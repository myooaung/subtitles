1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,630
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,260
We left off with our really quick website that we built using Bootstrap.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:14,480
But I want to show you one thing that I've kept from you, and that is the layout feature in Bootstrap.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:21,350
And this was the primary reason that Bootstrap was so popular because layout was so difficult and we

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,630
didn't have Flexbox back in the day.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:30,920
Bootstrap allowed us to create very responsive websites using these ideas of columns.

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,820
To show you what I mean.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,310
We're going to create our own column system.

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:43,020
We're going to go back to our website and I'm going to delete everything that we created so far.

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,730
In a save and refresh.

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,990
Everything's empty.

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,440
So in bootstrap, you can do something like this.

13
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,350
You always want to wrap everything in a container.

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,690
And again, if you go to the documentation.

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,520
They'll show you what to do, and we'll just grab the top once.

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,500
So let's just copy these.

17
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,960
Fix the indentation a bit.

18
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,310
There you go.

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,290
And if I refresh?

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,260
Well, we need to have a bit of a background so we can see them.

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,940
So I'm going to say column.

22
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,990
We'll do a background.

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,940
Color gray and the border will be two pixels.

24
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,530
Solid black.

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,820
Save.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,800
And go back and refresh.

27
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,080
We have our borders.

28
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,720
Now, here's something interesting that you can do.

29
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:41,830
You can do a column, small six and then column small three.

30
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,540
Don't worry, I'll explain what that means.

31
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,850
I'm going to refresh and look at that.

32
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,470
The size of this.

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,680
Just got smaller.

34
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:58,300
And that is because Bootstrap has the idea of a grid system, and this grid system has 12 lines.

35
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,860
So six plus three is nine.

36
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:10,250
So it's saying that I want this column to have six spaces out of that 12 and this column to have three

37
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,080
spaces out of that 12.

38
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,380
So if we add another column.

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,550
And six plus three plus three is 12.

40
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,830
I'm going to say extra here.

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,980
I refresh.

42
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,800
You'll see that it fills in this gap.

43
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,770
What if I put in four here?

44
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,080
So that is 13, which is over 12?

45
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,720
Well, if I refresh, this goes down to the next level.

46
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,210
So you see how easy it is to control things in bootstrap.

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,080
I can also do something like column.

48
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,730
Extra small will do.

49
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,400
12 and then column.

50
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,880
Extra small six column.

51
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,040
Extra small six.

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,480
And actually we'll do.

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,820
Medium here.

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,370
Save.

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,140
Let's refresh and see what happens.

56
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,370
Whoa.

57
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:16,940
What this is saying, that if the size of the window is medium, then I want the whole 12 grid system

58
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:24,780
to the first diff and then six of the 12 to the second and then the extra one six.

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,260
So you can see here that that's medium.

60
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:35,240
But because we have these small properties in here, if I make it smaller, you can see that it resorts

61
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,820
down to the 634 grid.

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:45,050
Let's change this back to three so it looks better and show you that there's a few other sizes that

63
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,800
we can add.

64
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:55,610
You can see over here that we have grid options and we have small, medium, large and extra large.

65
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,010
So let's do large and see what happens.

66
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:06,270
So for large, I want to have everything on their own so we can do this.

67
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,800
And safe.

68
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,130
Let's refresh and see if we can guess what's about to happen.

69
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,230
I'm going to go from.

70
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,190
Medium to large.

71
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,149
Do you see that?

72
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,490
12, 12, 12.

73
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,260
So I want each diff to occupy 12 spaces, 12 grid systems, which is the full thing.

74
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,540
If I go to medium, I now occupy with the first 112.

75
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,620
The second one, six and six.

76
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,270
So they should be one after another.

77
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,210
And if I go down to even smaller.

78
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,560
The small will have six, three and three.

79
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,240
So this is how you can create really responsive websites.

80
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,230
And that was the biggest selling feature of bootstrap.

81
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,510
It was solving this really, really hard problem of making sure that our website looked good no matter

82
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,710
what the screen size.

83
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,980
So I want you to play around with the grid options here.

84
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,900
This is the hardest concept to grasp and bootstrap.

85
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,970
Once you've learned this, it's very, very easy to create websites extremely fast.

86
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,540
I'll see in the next one.

87
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,040
Bye bye.
