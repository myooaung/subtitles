1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,670
Hello, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,939
Next, what we're going to learn about these options up here in the middle.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:10,410
When you select like a frame or say like a rectangle or a shape like that.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,840
Let's jump right in.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,810
So I'm going to select our and now have the rectangle selected.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,300
As you can see, I'm going to draw a nice square right in the middle of my little frame over here.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,320
Let's zoom in and you have three options.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,730
Let's go through them individually.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,220
So the first option is edit object.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,759
So I've selected edit object and I have a couple of options up here.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:40,020
I have the MOVE tool, I have drawing tools like the pen tool that we saw before and the pencil tool.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,950
I also have the Bend tool which will allow me to make some really nice curves and I have the paint bucket

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,460
tool.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,290
So I really want to focus on a couple of these tools because you won't be using them all pretty often.

15
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:59,970
But if we use the MOVE tool, we can select like a point on this square.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,129
And we can move it any which way we want.

17
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,140
So in this case, if we move it in, I'm going to make a little bit of a diamond.

18
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,040
So I'm going to select both points and bring them in little by little.

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,530
And now I have a diamond.

20
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:25,640
Now, if I wanted to use, say something like the bed tool, I can take that.

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,760
And start twisting it any which way I want.

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,310
I can even make this into a little bit of an oval.

23
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,750
Now these are really great for making your own custom icons, and we're actually going to get into this

24
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,860
in a later section of the course where we create our very own icons.

25
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,770
But just so you can get used to some of these tools, we have it here.

26
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,420
So I'm going to do that for this side to.

27
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,840
Not a really nice oval we have going here, but.

28
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,940
It's going to work.

29
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,950
And we can even select these different points and bring them in.

30
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,430
Kind of looks like an egg about to topple over.

31
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:11,000
But you don't need to actually click into here to to get those options.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,780
You can just double click on your shape and those options will appear.

33
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,660
So that's to edit your object.

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,180
The next part and what I spoke about in the last video was a component.

35
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,130
Now, this is one of the most powerful things about Figma and something that you will definitely use

36
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,240
if you're on a team.

37
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,210
I even use them when I'm doing solo work.

38
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:39,200
Now the difference between using components within a team and by yourself, it depends really on the

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
plan that you're using within Figma.

40
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:48,290
Now, if you're using a free plan, you will only be able to use components within the file.

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,310
You can't have a component be reused outside of the file.

42
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,870
On a professional plan or an organizational plan, you can use components across teams, across files

43
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,400
and across projects.

44
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,220
And we're going to get into how to do that later.

45
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,790
But this component.

46
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,970
Little option here just creates a component.

47
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,700
Now you'll notice that over here.

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,930
Now this is really great for interface design.

49
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:26,790
If you're creating new things that you need to reuse like buttons or logos, text, there's different

50
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,280
things that you can do and you can recreate.

51
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:38,970
Now, if you see my component right here, there is four little dots, and those four little dots basically

52
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,600
signify that this is a master component.

53
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:49,200
So you don't want to touch this one, but if you do want to reuse it, what I would do is I would copy

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,320
it.

55
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,750
So I'm going to command C and command V.

56
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,420
Now I have another component, but this is an instance.

57
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,630
And what that means is this is another variation of this component.

58
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,220
So you can have a file with your main component.

59
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:16,870
Or a page with your main component, and you can have the instance be reused throughout the rest of

60
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,630
the file.

61
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:24,430
In the case of using it within a free plan, like we'll be using it for this project that we're going

62
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,180
to be building.

63
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,800
So let's take a look at that.

64
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,660
So in the assets panel, I'll see I have local components.

65
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,160
And I'll show me which frame it is in.

66
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,010
So if I want.

67
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,750
This is the frame.

68
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,440
So if I rename this, I can call this components.

69
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:48,230
And if I go back into my assets section, I'll see that those were my components live.

70
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,930
So I have my rectangle one and it's selected.

71
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,470
That's my master component.

72
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,200
But I don't have this component there because that is just a copy of this.

73
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,570
So let's go to a different page.

74
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,100
Let's see how we can use this.

75
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,220
So I'm going to do here is I'm going to go into this frame and I'm going to go into my assets and I

76
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,630
can just drag it over.

77
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,230
And there we go.

78
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,460
We have an instance.

79
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,100
If we go back to my layers, we can see this little diamond shows that I have an instance of it and

80
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,210
I can delete it if I want, and that component will always be there.

81
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:29,390
Now, if I go back and I go back to that original component, if I delete that.

82
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,080
I have no more components.

83
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,630
Let's go back and fix that.

84
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,430
So there's my component, and that's how you create components within Figma.

85
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,120
It's really easy, really easy to use across different parts of your app.

86
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,530
It's what we're going to be doing.

87
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,780
Even in like the user flow section, we're going to be doing it when we're creating our very own components

88
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,370
for our design system.

89
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,020
It's going to speed up your workflow.

90
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,970
Can you imagine if you have to keep on designing the same button over and over again when you can just

91
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,100
easily go over to the assets panel and just copy and paste it from there, at least they'll all be the

92
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,070
same and they'll all be very consistent and your designs will be much more consistent afterwards.

93
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,310
It's a great practice to have a component library for whatever file you're working on, especially when

94
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,750
you're in the final stages.

95
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,780
So we're going to delete this component.

96
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,310
Next, I'm going to create a new rectangle.

97
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,600
So I collect ah and click shift and I create a square over here.

98
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,590
I'm going to zoom in, so I'm just sliding in.

99
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,800
The next option.

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,840
Our masks.

101
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,300
Now to create a mask.

102
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,320
I'm going to copy this.

103
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,450
So in case of Apple, I can do option shift.

104
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,060
Enjoy your egg and that will drag a new square.

105
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,770
Or you can just do a command C and command via copy and paste.

106
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,620
It doesn't matter.

107
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,550
But we're going to make one of these a mask.

108
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,660
So let's select a different color.

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,410
So in order to my fill, I'm going to select red, bright, bright red.

110
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:18,130
Now, if I select both of these and I click.

111
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,410
The mask option right here.

112
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,810
You'll notice that.

113
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,090
One of these.

114
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,990
Is hidden while the other one is showing.

115
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,910
Now if I move over.

116
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,630
You'll notice that the rectangle on the left was actually acting as kind of like a window or like a

117
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,710
frame into viewing this rectangle.

118
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:52,160
This is great for imagery or if you want to like hide different shapes.

119
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,060
So this is a great way to kind of do that.

120
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,890
And if I delete this.

121
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,090
It shows again.

122
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,240
So let's do that one more time this time.

123
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,800
Let's overlay them.

124
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,870
Uses mask and rectangle two is now the mask.

125
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,950
And now if I move Rectangle three.

126
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,970
You'll see that it is being hidden by rectangles too.

127
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,380
So really cool way to create masks.

128
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,070
But another great thing.

129
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,679
So I'm going to click Rectangle again and make another square.

130
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,659
You can create.

131
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,789
You can use Boolean.

132
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,970
Options here.

133
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,919
So these Boolean options are operations are right here.

134
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,910
And usually this is when you have two or more shapes.

135
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,010
Available.

136
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,940
If I select all of them, I'm just going to drag my cursor over them.

137
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:00,090
If I select all these, I have union selection, I have subtract, selection, intersect, exclude,

138
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,920
and I can even flatten these.

139
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,970
So if I do union, you'll see that they're all together now.

140
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,840
They're one shape.

141
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,470
If I double click in here, I can pull them out if I want.

142
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,540
But they're still a union.

143
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,020
Now, if I go back.

144
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,220
Bring that back in.

145
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,610
Go back.

146
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,730
Command Z and command Z.

147
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,500
Now I have all these shapes again.

148
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,990
You can use subtract.

149
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,910
You can do intersect.

150
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,660
You can do exclude all these different options.

151
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:41,480
And at the end, if you want to finalize your design, you'll see, like I said before, like you can

152
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,260
access these layers underneath and you can fiddle with them if you want.

153
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,860
But if you want to access your design.

154
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,770
I'm going to just fix this.

155
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,490
OC Cool, this looks pretty cool.

156
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,550
I'm going to actually select it, go to my Boolean operations and click Flatten Selection, and now

157
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:07,300
I can no longer select that, but now I can edit it like it's its own shape so I can start clicking

158
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,890
the move tool, the Bend tool if I wanted to, and go in a little bit deeper.

159
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,760
Mind you, weird stuff like this.

160
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:21,760
This becomes really handy when you're actually using these different types of tools to create stuff

161
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,780
like icons.

162
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,410
And that's it for the top bar.
