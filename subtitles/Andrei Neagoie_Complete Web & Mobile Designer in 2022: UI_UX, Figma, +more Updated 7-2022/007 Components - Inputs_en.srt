00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,750
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,980
So we're talking about components again and we're talking about inputs.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:10,030
Now, we covered this a bit when we're talking about just forms in general, when I'm thinking about

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:15,330
creating just like components around inputs, there's so many different factors.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:21,160
What I have here is I have my general input, which is like the base style here.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,600
Let's go into it.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:31,330
We have my right icon and within there I have my icon that I can swap out with anything.

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,490
I can hide this section if I need to.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:43,930
I have my content area over here and I have my text and icon little component section and my text is

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:44,830
over here.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,570
And just like that, like if I decide to hide this, my text will just automatically left a line.

12
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,550
So I'll show you what that looks like after once we create more instances of things, and this is how

13
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,770
I've set up my general input, very simple and everything else is connected to that.

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,130
I've also created a nice label.

15
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,820
Let's jump right into what the label looks like.

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,870
I have my left content.

17
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:13,060
In my right content, you'll notice these little icons, and that is just to indicate I have an auto

18
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:20,770
label set up and that helps me create just like responsive, not entirely responsive, but responsive

19
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:27,670
within this sense that if I were to delete something, the entire width wouldn't stay just like the

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,660
width of optional.

21
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,540
It would shrink down to the label width.

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,210
So I have my left content which is made up of my label copy and my optional indicator.

23
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:44,410
And then on my right I have like a little description and I have an icon if I need it.

24
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,700
And same thing is set up in an auto layout which will help me a lot.

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,640
So that is how I set up labels.

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:59,620
I have a word counter if we need that in the future, which is just a simple like text that I've used.

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,480
I've used my style here.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,310
If we wanted to, we could maybe bring that up into a top pixel style.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,230
But I've left it at ten and I have a field message.

30
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,880
So if there is an error, if there's a success, same thing.

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,420
I have my icon, which is always going to be accompanied by text and I've set it to a certain width

32
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,900
that I know on mobile that I'm designing for now.

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,850
There are going to be instances where you can't always do this.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,200
We are afforded that luxury because we are just working with mobile.

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,190
But remember, auto layout just isn't there yet and I would be using that a whole lot more for things

36
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:48,940
that I can like expand in terms of width and height and have the elements still stay within that auto

37
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,080
layout properly.

38
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,900
Right now, they just don't do that entirely.

39
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,370
They don't work that way.

40
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,270
But this is really great for what we need it for now.

41
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,940
Now let's get into our variations of our base.

42
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,250
So I've done a couple of different things here.

43
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,830
The first section, I've just done inputs.

44
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,910
You know, there will be times where you just need an input and no label.

45
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,280
Sometimes you may just need to input with a placeholder.

46
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,070
You know, you see them on sign up screens and I think that's totally fine.

47
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,210
You know, I think that's a one instance where you can just use a placeholder because it's just so standard.

48
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,350
You have your email and your password or something very simple like that.

49
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,250
So I've done things like placeholder on selected.

50
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,970
I have it with a placeholder disabled with an error.

51
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,170
Same thing over here.

52
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,240
I've just empty states.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,640
I have empty and selected empty, disabled and unselected with an error.

54
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,560
Empty error selected, as you can tell, with inputs and forms in general.

55
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,390
They are so complex.

56
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,930
I mean, just look at all the different variations that we have to design for.

57
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:58,420
That's not to say that we are going to use these all these variations to show every single use case

58
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,270
within a form when we're designing and presenting.

59
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,080
But this is like what I'm saying around design systems are for everyone.

60
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,580
We need to show developers what we're thinking in terms of the different use cases and what those use

61
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,960
cases look like.

62
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,910
So we have a filled version and a field selected.

63
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:22,150
We have a field disabled error, unselected filled, error selected, and in this case you can only

64
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,460
see a success message when it is filled and filled in selected.

65
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,260
You'll notice when it's full and sorted we get a little bit of a thicker outline, we get our carrot

66
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:38,860
that's blinking in there and now we'll see actual form fields.

67
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,080
So with labels included, we have our label and what I've done here, you'll notice that it's just the

68
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,650
label.

69
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,560
Everything else is hidden just by default.

70
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,240
I found that that was just better.

71
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,070
And in the future, in most cases, this is how our label will be displayed.

72
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,890
But if we have like I'll show you an example in a second, but basically.

73
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,360
It's a duplicate of this, but with a label included with message text at the bottom included.

74
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,660
If we need a successor error messages, you'll even see I swapped out the icons for something that is

75
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,080
much more fitting for an error or a success message.

76
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,470
So let's get into how we can use just one of these assets, these components.

77
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:28,230
So I'm just going to actually show you how I would use it from the asset section if I were using it

78
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,500
within a project I'm going to go into here.

79
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,780
I can even search for it if I want to.

80
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:40,170
I can just search input and I can see all my types of inputs that I've created, which is a lot.

81
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:50,340
I can also just go into the input section, say I'm trying to create a form field and I am going to

82
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:59,160
see all these different instances and maybe this is a lot and you know, you don't want to see all of

83
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,740
these and you want to break it up further and break it out into different frames.

84
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,730
You can do that too.

85
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,370
I may actually do that at one point.

86
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:14,340
So if I bring my form field, this is my field unselected, I'll see that my form field failed unselected

87
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,980
and I don't need to do anything here.

88
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,560
What I'm going to do is I'm not even going to rename it or anything.

89
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,020
I'm not even going to create a new component like when you are using it within your designs, when we're

90
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,540
using them, we don't have to recreate components.

91
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,130
Every time you use them or you change them, they're there for you to just kind of tweak.

92
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,640
If you need, you can use them as is.

93
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,220
So if I were to call this one.

94
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,410
Birth date.

95
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:49,810
So I have my birth date and here I can start turning things off that I don't need.

96
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,990
So I'm just going to do that.

97
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,870
I'm just going to do that.

98
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,830
And there you go.

99
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,510
What I can also do is I can turn on my right content.

100
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,660
I can take that icon off.

101
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,530
And

102
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:18,030
and I can change that variation to like text gray like that.

103
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,870
I can even make this one a little bit lighter.

104
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,330
I think this one's already set to text great 80.

105
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,730
So there you go.

106
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,270
You can just continue to create like a form like that if you need to.

107
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,540
You'll also notice, like the same thing applies.

108
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:41,220
If I were to go here and tighten up that radius a bit, maybe make it only five pixels, that's going

109
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,270
to just be changed everywhere else.

110
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,660
It's reflected in all my designs, even my instances of the components that house that original input.

111
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,440
So if we look over here, I have that base input right there and it's going to be reflected there.

112
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:05,430
So that is how I would use them if I like, say I had credit card information like a CVB.

113
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:16,000
We have a way to toggle an icon and in that icon we can go in here and let's change that instance.

114
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,860
We could have different types of icons.

115
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,920
I think this one actually suits what you would use for your CVB.

116
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:31,580
So say if that was like my code and we can, like, shrink down that text, what you could do is you

117
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:37,940
have to make sure that your field unselected is able to actually shrink properly.

118
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:46,190
So that is how you would create different types of inputs very easily with all the different variation

119
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,820
you need.

120
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,510
That includes things like different types of icons.

121
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:56,330
So if I wanted to go ahead and create like a search bar right here.

122
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,800
I have my search and I can use it any which way I want.

123
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,280
So that's an empty search, and that is how I would use it.

124
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,090
So you use all these different assets in a way that is going to help you.

125
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,130
But remember, to create these different variations for your development team, for your whole team

126
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,210
to understand all those different use cases.

127
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,780
Why would we see an error?

128
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,740
Why would we see like a selected state?

129
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,330
Why is there a disabled state?

130
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,070
You need to ask those questions.

131
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,730
Remember to go through your user flows and think about all those different cases.

132
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,210
And that is how we create components for inputs.
