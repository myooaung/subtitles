00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.540
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.350
So last time we talked about just micro interactions around like hovering, clicking, and sometimes

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.710
I like to actually make just animations for great feedback.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.010
And one example of that is you saw my little kind of animation of my bouncing ball, this little notification

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.690
bubble that was bouncing on a heart.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.520
And I thought that was really cool.

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.560
And I think we should probably recreate that for our own project, maybe like a little bouncing ball

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.320
for our cart or something like that.

9
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.750
Now there are different ways to create that.

10
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.280
You can go really simple.

11
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.190
What I did for something like this was much more in depth.

12
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.910
If we think about motion in general and animation in general, it must follow the laws of gravity.

13
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.200
So what that means is if we think about how a ball bounces up and down, let me just create a circle

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.040
because I don't really want to mess with that frame over here because this is where our animation is

15
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.910
actually.

16
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.650
So I'll show you how that works.

17
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.710
But the one way we can think about like just gravity in general, when we think about a ball, when

18
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.210
a ball hits a ground, what happens to it?

19
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.020
It doesn't just look like this when it hits the ground, it kind of squishes just a bit.

20
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.590
You don't see it and may not switch that much.

21
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.200
It may just like shrink just a little bit like that, but still does.

22
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.520
And when a ball propels itself upward.

23
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.870
It stretches depending on how fast it's going.

24
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.870
So if we're thinking about something like a really squishy ball, that's how it would look due to gravity

25
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.500
and velocity and all different factors due to physics.

26
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.710
So what will happen is if it bounces up and then reaches just like the max height it can go, it will

27
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.520
start to just recede and return to normal.

28
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.780
And then after pause in the top and then start dropping down and then hit the ground like that, and

29
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.440
then same thing.

30
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.000
And over time it will gradually stop bouncing, hopefully.

31
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.090
Now we need to apply that to our animation, so let's just delete that.

32
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.220
Now, there are different ways we can go about doing that.

33
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.490
We can make something really simple, just something like moving up and down.

34
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.190
And that's I'm going to show you how to create something really simple like that, and I'll show you

35
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.070
an example of what I created that followed all the laws of physics and just gravity in general.

36
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.350
So let me jump right in.

37
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.620
I have a little frame here called notification, and within that frame I have a little layer, not original

38
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.980
naming, but I have a little layer that is going to act as our notification bubble.

39
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.350
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to select a plug in, a very special plug in that is and it

40
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.210
is called Fake Motion.

41
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.140
And here it is.

42
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.310
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my plug ins.

43
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.090
Go to fig mocean and open fig mocean and it's going to open up like an overlayed window.

44
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.060
There it is.

45
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.020
And you'll see our layers within that frame.

46
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.100
There's only one layer.

47
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.370
Now, let me just give you a little walk around and what fig motion is.

48
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.560
There's a timeline.

49
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.940
If you've ever used something like After Effects or Premiere Pro or anything like that.

50
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.970
Screen flow, they all have timelines.

51
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.690
Now you can animate all these different properties like the x y coordinates with hey, all that kind

52
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.080
of stuff, and you can animate it based off of keyframes.

53
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.310
So these are in 100 millisecond increments and.

54
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.200
That is basically it.

55
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.320
What you want to do is you want to set like a keyframe and then go ahead and you can set another keyframe.

56
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.980
And when you click into something like that, you can adjust it.

57
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.440
So this will move on the x axis and this will move on the Y axis.

58
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.580
Now, when you're done, you can actually just play and it will.

59
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.540
It will show you what's happening over there.

60
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.870
So what we're going to do is I'm just going to give you an example.

61
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.600
Mm hmm.

62
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.370
So if I were to just look at this, I'm going to remove these.

63
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.850
And I'm going to select that the why I want to move it up and down.

64
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.320
And if we play.

65
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.260
We'll see that it moves down.

66
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.420
That's a terrible animation, but you can see that we can start creating much more complex animations

67
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.550
from something like this.

68
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.980
So let's jump right in.

69
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.740
I'll show you a couple of little tricks that you can do along the way and what happens after you're

70
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.120
done exporting it.

71
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.400
I'm going to create something really, really simple.

72
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.220
I'm going to bring that down.

73
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.650
I'm going to update my layers because any changes over here will not be updated here unless you update

74
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.690
them manually.

75
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.960
So I'm just going to start at zero and I'm just going to.

76
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.980
It doesn't really matter.

77
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.070
You can select just different points in time.

78
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.290
So I'm just going to let 200 milliseconds and I'm going to select another keyframe.

79
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.840
And what I can do here is I can.

80
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.790
Go into this and I'm going to type.

81
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.370
How about just 20?

82
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.490
And you can see what type of animation.

83
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.290
So I don't like doing linear.

84
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.630
You can do custom if we wanted to.

85
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.580
And it'll give us like a little graph.

86
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.340
We can play with that if we wanted to.

87
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.280
But if you didn't feel like actually working with a custom, just the easing, you can just select ease

88
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.650
in, ease out, ease in and out.

89
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.370
So for this animation, I am moving upwards.

90
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.490
Let's check what E's out looks like.

91
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.840
So we're going to play.

92
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.570
So that was really quick.

93
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.850
So let's just see what the animation looks like.

94
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.000
So you can see it's pretty abrupt and it slows down.

95
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.300
Now, if we use something like these in.

96
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.360
So.

97
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.820
It was very.

98
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:11.850
Very slow to move and then it's gradually cut just faster as it moved in and out.

99
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.980
So we can just do ease in and out because if we're thinking about gravity at the most basic sense.

100
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.700
You can do that.

101
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.450
So I'm going to just do I'm going to go to 1/2.

102
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.230
So it's going to take 1/2 to get from top to bottom.

103
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.010
But I'm going to make sure this is much larger in space.

104
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.550
So.

105
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.490
Let's even go even further.

106
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.990
Um hmm.

107
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.450
Let's do ten.

108
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.920
So that looks good.

109
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.440
So if we play that.

110
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.770
Do you see how it eased in and out?

111
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.830
So it was kind of like it was slowly moving upward.

112
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.720
Then when it got to the top, it was slower.

113
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.910
Now, when we come back down.

114
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.450
Scroll all the way to the side.

115
00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.850
So I'm going to go all the way to 2 seconds.

116
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.360
Actually, at the top, I may just wait.

117
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.940
So I may wait for like.

118
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.770
Just a bit.

119
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.680
And when I get up here, I'm going to select.

120
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.690
We're just going to stay.

121
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.650
We just stay.

122
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.640
Ease in and out.

123
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:16.960
We're not going to move.

124
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:25.940
And then we are going to go to 2.2 seconds, which is over here and we're going to go all the way back

125
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.120
down.

126
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:34.130
So what I need to do is I need to select my y coordinates and I'm going to see the original.

127
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.570
I'm just going to select that.

128
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.040
And I'm going to paste that within here.

129
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.940
And when I think about actually like something dropping, it's going to ease out.

130
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:54.550
Actually, it's going to ease into it and then it's going to drop really quick.

131
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.850
So let's see how that looks so up.

132
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.650
Down.

133
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.850
Sometimes you just have to fiddle with these to get the right just the right animation.

134
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:05.870
See, I didn't like that one.

135
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.520
You saw how it slowed down at the end.

136
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.250
That makes no sense in terms of gravity.

137
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:15.650
So I'm thinking like, you know, when you hold, you get up to the top, hold and down.

138
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.400
So we can now start to fine tune this a bit.

139
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.880
Maybe that hold is only.

140
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.120
Just there.

141
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.530
Maybe we start bringing it in a bit more.

142
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.940
So we got at seven seven.

143
00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:41.919
700 milliseconds and we can do like a half millisecond hold.

144
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:48.580
And then, hmm, we will go to 13.

145
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.370
The drop should be maybe a little more quicker.

146
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.090
So I'm going to go grab that keyframe and drag it all back.

147
00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:01.240
The only problem is this doesn't have a way to zoom in and out and grab keyframes, like just dragging

148
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.890
and just drag to select, which kind of isn't the best.

149
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.890
But this is great, just working within Figma.

150
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:09.820
So there we go.

151
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.800
We have like a little a little animation going now.

152
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.210
We can even go a little bit further if we think about so this is more linear.

153
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.000
Now I'm just going to exit out of fig motion.

154
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.520
So we have a little animation here.

155
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.410
Now, let's take a look at this one.

156
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:31.970
Where whereas fake motion.

157
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.200
Although right there.

158
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.590
Now we're at zero.

159
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.960
You can see all the different types of key frames I have in here just to get it right.

160
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.390
And as you can tell, I've created like a little bounce.

161
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:50.720
So it's going to squish and propel itself forward or upward.

162
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.780
Stop.

163
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.130
Return back to normal size and propel itself downward.

164
00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:01.590
And it's going to shrink in width and look much more elongated.

165
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.900
And it's going to hit the ground again.

166
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.570
It's going to shrink and it's going to do the same thing.

167
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.290
But this time, if you notice when it reached that top height.

168
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.080
And then came down for the second bounce.

169
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.220
We've lost a little bit of speed.

170
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:20.050
We've lost a little bit of force, and we're not going to jump as high this time.

171
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:21.340
We're not going to bounce as high.

172
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.320
We're going to bounce just a little bit and then just a smidge.

173
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.390
Let's see what the ending of this looks like.

174
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.120
So just a smidge.

175
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.600
And then we're just going to hold.

176
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:39.990
So that way when we do create this loop bubble gif, it's going to hold for like a couple of seconds

177
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.910
afterward before it bounces again.

178
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:47.940
So it's not like crazy bouncing in the corner of your screen and people are going to be really annoyed

179
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.150
with it.

180
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.050
So let's take a look.

181
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.680
There goes.

182
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.740
And it's going to hold.

183
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.170
Then it will bounce again.

184
00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:58.980
Boom!

185
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.640
So that's a quick little way to do it.

186
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:08.780
I'm going to actually show you how to break this down just a little bit more and with this one in our

187
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.650
next video.
