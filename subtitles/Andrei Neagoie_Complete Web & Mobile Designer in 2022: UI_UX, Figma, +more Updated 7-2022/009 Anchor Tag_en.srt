1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,420
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:09,320
In the previous videos, we talked about some of the most common HTML tags and how the HTML document

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,030
is read by the browser.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:20,450
However, we've missed one critical feature of HTML, and if we go back to our diagram here that we

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:29,960
should remember from the first section, the HTML file gets sent to us, but the power of HTML is and

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,560
its ability to link to other documents.

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:40,970
So if I go back here to our website, it's a simple one page website, but I can't really click on Fuji

8
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,500
or Apple or Banana.

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,750
It doesn't link to anything.

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,290
There must be an HTML tag that we can use for that, right?

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,540
Well, yes, there is.

12
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,910
It's called a anchor tag.

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:01:01,070
So an anchor tag is very easy, just an A, and this anchor tag has something called an H ref, which

14
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,870
is an attribute and it's the hypertext reference.

15
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:11,150
So in this H ref you'll be able to link to something.

16
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,320
So let's close this.

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,320
A tag has an opening and a closing tag.

18
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:23,690
And if I save this and refresh the page, well, nothing happens because you need something in the anchor

19
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,140
tag.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,320
So let's do new page.

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,220
I save that I refresh and we have new page here.

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,090
Now if I click this, nothing happens.

23
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,460
You can see that it's it has the link and the mouse changes images.

24
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,130
So it's clickable, but nothing happens.

25
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,470
Well, that's because we need to specify where we want the link to go.

26
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,700
Now let's think about this.

27
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,680
If we want to link to a new page, we don't really have another new page.

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,280
If you remember, we only have indexed HTML.

29
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,200
Would it be great if there was another file that we can link to?

30
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,540
Well, let's create another file.

31
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,860
Let's open up sublime text.

32
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,330
Actually, I'm going to say file, new file.

33
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:19,180
I'm going to save this as a new page and we're going to save it to desktop and see over here how when

34
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,110
I went to Sublime text, it's now a plain text.

35
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,390
I need to make sure that this is an HTML file so I can just do html.

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,830
Safe and sublime text automatically adjusts to the HTML.

37
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:43,160
So again, I can type in that short command a HTML and tab that comes with sublime text and lets do

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,470
the title, new page and the body.

39
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,980
We can just do a header that says this is the new page.

40
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,300
If I save this, great.

41
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,680
We have a new page.

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,920
And if I go to my desktop here, you see that I have new page and index dot HTML.

43
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,870
So how do we link these two together?

44
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,030
Well, it's very simple.

45
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:17,810
We open up sublime again and within indexed HTML the ref can now say we're linking to new page that

46
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,380
HTML.

47
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,960
Let's save that and let's give it a try.

48
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,250
Refresh the page.

49
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,510
Click.

50
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,820
And this is a new page.

51
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:28,970
Awesome.

52
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,540
But to go back, we have to press the back symbol.

53
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,380
So let's link back to the original file again.

54
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,450
We can do this by.

55
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,370
P tag, which is four paragraph, I'm going to say go back, close that tag.

56
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,960
But hold on a minute.

57
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,760
I need an anchor tag.

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,560
Right, if I just save this.

59
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,350
And refresh the page, I say go back.

60
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:02,060
But what if you really, really want this to be a paragraph or let's say you want this to be an H two,

61
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,060
but you also want it to be an anchor tag.

62
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,770
Well, that's very simple.

63
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:14,150
You just wrap it in an anchor tag and just so it's nice and clear, we're going to have the nice spacing

64
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,630
here.

65
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:21,290
And again, an anchor tag must have an H ref which tells us where to go and we want to go to index.html.

66
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,040
So index html save.

67
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,530
And refresh.

68
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,910
Let's go back.

69
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,300
Let's go to the next one and back.

70
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,330
So this is the power that comes with HTML, this ability to link to other pages.

71
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,960
And yet we can have text, we can have lists, we can have images.

72
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
But the true power is in this linking ability.

73
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,430
And the next episode, we're going to expand on this.

74
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,020
I'll see you in that one.

75
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,620
Bye bye.
