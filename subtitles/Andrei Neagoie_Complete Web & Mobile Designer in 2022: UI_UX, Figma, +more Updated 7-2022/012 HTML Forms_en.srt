1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,060
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:09,210
We're going to get into some more advanced tags and probably the most important tag that you'll use

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,550
other than the ones that we've covered so far are tags that we need to create forms.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:21,900
As you know, when you go to websites, usually there's some sort of a log in or registration form.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,000
So we're going to build that out today.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,230
To get started, let's just create a new file here.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,810
We'll save it and call it registered HTML on our desktop.

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:43,430
Perfect and we know that we want an HTML, so we use our little shortcut and we'll title it register,

9
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,450
save that.

10
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,250
And now in the indexed HTML file, let's add another link.

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,990
That references.

12
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,310
Register.

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,270
HTML.

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,420
And I'll just say, here, register.

15
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,500
All right.

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,480
We'll save both of these files and let's refresh.

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,160
We have register.

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,900
Click register.

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,760
Well, we have nothing yet, but it looks like it's working.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,780
Let's add this on a new line just because it looks prettier that way.

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,010
So to do that, if you remember, we're going to add a break tag.

22
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,460
So let's refresh.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,190
There you go.

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,110
We have new page and register.

25
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,770
So let's build out this form.

26
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,470
If you go into register dot html.

27
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,980
The way we write forms in HTML while conveniently there's a form tag.

28
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,120
Okay.

29
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,870
But this form tag itself, it needs to have the actual form inside of it.

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,900
So what kind of form elements do we have?

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:55,660
Well, again, if we remember our good old friend W3C, let's type in forms.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,340
And we can see over here that we have HTML forms.

33
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,410
And refresh.

34
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,850
We'll make that full screen.

35
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:11,990
And you can see over here that there is a ton of information on it, but you can look that up yourself

36
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,770
for now.

37
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:18,730
I'm going to introduce you to the most common ones, probably the ones that you'll use 90% of the time.

38
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,990
The first one, as we do with any form and let's go to that page for now is what we want to enter our

39
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,380
name.

40
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,250
So how do we do that?

41
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,950
We have a input tag.

42
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:37,520
That has a type of text because, well, our name will be in text form.

43
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,940
And we can close that off.

44
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,590
And it's actually a self-closing tag.

45
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:49,700
So now if I save and refresh, we have a little box here.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,290
Hopefully you can see that.

47
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,370
But well, we should probably title it because we won't know what to enter that way.

48
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,080
So we're going to put in here, we're going to say first name.

49
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,100
Semicolon and save.

50
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,940
Let's refresh.

51
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,170
We have first name and now let's make this a little bit bigger.

52
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,190
There you go.

53
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,460
Now you can enter your name in here.

54
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,200
Let's add another one for last name.

55
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,240
And again, we'll have our input type.

56
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,970
So that's an attribute and a value of text.

57
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,880
And if we refresh, we have last name.

58
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,550
Okay, but it kind of looks ugly.

59
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,950
Remember that HTML just reads line by line and doesn't really know that we want a space here.

60
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,290
So again, we can add a.

61
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,460
Brake tag here and refresh.

62
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,830
And we have first name and last name.

63
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,940
Okay, that's that's fairly self-explanatory.

64
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,100
Now, what else do we have?

65
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,770
In a form, we have email.

66
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:08,070
So let's add another field, which is email and we'll do input again.

67
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,320
Type calls, text.

68
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,380
We'll add another break here because we're going to need that spacing.

69
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,640
And let's save refresh.

70
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,360
Awesome.

71
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:20,649
Okay.

72
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,740
So we have our general registration form.

73
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:31,430
And obviously with any form, we need some sort of buttons, like we need to submit this somewhere so

74
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,370
we can register.

75
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,590
Well, again, there's a nice input type for that.

76
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,010
So we do input instead of a text type.

77
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,590
There is a submit type.

78
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,810
So this.

79
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,820
If we add another break in here.

80
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,820
And I save this, I refresh it has a submit button.

81
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,180
Now.

82
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,350
Now, where did this summit come from?

83
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,240
Well, when you put an input type submit, it automatically creates a button.

84
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,290
And if you don't specify what to say, it'll just have this text.

85
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,280
But we can change that so we can put value.

86
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,600
And we'll put a register.

87
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,330
Say that refresh.

88
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,060
We now have a register button.

89
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,450
Och.

90
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,330
But what if we make mistakes in this field?

91
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,900
We write stuff and we want to reset this form again.

92
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,300
There's another input for that.

93
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,890
And the type of that input, as you can imagine, is reset.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,610
So now if we close this ad, another break in here, actually, we can keep that on the same line.

95
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,800
We'll save refresh.

96
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,640
And we have reset.

97
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,800
So now if I type in anything in here and let's say I don't like this, I need to reset the form.

98
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,130
I can just click reset and it clears everything for us.

99
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,490
Okay.

100
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,810
You may be asking yourself what happens when we click register.

101
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,540
Before we get into that, I want to just go through the common input types and then we'll click registers

102
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,540
to see what happens with the email.

103
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:20,810
We ideally want, first of all, for it to be required so that when you click register, if you haven't

104
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,140
provided an email, it won't let you register.

105
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,790
And there's an attribute that we can use for that and that is required.

106
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:37,950
And here we don't actually have to specify a value because automatically it's assumed that required

107
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,700
equals to true, which means that this form field is required.

108
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:50,820
So if I say that I refresh and I leave it blank and I click register, we'll say, please fill out this

109
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,330
field.

110
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,280
Now we also want to make sure that it's an appropriate email field.

111
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,640
So if I type something like this, we still want to make sure that this is an incorrect email.

112
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,840
We don't want to register.

113
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,720
So the input type of text that I told you for email is actually wrong.

114
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,390
There's a specific one that we can use, which is, as you can imagine, email.

115
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:20,950
So now if I refresh and type in something that's not an email and I click register.

116
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,100
I'll say please include Annette in the email address.

117
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,260
Very nice.

118
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,250
It's kind of like magic.

119
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,590
It does this for you, which is very, very nice.

120
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,920
Let's expand on our knowledge of inputs and add a few more fields that will most likely need.

121
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:44,540
We usually want to know somebody's birthday, so let's add birthday here.

122
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:50,030
And for this input type, let's do type.

123
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,170
Date.

124
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,750
So if I save this and I refresh, look at that.

125
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,210
We have a nice little date picker.

126
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,040
So I can pick anything in here.

127
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,870
All right.

128
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,850
What else do we need?

129
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,900
We also need gender.

130
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,480
So we'll do input, type.

131
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,300
And for gender.

132
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:17,010
Well, there's no specific input type for gender, but there is something called radio.

133
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,530
And radio is, as the name suggest, radio buttons.

134
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,560
So now.

135
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,640
I click refresh and well, I have one radio button, but we ideally want to have options, right?

136
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,870
So how do we do that?

137
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:40,240
So for the radio, we also need to say whether it's male or female, let's have within the gender.

138
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,150
We're going to have a break over here in the line and we'll say.

139
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,570
Input type radio and we'll say mail.

140
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,880
And we also want.

141
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,600
Female.

142
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,670
And we also want.

143
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,430
Other.

144
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,350
And when we refresh this, we have male, female and other.

145
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,010
But you see a problem here.

146
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,610
I just click the radio buttons and I can't deselect them.

147
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,450
And ideally you should only be able to select one.

148
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,430
And right now, the way the radio buttons are, they don't know of each other's existence.

149
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:27,730
We want to make sure that they know that they're connected to their family and only one of them can

150
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,360
be picked.

151
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,130
So how do we do that?

152
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,630
The way we do that is through the name attribute.

153
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,950
So for the name we'll say gender.

154
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:48,670
And this name attribute needs to match on all the radio buttons so that they know they are together

155
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,310
their part of the gender input field.

156
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,040
So if I save here and refresh.

157
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,480
Now you can see that I can only select one.

158
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,980
All right, perfect.

159
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,690
What else should we have?

160
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,130
Well, let's say I really want to know if you have pets.

161
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,380
So with pets.

162
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,050
We're going to have input type.

163
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,110
Well, you can have multiple pets, so won't be radio buttons.

164
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,090
We want checkbox.

165
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:32,920
So checkbox we want it to have cats or let's put cat and we want to have.

166
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,820
Can type today.

167
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,940
Check box, and we want to have dogs.

168
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,510
So let's save that.

169
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,400
Let's refresh and look at that.

170
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,880
We have pets, but this time it's checkboxes, which means.

171
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,510
I can select multiple.
