00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.470
Everyone.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.230
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.700
We're going to be talking about the presentation view and some collaboration tools built right into

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.090
Figma.

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.200
So let's jump right in.

6
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.850
So the presentation view, which I have open over here in this tab in which we've been testing a lot

7
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.020
of our stuff with.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.660
Over here, it allows you to see your prototype in action.

9
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.970
So you want to use this while you kind of build and test your prototype or when you're ready to even

10
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.560
share your prototype with others.

11
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:36.340
Now the easiest way to access your presentation view, if we go back to our original file, is to click

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.690
this little button up here.

13
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.180
If we just access that presentation, it'll open up a new tab with your presentation or your prototype.

14
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.950
In full view.

15
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.480
Now you can do a couple of things here.

16
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.040
You can click through if there are any hotspots.

17
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.510
So if we go back and we actually create one, let's do that really quickly.

18
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.620
So.

19
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.360
Just so very quick.

20
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.920
We'll just do this.

21
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.140
Instantly.

22
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.160
So.

23
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.960
Right there.

24
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.810
Okay, let's go back to our presentation so you can easily just interact with hot spots like that to

25
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.890
get across prototypes.

26
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.710
But if you don't want to do that, you can just use your arrow keys to go through your pages.

27
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.930
If there's no prototype, there will be all your pages that are designed and you can just tap through

28
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.040
them if you want to.

29
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.930
But if you do have a prototype, you'll see at the bottom that this is page one of two.

30
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.730
So only two images are two screens are within your prototype right now.

31
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.510
So let's go back.

32
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.360
Let's just fix that prototype over here.

33
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.500
We're going to make sure that this is fixed to the bottom.

34
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.610
Perfect.

35
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.960
And there we go.

36
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.330
Okay.

37
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.250
So.

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.290
We have prototype.

39
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.360
And there's a couple of things you can do while you're in this presentation view.

40
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.250
You can easily change the options.

41
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.590
That's probably the biggest thing right here is changing these options.

42
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:14.180
And essentially these view options will allow you to kind of change based off of like the size of your

43
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.690
prototype.

44
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.670
So if I click 100%.

45
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:27.050
I can easily see it, but it's going to scale my whole device beyond my screen or my viewport right

46
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.470
here.

47
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.080
So I often don't use that, but I do use is something like scale down to fit.

48
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.020
There's also scale down or up to fill.

49
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.690
So if your prototype is like smaller, you can select that option over here.

50
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.660
Phil to actually expand to fill the top or the width of the container.

51
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.830
I usually I'm working on mobile or if I'm working on a desktop, I may have a custom size, but in the

52
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.630
case of mobile I usually just use fit.

53
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.530
Another option that you can use is showing hotspot hints on click, so you can use that.

54
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.410
Usually when I'm testing with users, I don't.

55
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.410
So you'll notice that if I restart this.

56
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.830
I won't see the hot spot that was there before.

57
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.440
So let's go turn that on again.

58
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.330
Then you'll see the hotspot.

59
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.480
Another thing you can do is hide and show the toolbar and footer.

60
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.830
So easiest way to do that is just to click here.

61
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.950
But remember, the way to get it back is command plus back slash.

62
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.640
They show you the little shortcut right there.

63
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.340
So if I turn it off, it will give you a reminder of what it is and you can copy your share link, because

64
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.770
if you do copy your share link, it will update your share link and we'll get into the sharing feature

65
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.340
later.

66
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.710
But it's much more immersive.

67
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.850
So if I go back here and I actually go to my prototype.

68
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.670
And I go to my prototype settings, I go to my backgrounds.

69
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.110
I'm going to make that block.

70
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.550
And that is just much more immersive than it was before.

71
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.730
So I'm going to just bring back that toolbar.

72
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.110
And there it is.

73
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.250
So do you remember that when you do want to hide the toolbar, you're going to want to copy that link

74
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.420
if you want to send it out like that.

75
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.930
I think that's really good for actually testing with users.

76
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.660
It's so easy because it kind of removes the fluff around here, like all this kind of stuff.

77
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.520
If you don't want them commenting or if you don't want them clicking anything around here, totally

78
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.650
easy to just set it up for them, send them the link like this and it's much better.

79
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.240
And the other thing you can do is actually go to full screen.

80
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.290
So entry in full screen to make the prototype much more immersive.

81
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.890
So this is going to be a much more immersive experience if I go to full screen, hide the toolbar,

82
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.640
and all I see are my tabs, but the user wouldn't see that.

83
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.560
Och.

84
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:07.060
And I think the biggest thing within prototyping over here is just like the collaboration within Figma.

85
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:14.800
So when I like to share my prototypes, I'm going to make sure that like teammates or stakeholders that

86
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.470
I'm depending on are going to comment on that.

87
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.980
So the easiest way to do that is to hover your share prototype button over here and you can click,

88
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.380
then you can send it to people to view or if you're like in a Slack group with them or if you want to

89
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.780
just send it quickly to like a friend on Facebook or whatever messaging platform, all you need to do

90
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.860
is copy the link.

91
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.210
You can also embed the code if you need to.

92
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.920
That's just totally up to you.

93
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.020
Figma does support live embeds, but we can get into that at another time.

94
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.710
So you can add people to the project.

95
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.040
You can also just anyone with the link in view.

96
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.480
I think like this is probably what you're going to be using it for the most in terms of like sharing

97
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.060
it with others to kind of comment on your prototype, sharing it with users if you're like testing like

98
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.280
remotely, I often test remotely when I'm working from home, I'll test with a user just over like a

99
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.380
zoom call and I'll send them a link like this and they will easily be able to interact the prototype

100
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.610
while sharing their screen.

101
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.020
So this really kind of keeps our whole workflow in one place.

102
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:25.050
We can design a figma and we can easily share our prototype within Figma and get all of our feedback

103
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.130
within Figma.

104
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.800
So remember to update your link if you kind of hide the toolbar.

105
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.350
I know I mentioned that a couple of times, but it's really important.

106
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.960
Another thing that I love within Figma is actually just commenting.

107
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.140
I mean, it's so easy to get feedback.

108
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.770
You can comment directly on prototypes.

109
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.920
So all you need to do is click this button over here or you can just press see.

110
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.290
And you can kind of drag a comment anywhere.

111
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.840
I can just say I love this image.

112
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.400
It also supports emojis.

113
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.570
And you can post it.

114
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.520
And over here you can kind of copy the link to this comment and send it to somebody.

115
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.200
You can edit your column, you can delete it.

116
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.820
Any editor on the file can actually take your comment and resolve it.

117
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.980
So let me show you what that looks like.

118
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:27.270
So if I'm the editor and another thing to note is that if you do actually want to see comments, you're

119
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.890
going to have to actually click on them.

120
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:34.620
But as the editor, you can resolve the comment just like that.

121
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.000
All you need to do is.

122
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.050
Right click this little button.

123
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.210
It's a little checkmark in a circle.

124
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.570
Click it and you've resolved the comment.

125
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.470
Now let's go back to our main file and I'm going to click on the comment.

126
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.680
Over here.

127
00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.300
So.

128
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.980
If you click on this comment button, you'll be able to comment and you'll notice that the comments

129
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:07.650
that we left in the presentation View also show up on our actual like designs as well, which helps

130
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.510
us as designers because we don't necessarily need to be in the presentation view to actually view it.

131
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.270
So you can easily see them there.

132
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.670
You can see your resolved comments on the side here.

133
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.950
You can view based off of only yours.

134
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.050
You can bring those back.

135
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.020
You can actually unresolved the comment.

136
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.220
You can also reply to people.

137
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.240
So if I just press say, hey.

138
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.409
Daniel.

139
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.090
What's up?

140
00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.780
And that person will get a direct notification based off of the comment settings.

141
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.330
So these are the comments that he's over here.

142
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.670
Like I mentioned, you can show result.

143
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:57.190
You can also decide if you'd like to show the results comments in the prototype if you want.

144
00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:04.180
So if you go to our prototype over here, you can show your result comments in there.

145
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.070
And you can show only your comments in there as well.

146
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.080
So definitely a lot of options here for just general collaboration.

147
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:20.910
And honestly, when we're creating our own prototype, I really want and I really urge you to copy like

148
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.350
a link, get the link from here or share it with people that you want to get feedback from because it

149
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.450
just getting feedback quickly.

150
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:33.330
And this is why I love Figma so much is that like you can just get feedback quickly within your prototype

151
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.350
and make those changes right there.

152
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.460
You're not switching between different applications, you're not fumbling over creating a prototype.

153
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.840
You saw how easy it was.

154
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.480
And our next video, we're definitely going to create our own.

155
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:51.480
So remember that to create a good application or a good product, you need to start that feedback loop

156
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.130
as early as possible.

157
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.200
So we're going to link together our prototype and we'll get it to a place where you can send it off

158
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.490
and get feedback quickly.
