1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.410
All righty.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.830
So in this video, we're going to be talking about figma, what it is and how we are going to be using

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.160
it.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.600
And we're going to just set up the basics of our project.

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.150
So first, what is Figma?

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.840
So this is a tool for web designers that allows them to create mockups and prototypes of websites,

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.410
including all image and icon assets, as well as colors and layout positioning.

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.260
As someone with years of graphic design experience, specifically working with layout and design, I

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.180
can appreciate the connection between design and development that Figma allows for.

10
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.410
So I'm going to start by sharing a resource within the course.

11
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.740
I'm not going to go hugely in-depth on this, but feel free to read about it at your leisure.

12
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.120
The fundamental things that you need to know is that it works similar to Photoshop in that you have

13
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.530
layers and each of these layers can have their own styling.

14
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.570
In this case, it actually allows you as a designer to set the CSS values for how it should be positioned

15
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.590
on the page.

16
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.410
And that's something we're going to look at as well.

17
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:21.810
And the other main thing that is important is that it allows us to have shared styles so we can get

18
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.900
the color styles from Figma as well.

19
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.780
And also the important thing is exporting image assets.

20
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.190
So we'll get to this part later on in the next video.

21
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.120
All right.

22
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.140
Let's get started with our specific Figma project.

23
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.780
I will also provide this link.

24
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.680
To the project.

25
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.230
It is called Landing Page.

26
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.560
It looks like this.

27
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.010
And when you go to this link, you'll be greeted with this.

28
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.700
If you've never gone to Figma before, the first thing you're going to need to do is log in in order

29
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.180
to complete the handoff between the designer and the developer.

30
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.070
So first, we're going to log in.

31
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.660
I've already created my account.

32
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.000
You can log in with Google, and once you do that, we can actually close this one for now.

33
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.720
Once you do that, you can see that we have our landing page here.

34
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.430
And as I hover over it, you can see that we have different layers, different assets happening here.

35
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.810
I'm actually just going to zoom in to make this a little bit easier to see.

36
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.860
So I'm going 150% and then I want to make this fit within the page so I can actually use a keyboard

37
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.300
shortcut in figma.

38
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.250
So I'm just going to press shift and one and then you can see that it's zoomed to fit.

39
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.550
All right.

40
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.280
Awesome.

41
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.960
So once you've logged in, this is all the work that the designer has done.

42
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.700
And essentially all we're trying to do is recreate this in our code.

43
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.950
So the first thing you might notice on the left side here, we have a landing page when I click on it.

44
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.490
This is our landing page layer, which is everything.

45
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.040
You can see that we have some CSS over here, including a background linear gradient.

46
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.050
If I collapse this, we can actually see that it's made up of a bunch of different layers.

47
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.490
So you can see we have our main image, we have our branding, we have all of our other images here

48
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:17.000
at the bottom, and we have our app store badges here, and then we have our text here as well.

49
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.020
All right.

50
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.930
So that's generally how everything's going to be laid out.

51
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.160
As you click on them, you'll be able to export individual layers.

52
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.430
But again, we'll get to that in the next video.

53
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.330
So we're going to go back to clicking on the landing page.

54
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.500
And this is the first styling we're going to apply within our project.

55
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.630
But first, we're going to need to actually set up our project in Visual Studio code.

56
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.630
So if we go back to our desktop here, we're going to start with the standard empty template.

57
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:56.960
So I'm going to just use this, duplicate it, and then I'm going to rename it Splash Dash Page and

58
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.440
then I'm going to open this up in Visual Studio code.

59
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.670
Okay.

60
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.450
So we have our files open here.

61
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.520
Perfect.

62
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.830
All right, let's start with the usual.

63
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:19.589
We're going to change our title here to B Splash page, and we can save that and then run our project.

64
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.149
All right.

65
00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:22.530
So it's working.

66
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.430
That's great.

67
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:30.360
Now we can go back to our HTML and the first thing we're going to do is we're actually going to create

68
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.540
a wrapper div for everything.

69
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.040
This is because we want the wrapper to be the 1440 pixels and we want that to be able to be centered

70
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.200
in the body because some screens will actually be wider than 1440 pixels.

71
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.140
So if you have a 1080 P monitor, that width is actually 1920 instead of 1440.

72
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:58.830
So to create a div with the class wrapper in Visual Studio code, we can actually just type period and

73
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.670
then wrapper.

74
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.880
So that's the class and then press enter and you see we have a div with the class of wrapper.

75
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.230
Very cool.

76
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.820
Okay.

77
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.540
So we can save that.

78
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:17.130
And if we jump back to Figma here, we can see that we have some styling suggestions here.

79
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.640
So the first thing we're going to do is we're actually going to copy the background first and we're

80
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.570
going to put that in our body itself actually.

81
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.990
And we can get rid of this min height because we're going to deal with that later.

82
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:38.880
And then we also want to style for our wrapper itself and we'll jump back.

83
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.960
To the browser and we're going to copy the position relative and the width, but we're not going to

84
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.340
copy the height because we want the height to be a little bit more dynamic than that.

85
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.710
So we're going to paste that in there.

86
00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:00.330
So we have our position relative and we have our width of 1440 pixels and instead of our solid height,

87
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.880
we're going to have a more dynamic height.

88
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.690
So we're going to give it a min height of 100 viewport height.

89
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.070
So this is taking up 100% of the screen real estate that's visible.

90
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.030
If you increase the number more than that, it means you'll actually scroll down the page, which we

91
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.710
will actually need to do later.

92
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.520
And next we're going to give this a margin of auto.

93
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:32.010
So this is going to center our wrapper within our page if our page happens to be wider than 1440 pixels.

94
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.830
And I'm just going to give it a background of Dodger Blue now so you can see what I'm talking about,

95
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.580
so we can save that now and jump back.

96
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.280
Okay.

97
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.580
So we can see definitely a lot of blue happening here.

98
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.220
But if we actually zoom out, we can see that we have our gradient background.

99
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.830
It's very subtle, but there's a little bit of pink down here and this is showing that our wrapper will

100
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:03.050
remain centered even if the page is bigger than our 1440 pixels.

101
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.150
So that's why we're using a rapper here.

102
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.230
All right.

103
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.070
So I can set that zoom back to 100%.

104
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.000
All right.

105
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.140
Now we're ready to start with the text for our project.

106
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:21.780
So back in Figma we can see that we have a title here and we have some body text down here.

107
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.920
So the first thing we're going to do is if we click on the title, we can see that we have a font family

108
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.140
of Futura T.

109
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.590
So I personally know that this is a paid font and we want to stick with free fonts for our project.

110
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:42.280
So I'm going to be changing this to Lato instead, so I'm going to jump over to Google Fonts.

111
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.670
In order to do that, you can choose a different font if you like.

112
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:53.560
To me, this is a similar very popular font, so I'm just going to search Lato Lato and I'm going to

113
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:59.020
click on it and I'm going to scroll down and I'm going to select the regular font.

114
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:04.000
I'm going to go over to embed and I want to copy the import statement.

115
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.500
So I'm going to highlight that copy that jump back and I'm going to paste that at the top, the CSS

116
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.100
here.

117
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:21.400
And then I'm also going to in the body assign the font family to be lato comma sans serif as a backup

118
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.100
just in case that doesn't load.

119
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:31.030
Now we're going to need to build out the HTML with the font from our Figma project.

120
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.059
So first we will build out the text here.

121
00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:41.260
So we want our title and text come into a title there and then we're going to create a parent container

122
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.970
because we're also going to put in the app store badges in here as well.

123
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.530
So we're just going to use dot text container to create our div.

124
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:58.780
And then inside of this, we're going to create an H one dot title to specify this is our title class

125
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.470
and then we're going to create a paragraph element.

126
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.720
So P dot text.

127
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:11.020
So to give that a class of text and then we're going to jump back to the browser and close our Google

128
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.810
fonts for now and go back to figma.

129
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.870
And we want to actually copy the text so we can just copy this right here.

130
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.610
And then jump back and we're going to put that in the title there.

131
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.000
And then we're going to highlight this and we're going to copy the text here.

132
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.090
And we can jump back past that in.

133
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:35.540
Okay.

134
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.330
I'm going to use alt z to word rap so that we can actually see everything.

135
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.480
That reminds me we can actually get rid of font.

136
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:41.850
Awesome.

137
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.820
We don't need that for this project oc.

138
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.120
And so we have our HTML done here.

139
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.550
Let's save that and check it out.

140
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.410
Okay.

141
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.040
So we have our font in here and we have our Google font, so that's good.

142
00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.530
We can see that we now have a horizontal scroll bar though, and that's definitely something that I

143
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.580
don't want to have.

144
00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:11.350
I think that's usually a bad thing to have, so we can fix that by switching our overflow ex on the

145
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.150
body to be hidden.

146
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:18.160
So we'll go back to our CSS here and below our margin.

147
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.490
We're in type overflow x, so this is only for left right and we want that to be hidden.

148
00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:25.710
Okay.

149
00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.560
We can save that in check.

150
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.800
All right, perfect.

151
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.260
We got rid of our horizontal scroll bar at the bottom here.

152
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.240
So we still have margin above our H one.

153
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.790
As you can see, there's a bit of white here, but let's copy the styling from Figma first to see what

154
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.720
changes.

155
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.640
So back in Figma, I'm going to go over to our title again.

156
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:52.380
And I'm going to copy all of this, but I am going to get rid of that specific font family.

157
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.790
I'm going to copy the color, but I'm going to copy that separately because I'm going to put that in

158
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.610
the body instead of having to have it in both of them.

159
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:05.880
So we're going to go right below here and we're going to have a class for our title, and I'm going

160
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.020
to paste that in.

161
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.240
I'm going to highlight all of these press tabs so that it's indented properly.

162
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.940
And I'm going to get rid of this font family here.

163
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.850
And I'm going to go back to Figma to copy the color here.

164
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.230
And we're going to paste that right here above our background color.

165
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:37.010
Then I'm going to go back and copy the CSIS for our body text here.

166
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.500
So you can see that we have a position of absolute.

167
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.560
So that is setting exactly where they want it on the page.

168
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:50.390
So that's why having our wrapper be 1440 pixels is so important because all of this is relative to that

169
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.640
1440 pixel width.

170
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.270
Okay.

171
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.100
And we'll jump back and below this.

172
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:03.370
We're going to use our text class here and we're going to paste this same thing.

173
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:10.510
We're just going to highlight this tablet over and then remove our font family and we can save that

174
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.160
now and check it out.

175
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:14.750
Okay.

176
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.290
So that's definitely looking a lot better.

177
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.110
It is exactly where it should be on the page.

178
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:27.380
So you can see if we go back that we have a gap here and we have a gap here on the top which we are

179
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.090
maintaining perfect.

180
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:35.150
So our positioning is working out and copying over our CSS is going pretty smoothly so far.

181
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.460
I can actually get rid of the.

182
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.300
Background Dodger Blue.

183
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.500
That was just to show how the rapper will remain centered on the page.

184
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.630
Okay, cool.

185
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.140
In the next video.

186
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.800
Now that we have our position where we want it to be, we're going to be starting to tackle the image

187
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.790
assets.

188
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.440
So I'll see you in that one.

189
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.610
Bye for now.
