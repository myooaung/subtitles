00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,130
And welcome to the student Q&A section.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,180
So as students take this course, usually I get a bunch of questions.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,470
Some of them are really, really good.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,670
Some of them I get often.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:18,140
And we're going to use these Q&A sections for me to make a reply video to answer some of those really,

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,100
really good questions.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,340
And the first one we're going to tackle for this video is index HTML.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:34,010
If we go back to our example that we had, you've noticed that I've always used indexed HTML as the

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,990
first page and then we created a new page, HTML.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,670
Now you might be asking yourself, why index HTML, why not home HTML or Apple's HTML?

11
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,920
And you could actually do that.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,990
But I can explain this really well by looking at this diagram.

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,730
Most of the time there are more than a few HTML files.

14
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,470
You saw that with our example.

15
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,489
We had our index on HTML and also new page HTML.

16
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:11,840
But when we make that request to let's say Google.com, how does the server know which HTML to return

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,060
first for the home page and you could go into the server and configure it and tell it.

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,780
You know what I want about HTML to be the first page.

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,930
But by default most servers just say I'll return index.html.

20
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,160
If I see index.html in the servers, I'll just return that.

21
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,570
So this is just a common practice that you'll see in a lot of the projects that a lot of the websites

22
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,420
that you'll work with is that indexed HTML is usually you can think of it as the home page, the first

23
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,230
HTML file that the server returns.

24
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:53,850
And if anybody in the index site HTML clicks on a link, then it will return whichever link they return.

25
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,950
So that would be let's say they click on about anchor tag, then they'll get about dot HTML.

26
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,810
So that's it.

27
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,330
That is your answer to your question.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,560
I'll see you in the next one.

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,190
Bye bye.
