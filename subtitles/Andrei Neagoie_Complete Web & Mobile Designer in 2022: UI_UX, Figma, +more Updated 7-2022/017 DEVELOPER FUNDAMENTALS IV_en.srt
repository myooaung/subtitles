00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,700
Welcome back to another developer fundamentals video.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,660
And you know who we haven't seen in a while?

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:08,520
My friend Jean-Claude Van Damme.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,020
How are you doing these days, John?

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:12,280
Yeah.

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,110
All right, so what is this developer fundamental that we're going to teach?

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:26,640
Well, I have over here animator CSIS, and this is another CSIS file that we can download to animate

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,150
things.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,690
So all I need to do is click download Animate CSIS, and I have the CSIS file.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,890
Download it for me.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,630
So let's open that up.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:44,910
You'll see over here that, yeah, this is a massive CSS file that I just downloaded.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,470
And this is how bootstrap that we've seen in previous videos works.

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:57,420
They're essentially providing a CSS file for us with all these properties already preset, and we also

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,870
have all the classes that we need to use them.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,360
So let's say I wanted to use this and I'm just going to copy this for now.

17
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,670
And I have an empty website and I'm just going to copy and paste the CSS for us.

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,860
Just think about how powerful that is.

19
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:23,490
We're able to not start from scratch, but use what other people have created to make our websites faster.

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,460
To show you this.

21
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,310
Let's open up this file so into our browser.

22
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,180
Okay.

23
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,870
It's completely empty.

24
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,820
And let's just have a header, one that says, Animate me.

25
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,750
I'm going to save and refresh.

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,820
And looking at animates, I can add the let's add bounce to our header.

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,940
All we need to do is click on something like V on GitHub and it will explain for us what we can add.

28
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:05,790
And I'll just save you the trouble of reading, but all we need to do is this copy and add the class.

29
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,360
Animated and then whatever animation we want.

30
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:11,380
And this library.

31
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,360
That's how it works.

32
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,310
You just need to stay a class.

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,910
And type animated first and then any of the actions that were provided on the website.

34
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,670
So in our case, it was infinite bounce.

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,710
Save and refresh and well, we have a link to our stylesheet here, so let's do that.

36
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,020
And we should be really good at this by now because we've done it plenty of times, save and refresh.

37
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,930
Look at that.

38
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,410
A header is now animated.

39
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,160
Let's see what else we can do with this.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,910
We can do jello.

41
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,910
Actually, let's do something more exciting.

42
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,560
Maybe flip.

43
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:55,400
Woo!

44
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,060
I like that one.

45
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,660
Okay, so we want to do flip.

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,890
We can type in flip and refresh here.

47
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,730
You see that?

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,460
Let's do that infinite just so we can see it.

49
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,140
Whoa.

50
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:12,830
There you go.

51
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm going to stop that because that's going to get us dizzy or fresh.

52
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,200
There you go.

53
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:26,480
Now, the fundamental here that I want to show you is that when we're building websites, it is very

54
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,540
rare that we build something from scratch.

55
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,500
Most of the time you want to build on top of something that has already been created.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,660
Otherwise, the whole environment of being a developer would be very, very tedious.

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,430
How much of a waste is it if somebody has already created a solution that you need?

58
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:50,560
So as a developer, you want to be efficient with your time and your limited resources.

59
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,810
So you want to find things like bootstrap or even animate CSS if they solve your certain problems.

60
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,160
And that is true for CSS as well as JavaScript.

61
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:11,260
When we get into it, you want to find solutions that already exist, and only if they don't exist already,

62
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,900
then you can implement your own.

63
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,839
Finally, I wanted to show you one other tool and that is creative.

64
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,649
Tim.

65
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,980
So if you click on Creative Tab.

66
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,720
They create bootstrap themes.

67
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:38,470
They're using the bootstrap toolkit to build their own styles and their own little customized actions

68
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,790
to make it even better.

69
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:47,290
So if I go to categories over here and we'll do UI kits, you'll see over here that they have all these

70
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,430
things that we can use.

71
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,950
So if we click on Paper Kit to Pro, let's find a free one.

72
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,840
Actually, if I click on.

73
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,570
Price low to high.

74
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,800
There you go.

75
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,290
We have to get it done.

76
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,720
And we also have paper kit, too.

77
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,860
So if I click on this and I'm going to make this full screen.

78
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:19,040
This allows us to build something like this very, very easily with their own custom design.

79
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,550
And all we need to do is do a free download.

80
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,220
And you'll see that when we download this.

81
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,690
We have all the files that we need and let's open it up.

82
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,510
Look at that.

83
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,590
We have this website that just like.

84
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,050
Bootstrap.

85
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:49,690
We can use these buttons and these different styles and navigation, progress, bars and forms and everything

86
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,440
that you need.

87
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:59,200
And because we know now how the HTML files and CSS files work, we can actually start customizing this

88
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,820
and we can open up an index file and start editing.

89
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:12,370
Or if we go into assets and CSS, we can start adding our own CSS values to it.

90
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,900
And you'll see a lot of developers that.

91
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,470
Do this.

92
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:18,980
Exactly.

93
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,770
They're freelancers and people need just websites built and they're able to build websites really,

94
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,530
really fast by using something like creative.

95
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,390
Tim Because as you can see, they've already built really nice looking components for you.

96
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,580
There's paid ones that you can get and that is one avenue that you can go.

97
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:46,030
But I do argue that these type of websites can only take you so far.

98
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:54,160
And in order to build real applications, real complex applications, and even garner higher salaries

99
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,910
and make your skills really valuable, we need to learn JavaScript and we need to become better than

100
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,840
just using templates and CSS.

101
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,780
And that's why we're going to get into the next section that is JavaScript.

102
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,670
That is when the real power comes.

103
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,660
I'll see you on that one.

104
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,500
Bye bye.
