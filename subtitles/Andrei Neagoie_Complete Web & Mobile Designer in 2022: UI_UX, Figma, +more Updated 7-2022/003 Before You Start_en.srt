00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,790
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,689
We're going to be talking about site maps and we're going to be building our own in Figma.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,070
But before we build our own, I want to go through a couple of different things about my process and

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,390
how we can just get started on the right foot.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,620
So what I like to do is I like to grab all those sketches that we created in the beginning, and I like

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,340
to just drop them into my files wherever they're relevant, of course.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,160
So if I'm done sharing them with the team, I'll put them in some sort of folder or a page where I can

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,520
share.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,940
So I'll just click share and copy that link into drop it into a Slack group or whatever messaging platform

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,600
we're using.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,470
And over here we have all our sketches.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:46,020
So I'm using them in our sitemap file right now, and they're going to help us really figure out the

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,430
structure of our application.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,610
They're going to help us think about maybe some details or details on pages that could really influence

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,560
the categorization of certain things.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,220
So we started with mapping out the overall journey.

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,280
So I know that we need an onboarding screen.

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,110
I do know that we need some sort of home screen or this looks like a search result screen that I quickly

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,830
mocked up.

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,260
I know that there's going to be some sort of like order screen says package shipped here and a package

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,800
arrived.

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:20,880
So there's probably maybe another screen that will pop up for the user, but that is probably just conditional.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,090
So we're not going to necessarily worry about that kind of stuff just yet.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,380
I do know that there's a product page over here as well and we have a cart.

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:38,160
So I know that there's certain areas where I can get to like the cart differently, so I can probably

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,290
get to the cart from the product description.

27
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,980
I haven't necessarily thought about that too, too much, but it is a possibility.

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,680
Maybe once you add an item, it'll push you into the cart.

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,380
But mainly I think we thought about the cart from a navigation standpoint and keeping it there at all

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:52,740
times.

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,300
So we'll probably keep the cart in the navigation and we're going to worry about that when we're talking

32
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,410
about actual site maps.

33
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:05,910
So it looks like our main navigation is like home save orders cart and there's going to be some extra

34
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,820
information on each page that we're also going to break down.

35
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,320
So right now we have a homepage.

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,910
It looks like we have some products here.

37
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:18,150
I have like a profile avatar that I'll probably allow users to actually access a profile and maybe account

38
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,870
settings.

39
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,670
So we'll think about that while we're building our same app, we do have like a saved section.

40
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:32,540
And this same section probably has different items, more similar items away into the cart section.

41
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,260
What else do we have here?

42
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,160
We have a cart, so we've already thought about that a bit.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,530
And here I'm already thinking about some of the navigation schemes, so I know a search leads to a product

44
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,380
or a results that then leads to a product.

45
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,720
We have a product that leads right to checkout.

46
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,290
We probably have categories down here that we need to think about.

47
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,140
We spoke about kind of like those primary, secondary and tertiary levels.

48
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,050
So we're going to think about how far we need to go.

49
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,280
Probably not too far.

50
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,290
I'm thinking only like secondary.

51
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,550
So what we have here, we have orders, so we probably have an orders page.

52
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,780
Okay.

53
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,410
And yes, we do have some sort of navigation scheme that we started building out.

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,470
And what I have here is home description.

55
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:25,180
So what I really want you guys to do is grab all your sketches, digitize them, put them into figma

56
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,590
and use them to really help influence what you're trying to build here.

57
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,470
Sometimes people sketch and they forget about the sketch and they start building something entirely

58
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,760
different or they start kind of fresh.

59
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,340
We don't necessarily want to start fresh.

60
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,580
We want to influence the work as we go along based off of our findings.

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,280
So whatever feedback you got.

62
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,430
Implement it here.

63
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,920
Don't have to necessarily go back and redo everything.

64
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,070
Just keep moving.

65
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,410
So we have screen flows and we know that a search will lead to results and the results to description.

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,570
So we basically know where we're going with some of these sketches.

67
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,060
Now let's review some of our user flows here.

68
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,190
So we have registering with our product.

69
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,490
We know that there will be like a welcoming or boarding.

70
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,149
I'm not sure what that will look like, but it'll lead into a registration flow.

71
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,300
Which we need to think about, which would push us into the home page.

72
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,340
So that's helpful.

73
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,750
Over here, we have finding the right product through search.

74
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,930
So we've done this already with our sketches.

75
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,690
So we this is just more refined.

76
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:38,290
Yeah, yeah, we've done that and we have making a purchase and so we understand the cart.

77
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,570
So we have a lot of refined little flows here.

78
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:49,270
And since our application isn't too detailed or complex, we have a good starting off point based off

79
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,200
of what we have here.

80
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,840
And you'll probably have much more than this.

81
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,770
And you know, you should start thinking about all the different types of flows.

82
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,170
But like I said earlier, the design process is just constantly evolving.

83
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,060
You don't necessarily stop sketching.

84
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,370
You don't necessarily stop creating user flows.

85
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:12,910
Everything's always kind of happening simultaneously in a way, especially with sketching and user flows.

86
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,540
So don't worry, if you don't have too much, you'll figure it out once you start building out the site

87
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,000
map that maybe this doesn't necessarily make sense.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,770
And I need to go back and think about it.

89
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:27,130
So don't be too hard on yourself if you forget something, because it definitely will happen.

90
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,820
Especially once you start talking to more people and getting feedback.

91
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,930
So before we begin, I just want to explain what I have here.

92
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,130
And these are a couple of components and you know how much I hate recreating the wheel.

93
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:46,180
These are some components that I kind of took from a resource for site maps because if somebody else

94
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,280
created it and it's a free resource, I am down to use it because it's going to make my life easier

95
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,790
and I'll link that original resource for you.

96
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,230
But you can use that.

97
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,310
You can use what I've created here.

98
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,530
I've kind of modified it a bit.

99
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,100
It's just what I need at least.

100
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,890
So let me just break this down.

101
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,010
These are the individual components that we'll be using.

102
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,100
And I know I explained some maps a little differently in terms of just having a label, but I really

103
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,870
like to build site maps in a way where I can start understanding the content structure inside.

104
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:23,650
So each page may have their own set of content that will link elsewhere, and you can kind of start

105
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,270
merging some sort of site map with like a little bit of a flow diagram.

106
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,650
I mean, like, you don't want to get too complex, but it really helps you think about the different

107
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,510
types of content that you're going to need on the page.

108
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:41,260
So this kind of stuff will be obviously influenced by your sketches and your user flows, and it will

109
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:47,320
give you a good overview if you have redundant content somewhere or if you don't have a piece of content

110
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,520
that you forgot about.

111
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,530
And we'll probably figure that out now.

112
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,270
So what do we have here?

113
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,040
So I have public components.

114
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,140
So this basically means that if a person uses our app and doesn't have an account, that's a nice shade

115
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,680
of blue.

116
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:06,070
If they're a member, they'll only be able to see content that is member based and we have a login or

117
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,000
sign up button and we have an outside link.

118
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,720
I'm not sure we're going to be using outside links, but it definitely helps to have some variety and

119
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,640
we can obviously create more of these.

120
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:26,710
And if we do option command B, we will essentially detach that instance and we can recreate our own

121
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,390
instance by going option command K and we can rename it to something else.

122
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,820
Och.

123
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,130
So let's just command ze out of that.

124
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,040
And in here, this is just the container.

125
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,630
So I kind of have it set up similar to what the original file had, which is this nice, cool little

126
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,400
browser looking window.

127
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,770
It has a title and this is going to be the title of our page, and we are going to name all these pieces

128
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,670
based off of the content.

129
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:56,610
So I will show you what that looks like right when we get into creating a sitemap.
