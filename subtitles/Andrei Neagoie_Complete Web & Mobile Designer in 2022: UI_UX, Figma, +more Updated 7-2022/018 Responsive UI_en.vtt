00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.050
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.290
Whenever you have a request from an employer to build a website or a web app, one of the first things

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.450
that they will ask for is to make sure that your website is responsive.

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.030
So what is responsive UI?

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.490
Well, I can show you by opening up the developer tools, which we should know by now, and you'll see

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.570
over here that there is a little phone icon.

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.460
If we click on this.

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.299
It will show you what your website will look like on, say, an iPhone.

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.650
Let's make this a little bit bigger.

10
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.920
So let's do 100% of the size.

11
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.460
Perfect.

12
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.680
You'll see that your website on an iPhone looks like this.

13
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.440
And if we do an iPad.

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.370
Well, it looks like this.

15
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.920
And if it rotates, it looks good.

16
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.590
So responsive means that your website, no matter what, whether it's on the big screen or something

17
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.700
like an iPad.

18
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.610
It is responsive.

19
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.740
That means there's no cut offs.

20
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.970
Everything looks good no matter what size the screen is.

21
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.870
So if we go back to our website and close the developer tabs, I can actually play around with this

22
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.600
open and close and see that it's responsive.

23
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.530
The website looks good no matter what the size, and users can enjoy the experience and not be turned

24
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.550
off because whether they're accessing it through their iPad at home, on their couch, it still looks

25
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.940
good.

26
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.530
So keep that in mind.

27
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.760
Responsive UI should be a priority when building websites.

28
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.440
I'll see you in the next one.

29
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.970
Bye bye.
