00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.589
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:08.660
So I gave everyone a big rant about design, fidelity, and the proper way to jump into higher fidelity

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.370
designs and just general visual style exploration and all that fun stuff.

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.010
And now we're actually going to do that.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.020
What I want to do is I want to start with the home page.

6
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.460
I know, big surprise home page.

7
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.630
But the reason why I like to start with something like the home page, it's not always the home page,

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.430
but the reason why I do start with the home page a lot of times is because it's a great place to find

9
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.980
a lot of different types of elements we may incorporate just throughout the entire app.

10
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.870
I see like cards here.

11
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.550
I just see general variation in terms of typographic elements.

12
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.870
I see other elements like iconography.

13
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.850
I see our main navigation.

14
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.240
And I think like there's also a variation of cards here.

15
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.950
We may not even build it like this.

16
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.800
I think we're going to make some changes along the way as well, and that's something to note in general.

17
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.910
Designs just never really stay the same.

18
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.950
We're constantly iterating based off of what our feedback is in terms of user feedback, also based

19
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.830
off of what we think is a better design pattern.

20
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.080
So I'm going to make some changes here.

21
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.450
I'm going to jump right in to a couple of portions of the home page and hopefully you design along with

22
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.870
me.

23
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.400
You don't need to copy me directly, but I'm going to show you just some decisions I'll make in terms

24
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.020
of like cards and stuff like that that should help you when you go and create your own.

25
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.860
So let's jump right in.

26
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.790
I think like I've been talking about this a bunch and I think we should redo the navigation a bit.

27
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.690
I think these options are fine for now, but I really don't like to search at the very top, so I think

28
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.920
like we'll just incorporate it in a way where the user can easily just click at the navigation portion

29
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.990
and it'll pop into it like an overlay.

30
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.030
So let's go ahead and just create like a simple navigation.

31
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.020
So I'm going to just kind of go in here.

32
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.340
What I'd like to do is just create like a frame that's going to house our nav.

33
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.539
Let's just rename that to NAV.

34
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.710
So we're going to create a little enough over here.

35
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.230
I'm going to pick some icons.

36
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.330
So I like feather icons.

37
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.080
They're really nice.

38
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.630
So if I go, there's home.

39
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.110
It should drop right in there.

40
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.590
There it is.

41
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.140
There it is.

42
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.740
So home.

43
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.170
What else do we have?

44
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.660
I think it will be like under save.

45
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.730
Or maybe if we just search up heart.

46
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.660
There it is.

47
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.700
They're perfect.

48
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.340
Their search.

49
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.550
And when you're picking icons, I know I went over this before when we went through like iconography

50
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.060
and stuff like that.

51
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.650
Just make sure you're very consistent.

52
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.750
You can even create your own like we did.

53
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.550
So we have that bookmark orders.

54
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.330
I don't know.

55
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.320
Let's.

56
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.440
Do they have anything for orders?

57
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.300
I think like sometimes you just need to create your own and that's fine here.

58
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.920
This one, this one can work.

59
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.190
And what's next?

60
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.360
We need a cart.

61
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.350
There it is.

62
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.310
Perfect.

63
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.900
So we got all our icons.

64
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.430
And what we're going to do is we're going to create our own.

65
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.260
There they are.

66
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.270
We're going to create a little navigation here.

67
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.050
So that's the shopping cart.

68
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.870
Perfect.

69
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.700
So these are all 24 pixels.

70
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.200
And are they scalable?

71
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.400
No, they're not scalable.

72
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.110
That's totally fine.

73
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.000
What we're just going to do here is we're just going to keep everything the way it currently is.

74
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.120
In terms of the constraints, this should actually scale properly.

75
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.680
There it is to see how this works if we scale it.

76
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.890
Okay.

77
00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.280
So we have our icons and I'm just going to kind of place them into our frame for now.

78
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.350
What I'm going to do is I'm going to make the search more prominent as a piece in terms of our navigation.

79
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.020
And I'll tell you in a second why I'm going to do that.

80
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.630
So we could do audio.

81
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:21.490
I like doing audio just because it's a really easy way to lay everything out within your app and within

82
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.900
frames in general.

83
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.530
So let's do 24 pixels on the side.

84
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.460
Actually not.

85
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.670
Let's let's not do another layout.

86
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.000
I think the best is just a grid.

87
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.760
So we'll do a55 column grid.

88
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.670
I have some grids in here.

89
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.700
But I think we're just gonna have to create our own.

90
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.450
So let's go ahead and create our own grid.

91
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.230
So we're going to choose a column grid.

92
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.260
Right now, we should just be kind of flying through here because we've done this so much.

93
00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.540
So we're just going 16.

94
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.330
And once again, I'm kind of working off of that baseline that we we talked about before when we talked

95
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.500
about grids and spacing.

96
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.160
Okay.

97
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.660
Perfect.

98
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.510
Let's just resize this frame.

99
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.490
So that is nice.

100
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.230
Let's go right in.

101
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.930
And I'm just going to center this.

102
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.160
What I like to do is like, I'll just go like this perfect.

103
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.630
And then just bring it back to 24.

104
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.250
And even if it's not perfect, that's fine.

105
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.470
So we are going to just keep it centered and centered.

106
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.710
So it's going to stick to that same thing over here.

107
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.720
I'm just going to make sure that center is a 24.

108
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.740
And that's going to be actually not the easiest way to do this is just to kind of select them all and

109
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.900
fix the constraints all at once.

110
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:07.880
So when if this somehow this frame gets resized, we won't have to worry about just general resizing

111
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.570
issues.

112
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.480
So we'll just leave that there because I'm going to come back to that.

113
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.550
So if you notice, like right now, I'm not really worried about color.

114
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.970
I'm thinking about just hierarchy within the navigation.

115
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.460
And what do we have here?

116
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.530
We have 24 by 24.

117
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.700
And I just want to make sure these are all spaced perfectly within this grid.

118
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.810
May not be perfect.

119
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.980
Perfect, but close enough.

120
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.410
So what I want to do here is.

121
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.610
I want to.

122
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:48.330
Select my lips tool and I'm going to just create a big circle and I'm going to send that to the back.

123
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:57.240
And as you can tell, I have color styles set up, so I'm starting to build out a design system slowly

124
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.740
and I have some primary colors.

125
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.330
Like I mentioned, I have some UI colors and don't worry, we're going to get into this later.

126
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.070
But remember what I told you about just our general color palette?

127
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:16.210
What we can do is we can go in to our color and if we want to reuse it, we can just select that, select,

128
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.710
create a style and just write your style up.

129
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.970
And the easiest way to do that is just to like write primary slash.

130
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.560
I'm just going to call it gold and there it is.

131
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.630
So that's a local style that we have now.

132
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.030
And that's just it's just something that's just really easy to use and we'll speed up your workflow.

133
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.230
So I'm just going to select that.

134
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.030
So I have a 48 by 48 pixel circle.

135
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.070
I'm going to actually go back.

136
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.730
And select that.

137
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.370
That is a white.

138
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.100
Yes.

139
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:54.360
Okay.

140
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.760
I'm going to turn my grid off right now just because it's a little.

141
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.100
Little distracting.

142
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:06.650
So I'm going to select all those and I'm going to just select a nice shade that's very light.

143
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.860
Remember how we went through just creating neutrals and stuff like that in our color palettes?

144
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:19.580
Similar thing that we're doing right now, and I think that is pretty good.

145
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.080
Let's just turn on our grid one more time.

146
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.250
So if you want, you can kind of just.

147
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:29.970
Get that.

148
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.050
Nice.

149
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.150
Okay.

150
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.260
So this is what I was thinking for our navigation.

151
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:46.810
I think I'm going to have to make that a little smaller, so I'm just going to go 80 pixels.

152
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.770
You notice how the all these pieces kind of state together.

153
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.100
That needs to be sent to the center.

154
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.930
So remember to always set your constraints.

155
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.210
I mean, it just makes your life so much easier.

156
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.470
So these are all set nicely.

157
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.180
And I'm going to.

158
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.310
Make sure that everything is centered.

159
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.900
So I'm just going to.

160
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.910
Call this search

161
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:17.910
background.

162
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.850
And I'm just going to.

163
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.700
Group that into a frame and call it search.

164
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:32.960
And what we can do here is we can just like once again, center, center, everything stays together.

165
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.090
So I think 80 is good.

166
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.980
It's also a multiple of our baseline.

167
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:44.960
I think we are missing one more thing and we are just going to add like maybe like a horizontal rule.

168
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.560
I mean, there's a couple of ways we can do this.

169
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.860
I like using the.

170
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.070
We're using like a rule.

171
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.900
Or you can use like a shadow.

172
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.090
So there's our rule, way too dark.

173
00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.530
So we're going to come in here.

174
00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.930
And so there you go.

175
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.620
We're starting to build a Navajo.

176
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.630
And I'm really I'm really liking it.

177
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.910
I'm just making sure there's enough contrast.

178
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.700
And we start to look like you can start building that fidelity.

179
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:26.190
Like we started to use icons that maybe are much better for our use case just for our general application.

180
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:32.720
We're starting to also think about like different types of hierarchy within the navigational structure,

181
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.190
whether what is selected.

182
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.200
So we'd be on the home screen right now.

183
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:44.000
I think another thing that we should be thinking about is like, what is the micro interaction?

184
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.690
For for an active navigation piece.

185
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.730
So there's different ways we can do that.

186
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.040
So I'm going to just use like a.

187
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:10.280
A little line here that will help us just distinguish what is active.

188
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.510
What is an active?

189
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.520
Beautiful.

190
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.230
So let me just make sure everything is centered.

191
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.920
Perfect.

192
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.760
So that's how you build a really easy navigation.

193
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.860
And you can tell based off of what we've been building over time and some of the decisions that you've

194
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:36.500
seen me make, I know I made this based off of a gut feeling, not actual user feedback, and this is

195
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.490
just my assumption.

196
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:43.370
The first thing I would do is I would test this before I make a big leap to just general design, and

197
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:48.020
I would test it again once I get here just because I need to make sure that this interaction is going

198
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.650
to work.

199
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.470
So that's it for the navigation.

200
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.240
And the next video, I'm going to get into some other UI elements on this home page that we have over

201
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:56.540
here.

202
00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.250
This is our just our little wireframe.

203
00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:05.150
So yeah, meet me back here again and we will jump right into designing some other elements.
