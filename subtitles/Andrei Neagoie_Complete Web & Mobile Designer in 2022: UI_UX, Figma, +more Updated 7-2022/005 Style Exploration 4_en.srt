1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,630
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,530
So I just want to kind of start to finish off filling up this page.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,400
I'm going to start thinking about a couple of different like UI elements that maybe we, you know,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,530
maybe we didn't think about too much.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,770
So maybe let's start with thinking about so the profile we kind of remove different than NAV and I think,

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,950
you know, maybe we should have like a static, persistent, like avatar in the top.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:32,850
So let's see where we are on our grid so we can start thinking about if we do have avatars, what do

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,780
they look like?

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,050
I'm going to use the plugin over here called Content Reel and I have this selected.

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,930
I'm just going to select an avatar and there we go.

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,340
We have our avatar that I just plops right in and that's pretty cool.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,500
I mean, that's something to think about.

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,330
Do we need something like that?

14
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:51,960
Maybe.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,770
Maybe not.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,370
I don't know.

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,800
Maybe we need to rework our NAV a bit.

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,360
What about this?

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,670
I mean, what happens if people want to see more?

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,390
Do we have a title here and do we have another link?

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,550
Is that too much to kind of have that over and over again on a page maybe?

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,420
I don't know.

23
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,900
What we can do is we can start thinking about some alternatives.

24
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,330
So I'm going to do I'm actually going to create a large button.

25
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:23,390
And within that button I'm going to place within that frame, I'm going to place some text and I'm just

26
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,350
going to just say, discover more.

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,600
Like Maybe I'm here.

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,550
I'm also exploring different things, like just our language.

29
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,360
What type of language do we want to use?

30
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,510
Do we want to entice users like that?

31
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,100
Do we want to stay more standard?

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,500
Like just saying stuff like see more?

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,710
These are the types of questions you should be asking yourself.

34
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,060
So what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to make that like that.

35
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,670
I'm going to actually make this an auto layout.

36
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:03,420
So I switch at the vertical so I can adjust the width and that's fine.

37
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:12,010
The top, we want to make this like a 48 pixel, so we're just going to have to do a little bit of testing

38
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,210
to get it there.

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,520
So we got 48.

40
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,510
Hmm.

41
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,400
Let's roll with 48.

42
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,390
I think that's fine.

43
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,390
This needs to go in the middle, so we're just going to adjust that to the middle.

44
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,590
Let's make this reach the end of our.

45
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,960
Our grid.

46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,950
So it's centered.

47
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,770
That looks good.

48
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,500
That looks good.

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,930
We don't need any space in between.

50
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,150
And we need a fill 100%.

51
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,360
We need a fill so we can start thinking about like buttons.

52
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,210
We have this kind of this yellow from our app.

53
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,850
Let's actually just grab that logo.

54
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,690
So we have this this yellow that we're using.

55
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,650
We're sticking very much with the branding, the color palette that we've kind of expanded upon.

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,780
I don't know if I'd like this teal that much.

57
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,180
It's making things look really kind of dull.

58
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,910
But let's just keep going and we will figure it out 100%.

59
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,600
We will figure it out.

60
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,040
So you'll notice how I've broken up my color styles and I'll get into that later.

61
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,010
But it just makes it easier when you kind of break it up by use.

62
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,810
Case I'll look background text.

63
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,380
Even if you're repeating the colors, you'll notice like I've repeat white a bunch.

64
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:32,000
So that way if I'm in a very complex component like this, I can easily just pick off like, what's

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,520
a UI color, what's a text color?

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,310
And if there's multiples, I just want to change the text color.

67
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:43,400
I can easily just find anything that says like UI or text and just change the base off of that.

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,410
I haven't been using that here.

69
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,780
It makes it really easy to go back and make some of those changes.

70
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,890
Okay.

71
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:59,210
So for color, I think white will be fine in terms of accessibility, I think like that's pretty good.

72
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,100
We'll need to test that for sure.

73
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,170
I'm sure this is not accessible.

74
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,390
So like I said, we'll just test.

75
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,030
But I'm kind of liking this nice orange button, like what happens if we kind of add an effect to it?

76
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,020
So what I like to do is I'll just create a copy over here, usually like this as well.

77
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:21,019
I'll just create a bunch of different copies of things and I'm starting to see like, okay, this is

78
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:26,960
where we're kind of going in terms of our exploration, just general hierarchy.

79
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:35,030
Like when you see things separated away from the page, let's just remove this image and you start to

80
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:42,290
kind of like, Oh, this is looking very interesting, and I can see if these little pieces can kind

81
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,670
of survive on their own.

82
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,530
Let me go back to this image here.

83
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,170
This needs to be refined a bit.

84
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:55,100
I can start seeing like just the general visual direction of my designs, much more easier than just

85
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,560
kind of viewing it in a page, one after the other, as they're kind of secluded to where you're viewing

86
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,340
them on the screen.

87
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,030
So I'm trying to make one like cohesive language.

88
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,290
We have a button here.

89
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,210
I really like the button a lot.

90
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,660
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to add an effect.

91
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,730
Maybe this will work, so I have a default shadow.

92
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,140
So that's really nice.

93
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,590
So I'm starting to think like, okay, what happens when it's active?

94
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,170
What happens when somebody taps on it on desktop?

95
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,780
What happens is somebody hovers over it.

96
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,510
I'm trying to think about all these little micro interactions as well at this point.

97
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,730
Like, does somebody just click and the shadow kind of disappears, kind of like the buttons being pressed

98
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,970
to the bottom or maybe nothing happens.

99
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,570
I don't know.

100
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,070
So just something to think about to incorporate that early.

101
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,260
I kind of like the shadow.

102
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,340
We'll leave it for now.

103
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,620
We'll place that up there.

104
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,920
Let's also think about some secondary cards that we have here.

105
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,950
So right now we have a bunch of different elements.

106
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,290
We're starting to think about our typography structure.

107
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:03,410
We're starting to think about just cards, buttons, links, all of these different things, avatars.

108
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,280
We have navigation and icons and just the general style of icons.

109
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,980
And we've done this all just from the homepage.

110
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,750
Not every homepage is going to be like this, but I like to pick a page that has a bunch of or just

111
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,990
a variety of elements that I can start to build.

112
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,880
And actually it'll help me dictate what that visual style will be going forward.

113
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,860
So the last thing I really want to do here is I want to create some cards, maybe they're category cards.

114
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,960
I was thinking actually what I want to do is I just want to name that button.

115
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,400
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to create another frame, surprise, surprise, she's

116
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,390
going to call it card.

117
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:48,470
And what we can do here is we can start thinking about what this card could be.

118
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,230
So we have like a light grey.

119
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,850
I mean, we can use like secondary colours here.

120
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,030
I'm not entirely sure just yet, but what I'm going to do is I'm just going to.

121
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,050
Stealing from there.

122
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,600
And I'm going to start thinking about what these cards can be.

123
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,000
Shopping habits and interest.

124
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,980
Maybe another way for users to get into that kind of funnel.

125
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,250
Maybe that's just not large enough.

126
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,020
20 pixels looks good.

127
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,210
That's fine.

128
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,060
What I'm going to do is I need an icon.

129
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:39,650
So I'm going to actually first I'm going to create a circle within here, and that's going to be the

130
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,800
background I want to have like a Chevron.

131
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,130
A Right.

132
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:50,030
Chevron making it look like you can click on this and just making that look really apparent.

133
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:58,370
So let's just set the background to that to White and let's go and find a Chevron.

134
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,440
So you've got feather icons.

135
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,290
Do we have it under arrow?

136
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,300
I don't think so.

137
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,840
It's actually under Chevron.

138
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,230
Sometimes it's under Arrow.

139
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,820
So we're going to click that.

140
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,270
There it is.

141
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,370
Thank you.

142
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,050
And we can take this.

143
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,470
This frame here is perfect.

144
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,980
And we're going to plop it right there.

145
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,020
And we're actually going to make this another frame.

146
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:31,200
And we're just going to call this Chevron and that will link to another page.

147
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,429
Let's just change the color of that.

148
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,580
We could do something like a yellow.

149
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,000
Like that looks pretty interesting.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,340
And we could also just kind of keep it like a dark like a dark block.

151
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,909
This can also be like just like a dark gray.

152
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,580
I don't necessarily know what's going to work, but I'm just trying a bunch of different options here.

153
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,980
Let's let's see what our grid looks like.

154
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,770
So we want to make this want to make this just a little smaller.

155
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,830
This needs to get on to our grid.

156
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,570
So we got four, four.

157
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:12,200
This also needs to think about this.

158
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,960
So if I actually.

159
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,850
I'm going to shift one too.

160
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,200
That's a pexels.

161
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,430
To 16.

162
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,670
Can shift control option and using arrow.

163
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,570
I'm going back the other way and I'm actually shrinking it.

164
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:38,110
So I've got 16 pixels and from here 100 and.

165
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:44,220
Trying to keep this very similar in height as well, kind of like a square.

166
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,400
So we're just going to

167
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,170
816.

168
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,240
So we got square here and there you go.

169
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,930
Like let's call this title.

170
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,400
Actually, it's already title perfect.

171
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,840
So we have a little card that is really nice.

172
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,510
And if we just copy that, we can start like making other cards based off of that.

173
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,650
So.

174
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,670
Another tip.

175
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,050
Today's trending items.

176
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:17,930
Perfect.

177
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,530
We can also, like, make this a different color.

178
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,570
Like it could be like that bronze.

179
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't know what's going to work just yet, but I'm starting to create some interesting reusable cards

180
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,830
that I'm really liking.

181
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,320
Incoming.

182
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,160
Kind of like that.

183
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:44,240
It can be flash deals and this can be a white text.

184
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,440
Oops.

185
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,760
And that will be like a blue maybe.

186
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,720
I don't know.

187
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:58,140
I'm kind of I'm kind of using a bunch of colors here, but it's all about just exploring what may work.

188
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:04,500
So we got browse are categories like maybe this just throws them into the category screen instead of

189
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,930
just having a bunch of different categories out there.

190
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:14,070
But it also gives us a bunch of different options in terms of like like, you know, they can view flash

191
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,850
deals.

192
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,070
It doesn't need to muddy up that home screen.

193
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,020
They can be like the trending items.

194
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,710
They can get into like habits and shopping interests.

195
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,770
So, like, there you go.

196
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,540
Look, we're already creating a bunch of different UI elements, and, you know, I'm not sure if I'm

197
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:36,420
really, like, going to settle with something like this because I don't know if it suits the style

198
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,160
and just the general tone of the brand.

199
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
So I may just do a little bit of a pivot.

200
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,180
I need to think about that a bit more.

201
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,460
And you should definitely you should too, because this is your design as well, and you're going to

202
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,880
have to figure out what you think is best for you.

203
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,670
So just from the homepage, we have a lot of different typographic elements.

204
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,640
We have a large card, we have some smaller cards.

205
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,650
I think we need to find something in the middle, like maybe like a middle card that we may use in terms

206
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,400
of size.

207
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,810
We have just typographic hierarchy in terms of like the cards themselves.

208
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,760
And this is just only using one typeface and you can see the variation that we've created already.

209
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,680
It hasn't taken us a bunch of time.

210
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,950
We have an avatar over here, we have buttons, the links, and we have a navigation as well.

211
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:25,440
You know, pick a screen that you feel will give you a lot of different elements to work with.

212
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,520
That could be different for you.

213
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,960
It could be different from the home screen in the way you set it up and use that to kind of create those

214
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,190
reusable elements and we can even create them into components.

215
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:41,040
If you really settled on something and use that throughout your product over here because you can actually

216
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,390
use like those elements to create other elements with some variation.

217
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,640
Like I have buttons here that I've used.

218
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:53,220
I have different types of elements in terms of typography that can be reused, like in terms of the

219
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,020
product name and like just the size that I've used here can just be reused here.

220
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,880
So it's all about like figuring out what style you're kind of, you're liking, what's going to work

221
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,650
for the user, what's going to resonate from them.

222
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,150
But also, once you've settled, you need to actually think about reusability.

223
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,050
You don't want to create 100 different types of cards.

224
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,010
That's fine.

225
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,860
Like, I mean, if you have different slight variations, like a button in there or maybe like a link

226
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,290
or like some sort of, I don't know, some sort of price or pill like we have in ours.

227
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:30,780
Like just for an example, we have like just price changes that's going to happen regardless.

228
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:37,920
But think about reusability just so you can make your life and developers lives much more easier.

229
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,990
And plus, when a user is looking through an application and they see something or a style that is just

230
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,850
incredibly consistent, it makes that user experience so much more better if they're going to a new

231
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,120
page.

232
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,130
And every time they get to a new page, everything is entirely different, whether that be just hierarchy

233
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,330
in typography or even just use of color.

234
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:03,330
Something as simple as that could really just make a horrible experience for the user and it's just

235
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,200
incredibly jarring.

236
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,270
So think about that as well.

237
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,310
Yeah, that's it for visual design and just visual style and exploration.

238
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,890
So go out there and have some fun, experiment with typography, experiment with color, experiment

239
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,380
with all the different UI elements that you want to build.

240
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,080
And I'm sure there are many more pages to build from here.

241
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:28,290
Just take a look at our wireframes so you can have just so much fun doing that and figuring out which

242
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:34,110
ways you can kind of build just reusability and consistency within our product.

243
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,160
And that's it.
