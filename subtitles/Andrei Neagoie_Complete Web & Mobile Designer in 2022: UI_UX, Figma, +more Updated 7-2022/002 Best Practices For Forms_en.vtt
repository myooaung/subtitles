00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.190
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.050
We're going to jump right in to some scenarios we often face with dealing with forms.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.990
I'm going to teach you the best practices.

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.280
We'll go through some demonstrations on what not to do and we'll fix them together.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.790
So before we even can start creating our own inputs and advanced inputs and buttons, we need to talk

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.250
about forms as all forms of essentially replaced conversations we have with each other.

7
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.260
So when you design a form, you should always keep in mind that they should feel like a friendly conversation

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.050
between your user and the product.

9
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.590
The first scenario we often find ourselves in is the amount of questions we have on a form.

10
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.640
So over here we have a little form.

11
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.890
It's kind of long and kind of demoralising when creating a form.

12
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.290
We need to keep it as short as possible and only ask the questions that are absolutely necessary.

13
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.970
Remember that there are some optional inputs that absolutely need to be there.

14
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.480
We should mark them as such and avoid using an asterisks.

15
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.110
If some inputs are optional, do you really need those inputs at all though?

16
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.060
Asterisks muddy your design too and create too much visual noise, and sometimes they can be confusing

17
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.840
to others.

18
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.130
Let's take a look over here.

19
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.710
I think we can actually fix this form.

20
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.050
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this frame command C and V and there we go.

21
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.040
We have our frame.

22
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.730
So what I would do in this scenario is just reduce the amount of inputs.

23
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.600
So I don't think if we're creating a log in form, you don't necessarily need to have country phone

24
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.260
number.

25
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.630
Um.

26
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.850
You may not even need a first name or a last name.

27
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.300
You could have an input just for full name.

28
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.030
And there you go.

29
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.760
You don't need to ask questions that don't necessarily need to be there.

30
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.530
So do your best to only ask the user the absolute minimum.

31
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.640
So let's jump to our next scenario.

32
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.210
Remember what I said about making your forms a bit more conversational?

33
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.289
Well, they should also logically flow like a conversation.

34
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.320
What is the first thing you ask a person when you meet them?

35
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.800
Their name.

36
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.620
You wouldn't ask for their address or their credit card information first.

37
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.900
I don't know if you would ask for their credit card information, but we should start with their name

38
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.350
and then move on over to some more sensitive questions.

39
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.300
So let's fix this input.

40
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.150
So we're just going to duplicate it.

41
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.340
And.

42
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.350
We can just rearrange it.

43
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.260
So like a conversation.

44
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.580
You should be asking what seems logical first.

45
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.750
It would be kind of weird to be asked your address or credit card number before your first name or your

46
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.620
full name and your email or any other information like that.

47
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.290
So that's what I would do.

48
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.990
Okay.

49
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.750
So the next scenario we often find ourselves in.

50
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.920
Is with long forms.

51
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.200
So sometimes you may be tasked with building a very long form or set of long forms.

52
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.750
Then that happens, and that's totally normal.

53
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.320
It happens.

54
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.470
There's a lot of different use cases like accounting software or just certain long registrations.

55
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.640
It really depends, but it's a big no no to have all these inputs grouped together because we run the

56
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.240
risk of confusing our user.

57
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.680
So the solution try to categorize relatable information so you don't necessarily need to break these

58
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.540
into separate flows.

59
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.600
But what you could do and let's just copy this over here.

60
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.260
You can actually just make these into.

61
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.260
Supper categories.

62
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.600
So what I'll do is it looks like I have a credit card information.

63
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.200
So this is a group on its own.

64
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.960
I have full name.

65
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.320
Address, city, postal code, country, state.

66
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.060
Let's just bring these down.

67
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.260
What I'm going to do is I'm going to break this first one into payment method.

68
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.959
And let's just give it a nice border.

69
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.840
That looks really good.

70
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.330
That's just a line that quickly.

71
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.240
So we have payment method.

72
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.820
We can bump this up just a bit.

73
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.020
So it seems like a nice title.

74
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.380
Who did that?

75
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.180
Oops.

76
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.480
This changes the board.

77
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.180
And we can even, like, just decrease the opacity of this so it isn't.

78
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.850
To.

79
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.350
In your face.

80
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.260
Let's just do that a little bit more.

81
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.820
Okay.

82
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.240
So we have one title over here for a grouping.

83
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.660
Oh, bring that one down there.

84
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.400
And we could just call this.

85
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.880
Billing information.

86
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.390
And just like that, we've logically broken out each piece.

87
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.410
Into their own groups.

88
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.720
And you can do this if there's multiple groups, but it just helps users digest your information much

89
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.560
more easily.

90
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.570
So if I were to come to a bunch of inputs like this, this is a lot.

91
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.730
And like I said before, in terms of like longer forms and only asking the necessary questions, sometimes

92
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:43.240
you have a large amount of questions and this could be demoralizing just to see just a blank slate of

93
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.290
a bunch of inputs.

94
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:52.000
So breaking it in to pieces allows users to easily understand that information and fill out all the

95
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.950
necessary inputs that they need to.

96
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.710
So let's move on to our next demonstration.

97
00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:59.930
What do we have over here?

98
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.960
So layouts, layout applies to forms as well.

99
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:11.290
I've personally been guilty of this where we have two columns.

100
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.120
Now forms should always be arranged from top to bottom in a single column, so it's easy for a user

101
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.660
to read.

102
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.180
We typically read from top to bottom and left to right, and this implementation makes me kind of wonder

103
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.410
which direction I should start to fill out the inputs so I go left to right.

104
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.410
Or do I go top to bottom and then top to bottom?

105
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.930
So it's a little confusing just for users in terms of which way they should be filling out the information.

106
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.650
Like I said, this is copy paste that.

107
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.740
And we're just going to take these two inputs and just bring them right down here.

108
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.370
And there you go.

109
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.560
That's just much more easier to fill out.

110
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.980
And if users are tabbing through inputs.

111
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.120
Like if this is longer than where they are on the page, it gets confusing because the page could be

112
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.980
jumping around while they're tabbing.

113
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.840
This just keeps everything really consistent.

114
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.710
They know that they're going from top to bottom, right down to the input, the button input at the

115
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.190
bottom.

116
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.410
So keep things consistent like that.

117
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.570
That's just much more easier for the user.

118
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.980
Okay.

119
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.180
Buttons, these are your action buttons at the end of the form.

120
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.790
And this is kind of up for debate and I don't really sway either way in terms of placement of your buttons

121
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.810
at the end of a form.

122
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.360
I mean, I do have a preference and I'll let you know in a sec.

123
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.620
Some people will argue that buttons should be left a line over here.

124
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.900
That's because we logically read from top to bottom and left right, meaning that button will be right

125
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.640
here waiting for you at the end of the form.

126
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.250
So if you're going top to bottom, left to right, it's right there and it makes most logical sense.

127
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:50.820
But sometimes when you think about how we think about forms and proceeding to a next step, we generally

128
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.350
think about moving right as the next step and left as going back.

129
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.580
So this is where the debate kind of stems from.

130
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:05.760
So if this were a step within like a progress form which has multiple steps, like three steps or something

131
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.010
like that, then sometimes I feel like if you were to click next, you would look for it on the right

132
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.660
rather than on the left.

133
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.950
Totally up to you.

134
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.340
I personally sway in the direction of having them left the line.

135
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:23.010
I do like them there just because I believe that it does logically help the user going from top to bottom,

136
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.760
left to right.

137
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:29.670
But it comes down to you testing with your users to so do that, make sure that whatever you have works

138
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.039
well and proceed in that direction.

139
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.200
Let's talk about the scenario we have here.

140
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:40.440
Another scenario we find ourselves in is that you may have two buttons like a submit and cancel, and

141
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:46.020
we have to make sure that both buttons are easily distinguishable to avoid the possibility that a user

142
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.130
clicks on the wrong button.

143
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:52.740
You can easily do that with a secondary button, and you should do your best to add micro copy wherever

144
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.040
possible and be descriptive with your button names.

145
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.340
So let's finish this.

146
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.030
Let's fix this up.

147
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.500
So we're going to do is.

148
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.640
Go over here.

149
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.850
One thing I noticed I'm going left to right.

150
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.690
So one thing I did notice is that the cement is on the wrong side.

151
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.580
So we're just going to bring that submit over and the cancel to the right.

152
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.830
First, I'm going to fix the button here.

153
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:22.650
So this cancel is just way too alike to the submit and I run the risk of having my user click one or

154
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.620
the other, and that is a no no.

155
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.980
So let's just fix this up.

156
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.590
All we can do is just have a secondary button.

157
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.480
So that is just easily distinguishable now.

158
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:43.510
And over here, we talked about having a better name for our copy or just a better copy for our buttons,

159
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.930
just making it more actionable and descriptive.

160
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.340
So this could be something like.

161
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.200
Create account.

162
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.750
Perfect.

163
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.480
So this is much better than what we had before.

164
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.320
Let's take a look.

165
00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.720
So here they are, side by side.

166
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:04.700
We have a cancel and submit on the wrong side and they were too similar.

167
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:11.090
Now we can easily understand which one we should be clicking and which one we could click if we needed

168
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.570
to.

169
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.910
So I de-emphasize the cancel made the create account stood out.

170
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.540
Let's jump to our next scenario.

171
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.640
So what do we have here?

172
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.000
So everything looks pretty good, right?

173
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.680
Remember how we covered long inputs and broke them out into different categories?

174
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.510
Well, sometimes forms are just too long that you need to split them into different pages entirely,

175
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.950
which is logical.

176
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.750
You don't want a user to infinitely scroll on one page to fill out a super long form.

177
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.310
And on mobile, we need to think about how we treat long forms.

178
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.090
We will probably treat them much more differently than we do on desktop.

179
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.650
So when you do this, you need to let the user know where they are within the flow and what they need

180
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.380
to do and how much longer they are to the end.

181
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.980
This can be done in a variety of ways, like there's progress bars, there's percentages and step counters.

182
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.210
We have this little form over here.

183
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:06.820
Right here.

184
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.100
And what we're going to do is we're going to fix this.

185
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.960
Let's take this out.

186
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:17.380
And let's just let's assume that this form is like step two of three.

187
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.790
Within our process, I'm actually going to go back up and steal.

188
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.480
This.

189
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:26.420
Oops.

190
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.250
Okay.

191
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:31.680
Sounds good.

192
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.350
So this password.

193
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.910
I mean, we can just do.

194
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.600
We can remove that because that doesn't really make sense and we can just save personal.

195
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.890
Information.

196
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.730
Let's just bring that down.

197
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.580
And.

198
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.390
Actually, let's create a progress bar first.

199
00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.880
So like I said, there's a couple of ways you can do this.

200
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.310
I mean, I'm just showing you quickly.

201
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.960
And you could probably do a much better job than I'm doing right now.

202
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:10.590
But.

203
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.750
Here we go.

204
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.380
So there is our progress bar.

205
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.760
That isn't very good.

206
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.760
Say, this is step one.

207
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.710
Let's find a nice screen.

208
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.800
So that's about 33% of the way.

209
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:35.120
And what you can do is you can have a little progress indicator.

210
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.920
Let's just bring down that size.

211
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.880
Great.

212
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:51.060
So you could do something like that where it just lets the user know that, hey, you are 33% of the

213
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.780
way through.

214
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.570
So you can have that anywhere on your page.

215
00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:01.160
You could also do like a combination of like showing what steps they are in or which step they're in

216
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.180
within the flow.

217
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.370
So that could look something like.

218
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.930
Let me just bring this out.

219
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:09.680
Oops.

220
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.210
That's a little too light.

221
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.110
And I think I had down 10%.

222
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:15.890
Yeah, that's good.

223
00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.250
So this is like, kind of like a stepper.

224
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.950
And it could show something like.

225
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.560
This one can just say personal info.

226
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:37.070
And this kind of allows the users to just get a sneak peek at the type of information that they will

227
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.780
be asked in the future.

228
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.400
So there's personal information.

229
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.650
This could be like payment.

230
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.430
And this could be like shipping.

231
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.800
So this is another option.

232
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.280
And like I said, it's totally up to you and what you think is the best.

233
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.790
Like what you've tested with what performs the best.

234
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:02.250
Another way to do this is to just kind of have a little stepper.

235
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.800
And this is usually like pretty much all you need.

236
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.380
Most of the time I find you can do something like step one.

237
00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.470
Of three.

238
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.220
So you could do something like that.

239
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:20.270
It just helps the user understand that, you know, if they're coming into this form, they have a good

240
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.290
understanding of how long the form process is going to be.

241
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.620
They don't want to be stuck in an infinite scroll and not know where to go.

242
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:33.530
It also allows you, if it's a really long form, you could implement some sort of save feature where

243
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.720
they could save at a certain step and they could easily remember.

244
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:42.920
So remember, if your form gets too long or if you're dealing with mobile, you need to break things

245
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.670
out just so it's just in bite sized pieces for your user.

246
00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:52.880
So these are the best practices for forms and we'll jump into best practices for inputs.
