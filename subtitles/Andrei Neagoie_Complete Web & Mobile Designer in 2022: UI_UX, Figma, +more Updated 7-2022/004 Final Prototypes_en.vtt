00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.020
Everyone.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.859
And welcome back.

3
00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.770
So we are at the very end of our project.

4
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.210
You know, we've created a bunch of designs, we've created a bunch of components.

5
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.970
We understand different things like color theory.

6
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.630
We understand a bunch of things like typography and like we're at the end.

7
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.780
And you probably wondering, what do we do with all of this?

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.220
Like, how do we put it together?

9
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.130
How do we showcase some of our designs and some of our interactions?

10
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.040
We've been thinking about how do we incorporate things like motion animation, and this is where the

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.510
fun stuff really happens.

12
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.720
If the other stuff wasn't fun to you, I mean, this is the really, really fun stuff.

13
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.920
So what we have here are high fidelity prototypes.

14
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.890
So I've kind of grouped them into the same file where we have our actual high fidelity designs, and

15
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.430
over here we can really start to experiment with certain types of interactions.

16
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.250
As you can tell, I don't just have one large prototype.

17
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.800
I actually advocate against that unless you're just trying to like showcase some like the navigation

18
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.280
tree.

19
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.620
But if you're trying to get into the little different types of elements, you may want to actually create

20
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.540
like a separate prototype for that.

21
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.740
So what I have here is I have our onboarding section.

22
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:17.420
Now I want to showcase what it's like to get from the main onboarding screen to sign up or not signing

23
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.730
up.

24
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.760
In this case, the user is not going to actually sign up.

25
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.570
So let's go ahead and play this.

26
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.220
But before we actually do that, I want to click the prototype tab.

27
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.010
And as you can tell, I have everything set up here.

28
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.080
I have a different type of phone model.

29
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.640
I have like the background color set to whatever I want.

30
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.950
I have my starting frame, which is at the splash screen prompt.

31
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.410
It looks like we're good to go.

32
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:51.080
So if I select this, you can see that if a user presses this CTA, they're going to go to this page.

33
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.700
And this is the interaction I have.

34
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.830
Now I have on tap.

35
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.100
It will navigate to the next onboarding screen.

36
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.530
It will push this onboarding screen out, but it will smart, animate those layers.

37
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.810
And what that means is, if you were paying attention in our last course around prototyping and motion

38
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.270
and animation, smart, animating the matching layers will actually keep the layers that are named the

39
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.760
same in the same frame, and it will just animate them to a new spot, depending on different types

40
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.420
of properties.

41
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.230
Like it could be position, it could be color, it could be size rotation.

42
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.180
There's so many different properties that are covered by smart energy.

43
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.140
So let's take a look.

44
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.940
So we have that pumping in here.

45
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.500
I've also set up a couple of different interactions here where it's very similar.

46
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.570
We have that push animation all at the same time.

47
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.700
The type of animation is like an ease out.

48
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.310
But I also have on the actual entire frame, I have a drag interaction.

49
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.190
So if users just want to kind of swipe through, they would get the same interaction from clicking next,

50
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.740
but it would actually just be like a drag animation.

51
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.670
And then if we take a look at that top, we have a skip button and that skip button is going to lead

52
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.230
all the way to the very end.

53
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.500
And I want to keep this at the very top.

54
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.240
I don't want users to skip through this onboarding.

55
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.480
I want them to get a good understanding of what is this application all about.

56
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.420
So one thing I want to just showcase before we actually run this prototype that I forgot about so you

57
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.980
can tell like text is name the same.

58
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.170
So we'll see slight animation there in terms of how the text changes, these animations are definitely

59
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.590
different.

60
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.450
So I have this one named illustration one.

61
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.670
I have this one illustration too, and so on and so forth.

62
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.550
These circles are actually all named Main Circle.

63
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.890
So let's bring that up.

64
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.690
So you'll see if I click one circle, it's going to be reflected in every frame.

65
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.060
It's going to show me straight up what I'm dealing with, where it's repeated, and how it possibly

66
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.390
may.

67
00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.070
Enemy Same with these carousel little buttons over here.

68
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.820
So I have a carousel set up.

69
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.140
And I have our buttons.

70
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.330
So let's run this prototype.

71
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.130
What we're going to do is we're going to click play.

72
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.790
It's going to pop up in a nice window over here.

73
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.790
And if we press our, we will restart it.

74
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.520
So if I click on my prototype, I can see which button I'm going to click and I'm going to do that.

75
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.960
So we'll see.

76
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.760
That was a nice little animation.

77
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.380
We had that main circle come in.

78
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.330
Everything slides in nice and slow.

79
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.510
If I want to kind of swipe, we can start seeing a little bit of swiping.

80
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.310
Animation, we can see how the actual carousel starts to work.

81
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.110
So I'm going to click next.

82
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.500
Boom.

83
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.140
We're on our second page.

84
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.970
Irrelevant results again.

85
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.860
Boom.

86
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.510
And then the last one.

87
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.310
Perfect.

88
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.380
So at this point, we're at the very end of our onboarding screen, and all I'm going to do is I'm going

89
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.860
to click.

90
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.750
So we had a little issue there.

91
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.350
We'll see.

92
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.080
Ask me again later.

93
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.770
Notice how there was a little funky background change.

94
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.840
Now this is what we're going to do here.

95
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.700
At this point.

96
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.200
If I click, ask me again later.

97
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.570
I don't want a smart animate at all.

98
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.420
So let's see if that fixes it.

99
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.250
Yes, it does.

100
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.850
So it just moves in over.

101
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.000
And we're at the home screen now.

102
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.720
We don't need to worry about things like logging in at this point.

103
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.430
You just can log in if they click that.

104
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.770
But we have.

105
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.870
Easy ways to get back.

106
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.910
So as you can tell.

107
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.100
I've also set animation to go back and forth if the user wants to do that, but this is how we've handled

108
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.790
our onboarding.

109
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.320
It's really exciting stuff.

110
00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.810
I love that.

111
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.650
I love the little animations there.

112
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.580
And then we can kind of go through our containers.

113
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.970
We have kind of like a swipe container over here.

114
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.600
Same with our deal section.

115
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.850
And we just have our standard things like our shopping and habits and interests.

116
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.920
So these are the kind of the components that we've used.

117
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.000
Now, if we go back to our screen, you can tell that sometimes when you're creating prototypes, your

118
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.320
components may not actually work really well, because if you're trying to smart, animate certain things,

119
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.890
you're going to need to possibly break those down a little bit more.

120
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.340
I've done that a bit through some of the prototypes I've created, like, here's some carousel dots.

121
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.850
They're not a component yet, but I may actually create a component for them when I'm using them.

122
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.940
In this instance, I probably won't actually use the component version.

123
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.560
So you have to think about those little things because, you know, sometimes if we take a look at our

124
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.260
primary default component, if there are certain things changing within, you know, you see how deep

125
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.920
this goes.

126
00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.980
And with it needing to match certain naming conventions and stuff like that, you may have two primary

127
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.350
button defaults on the same screen and you may need to rename them and things get a little bit complex

128
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.150
in that regard.

129
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.640
So that is what we've done for onboarding prototype.
