00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.480
We're back in concepts on my iPad and we're going to be sketching navigation schemes.

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.240
Now navigation schemes really help you figure out which options your users can choose, the directions

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.670
they can move in, and various parts of your product.

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.300
It helps to define your navigation and the hierarchies within.

5
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.030
I always do this at the beginning and it really helps influence my user flows later and my site maps.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.640
Basically, this is the structure of your product.

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.050
So what I like to do is let's just title this quickly.

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.390
So number three is a different type of flow and we're going to call it structure.

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.010
I like to call it structure.

10
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.410
There we go.

11
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.880
So number three.

12
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.660
Now, what we're trying to do here is we're really trying to think about navigation schemes.

13
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.150
We're trying to think about that structure of our product.

14
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.050
Sometimes I start thinking about the different types of screens that we actually do need.

15
00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.470
The one screen I know we need and that we've actually had sketched a couple of times is our home screen,

16
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.360
that main screen that somebody comes to.

17
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.380
So when I think about the home screen, I'm thinking about like maybe like a welcome message on top.

18
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.090
Maybe there's like a profile image, just different things like that.

19
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.690
I mentioned certain things like having like product images at the top so we can start thinking about

20
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.950
that a bit more and what that could look like and what that experience can feel like.

21
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.520
Maybe there's some deals at the bottom.

22
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.330
But I do know that there is some sort of home page, so we can kind of create a little icon here.

23
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.660
Now, when I think about a user moving through this app, maybe they have a saved page as well.

24
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.610
You know, sometimes we don't want to buy a product right away or we're waiting for a sale and we just

25
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.450
save it to some sort of wish list or something like that.

26
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.950
So let's have a saved page.

27
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.800
I think that's a really smart way.

28
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.950
We're allowing users to keep track of their products.

29
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.320
So maybe there's some text there.

30
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.120
We have some sort of persistent UI or navigation at the bottom.

31
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.759
And over here, it could be something really simple like.

32
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.140
Just a list of products that they have.

33
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.960
With some details.

34
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.020
Maybe there's a call to action here that add it to your cart and buy it right away.

35
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.930
Maybe this is sink to some sort of notification like when a product goes on sale.

36
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.820
But we can start thinking about like we we have a home page and maybe we have like a saved page as well.

37
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.880
I do know one thing we do need for sure.

38
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.250
That is a cart.

39
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.950
And we need to make that much more prominent because if a user adds something to a cart, we want that

40
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.800
to be right at the bottom or right in the place where a user can see it and click it easily and notice

41
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.660
that maybe there's a notification there.

42
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.960
So let's create like a little card screen.

43
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.220
And now I'm starting to think more about that hierarchy.

44
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.330
I mentioned it a little bit in the last video, but maybe there's a button at the bottom.

45
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.210
And if you notice, like we've had a persistent bottom navigation over here and over here, and what

46
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.570
we've done is we kind of switch that up a bit at the bottom here.

47
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.000
Now we have a button that links them to the checkout process.

48
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.090
And it'll allow them to easily tap that, especially on mobile and especially using that kind of design

49
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.800
pattern.

50
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.160
We're allowing them to click easily and then putting the option to go backwards up top, which is a

51
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.880
little bit more harder.

52
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:42.140
But if a user is going to cart, my assumption at least is that they want to check out, you know,

53
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.270
review their products, checkout quickly.

54
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.030
So we want to make that experience really quick.

55
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.300
So we have several navigation pieces over here.

56
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.550
Cart could live in here as well.

57
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.910
Let's draw a little cart.

58
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.330
That's going to have to work.

59
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.050
So now we know some basic navigation pieces that we like.

60
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.740
Now we can start thinking about, like our home screen a little bit more.

61
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.500
So if we redraw it here.

62
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.070
See about making your sketches messy.

63
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.350
I mean, it doesn't really matter about the details or too much.

64
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.829
Those start to kind of come naturally later on.

65
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.130
If I start thinking about where these different things lead, I can start thinking about the structure

66
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.360
of our whole product.

67
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.480
So I know that there's a home page and that's the first layer.

68
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.870
This is layer one, but on layer two.

69
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.690
I can actually go straight to a product page.

70
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.550
So I know that's a layer, too.

71
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.060
And from there I can go into check out.

72
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.570
So I start thinking about different ways I can prioritize certain tasks that are really important to

73
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.680
a user and really important to our business schools.

74
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.910
OC There's our cart.

75
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.640
But now we start thinking about that.

76
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.460
We can also start thinking about, well, what happens after this scenario?

77
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.300
You know, a user has gone through the checkout process and they get that nice happy screen and their

78
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.560
item has shipped.

79
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.610
Well, don't you often keep track of your orders?

80
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.270
I know I do, but we can test that assumption later.

81
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.120
Maybe there's a different navigation piece.

82
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.120
You know, we talked about a profile.

83
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.040
The profile button at the top.

84
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.670
And maybe that leads to like a user settings page or like your current orders.

85
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.880
But it doesn't seem like that is prioritized and maybe that should be prioritized.

86
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.990
So maybe we could create an order screen.

87
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.220
So if we go back up.

88
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.880
Maybe there is an order screen.

89
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.230
And let's draw that up just quickly.

90
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.150
Right here, we can start thinking about maybe you can search your existing orders.

91
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.270
I'm not sure if that's a feature we would build right away, but we want to build like that most the

92
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.130
minimum viable product, the pieces, the features that users really want right away.

93
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.190
So if we think about what you would see on an order screen, you'd probably see your products that you

94
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.420
ordered their details and maybe the status.

95
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.860
There's multiple statuses that we need to think about, and this is what I mean when we're talking about

96
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.390
the different requirements that just naturally surface when we start thinking about different components

97
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.170
on a page.

98
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.960
Right here.

99
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.980
This could be a product that has been shipped and there's like a map with a tracker that's like pulsing.

100
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.160
You start thinking about things like motion a bit.

101
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.420
Maybe over here this is a delivered one.

102
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.860
So we could start thinking that we have maybe a fourth navigation piece.

103
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.280
I would argue that, you know, your search is a part of your navigation because it's a very prominent

104
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.020
feature for a product like this.

105
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.870
Being able to search and find products is so important.

106
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:09.300
So from here, what I would naturally do is I would start kind of sketching a little bit more screens,

107
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.360
thinking about how these different screens link together.

108
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.850
I would actually start building some sort of like mini site map, so I know that home.

109
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.370
Is like my ground zero and from home.

110
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.750
If I move over, I get items.

111
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.020
The product description I can get to.

112
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.950
What else can I get to?

113
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.270
I can get to, like, a category possibly.

114
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.760
So let's write that in.

115
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.920
And you know, there's other things.

116
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.590
So this product is about personalization.

117
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.550
Maybe there's like an interesting portion about like interest.

118
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.400
Maybe that's front and center on something like product like this.

119
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.240
So maybe there's like, I don't know, a component around interest.

120
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.630
So I start thinking about these types of navigation trees.

121
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.430
We can also think about Saved as well.

122
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.020
We created a safe page.

123
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.720
So if I make a little box here for a saved and I go down.

124
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.460
I can start thinking about where saved actually leads.

125
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.740
I know I have products.

126
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:20.500
I can go to an item description page and that obviously can lead to the cart.

127
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:31.310
This isn't an entirely complex product, but it's a lot of different ways you can find certain pages

128
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.049
from Saved.

129
00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.150
I could probably go directly to a checkout.

130
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.240
That would be awesome, especially if something comes up as like on sale or like.

131
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.669
Yeah, like a flash sale.

132
00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:49.400
That would prompt a lot of people to probably just bite the bullet and buy what's in their wishlist.

133
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.000
Maybe we have other items.

134
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.730
That are relevant to them.

135
00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.230
And whatever's in their wishlist.

136
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:05.590
Maybe if they have something in relation to shoes, maybe there's another pair of shoes that we can

137
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.070
kind of push to them and hopefully they'll choose those pairs.

138
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.560
It really depends.

139
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:16.690
So we can start thinking about this navigation tree, which will definitely affect how we build out

140
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.620
our site maps.

141
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:22.080
So that's how you can take an approach at sketching navigation schemes.

142
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:27.170
It's really easy way to just kind of get that over view of your application.

143
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:31.480
I mean, we just kind of scratch the surface over here, but I urge you to kind of go back.

144
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.810
You know, you don't necessarily need to copy exactly what I did here.

145
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.720
Like I said before, use what you think is best.

146
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:43.510
Whether that's like paper, do it digitally, refine them, ask questions constantly.

147
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.750
Never stop asking questions because you'll find different roads like we did.

148
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.850
And that's navigation schemes.
