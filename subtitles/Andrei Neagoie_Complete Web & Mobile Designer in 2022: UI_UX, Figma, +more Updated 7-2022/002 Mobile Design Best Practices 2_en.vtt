00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.890
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.340
So we are here with part two of mobile design best practices.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.420
Now we're going to start off with navigation.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.450
So make your products easy to navigate.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.670
I mean, that seems simple, but I mean, that's the biggest priority of every single app is helping

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.820
users navigate everything won't matter if users don't know necessarily how to get to places where they

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.660
want to go.

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.450
So users should be able to browse your product effortlessly.

9
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.540
Well, completing all their primary tasks.

10
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.600
So here's an example.

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.440
I mean, just it's just very easy.

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.060
I know this is a home icon.

13
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.980
I know this is some sort of saved or wishlist or whatever icon search profile.

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.440
See, this is kind of like search and profile.

15
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.240
So I got a three out of four, right?

16
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.800
But I mean, making your product easy to navigate is so key.

17
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.040
Now, the first thing we want to do is, you know, think about standard navigation patterns, whether

18
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.970
that be like a navigation draw a sidebar we don't have on here, or it could be like a bottom bar.

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.500
iOS likes using bottom bars.

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.760
So that's another design pattern or a mobile design pattern that we can use.

21
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.260
You know, users are familiar with these types of patterns, so there's really no need to reinvent the

22
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.620
wheel.

23
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.360
Like you don't want to have like some sort of navigation on the right and it being like vertical or

24
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.530
something crazy like that.

25
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.460
It won't work as well.

26
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.690
And that's kind of proven.

27
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.570
The second step is we've got to think about the order, and that is where we kind of prioritize the

28
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.970
different types of options within your product.

29
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.760
So, you know, in this one, it looks like they've kind of made this much more prominent, like their

30
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.360
filters.

31
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.750
And that's a big it looks like it's a big portion of their application.

32
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.040
So they've ordered it accordingly to where your thumb may actually hit it.

33
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.480
So that's very interesting.

34
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.530
Just in terms of implementation, something I've been thinking about for our application, like maybe

35
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.810
a search can go there and it could pop up a search instead of having search always fixed at the top.

36
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.880
So that's something that I definitely think about.

37
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.980
And there it is again.

38
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.260
Consistency hits back, it's back.

39
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.640
So don't mix navigation patterns in your product you want to always stick to.

40
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.320
One is very confusing.

41
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.490
If you have something like this and then you implement some sort of draw or sidebar.

42
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.310
So stick to one and stick to one.

43
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.600
Only the next one is animations and micro interactions.

44
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.900
So these shouldn't be like an afterthought.

45
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.960
You should always be thinking about them, you know, right from the beginning of your design process,

46
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.610
you should kind of be thinking about that.

47
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.560
But also before you get to High Fidelity Designs, think about that as well.

48
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.030
Animations are kind of like that best tool to describe like state transition.

49
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.500
So as you can see here, just like just the transition really helps let users know exactly what's happening.

50
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.760
So let's take a look at another example.

51
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.540
If I'm switching pages, I can see like that state transition from right to left.

52
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.880
I can see which pages I'm going to very easily.

53
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.910
If we take a step back and we think if this were to happen instantaneously, it would be much more confusing

54
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.090
for your user, it would be much more jarring for your user.

55
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.770
So that is one big part of like using micro interactions or just using like animation in general in

56
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.370
motion.

57
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.530
You also want to just stick to the basics.

58
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.740
I mean, you don't want to overcomplicate things by adding different types of crazy gestures.

59
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.890
Over here we have like just pulls, taps sliding.

60
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.710
I mean, just the basic stuff is more than enough.

61
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.060
You know, it can be tempting to use a bunch of different available gestures, but I mean, the learning

62
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.540
curve is just way too high in most cases and most people are only really familiar with like the basic

63
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.320
ones anyways.

64
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.250
So stick to the basics when it comes to gestures and it'll make just the interactions in your application

65
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.300
much more smoother.

66
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.850
And one thing I really want you to think about is think about when the user comes to your application

67
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.340
or your product for the very first time.

68
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.770
You really want to optimize for that because you know that first time experience can really make or

69
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.890
break like just the user's understanding of your application, even just the user's feeling about your

70
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.490
product.

71
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:16.500
So it's very important to kind of emphasize how much thought really should go into that experience.

72
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.570
So if your app allows for it or your product allows for it, think about allowing your users to try

73
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.630
your app first without actually having to sign in.

74
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.310
So like they could have like an onboarding screen and then they could just like get started really quickly

75
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.500
without necessarily having to go through a sign in while, you know, mandatory registration is a common

76
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.090
source of friction for users.

77
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.280
And it's probably one of the main reasons users abandon a product and they should only really be asked

78
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.840
to sign up if it's essential.

79
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.040
So think about that.

80
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.110
Definitely when you're going through that process, even if we're thinking about our application that

81
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.630
we're building, we want to maybe delay that registration right to the end and let users actually try

82
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.760
our product first.

83
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:03.400
Also, allowing users to try your product just a bit in the beginning can kind of like get them more

84
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.610
likely to commit in the end if we gently remind them throughout the process to sign up or if the users

85
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.150
just like our application overall, it gives them more of an incentive to actually sign up when they

86
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.100
would have just been like behind a wall in the first place and maybe have deleted the application without

87
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.380
wanting to sign up or give us their information.

88
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.050
Your onboarding is so important.

89
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.670
I mean, it should be so smooth.

90
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.000
Make sure your app showcases why users should stay.

91
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.930
So I mean, whether that be like your value prop is hidden within your onboarding or just teaching users

92
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:46.330
how easy your app is to use in relation to competition, just make sure that it is a way to kind of

93
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.880
showcase why your app is so important.

94
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.730
These usually are screens that users see when they first come to your product, or it can be kind of

95
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.990
contextually based.

96
00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.100
If there's like an empty state in your product, there could be a chance to onboard users to a feature

97
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.570
that they have never used before.

98
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.940
So I mean, like whether that be like a drag and drop that's been introduced for the first time, we

99
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.560
can have something that is based just within the app when the users first interact with it.

100
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:19.180
Also, I think it's really important to kind of create that illusion that your product is really fast.

101
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.570
I mean, loading time is extremely important for mobile users.

102
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.850
If pages take too long to load, users may become really frustrated and maybe decide to leave.

103
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.260
That's a big possibility.

104
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.090
So we want to make it clear that something is loading and the product is loading data.

105
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.550
It's not just a blank or static screen that runs the risk that users think that something's frozen.

106
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.980
So many people have animations and you saw one in the beginning with like pulling down and something

107
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.060
was happening up top and that's really pleasant and it gives the user something interesting to look

108
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.960
at in the meantime.

109
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.200
But then we have something like this where they're like kind of like skeleton screens.

110
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:59.050
And I like using these because they kind of display a blank slate of the screen that is gradually loading

111
00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.830
content.

112
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:05.020
So unlike a loading spinner, the skeleton screen shows progress that the content on their screen is

113
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.100
actually loading.

114
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.140
So this is a really good pattern to use when you're kind of loading results or something like that and

115
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.640
they don't load right away.

116
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.670
And the last best practice would be that this is mobile, not desktop.

117
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.880
Please remember that and we need to optimize for that.

118
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.390
So we need to make sure our content is readable and legible.

119
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:30.640
You know, we need to optimize for that smaller screen that could be like font sizes.

120
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.750
Generally, anything below 14 pixels is going to be a little hard to read on mobile.

121
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.790
It could even be like font family.

122
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.230
You may need a clear and easy font to read, so that's just something that we need to think about as

123
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.800
well.

124
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.810
If you need to switch it up, there's also contrast, so make sure there is plenty of contrast.

125
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.470
Between foreground and background colors.

126
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.340
When it comes to typography, even a light gray may look okay.

127
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:58.080
We need to make sure that it's actually accessible, and we also need to limit the amount of characters

128
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.870
on one line because it could be hard to read too many characters, especially if it's a size 12 pixel

129
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.470
font.

130
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:09.690
Just having it run right across could be a little harder to read or even smaller than that.

131
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:15.600
And remember, we're designing for fingers and not cursors like the one I'm using a point right now.

132
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.400
It's easy to hit a small button with a cursor, but can you imagine trying to tap that with your thumb

133
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.000
over here?

134
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.080
They've done a great job of making things really accessible with larger buttons, larger cards, just

135
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.260
making touch areas easily accessible and more spaced out.

136
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:36.150
Like over here on this map, when designing for those actionable elements on a mobile product, your

137
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.510
targets need to be larger so they're just easier to hit.

138
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.070
You know, mistakes do happen and often because of small UI elements.

139
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.990
I've definitely made that mistake in the past.

140
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.790
You know, having the right amount of space between elements like this may be a little tight, but having

141
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.570
the right amount of space can really make a big difference if there are too close.

142
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.830
I mean, you kind of run the risk of somebody tapping things like think about if you have like a console

143
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.720
in a safe right beside each other.

144
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.820
I mean, that could be very problematic.

145
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.510
And sure, a lot of people have already seen these screens before.

146
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.360
I mean, there are a bunch of different variations of them.

147
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:15.630
And this is just essentially reminding us that there are thumb zones and we should do our best to keep

148
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.970
our primary actions in the green.

149
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.920
We don't want to have them up here.

150
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.350
If this is your left hand, this is what it would look like.

151
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.930
If this is combined, you have much more reach.

152
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.130
In terms of if you're using two hands and usually a lot of users with larger phones, we'll figure out

153
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:37.790
a way to reach that top area and whether that be with two hands or kind of like maneuvering around with

154
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.590
their hand, they could find a way to do it by means keeping your primary actions within the green.

155
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.900
Just much more success you'll have.

156
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.230
We need to consider like how we hold their devices.

157
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.860
So be very understanding how the users will hold them.

158
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.240
But when we do hold them in one hand, like I mentioned before, we don't have much reach.

159
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.690
So these green zones are essentially kind of like your safe zones, and you can strategically make sure

160
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:09.140
that all the elements you want users to actually use, like your primary actions, are within that thumb

161
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:09.740
reach.

162
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.680
Now, the red zone or yellow zones, those are kind of like your red zones or whatever you want to call

163
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.780
them, but those are the harder zones to reach.

164
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:24.230
And this is probably best suited for keeping like options that you want users to trigger less frequently,

165
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.510
you know, like a delete or a cancel.

166
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.280
So maybe think about that.

167
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.720
I know a lot of like iOS devices, especially in the design system, they kind of keep like they're

168
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.610
cancel or delete up there and their primary actions may be closer to the bottom as well.

169
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.420
So just think about that when you're designing.

170
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:45.170
That's why sometimes I like to use as a bottom toolbar for navigation if users are going to be navigating

171
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.430
between screens a lot.

172
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:51.350
That's also why I was thinking about using like a search at the bottom instead of keeping it at the

173
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.890
top.

174
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:58.940
So remember to stay in the green and that is the last thing I have for everyone.

175
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.770
Those are the practices that I follow in terms of the best practices for mobile design.

176
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:09.740
And if you follow those as well, I'm sure you're going to be able to design great mobile experiences.
