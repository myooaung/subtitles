1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:07,730
So you may find that you want to create different components based off of the changes you made to an

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,540
instance.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,100
And that's totally possible within Figma.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,860
That's why it's so powerful.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,660
So I call them themed instances or variants, essentially.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,120
How you use them is that they're a way to kind of manage component states and variations.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,960
They are created by taking an instance of that component like we did here.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:34,490
So this is the instance of this original component, which also includes these atomic components, and

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,330
you can essentially create a component based off of that.

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,430
So if I want to take this, we have another instance over here.

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,060
Now, this could be like a basic component with text.

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,430
We can obviously hide this.

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,290
So this is an instance.

14
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:05,190
You can just call this label again, since this is going to be a new component and this this can be

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:12,510
hidden and now say, I want to have an input, a component for inputs with icons just on the right side.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,390
If I feel like I'm going to have a lot of this within my app, I may consider doing this.

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,910
It's also just good to have.

18
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,950
So let's have a close button, which seems a little bit more generalized.

19
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:32,450
And what we can do here is we can just option command B to detach that original component so it won't

20
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,950
be updated by this anymore.

21
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,520
And we can rename it to Form Fields.

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,330
We can call it Icon, right?

23
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,850
And if I do option command K now that's a component.

24
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,170
So we can rename this one to form field default.

25
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,920
You can keep on doing this as much as you want.

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,680
Like I can edit this still and these will both be edited, so I'll show you what that looks like.

27
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,170
You notice how the border radius is changing?

28
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,910
If I want to edit the fill, it's still the same.

29
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:18,200
So if you want, like you can totally create different instances based off of the original that you

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,010
created.

31
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,090
You can even go ahead and create a like another component like this.

32
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:31,540
So I can call this default and I can do something like change the stroke.

33
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,390
So I'm going to select the input field.

34
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,050
And I'm going to change the stroke to like a red.

35
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,780
Bump that opacity up.

36
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,630
Ooh, that's really harsh.

37
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,260
Okay.

38
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:54,500
So I can do that and I can do option command B to just detach it from the master component.

39
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,500
Another way to do that is let me just do a command Z to show you.

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,640
You can right click and you can detach the instance right there.

41
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,050
So I'm going to detach that and I'm going to give it a new name.

42
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,660
I'm going to call it.

43
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,900
We're can just say error and we can do option command k and there you go.

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,150
We have our own error component.

45
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,710
So it's just an easy way that you can kind of take that, duplicate it to make an instance.

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,860
Another great way to use these is by going into your assets.

47
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,080
So I have a bunch of components there.

48
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,020
Over here is our building our own components section.

49
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,040
And you'll notice this is our page master components.

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,190
Look at that.

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,570
You see our atomic elements at the top.

52
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,670
We see our elements over here that are kind of like our basic default.

53
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,790
And if we go one layer deeper, let me just stretch this out.

54
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,210
If we stretch this out, we see our form field.

55
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,160
It follows the same kind of naming convention.

56
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,750
When you're creating styles, if you use a slash, it's going to create another kind of layer, like

57
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,410
a folder.

58
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,000
So we have our default air and we have just our regular form field.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,100
Go ahead, go out there, make some components and try like duplicating them, detaching that instance,

60
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,760
creating a new version of that and creating the new component.

61
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,279
Because this is like one of the easiest ways to work with components within Figma.

62
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:23,240
I mean, it's really speeds up my workflow and especially when you come across like going out and creating

63
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,750
like a design system or just creating a bunch of components to make your life easier, especially designing

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:36,710
at any level, whether that be wire framing or whether that be like visual design and gradually creating

65
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,450
more higher fidelity mockups.

66
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,340
This is going to help you.

67
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,640
You can easily edit the styles which could reflect in here if you're using color styles and typography

68
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,140
styles, and if you edit these like atomic elements, they will edit your components.

69
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:58,190
And if you edit your components, those instances, everything is so connected and easy to update.

70
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,590
Go ahead, go out there and create your own components and those instances of host components.
