00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,880
Pew.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,660
Can you believe you've made it this far?

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,970
I mean, at the beginning of this, you probably had no idea what any of this means.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,260
And now look at you.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,530
You know what every single line means?

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,110
And you know what?

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,880
This is pretty much it for HTML.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,480
It's not very hard.

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,700
You just have to remember a few tags and it's very easy to test around and play.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,560
So call yourself an HTML developer.

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,759
I have a fun little game for you.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,760
As you can see over here, we've created a simple web page where I can link to another page.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,590
I can go back, I can even click on register and submit a form.

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,450
I want you to try your hand at building your own little website here.

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:56,720
And once you're done, I'll provide the link to my email and the description below.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,980
Send me your first website and I'll showcase some of my favorite ones in an upcoming video.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,570
I'll see you in the next one.

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,440
Bye bye.
