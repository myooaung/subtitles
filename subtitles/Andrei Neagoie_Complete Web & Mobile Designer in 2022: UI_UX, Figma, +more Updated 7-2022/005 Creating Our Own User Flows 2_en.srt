1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,330
Let's jump right back into creating some more user flows.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,530
So we left off at registering within our product.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,059
I think the next user flow we should probably think about is maybe finding a product something a little

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,160
bit more interesting, not necessarily more interesting, but possibly cause a little bit of risk.

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,320
So what I'm going to do is just delete this.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,210
I'm going to rename this to Searching for a Product.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,820
Searching for a product.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:35,910
Okay.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,060
So there's multiple ways to find products within our application.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,630
We've already kind of understand that let's start creating user flows for each type.

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:54,210
The one that we're going to focus on right now at least is finding the right product through search.

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,690
Okay.

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,790
So let's get right into this.

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,650
Let's just start fresh.

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,950
We have our first step, obviously not this step, but we'll work on that.

16
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:15,080
So step one, when I'm starting to search at the home screen, so I probably need an input.

17
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,900
There's probably a bunch of stuff here.

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,790
Maybe there's like a headline, some large products.

19
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,910
You know, we kind of made this before.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,730
Maybe we should have saved that as a component of its own.

21
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,650
But so we have some small products, I mean.

22
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,730
If we were to try to create a flow for finding a product, we could probably find one through this route,

23
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,100
whether it's like a small product or a large product.

24
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,770
And those flows will be different from the one we're creating.

25
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,880
So let's focus on just search.

26
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,670
Actually, you know what I like to highlight that?

27
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,110
Make it look like a CTA.

28
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,170
And that's another thing you can do with user flows.

29
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,200
You can distinguish based off of color and stuff like that.

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,360
We can do that with our search over here.

31
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:12,900
Step one, the user is able to begin their search from the home screen.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,350
I called it the welcome screen, but it's actually the home screen.

33
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,930
The user is able to begin their search from the home screen and that's basically it.

34
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,640
So that's step one.

35
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,960
Let's just copy that.

36
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,620
Over.

37
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,930
Step two.

38
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,240
Now what should step to be?

39
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,350
So, like I said before, we can actually start creating.

40
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,910
Like this actually applies here as well.

41
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,990
So we'll know that we'll need to create another flow for.

42
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,170
Selecting a product directly.

43
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:54,190
So sometimes I'll leave a little note here and just say these step 2.1 or something like that.

44
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:08,110
The user is also able to find the right product if it shows up on the home screen.

45
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,210
So we can actually create a flow for that if we want to afterwards.

46
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,520
Now, I know that it's just there as a reminder.

47
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:22,540
So the user is able to begin their search from the home screen and what happens next?

48
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,940
So the next step, let's just copy that over.

49
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,290
Perfect.

50
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,340
Step two, actually, let's just finish this off just a little bit.

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,990
The user can click the search input.

52
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,560
So once they've clicked the input.

53
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:53,300
There is something here that happens and that should probably be them entering their search.

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,250
So what can we signify as that?

55
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,880
And we can just say this is like a keyboard.

56
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:16,339
So the user receives a keyboard prompt within a search overlay and is able to enter their search.

57
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,130
Perfect.

58
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,269
So that's step two.

59
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,490
Now they have a prompt.

60
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,070
They're able to enter their search.

61
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,150
Now when we were sketching and we started thinking about things like type ahead a bit so we can actually

62
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,200
highlight that here.

63
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,800
Let's take that.

64
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,220
We can use this as like our type of head results.

65
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,640
So another figma tip.

66
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:54,000
If I'm going to press command shift and duplicate that, I can actually let it go and then Press Command

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,740
to duplicate the exact same thing I just did so I can create multiples.

68
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,260
Now I'm just going to change this as the same color.

69
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,050
I'm going to signify that these are actually the suggested results.

70
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,120
So step three.

71
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,940
As the user types.

72
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:28,220
The product gives the user suggestions of potential searches.

73
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:42,200
The user clicks on the search item that relates most to their intended.

74
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,960
Church.

75
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:52,910
So essentially what's happening here is the user is actually clicking on here as they are typing, they're

76
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,940
getting suggested results and the user can actually just not click one of these, but they can just

77
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,980
keep on going and click enter whatever that CTA is within the keyboard.

78
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,840
But we're just going to highlight that they can actually click through a suggested result.

79
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,870
So step four, let's jump right into that.

80
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,250
So step four.

81
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,710
What do they say now?

82
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,350
Well, what do you think they see?

83
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,580
Let's just remove some of that.

84
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,000
So they probably still have their search at the top.

85
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,550
I'm just going to continue to use this.

86
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,710
And modify it from here on out.

87
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,830
I'll use this as well to modify this as well.

88
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:57,110
What I can do here is go back to the master component and make this a bit more scalable.

89
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,510
Fix the constraints there to make it left and right.

90
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,570
So when I do adjust that frame, it's going to adjust with it.

91
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,120
So we can play around with that.

92
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,550
So let's go back down.

93
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,330
Or here we are.

94
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,000
So let's fix that.

95
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,810
So those are search results.

96
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,020
So these are the search results.

97
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,850
So this is step four.

98
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:42,620
The user is presented with many search results and now they choose the product that they have been looking

99
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,370
for.

100
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,370
So another interesting thing here is I'm just going to highlight these really quickly.

101
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,310
So let's just highlight those.

102
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,890
Just so we can signify that this is being clicked.

103
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,090
Like I said, I mean, there's no really right way of doing this.

104
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,620
As long as you're explaining this really clearly to your audience, they're going to get it.

105
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,740
Just make sure to use what I've told you in terms of like a very clear title, clear direction and clear

106
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,530
details, and the rest will just kind of follow.

107
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,570
But one thing I'm noticing here is that, you know, we spoke a little bit what the make up of this

108
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,500
page could be.

109
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:29,170
And I'm just going to create like a little button in there.

110
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,780
You know, maybe I'm thinking that, oh, wow.

111
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,850
Like there is a filter here.

112
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,770
And now we have to think about a filter flow.

113
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:42,490
So as we go through individual flows that we're trying to solve for, we're going to find a bunch more

114
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,200
that we're going to have to solve for.

115
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:49,150
So this is the great thing about user flows and keeping them separate because they really breaks things

116
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:54,250
apart in a way, even though there are many to actually create and work through.

117
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,630
It really helps us kind of make it much more manageable and understandable.

118
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,910
So what I've done here is I've just highlighted the search results, so that's just going to indicate

119
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,610
that a user is clicking through their.

120
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,140
Perfect.

121
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:09,850
Wow.

122
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,020
We are on step five.

123
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,170
So what happens on step five?

124
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,660
So they've clicked the search result and now they've found what they've been looking for and that is

125
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,560
the product.

126
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,020
So we're just going to kind of end this here.

127
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,460
Let's just steal that again.

128
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,920
So honestly at this point, like don't waste your time going crazy in terms of visual design or anything

129
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,600
like that.

130
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,290
We really just want to get into like it's the same concept as sketching.

131
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:46,170
We just want to keep on generating ideas and we want to work through these and refine the details later.

132
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,280
It's really easy to get bogged down by all that kind of stuff.

133
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,550
So we have a CTA at the bottom, you know, like purchase this product or add it to your cart.

134
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,650
We have probably like a headline.

135
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,210
We have some text.

136
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:03,700
Okay.

137
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,410
Maybe there's like similar products or options here.

138
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,130
So we've kind of created some sort of wireframe.

139
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,240
Very easily.

140
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,940
Took 2 seconds just using some of the components that we built.

141
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,300
And we can even create a larger component library if we wanted to.

142
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:25,140
But for the sake of moving with speed, being a little lean, this is super easy just to do if you're

143
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,910
just quickly jumping into something.

144
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,130
If you do this often and sometimes you will, maybe it's great to create your own kit.

145
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:47,730
So step five the user is now able to review the product that they had searched for and can decide if

146
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,700
they want to add the item to their cart.

147
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,690
Perfect.

148
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,670
So now I know that after this there's going to be another flow 100%, and we're going to tackle that

149
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,270
soon.

150
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,770
But this is our flow.

151
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:07,620
So finding the right product through search step one, the user is able to begin their search from the

152
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,610
home screen.

153
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,870
There's our search bar.

154
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,670
We do know that users can find a product elsewhere, so we'll probably create another flow for that.

155
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:23,280
Step two is this user gets an overlay here with the keyboard and search they can enter their.

156
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:24,750
Details.

157
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,750
And when they do that, they get suggested results.

158
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:34,250
Here they have the option of actually just clicking the button and going to the search results page.

159
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,450
It just based off of their search or they can use one of their suggested results that we've given them

160
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,970
to push them to the search results page.

161
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,690
So that's what the user does here.

162
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:49,680
The user actually clicks this button here, and we can define that interaction a little bit more later.

163
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,380
And now they see a list of search results.

164
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:58,680
And over here, what they're going to do is they're able to click on a search result and move to the

165
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,890
next screen.

166
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,330
Next step in our flow, which is the product description page.

167
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,900
We also do know that we probably need to make another flow for what happens if they don't find their

168
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,380
product.

169
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,730
What happens if they decide to filter?

170
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,720
I mean, there are so many different scenarios just loaded in this one screen, and that's what I mean

171
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,880
when we have to start asking ourselves some questions in terms of like, well, what is going to happen

172
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,110
here?

173
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,520
What happens if something doesn't go right?

174
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:32,100
We often always design for the happy scenario, and that's totally fine because we do need to design

175
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,790
for that scenario.

176
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,820
But oftentimes that doesn't happen.

177
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,960
So we need to make sure that the unhappy scenario is just as pleasant.

178
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:47,280
So what happens here is they click on the search result and now they're right into our product description

179
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,850
page.

180
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,220
And from here they would probably either add the item to the cart, they can actually add it to their

181
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,850
wish list.

182
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,730
So that's another scenario that we need to think about, a flow that we need to actually build out.

183
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,110
And yeah, that's it.

184
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:08,010
So this is our flow for finding the right product through search.

185
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,450
Great job, everyone.
