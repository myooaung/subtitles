00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.570
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.990
In this video, we're going to be talking about CSS three.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:15.770
Now, just like with HTML and HTML five, CSS is a standard that constantly evolves to adapt to new

4
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.390
demands of websites.

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.760
So CSS3 is the latest evolution of CSS, where we've added new properties and new features so that we

6
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.220
can make our design even better.

7
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.790
So if you remember in our diagram over here, all of these browsers have different developers, different

8
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.230
teams that work on implementing their features.

9
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:50.990
Now, in an ideal world, everybody agrees on what CSS does and when new features and new properties

10
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.220
are added, everybody implements them at the same time.

11
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.510
But that's simply not the case.

12
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.730
Some browsers might work with some property, some might not, because they haven't gotten around to

13
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.780
making it work.

14
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.900
So let's go back to our website.

15
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.540
Now let's play with one of my favorite CSS3 properties.

16
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.450
How cool would it be if when we hover over these pictures, the picture moves?

17
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.390
Well, with CSS3, they've introduced something called transition.

18
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:36.280
And if I do all 1/2 and I'll explain what that does in 1/2 image hover.

19
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.290
So this should be familiar where when we hover, we want the image to transform.

20
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.210
This is a new property as well.

21
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.550
And we'll say scale.

22
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.470
1.1.

23
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.070
So let's see what happens.

24
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.020
I refresh.

25
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.360
Look at that.

26
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.350
My images are now moving on hover.

27
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.400
Isn't that cool?

28
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.510
What these properties do is say that I want the image to transition when an action is taken upon it

29
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.620
and I want all the properties to transition over 1/2.

30
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.810
And what's that transition going to be?

31
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.710
Well, when I hover, I want it to transform.

32
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.390
By a scale of 1.1.

33
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.340
So it's essentially growing.

34
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:31.190
If I change this to 4 seconds and I refresh, well, now it takes 4 seconds for the image to scale.

35
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.320
You can see over here, I'm going to change this back to 1/2 just because it looks better that way.

36
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.810
If I make this website full screen, you see that we now have a beautiful effect for our image gallery.

37
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.720
And there's there's also another property called animation, which you can look at on your own.

38
00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.700
But again, CSS3 has brought in a lot of these new properties to make websites even more dynamic than

39
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.390
they are now.

40
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:10.970
But there is a little caveat to using such properties, and that is you want to make sure that each

41
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.810
browser has implemented a new feature.

42
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.730
So if I go to one of our favorite websites, w three schools, they have a CSS browser support reference.

43
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.510
And here you can look at all the CSS to make sure that browsers support whatever property you want to

44
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.050
use.

45
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.790
So if we go to transition, we see that it is supported by all latest browsers.

46
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:45.710
But you also see that if we go to something like user select, they have this MZ moss web kit line over

47
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:52.460
it and if we scroll all the way down, it'll show you that it is supported by Internet Explorer with

48
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.670
Prefix MZ.

49
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.710
What does that mean?

50
00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.290
Well, these are browser prefixes and you'll see them every once in a while.

51
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:09.040
What it is, is these are new features of CCSS that haven't fully been implemented by the browsers and

52
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.360
you want to use a prefix to make sure that they work as an experimental feature in the browser.

53
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.070
Let me explain what that means.

54
00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.870
If I wanted to add a let's say a box shadow.

55
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.190
So that means kind of making this look 3D and having a shadow underneath the edge over here.

56
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:37.090
Previously I had to do something like this where I put Box Shadow and you can read into the property

57
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.290
to see what I'm about to do.

58
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:45.250
But I'm going to do four pixels, four pixels, five pixels, and then the color, which is a bit of

59
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.910
a gray.

60
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.280
So if I do this and refresh, well that looks nice.

61
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.840
And my browser is the new chrome, so it has this feature.

62
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.860
But a few years ago when Box Shadow was first introduced, you had to do something like this.

63
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:04.760
Box.

64
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.280
Shadow.

65
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.230
And then.

66
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.980
Copy and paste this and this makes sure that it works on the Mozilla browser.

67
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.230
And then you also had MMS.

68
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.790
Which makes sure that it works on Internet Explorer.

69
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.380
You had.

70
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.270
Web kit, which makes sure that it works on Safari and Chrome.

71
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.430
And then finally, you also had.

72
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.450
Oh.

73
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.470
Which made it work on the opera browser.

74
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.430
And then you also had to still mention the shadow without the prefixes at the bottom.

75
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:55.520
So now if any of these browsers don't support Box Shadow, well, they have these prefixes so that it

76
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.270
should work.

77
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.920
And Bug Shadow, it has been some time now, so you don't need to do this anymore.

78
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:08.450
But there is one great way of seeing if a certain property still needs browser prefixes, and that is

79
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.730
using something like this, which I will leave for you so you can check it out.

80
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.700
Another thing I wanted to show you is can I use.

81
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:25.140
So can I use dot com is a great resource to see anything that you might want to try out.

82
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.440
So if I type in here.

83
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:35.950
CSS transition, you'll see CSS3 transitions are supported in all these browsers except we have one

84
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:44.140
opera mini and it says it's 2.63% of the global usage.

85
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:52.870
So if you use CSS three transitions, 2.63% of the population might not be able to see it.

86
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.270
Now, whether that is your user base or not, you can kind of decide what the trade offs are.

87
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.640
But this is a great thing to use.

88
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:07.780
And if we use something like Flexbox, well, we see that Flexbox has all support.

89
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.560
So it should it shouldn't be a problem for you to use it.

90
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:13.310
Okay.

91
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.290
Let's go back to this and just finish up this website to make it look nice.

92
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.730
So I don't like that there's space here.

93
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.460
Ideally, this is all the way to the left, if I do.

94
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.860
Margin.

95
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:37.460
Zero pixels and I refresh that actually doesn't change much because sometimes browsers have their own

96
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.990
default margins.

97
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.930
So the way to get around it is to.

98
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.090
Do margin zero for the body.

99
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.170
So margin.

100
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.120
Zero pixels.

101
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.500
Let's save and refresh.

102
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.970
Perfect.

103
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:57.740
Now we have this all the way to the left, but we do want a bit of a buffer at the top.

104
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.420
So I'm going to add margin top.

105
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.270
And we'll do ten pixels, save and refresh.

106
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.760
Perfect.

107
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:14.070
Now we have a beautiful website and it didn't really take us much.

108
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.720
We just wrote a few lines of CSS, a few lines of HTML.

109
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.770
And look what we have.

110
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.690
I'll see you in the next one.

111
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:24.200
Bye bye.
