1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,050
Hey, everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:10,560
So what I want to do is I want to start creating some screens for our product, which is habitual.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,210
So we went through the process of like sketching some ideas out.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,630
We also started sketching like user flows.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,430
We started like way back when we were sketching, we were thinking already about let's find it some

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,120
navigation trees and how certain things are connected.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,150
And I really want to start thinking about our homepage in much more detail.

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,400
So this is our homepage.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,900
We're definitely going to have a search.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,650
We're going to have something around, like shopping interests and habits.

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:46,830
Republicans have a place for them to get to categories, maybe deals we have like a navigation, which

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,230
is like wishlist orders profile.

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,670
We have the cart as well and we have a way to log in or sign up.

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,000
So let's jump right in and start thinking about what this could look like.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
So I'm going to just create a frame.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:10,140
I'm going to press F and I'm going to just select that and I'm going to call this home page perfect.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,870
So the easiest way to start is like, let's take a look at our sketches and where we kind of left off.

18
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,110
So for our home page, we can tell like we were thinking about like having some text at the top and

19
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,350
be like a profile.

20
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,280
We can see like we could start thinking about the navigation as well.

21
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,500
We have some images there.

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,180
Those are some rough sketches.

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,590
So we do know that we were thinking about a search there.

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,920
I know at some point we were thinking also.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,470
About search in the navigation.

26
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,590
I don't know where that is.

27
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,170
I think it's here somewhere.

28
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,850
Anyways, we start thinking much more in terms of screen states.

29
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,740
So we have like a save icon.

30
00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:00,970
We have the name, we have price, maybe some categories, possibly looks like alternate funnels.

31
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,140
They can get into these maybe categories, maybe interests, other things.

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,600
Okay, so this definitely gives us a lot to work with and I'm going to start building based off of my

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,640
sketches like we don't need to match them directly, but I think they'll allow us to have a good starting

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,420
off point.

35
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,200
So.

36
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,070
Let's get started.

37
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,590
So the first thing I'd like to do with my sketches and my wireframes is start building out some of the

38
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,790
most basic things, like navigations and stuff like that.

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,040
So I'm actually just going to go to my assets tab.

40
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,480
I'm going to go up to UI elements and let's see where it is, navigation and containers.

41
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,630
And just like that, we have like a navigation bar.

42
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,220
So I think we should kind of start thinking a little differently.

43
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,910
Maybe let's go to our assets and icon social.

44
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,930
That's okay.

45
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,860
Let's just replace that nicely.

46
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,270
So we've got icons, we have social, heart filled.

47
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,870
Perfect.

48
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,410
There we go.

49
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,010
Easy.

50
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,530
Let's think about profile.

51
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,120
I know we said like we could have orders down here and that's very possible.

52
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,370
I was thinking about that, but we should probably test some different options as well.

53
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,910
We shouldn't necessarily just like stick.

54
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,730
To just one.

55
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,290
There's a count.

56
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,580
That was a good guess.

57
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,270
And icons.

58
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:32,600
Uh.

59
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,930
What else do we have here?

60
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,250
Shopping, maybe.

61
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:35,910
Yeah.

62
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,480
Cart.

63
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,380
There you go.

64
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,250
Okay, cool.

65
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,150
So there you go.

66
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,060
We have our very own navigation, and we can just like.

67
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,510
Just to show that we are on the home page.

68
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,780
Okay.

69
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,020
And what I want to start doing is actually.

70
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,360
Let's see.

71
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,840
We got here.

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,950
We got a search.

73
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,850
There we go.

74
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,710
So we have our search up here.

75
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,170
Third is good.

76
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:27,210
And I think we should probably have some text, so we could just start typing some text in here.

77
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,120
So we have like maybe like a big hello.

78
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,480
You know, some apps are really, really inviting like that and I kind of like that.

79
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,630
I mean, I think we should kind of test our messaging as well so we can go into here in our font styles.

80
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,640
Let's see how big some of these are.

81
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,880
Ooh, that's way too big.

82
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,190
So let's just go down here.

83
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,360
I think that's fine.

84
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,650
Perfect.

85
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,430
Let's zoom in.

86
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,190
Okay.

87
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,050
So I'm going to grab some more and I'm just going to write.

88
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,260
We have some recommendations.

89
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,220
Oops.

90
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,480
For you.

91
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,910
Okay.

92
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:20,920
So that's just going to trail off and we're just going to have to bring that in and let's set that to

93
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,410
like 16 regular.

94
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:26,900
Okay.

95
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,670
That's going to work for now.

96
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,590
So we're starting to build out a bit here.

97
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,550
Like I said, it's kind of like sketching, too.

98
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,100
I mean, we're being a little bit more thoughtful about the type of content we have.

99
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,840
We're also thinking much more about, like, the hierarchy of the information.

100
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,580
So I know that I really want search to be prominent in some way.

101
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,370
So for now, I'm going to bring it up here and see how it performs when I test it with users.

102
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,270
I'm also going to just hierarchy in terms of our copy as well.

103
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,820
It's just like a big hello, like a welcome and then some recommendations.

104
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:13,760
Maybe this could lead into some images or like some interest based stuff just for you.

105
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,340
I can bring that in just a little bit.

106
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,070
So just auto with brings it right to the width of the content.

107
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,120
I like using that.

108
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,020
Okay.

109
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,470
So we got a size 16.

110
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,670
We can do regular.

111
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,050
Let's do size 16.

112
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,830
Bold.

113
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,710
And right now, look, I'm not thinking too much about style.

114
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,210
I just want to kind of get everything on the page.

115
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,250
Then we'll refine.

116
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,030
Design has a very iterative process, and you're not going to get everything right in the first go.

117
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,990
100%.

118
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,630
I will bet on that.

119
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,020
And that's okay.

120
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:05,870
I mean, it's all about just like learning, building, learning, building and learning over and over

121
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,880
until you get it right.

122
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,960
And you're definitely not going to get it right on the first try.

123
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,000
And that's okay.

124
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,860
So what do we got here?

125
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,030
Content?

126
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,710
No, we don't need that.

127
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,770
Menus.

128
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,270
Menu's option.

129
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,690
Menus.

130
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,290
Chips.

131
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,180
Maybe we'll switch up image.

132
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,800
Perfect.

133
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,760
Look at that.

134
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,430
So we have an image placeholder.

135
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,530
You know, we actually may want to bring in a grid here, so I'm going to bring in a grid because it's

136
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,810
going to help me lay things out a bit more.

137
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,700
So what have we got here?

138
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,460
We got six.

139
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,960
Bring it to eight.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,330
The margin can be 24.

141
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,040
The gutter can be 24.

142
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,740
And don't worry, we are going to learn all about grids and how awesome they are.

143
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,270
But they're going to really help us.

144
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,070
To determine how we kind of lay things out.

145
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,050
Perfect.

146
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,030
Okay.

147
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,550
Okay.

148
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,360
There you go.

149
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,550
So we may have, like, a larger image.

150
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,540
I was thinking.

151
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,360
Hmm.

152
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,480
Something like that.

153
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,400
I like just hitting them with something really nice right away.

154
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,080
To toggle your grids.

155
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,409
If you're using them right away, we will get into it at a later lesson.

156
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,059
But Control G.

157
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Is really your friend here.

158
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,760
So control g just to hide and show.

159
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,920
Okay.

160
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,340
So we're just going to duplicate that.

161
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:56,630
And so when I'm thinking about the type of content I'm going to need for each product image, I'm thinking

162
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,460
about like the product name.

163
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,850
We don't need that to be bold.

164
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,150
It could just be like regular 16 pixels.

165
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,830
I'm also thinking about price.

166
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,690
So we could just write like $25.

167
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,690
Maybe this is bold.

168
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,030
I know people like to read a name first, but price is like one of the bigger motivators.

169
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,640
So we can do like a size 16 bold.

170
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,930
And like, you can tell, like, I'm whipping through this pretty quickly.

171
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,300
And maybe we have.

172
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,310
Some information.

173
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,270
I like that.

174
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,080
Okay.

175
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,800
So we got a size of 14 regular plug ins.

176
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,540
I like to use Lorem ipsum.

177
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,130
It's just a plug in.

178
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,600
It's really great.

179
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,000
One sentence is probably more than enough.

180
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,860
So one sentence, maybe we'll bring that down to 12 pixels because that's taking up a lot of screen

181
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,590
real estate.

182
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,140
Let's bring that down.

183
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,620
Okay.

184
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,440
So.

185
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,090
Let's just space things out just a little better.

186
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:20,160
So we got something here, and I'm just going to call this large product.

187
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,900
Large product card.

188
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,050
So now we definitely have.

189
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,420
We have to you'll notice that that just kind of sticks on that grid, which is great.

190
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,960
And it's using a base unit of eight pixels.

191
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,060
So it's just going to move in increments of eight.

192
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,210
We'll get into the reasoning for that.

193
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,590
But nice.

194
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,240
That looks really clean.

195
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,940
What else should we have here?

196
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,350
We should definitely have categories as well.

197
00:10:55,090 --> 00:11:00,400
Let's think about those deals and categories.

198
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,230
So deals are pretty big.

199
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,980
Oops, I actually forgot something.

200
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,840
Let's think about.

201
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,830
We also wanted like a heart.

202
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,640
So let's just bring that.

203
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,700
I'm going to search for heart icon.

204
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,840
Perfect and.

205
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,370
Let's just make that white.

206
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,420
Huh?

207
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:38,880
And like I said, I mean, use something to make your work flow much more quicker, much more easier.

208
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,740
I mean, we're not worried about being perfect right now.

209
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,540
We're just worried about making sure we can get these designs kind of done, get them into a place where

210
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,040
we can start testing with them.

211
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,830
Because you will most likely throw these designs out.

212
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,020
It's just the nature.

213
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,930
Of designing wireframes.

214
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,640
Okay, that's good enough.

215
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,630
Cool.

216
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,150
So we have the product image, and as you can tell, we have like the name, we have the amounts.

217
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,920
We can just duplicate this here.

218
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,540
We're going to fix this to the bottom.

219
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,380
And we're going to brag this over.

220
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,960
And yeah, so we can start thinking more about just the type of content we'll have for maybe smaller

221
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,160
images as well.

222
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,460
Make sure that's inside.

223
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,750
Okay, cool.

224
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,160
I want to start thinking about smaller images to.

225
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,850
So if I turn on my grid again, it's going to help me figure out what is the perfect size.

226
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,740
So yes, it's definitely going to have a product name.

227
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,890
We're going to group this and you can actually start creating your own little components here, your

228
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,480
reusable patterns.

229
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,260
So I'll make this a small product card.

230
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,960
And just to speed up your workflow if you plan to use these throughout your entire app.

231
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,290
So we got that.

232
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,480
You can even bring that in just a bit.

233
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,130
Cool.

234
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:20,590
There we go.

235
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,650
So, like, we already have, like, deals laid out.

236
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,560
And what else is next?

237
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,880
And next, I do want to have something different.

238
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,800
I want to have categories.

239
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:39,890
Okay.

240
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,030
So what we're going to do is we're just going to grab assets over here.

241
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,090
Grab a card.

242
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,290
Cool.

243
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:59,150
And I like the idea of letting them kind of fall a bit off of the page and like letting the user scroll

244
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,080
horizontally.

245
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,350
So we can definitely do that.

246
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,110
We can definitely prototype with that.

247
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,290
Okay.

248
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,960
You just call this, like, tech or something.

249
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,340
Okay.

250
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,590
Let's do, like, a size 14 bolt.

251
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,240
Perfect.

252
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,850
When you're creating these wireframes, remember, just constantly reference your notes, reference

253
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,510
your sketches, your user flows.

254
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,050
I mean, you shouldn't be going into like something like this blind.

255
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,590
And I think that's like that's a good starting point, 100%.

256
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,900
I mean, that's definitely enough to kind of get us testing.

257
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,470
We have a categories here.

258
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,400
We have our A navigation that we can use.

259
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,660
We definitely have like deals and we do have something around like our interests and stuff like that.

260
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,510
But I do think we're going to need to improve on this.

261
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:12,780
Like maybe this can stay, but maybe down here, you know, maybe deals is deprioritized or it's not.

262
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,510
To who?

263
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:14,960
Hi.

264
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,850
In terms of like the order of hierarchy.

265
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,740
So, you know, there's different things we're definitely going to figure out while we test.

266
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:29,810
And you shouldn't necessarily just design once and be okay with it, validate your assumptions, go

267
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,260
out, just ask people questions, talk to your client.

268
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,670
Does this necessarily, like fulfill the goals?

269
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,070
Will users actually?

270
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,580
Be enticed to start clicking on certain things.

271
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,100
Does this make you seem like a more personalized shopping experience?

272
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,690
I don't know.

273
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,490
I don't honestly know just yet.

274
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,670
And that's fine.

275
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,770
I mean, we are going to create many variations and you should be doing that, too.

276
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,510
Don't just settle on one.

277
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,530
So this is the home page that I've just wireframe too really quickly using all those components, and

278
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,660
you should definitely give it a try yourselves.

279
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:12,870
You don't need to copy exactly what I did, but go ahead and try to think about other ways that you

280
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,940
can incorporate special interests or like recommendations.

281
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,510
Think about ways that you can get users like into our funnel in terms of like purchasing.

282
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,530
I know we kind of have like shopping interests and habits over there.

283
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,130
We kind of knocked everything off in one way or another.

284
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,190
And you should really think about.

285
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:41,550
I know the goal of this project is really to kind of drive the point home of a more personalized shopping

286
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,030
experience.

287
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,570
So come up with your own feature.

288
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,690
Think about different ways you can kind of achieve that goal.

289
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,110
And that's it for our home page.

290
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,220
In our next video, we're going to figure out what else to build with our wireframes.
