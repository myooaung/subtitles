00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.950
Hey, everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.440
So one thing that we often forget about is something like our assets, like icons.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.770
Now, icons are very important.

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.050
We created our own icons in this course.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.260
And we've also found different types of resources that give us a bunch of icons.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.950
And these icons are definitely based off of our feather icon resource, which you can find right here.

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.820
So these icons are based off of that.

8
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.250
And I've taken all the icons I need for this application, and I've broken them into two things.

9
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.960
Two different sizes, 24 pixel icons and 16 pixel icons.

10
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.200
Now, you may not need to, depending on how you set your icons up, you could just resize them if you

11
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.290
really need to.

12
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.780
But what I've done here is I've split them up just to make it easier for you.

13
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.540
Now.

14
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.510
I've also included a several filled versions.

15
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.970
So, I mean, if there's a heart, let's turn off our grid, because each of these is on a grid.

16
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.900
So if we take off our grid over here, we'll notice that we have, like, a heart that is filled.

17
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.760
Or like a zap icon.

18
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.440
Or just like a star.

19
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.630
And this helps us really, like, if we're creating interactions with icons and we need to fill them,

20
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.010
this really helps.

21
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.800
So you don't necessarily need, like, massive icons set with like 400 different icons.

22
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.020
I personally use the icons that I'm going to use within the application.

23
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.310
I may have a couple extras just in case, and that's totally fine.

24
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.520
And you can continue just adding to this.

25
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.340
This is my icon system right now and I'll show you how I went in and built it.

26
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.100
So I have different sections.

27
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.540
This is how I've named them.

28
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.850
I've outlined 24 pixel.

29
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.640
And just that is where the artwork is within.

30
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.890
And then I've actually here, I will show you what I've done.

31
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.980
So if I take this, let's disconnect that.

32
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.060
This is my icon.

33
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.229
And I've just taken it and created it as a component.

34
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.490
I've done Option Command K, I've named it whatever I want to name it.

35
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.640
So I've been using this naming convention for my icons just to split them up between 24 pixels and 16

36
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.300
pixels.

37
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.000
And now whenever I want to use it, if I go into my assets section.

38
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.690
You'll see that I have it split up over here.

39
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.000
Let's change that for 1/2.

40
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.330
Okay.

41
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.200
So this is my outline, 24 Pixel Arrow.

42
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.140
You'll see that.

43
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.760
You see it selected.

44
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.350
Now let's just delete that and it won't show up there in my asset section.

45
00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:00.930
But I have my iconography split up by 16 pixels and then I have filled and outline 16 pixels and the

46
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.890
same for the 24 pixels.

47
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.280
And if I want to say get 24 pixel outline icon, I can see all my assets right here and this is why

48
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.720
I split it up just like this.

49
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.190
It's perfect.

50
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.220
You can just grab I want a home icon and just drag it into whatever file you're using.

51
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.650
And if I wanted to change that icon and I will show you how I've used this within other components,

52
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.830
I can just go into my instance section over here and it'll automatically give me related components

53
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.820
if I'm in 24 pixels, but say if I want to use like 16 pixels, I can do that too.

54
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.900
I can change it like that.

55
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:45.160
And just like that, we have icons that we can easily use within other components, not even with other

56
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.770
components, but just within a file.

57
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.110
If we need to grab something quick, it keeps everything in one place and neatly sorted.

58
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.950
So these are the icons I've decided to go with.

59
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.410
You can tell they're more rounded, more playful.

60
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.070
Kind of like how our logo is for habitual and just how the overall app kind of tone is.

61
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.380
And I've done the exact same for the smaller versions, as you can tell that.

62
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.589
They are a little bit more chunkier, but when you start shrinking your icons, you need them to be

63
00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:24.420
a little bit more thicker so people can really understand them and understand what they are.

64
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.110
We don't have them as thin as we do as at 24 pixels.

65
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.780
So just another thing to think about.

66
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.560
But that is how I have decided to incorporate iconography into my design system.
