1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,020
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:09,120
Last time we talked about just the different types of properties that Figma smart enemy actually supports,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,340
that being scale, position, opacity, rotation and fill.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,850
Now, I'm going to show you a couple of different prototype examples of that actually being used.

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,720
I guess you could say in real life examples, let me show you the different types of ways you can basically

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,130
use smart animate.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,060
So over here we have a little transition belt.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:42,900
And the goal here is to when you click this card, it will show this option and then we can click that

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,830
to delete it.

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,300
And then this portion will kind of animate upwards.

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:56,190
Think about if you hide maybe like a mailbox and you wanted to delete one of your mail items or like

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,960
one of those cards, and once you do that, the rest of the cards kind of just push upwards.

13
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,230
That's essentially what we're building here right now.

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:10,560
So the way to do that is you need to create three different screens for this type of animation.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,360
That's what I've gone ahead and done.

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,050
And if we just click on our prototype tab that we have here, so we've already done that.

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,450
I'm just going to click this screen just to show you what I've done.

18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,130
So I've selected this object.

19
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:29,700
So it's called Rectangle 17 over here, and it's going to match this one here that's also called Rectangle

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,450
17.

21
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,750
So naming conventions are very important with smart animate because if this was named something else,

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,610
nothing would necessarily happen.

23
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,430
So we wouldn't get like a fill animation when that changes and we wouldn't also get it to disappear

24
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,220
when it removes itself from this screen as well.

25
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:55,740
So what I've done here is I've just taken this prototype node and connected it to this screen and I've

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,310
selected on top navigate to this screen.

27
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,750
So it's just called transition.

28
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,560
I know poor naming, but it's just for the sake of an example.

29
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,750
And out of my animation menu, you can select instant, you can select dissolve.

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,940
But what we want to do is we want to select smart animate and that's what we've done.

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,440
So we have smart animate selected over here and you can select the easing, you can do ease out, ease

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,730
in, you can do linear.

33
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:31,320
I find linear looks kind of fake when we actually design animations and just different types of motion

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,310
in general.

35
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,070
Gravity also kind of applies.

36
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,780
You need to think about how things kind of gently kind of ease in or how gently they ease out.

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,670
And if things are way too linear, it kind of looks fake.

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,520
I like to kind of just apply one of these to it, you know, see what works for you.

39
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,020
I have ease out in this instance, so that's what I have applied.

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,750
And then you can apply the animation duration over here.

41
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,630
So I have it set to 500 milliseconds.

42
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,720
I feel like that's pretty good, just a time.

43
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,940
In general, you don't want to have something that is too quick or something that's too slow.

44
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,530
I think the optimal speed is in around like 200 to 500 milliseconds.

45
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,820
Stay within that kind of limit for these types of animations.

46
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,680
You just don't want to keep your users waiting.

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,210
So let's see what this looks like.

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,330
Let's go right to our prototype.

49
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,280
So we're just going to press our to restart so I can see my hot spot right there and this is what's

50
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,020
going to happen.

51
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,320
So we just have a fill.

52
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,890
That's it.

53
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,730
So I've clicked this and that card has been highlighted in some way.

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,690
Let's jump back.

55
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:47,190
And the next animation is I'm going to click that same object and I'm going to attach it to this screen.

56
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,050
And now it's the same thing that I have here.

57
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,870
I have animate, smart, animate as animation.

58
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,280
I have the eyes out and I have 500 milliseconds as my duration.

59
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,720
And this actually would not appear on this screen at all.

60
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,750
So I don't have a rectangle 17, as you can see.

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,140
So let's see what that all looks like together.

62
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,340
So I'm going to click.

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
We're going to click it again.

64
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,840
And there you go.

65
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,380
Simple transition.

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,649
If you provide enough content for something like this, it will look really nice.

67
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:24,540
So if you actually create cards that have content that's relative to what you're doing, not just black

68
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,470
blocks like I have, but that's just the easiest way to make this type of animation.

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,000
Now let's go back.

70
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,430
We're going to do is I'm just going to drag this over here.

71
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,210
So I have this.

72
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:49,390
Now, another thing that you can do is instead of actually just using smart animate, you can use a

73
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,120
different type of animation, like a push.

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,590
You just click that.

75
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,280
So let me show you what this looks like so you can have a push animation.

76
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,110
That's nice.

77
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,290
I mean, we're already thinking about screen transitions, but the problem is that you see the navigation

78
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,600
moves and everything kind of moves, like even the title and that kind of stuff shouldn't necessarily

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,620
move in our instance.

80
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,230
I mean, the title may move in another application or yeah, another example, but the navigation always

81
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,010
stay the same.

82
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:30,150
So this is how we keep the navigation in its place or any other layers in their place.

83
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,880
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select that same animation I have that also selected here.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,220
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to.

85
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,990
Let me remove this.

86
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,930
We're going to actually start from scratch.

87
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,090
So I'm going to actually just select this navigation item and I'm just going to attach it to the screen.

88
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,190
And I'm going to not click smart animate, but I'm going to click push.

89
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,840
I'm going to leave the easing the same way.

90
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,250
I'm going to leave the duration the same way.

91
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,710
And I can see a little kind of preview of what that animation looks like.

92
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,140
So I have my second screen as be coming in and pushing out screen A if I wanted to, I can have something

93
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,480
similar like that where it just kind of overlays.

94
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,330
But let's just stick to push for now and you'll notice this option here that says smart animate matching

95
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:23,720
layers.

96
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:32,300
And what that means is all the layers with the same name will be animated within this entire animation

97
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,650
that we're building out here.

98
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,020
So let me show you what that means.

99
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:42,220
So I've clicked that so you can see animate layers with the same name instead of using the transition

100
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:48,970
above, instead of having the navigation being pushed out of the frame, it will just animate to whatever

101
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:49,750
is over here.

102
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,390
So let's see, we have a couple of things going on.

103
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,050
So we have this it's called Rectangle 15.

104
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,490
We have this Ellipse four.

105
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,560
Yeah, and this is Ellipse four as well.

106
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,660
So we're going to see these different things animate.

107
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,440
And I even think I made this square over here the same as well.

108
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,540
So Rectangle 16, rectangle 16.

109
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,870
So let's take a look at what that animation looks like after we just connect this third screen.

110
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,040
So we're going to do the same thing.

111
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,900
We're just going to push it over there.

112
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,430
Let's match our easing.

113
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:25,750
So I have 500 milliseconds and on this one I'm going to have 500 milliseconds.

114
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,950
Perfect.

115
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,740
And this will link back there and see.

116
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:36,620
Now it's starting to just kind of grab the exact same animations that I have applied earlier.

117
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,530
So that makes things so easy.

118
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,810
I love that Figma does this.

119
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,930
This looks pretty complicated, but this is our flow.

120
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,220
Let's take a look at what it looks like.

121
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,170
So we're going to just go play that.

122
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,430
So we'll see.

123
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,870
Right now, we don't have a push in or push out, but we have things animating.

124
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,280
You'll even notice the little kind of micro interactions, and we're going to get into that in more

125
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,220
detail later.

126
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,980
But we can see that things are staying put where we want them.

127
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,320
So let's take another look.

128
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,190
And what we're going to do here is we're actually going to rename this to

129
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:26,590
call it square two and we'll call this circle three and we'll just call this square one.

130
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,710
So that way we will actually get some sort of animation.

131
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:43,690
So we'll just call this square, we'll call this rounded square, and we'll call this a circle.

132
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,560
And what we're going to do is we're going to name these just like them all.

133
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,590
I'm going to select Command R to rename and I'm just going to say text and a number.

134
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,450
So that way they'll all be different and perfect.

135
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,620
Actually, that looks good.

136
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,330
And let's see what that animation looks like now.

137
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,250
So it should update within there.

138
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,320
Let's just restart.

139
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,180
So now we actually get actual animation of the screen changing.

140
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,520
While we keep our navigation the same.

141
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,460
So really cool.

142
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:24,420
Little animation we got here so we can actually go in and make these changes where we need to.

143
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:32,290
In terms of how that animation looks, I'm talking more so about the little details of how things slide

144
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,270
in and slide out.

145
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,030
We just want to keep that kind of stuff consistent because everything constantly swipes in from the

146
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,630
right.

147
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,250
And when you're switching between navigation items, it gets a little confusing.

148
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:50,140
But that is essentially how you keep things in place while you are actually switching items on the screen.

149
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,240
So let's go even further down and we're going to kind of put these two examples together.

150
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,610
So we have a screen here.

151
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,790
Let's actually just delete that.

152
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,030
Perfect.

153
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,530
What do we have here?

154
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,700
So this is going to be.

155
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,570
Och, that's.

156
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,460
That's good.

157
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,560
So that's just going to smart animate.

158
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,220
And what we're going to have is we're going to have the navigation stay in place, but we're going to

159
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,580
have that same kind of card and we're going to actually have a drag.

160
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,560
So what happens here is.

161
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,330
After a delay.

162
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,590
So this is to mimic like a mailbox once again.

163
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,920
So I'm going to proceed to the screen and I've selected over here and I've selected after delay as my

164
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,700
interaction.

165
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,070
So after 1/2 or a 1000 milliseconds, we're going to navigate to the screen.

166
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,220
So that means we're going to have an item pop up at the top.

167
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,120
And everything's going to animate down.

168
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,770
So we have a select and a smart animation.

169
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,470
So kind of like what's happening here.

170
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,710
And then what we're going to do is we are going to drag.

171
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,030
So on drag to left.

172
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,970
We're going to smart animate as well.

173
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,800
We are going to drag this delete button in from the right.

174
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,600
And once we do that.

175
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:19,460
After a delay, after we've deleted, we will remove this item and the rest of the cards will jump up.

176
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,340
So let's see what this all looks like together.

177
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,820
So I'm going to play.

178
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,490
So all I'm going to do is click this.

179
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,370
There's our item.

180
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,680
So if you didn't catch that, let's do it one more time.

181
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,430
So going to click and let's wait for that delay and then item should pop up from the top.

182
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,050
There it is.

183
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,280
And I can see that I can click list item.

184
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,530
And the great thing about Figma is it kind of notices when you're like 50% of the way.

185
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,620
So if I release over here that delete will just slide.

186
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:58,130
If I release over here, it'll just go back so we can make some really nice micro interactions and animations

187
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,730
like this.

188
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,840
I'm just going to swipe it and then I'm going to wait for the other delay, which will actually delete

189
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,140
the item.

190
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,860
So I'm going to swipe.

191
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,370
Delete.

192
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,660
And it's gone.

193
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:14,580
Now we can go in and say, okay, that that took a little too long for our actual animation.

194
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,990
So let's go back.

195
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,650
So we have our swipe and it should be much quicker.

196
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,140
So we can even go even further.

197
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,940
Let's do that again.

198
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,050
And let's go to 200 milliseconds, because I think once you delete, something should be pretty instantaneous.

199
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,630
So let's go through that animation.

200
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,050
Boom.

201
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,290
That's beautiful.

202
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,380
I'm going to delete that and it's gone.

203
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,530
So, I mean, we can probably even trim that down a bit more, but let's do it one more time.

204
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,760
Let me see what it looks like.

205
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,520
Nice slide, delete and everything kind of pushes its way back up.

206
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,400
So this is a great way for you to prototype different types of animations in the application that you

207
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,010
may have with smart animate.

208
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,690
You don't even need to leave figma.

209
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,170
You can just create pages of different types of interactions.

210
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,840
I mean, I wouldn't necessarily go ahead and create one massive prototype with all these different like

211
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,360
animations and micro interactions.

212
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,440
Don't go ahead and do that.

213
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,860
It's going to take you so long to just put together.

214
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,370
And I mean, if you change one thing, then you may have to go back and rework.

215
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:31,380
What I typically do is if I have like an interaction just like this that I want to showcase, I'll make

216
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,720
a new page for it and I'll just stick to this one page and I'll have whatever screens I need in different

217
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,170
variations of those screens in order for me to actually go ahead and present that to whoever I'm presenting

218
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:50,160
it to, whether that be the product team alone, whether that be clients, keep things separate, keep

219
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,430
them clean, don't go out making crazy animations like that.

220
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,800
In our next video, I'm going to show you how I applied smart animate to that that other app I built

221
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,200
over here so I'll show you all the different things that I did to kind of put this together and make

222
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,560
things look really realistic in terms of motion and animation.

223
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,120
So stay tuned.

224
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,600
Let's jump into our next video and I'll show you how I did that.
