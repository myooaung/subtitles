1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,950
So let's talk about focus states.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,890
Focus is one of the most important features that enables users to use a computer with just a keyboard.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,410
Most style sheets will have this one piece of code that will cause major accessibility.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,190
Failure.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,300
And this is it.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:16,730
Yep.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,110
Removing the outline.

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,290
So let's go back just a bit.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,890
That would remove this outline, which is horrible.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,710
Do I ever do this?

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,030
Ever.

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,320
You should avoid doing this like the plague.

13
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,900
Keyboard users will know what element they're interacting with because of the help of focus styles.

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,210
So Focus highlighting is only used for interactive UI elements like form elements and buttons.

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,820
So we need to make sure that we keep that in there.

16
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,580
Another thing we should always be thinking about is focus contrast.

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,640
It's a guideline to have the color of your outline adhere to contrast standards as well.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,770
So if you look over here, we have an orange outline and that is definitely going to be accessible.

19
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:06,730
There is enough contrast with that white background, but if you were to have a very, very light gray,

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,710
that's just not going to work.

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,010
Next is to think about off screen content in relation to focus.

22
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,870
Keep in mind that sometimes we design content that is hidden off the screen, kind of like this menu

23
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,220
over here in this example.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,410
Some of this content could be like hamburger menus, models, etc..

25
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,210
Sometimes when a user has tabbing through focus points, they can lose track because it could be highlighting

26
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,410
something off screen.

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,700
Could you imagine how confusing that could be for a user?

28
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,980
If I was tabbing through something like this and I was picking up navigation items, super confusing.

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,010
This would cause so much confusion and the user could lose track of what they're doing on screen.

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,520
Speak with a developer about solutions around this.

31
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:57,370
But if you're feeling comfortable enough, you know you can do this easily with CSS or JavaScript.

32
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,260
Next is models.

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,430
Models can be an accessibility disaster when not done properly.

34
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:11,750
When users tap through a modal like this, they should be confined to just the model they should never

35
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,310
be focusing on content behind.

36
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,540
So could you imagine if I was tabbing through model title?

37
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,990
The exit button, whatever contents within on these buttons, and then all of a sudden I tap through

38
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,250
launch demo modal.

39
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,490
I would be pretty confused and lost.

40
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,770
So make sure you have that conversation as well with developers.

41
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,410
Now hover states also apply to focus, and hover states should be made accessible.

42
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,090
Users should be able to tap through hover areas as they do with focus based areas, because sometimes

43
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,500
we actually hide certain interactions under a hover state.

44
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,140
Think about Facebook and their reactions.

45
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:00,290
You need to hover over that like button before you can see all the other reactions.

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,370
But Facebook does a great job with making it successful.

47
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,900
You can actually tap through this as a focus state, which is amazing.

48
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,030
Let's talk about Click Targets.

49
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,480
Now.

50
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,540
Big thing is cards.

51
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,010
Cards are used a bunch in products these days, and it's important to create accessibility friendly

52
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:28,930
cards since they can get so complex with multiple states based on the type of interaction being performed.

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,180
A really good example of how cards can be made accessible is through Google Inbox.

54
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,780
Now if you take a look at.

55
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,520
Over here.

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,640
This is Google Inbox and this interaction is really great.

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,080
So they assign specific focus stakes to the.

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,470
So they assigned specific focus states for the cards that the user has navigated to.

59
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,960
So you'll notice that the person here is navigating to all these different cards, and then you can

60
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,750
see that this is the card that they're currently on.

61
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,570
The hover action is completed on focus.

62
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:12,050
So the hover action over here for all the different actions you can take on an individual inbox item

63
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,980
will be highlighted while you tap through, which is also great.

64
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:23,870
Now, another thing that people fail to realize is you don't necessarily need to make every single UI

65
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,520
element on the screen.

66
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,390
Tappable.

67
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,900
Or fixable.

68
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:37,100
What Google Inbox does really well in this specific interaction is that only the actionable items are

69
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,480
focused and not every other element in the card.

70
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,620
So over here you'll notice that only these primary actions are actually.

71
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,100
In focus in comparison to like all these other elements.

72
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,410
Next is target areas.

73
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:01,390
We need to make sure that target areas are large enough for users to select on a page.

74
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,590
So.

75
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,090
Some users have motor impairments and it find it hard to select smaller items.

76
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:18,630
If we take a look over here, we'll notice that the mailbox has a larger tappable area.

77
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,050
Same with what the edit button would be.

78
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,830
And this is what I was talking about in the beginning around like different that accessibility is greater

79
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,280
for all.

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,030
I mean, when you're on mobile, you want a larger tappable area and not even if you have a motor impairment.

81
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,800
This just makes my life easier as just going through my mailbox.

82
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,980
So keep this in mind just when you're designing in general.

83
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,250
Now I just want to say that many of these solutions aren't very style specific, but they do always

84
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,810
still affect us in some way.

85
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,540
Especially as designers, we always set out to build products that everyone can enjoy and use easily.

86
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:03,210
Accessibility should be a part of the design process earlier in every UI element, and every design

87
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,340
pattern should be made accessible.

88
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,920
And most importantly, you should always collaborate with your development team.

89
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,960
Accessibility is something that all of us can work towards and do, and it certainly starts with design

90
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,480
in terms of style, like contrast in labels and forms and all that kind of stuff.

91
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:27,420
But a lot of what happens in terms of specifications will happen on the on the development side.

92
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,780
So it's always important to talk to developers because they're going to have a much deeper understanding

93
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,490
of what's really necessary.

94
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,040
And they can really inform you and help you along the way.

95
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,290
So that's accessibility.
