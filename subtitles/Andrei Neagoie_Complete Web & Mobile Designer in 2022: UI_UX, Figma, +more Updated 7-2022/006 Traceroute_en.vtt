00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.700
Hello.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.610
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.330
You mentioned it.

4
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.630
The last lesson that we're going to be talking about, tracer, what is that?

5
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.510
Well, I just wanted to finally get the entire picture of the Internet across, and I think this is

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.970
the best way to do it.

7
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.760
Now, if you're on a mac, you're going to press command space and look for a program that comes with

8
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.500
your Mac called Terminal.

9
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.680
And you're going to press enter and you're going to get this.

10
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.500
So it's an application that all Macs have.

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.200
If you're on a Windows machine, it's called Command Prompt.

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.020
And in the exercise, right after this lesson, I will show you instruction on how to access that as

13
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.560
well.

14
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.650
We're going to talk about Trace Root.

15
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:48.480
And if you remember, we spoke about this image of all these connected things happening and going to

16
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.560
the Internet backbone, and then Google.com finally sends us the files back to our house and you can

17
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.310
actually monitor how that's going to work using traceroute.

18
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.090
So if we type in traceroute and on Windows Machine, it's actually trace our t, but for now we'll just

19
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.010
go traceroute and you can request for whatever website you want.

20
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.990
So let's go with google.com.

21
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.840
I press enter and yeah.

22
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.440
Look at that.

23
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.880
It gave me a whole bunch of hops that it did.

24
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.830
So you can see one through nine here.

25
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.090
So it did nine hops.

26
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.860
So that means nine stops to this address.

27
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.090
At 172 to 1 71.14.

28
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.880
So again, that looks like the IP address.

29
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.630
So again, let's always test our experiments here.

30
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.900
If I put that in and press enter, we should get google.com.

31
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.470
Let's see.

32
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.260
Look at that google.com.

33
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.530
So that's a fun little way of you to see where your requests go.

34
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.400
And you can monitor.

35
00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.720
You can see all these IP addresses are different computers that are trying to locate the Google servers.

36
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.190
So go ahead.

37
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.380
In the next section, there's a little exercise you can play around with this and just see where all

38
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.080
your requests go all over the world.

39
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.410
I think it's very, very cool.

40
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.410
We're going to finish up in the next section with some fundamentals and what we can do with this knowledge

41
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.190
that we have to actually become really good web developers.

42
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.660
So see you in the next section.

43
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.410
Bye bye.
