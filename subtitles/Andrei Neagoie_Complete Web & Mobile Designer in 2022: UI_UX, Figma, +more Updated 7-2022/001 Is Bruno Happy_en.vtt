00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.660
After all that hard work, you finally show your designs to Bruno Habitual.

2
00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.430
Does Bruno like it?

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.210
Well, Bruno absolutely loves it.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.450
He has been so inspired by your design work that he even got a really cool new hat.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.290
Check it out.

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.430
He wants to be a designer too now because, well, he just wants to create beautiful products like you.

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.750
Good job getting this far in the course.

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.990
Bruno's happy, and I hope you're happy too, because you learned a lot.

9
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.790
But here's the thing.

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.930
Remember this diagram that we saw at the beginning of the course?

11
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.970
We've just completed our planning and design phase.

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.220
We've taken on the role of a designer and have created a product.

13
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.560
But now we have a critical part, which is the handoff to the development team.

14
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.270
Usually you hand off your designs to developers so that they can actually build the product and launch

15
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.570
it.

16
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.660
So how does it work as a designer when you work with developers?

17
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.950
Let's find out.
