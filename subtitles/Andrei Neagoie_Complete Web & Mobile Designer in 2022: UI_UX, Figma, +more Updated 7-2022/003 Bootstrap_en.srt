1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,520
Let's start using bootstrap.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,400
And there are two ways we can use this toolkit.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,790
One is to download.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,600
And you can just click on the first link.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,040
It says Compiled CSS and JavaScript.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,910
Well, let's just see what gets downloaded.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,960
So if I open this, you'll see here that I have a CSS file and JavaScript file.

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,550
You see, there's a bunch of them.

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,190
You don't have to worry too much about it.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:36,880
It's just different CSS files that are used together based on if you're using the bootstrap grid or

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:43,780
the bootstrap case and you'll see some of them have the bootstrap CSS and that means that there are

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,220
minified.

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:49,810
So if I open this, you'll see that everything is on one line and minified.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,700
Right now all we need to do is just add this to our project.

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,260
But I want to show you a better way of doing it, especially when we're getting started.

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,470
And that is we can use something called a CDM.

17
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,260
So what is a n?

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,320
A n is a content delivery network.

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:16,750
Bootstrap has this link and they're hosting the bootstrap CSS files for us, so we don't even need to

20
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,130
include it in our project.

21
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:24,340
All we need to do is add this line into our HTML and you'll see here that the link tag, which refers

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:31,000
to a stylesheet, has an H ref that links us to the bootstrap minified CSS.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,460
And that's what a content delivery network is.

24
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,860
We don't need to include our files into our project.

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,240
We just link to some place else that is actually hosting this file.

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,500
So let's copy that.

27
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:48,700
So open up Sublime and I'm going to create a new file here and we'll save it to the desktop.

28
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,220
I'll call it indexed HTML.

29
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,470
I save and let's open that up in the browser as well.

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,630
Empty because well, we don't have anything here.

31
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,600
Let's start with our HTML page and we'll title it bootstrap.

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,050
And again we have that link copied.

33
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,490
Which is the dean that says, Hey, I want the CSS file from Bootstrap.

34
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,190
If you scroll down to the bottom, it also has the JavaScript file.

35
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,130
And like I said before, we need these files.

36
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,790
If we're using features of bootstrap such as dropdowns or models that actually add some actions to our

37
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,480
websites.

38
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,730
So let's just copy this and where we want to put JavaScript.

39
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,560
And again, when we get to that section in this course, we'll talk more about it.

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:49,540
We want to put it at the bottom of our body tag and that is because you want these JavaScript files

41
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,740
to load after all the content of your websites have loaded.

42
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,140
This way we have our website loaded and then these scripts get downloaded.

43
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,240
If we put these at the top, you'll have to wait for all of them to load before a user can see your

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,660
website.

45
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,400
And obviously that's that's not what we want to do.

46
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:07,650
Okay.

47
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,770
And this is all we need to have bootstrap working for us.

48
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,480
So let's play with a few things.

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,630
Let's say we wanted to add a nav bar.

50
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:24,100
I would go into the components and select nav bar and you can read about how it works.

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,020
But I really, really like this navigation bar, so I'm just going to copy the code.

52
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,670
And add it to my body.

53
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,900
And I know it can get overwhelming when you're copying a whole bunch of code and you don't know exactly

54
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,950
what it's doing.

55
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:50,530
But if you actually read this line by line, you know, everything is just a few tags with their own

56
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,300
specific bootstrap classes.

57
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,640
So let's save here and refresh.

58
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,520
And look at that.

59
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,620
We have a navigation bar.

60
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,930
How easy is that?

61
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,540
And one thing that Bootstrap is really famous for and why people love it so much is that it's fully

62
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,140
responsive.

63
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,430
So you see the menu bar here.

64
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,850
If I make it bigger, look at that.

65
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,800
It automatically changes according to what we need.

66
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,170
OC.

67
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,390
What else can we add over here?

68
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,649
Let's look at.

69
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,870
Let's add a Jumbotron.

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,550
Hello world so I can copy this.

71
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,280
And again, let's add that to let's add that right below the naff bar.

72
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:43,380
So again, in Sublime text, I can minimize this by clicking the side over here and below the nav bar

73
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,110
will add this jumbotron.

74
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,660
So if I save and refresh.

75
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,220
Look at that.

76
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,020
We have hello world.

77
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,850
Let's add one last thing.

78
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,180
We'll do a modal and with the modal.

79
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,590
I really like this one launch demo modal, so I'm going to copy this.

80
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,620
And again, I'm going to minimize the Jumbotron just so we can see what we've added.

81
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,790
Copy and paste this.

82
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,930
I always have to adjust my indentation.

83
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,590
Perfect.

84
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,930
And I save this and refresh.

85
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,440
We have the launch demo model and if I click this look that we have our own model.

86
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,370
Now this just to prove that this is JavaScript.

87
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,140
If I remove these scripts and I'm just going to comment them out.

88
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,620
And I click this.

89
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,330
Nothing happens.

90
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,810
And that's what JavaScript is doing.

91
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,880
We'll get into it, like I said later.

92
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:57,170
But there are some features that might not work with Bootstrap if you don't include the scripts, but

93
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,530
if you're only using it for styles then you might not even need these.

94
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,090
So if I remove this, if you saw, we still have.

95
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,630
All of these, but the nav bar isn't working anymore.

96
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,360
So again, you can play around and see what you need.

97
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,780
You don't need to know exactly what these scripts do yet.

98
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,090
So just leave them there for now.

99
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:25,590
Now, how can we change the style so that we can add our own custom look to our website?

100
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,770
Well, if we wanted to change something like the launch demo modal button.

101
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:40,080
Well, in that case, I can see over here that this is the button and I can look at the classes that

102
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,490
Bootstrap gives us.

103
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,920
If I go into.

104
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,460
Funds.

105
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:52,530
Well, here I can see that all these classes have all these colors have different names.

106
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:58,200
So if I want it to be a red, I can use button bun danger.

107
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,300
So again, I can remove.

108
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,210
Primary.

109
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,240
Actually, I can just type this out.

110
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,450
Instead of primary, I can do danger.

111
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,980
Save and refresh.

112
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,110
And now the buttons read.

113
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,490
But again, what if you want your own custom, look to the button?

114
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,080
Well, that's easy to do.

115
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,750
We can now say that from now on, I want button danger.

116
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,020
To be orange.

117
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,950
The way we do that is we create a style sheet at the top.

118
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,960
And now we can add our own stylesheet and you can see it's below the bootstrap one, which means that

119
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,410
according to cascading style sheets, our styles will override anything that might match the bootstrap

120
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:44,800
ones.

121
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,110
So let's create a style file here.

122
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,160
And I actually have one created already on our desktop.

123
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,400
You can see it over here in the same directory as the index.html.

124
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:06,440
And here we can say that the button danger that we just added has a background color.

125
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,350
Both orange.

126
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,520
If I save this and refresh.

127
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,040
Look at that.

128
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,730
Our button is now orange and the hover effect is still red.

129
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,080
And that's default bootstrap.

130
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,070
So we can do.

131
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,870
Button danger hover.

132
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,410
Is going to be black.

133
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,660
Save and refresh.

134
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,760
Look at that.

135
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,370
We have our own custom button.

136
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,010
You can see bootstrap is very powerful.

137
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,890
We're able to create websites really, really fast this way.

138
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,580
And in the next section we're going to talk about the best feature of bootstrap that I have yet to tell

139
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,150
you about.

140
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,620
I'll see you in the next one.

141
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,220
Bye bye.
