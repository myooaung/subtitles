00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,740
Hello.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,560
We're super, super excited to start the course with you.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,170
But as always, before we do, we need to see where we're starting and where we're ending up.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,500
So we have a clear path to becoming a top designer.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,800
So let's see what this course will look like for you.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,790
The first step is always meeting the client.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,990
This is the first step in any design project, any project you may have.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,960
And we're going to start off with a fictional company that hires you, and they want to create a product

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,759
that rivals Amazon.

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,110
And this entire course.

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,170
We're going to build this product from start to finish and give for you an exact step by step process

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,960
that you can use for all your future projects.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,380
This is a process that Daniel, who has worked as a lead designer for multiple companies, uses all

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,010
the time.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,440
Now, this section also introduces you to some of the tools we're going to use in the course how to

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,000
get the best out of the course.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,820
But we're also not going to spend too much time because I know you want to get started and start designing.

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,160
We're going to revisit this idea of meeting a client later on towards the end of the course, so that

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,230
you can learn about things like user stories, using Trello, using story mapping and figma.

20
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,000
But we want us to get started.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,690
So right away we're going to start designing this product that this fictional company, Cake Corp,

22
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,710
wants to build.

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,540
We're going to learn about sketching, about inspiration, about user flows and side maps.

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,290
This is the first stage where we try to draw inspiration from different sources and start to brainstorm

25
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,630
ideas for the product we're going to build.

26
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,400
This is a very critical process, and we're going to take you step by step then.

27
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,190
We get into even more exciting things.

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,950
This is the explore and iterate face.

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,250
This is where we talk about wireframes, prototyping and getting feedback.

30
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:58,120
We're going to start using Figma, which is a wonderful tool that more and more people are using now

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,160
because things like Photoshop are kind of outdated when it comes to design and most people don't use

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,280
it.

33
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:09,070
We want to use a modern tool like Figma that you're going to see allows us to do everything we want

34
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:14,770
and also makes our handoff later on when we finish the project super, super easy.

35
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,810
You're going to love Figma and the next step is the really, really fun part.

36
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,820
It's the visual design.

37
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:28,300
This is where we talk about design theory, accessibility, things like typography, grid and spacing

38
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,310
forms and UI elements, color theory, image and iconography.

39
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,320
And obviously, as I mentioned, accessibility, which is becoming more and more important.

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,740
And it's a must for all designers moving forward.

41
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:48,580
This is what most of you associate design with this idea of making things beautiful, adding color,

42
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,800
deciding what looks good.

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,340
But as you can see, there's lots of steps before we get to this visual design because you need to have

44
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,970
a plan before you start just making things pretty.

45
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,190
Now, this section is going to be very, very big and we're going to learn a lot of interesting best

46
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,860
practices and also step by step guide for you to implement these things in all your designs.

47
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,900
Now that our product is starting to take shape, we then get into design exploration.

48
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,860
This is where we talk about design patterns, mobile design, applying visual design and motion and

49
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,960
also micro interactions.

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,550
This is where we make everything look really modern again.

51
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:37,810
Talk about best practices, about the importance of motion and animations, how we can make the user

52
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:44,560
interact with our product in a way that is exciting to them, that creates a good user experience.

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,870
Lots to cover in this section.

54
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,020
We then get to putting it all together.

55
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:56,620
Everything we've built up until this point allows us to get to this point, which is building a design

56
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:04,780
system and the final composition, putting everything together to create the final high fidelity design

57
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,290
assets that you can present to your client.

58
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,860
Trust me, getting to this point is totally worth it.

59
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:18,160
By the end of it all, you're going to have tons of assets and design templates that you can use on

60
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,510
all your future projects.

61
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:25,210
And best of all, the product that we're going to build together, you can now put on your portfolio

62
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:31,390
so that next time you're on some freelancing website or you're applying for a contract, well, they're

63
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,450
going to see this and they're going to be impressed by your work.

64
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:40,960
But not only that, you now have the step by step process that you can use for all your future projects

65
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,960
to make sure that you follow the best practices.

66
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,470
This is where we go back to the idea of meeting the client.

67
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,110
We want to revisit this and make sure that we understand what happens when we get our clients or we

68
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,550
are looking for clients.

69
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,960
What are the best practices?

70
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,250
What are the questions that we ask to try to understand what their needs are?

71
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,190
Because at the end of the day, design is all about understanding what the client and the user needs

72
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,030
and creating a product around that need and want.

73
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:16,480
Finally, to complete the course, we are going to talk about this idea of creating a web portfolio

74
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,030
for you to be discovered by others, for you to get clients and who knows, maybe even work remotely.

75
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,290
We want to show you some of the best practices when it comes to showcasing your work.

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,040
And then finally, just as a bonus bit, because we're going to be talking about how to hand off your

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,050
work to developers.

78
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:41,230
Once we're done with the design process, we usually hand off our work to developers that can program

79
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,880
and perhaps put the website online or the mobile app in the app stores.

80
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,630
Now, HTML and CSS is not necessary for you to be a top designer, but it doesn't hurt to know how websites

81
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:59,080
are built, how to put a website online and learn how you might become a full fledged designer that

82
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,620
can use HTML and CSS to wow the clients.

83
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,570
So as you can see, we have a lot to cover, but it's going to be really, really fun.

84
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,200
We're going to build something really, really beautiful that I think you're going to be proud of.

85
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,160
At the end of it all, we're going to take you from zero to mastery.

86
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:23,110
But here's the thing the best part of this course is our online private community of over 300,000 students.

87
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,680
We have on here people chatting every day, helping each other out, solving problems together, showcasing

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,540
their work, or just talking about the latest and greatest in the tech industry.

89
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,940
This is an optional resource for you to use so that you can have a back and forth conversation with

90
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,500
other students and.

91
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,690
Myself and Daniel.

92
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,050
So that you feel like you're part of a classroom.

93
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:51,680
I'm on there chatting every day, and we also have monthly challenges for you to do to supplement the

94
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,250
course.

95
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,690
But you know what?

96
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,980
That's enough talking for me.

97
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:00,320
I know you want to get started, so let's learn how to design beautiful products.
