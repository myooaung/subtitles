00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,710
And welcome back.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:09,870
In the previous video, we went over the basic rules that all HTML files must follow, and I kind of

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:18,720
glossed over this doc type HTML tag and I did that on purpose because I want you to develop another

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,580
developer fundamental concept.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:27,850
And that is the fact that most of the time as developers, there's so much information out there, there's

6
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,770
no way that you can keep all of that in your head.

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,530
And as developers, we must get really, really good at problem solving.

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:42,310
So for the doc type, let's say if I was working and somebody gives me this file and I say, okay,

9
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,700
I got this, that's good, but I'm not sure what doc type is.

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,400
Well, again, we want to get really good at googling here and I know it sounds silly, but trust me

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,100
as a developer, you're going to be googling a lot and going to get really, really good at looking

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,700
for answers and understanding meanings behind code.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:08,080
So if I go into doc type HTML and we Google that, one of the first things we get is the double E three

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,590
school.

15
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,040
And this is a resource that I highly, highly recommend.

16
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:19,860
It'll actually explain what the dock type is and even show you a demo of what it does.

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:27,380
You can read into this and get more familiar with it, but the general rule and the concept behind dock

18
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:35,010
type is that dock type says to the browser, Hey, just a heads up, this file is going to use HTML

19
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,310
five and we'll get into what HTML five is.

20
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:44,300
But right now, HTML has evolved from back in the day when Tim Berners-Lee invented it to where it is

21
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:50,870
now and it has developed and evolved so that it has a few more tags, it has a few more features, and

22
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:57,770
this is the way for us to say, Hey, browser, we're going to be using HTML five, so please make sure

23
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:04,370
that you load the website properly and we'll get into what those new tags are and some of the new syntax

24
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:04,760
is.

25
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:11,750
But again, most likely in your day to day job, you're going to be writing this at the top because

26
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,640
we're writing in HTML five.

27
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,510
If that ever changes and something new comes along, we might change this.

28
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,370
But dock type, that's what it is.

29
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,830
But the key concept here is that I really want you to start Googling at any time you see in my video

30
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,210
something that you don't fully understand or you want to dig a little bit deeper.

31
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,250
You really want to grow those roots of your foundation so that you really understand how the landscape

32
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:34,730
works.

33
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:42,080
Okay, so I just wanted to get that concept across that as a developer you really want to understand

34
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,440
how things work and what they mean, and you'll come across in your day to day many things that it's

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:55,010
very easy to just on the surface copy and paste or just look at an example and do it without fully understanding

36
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,060
what it does.

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,900
But the developers that give really, really good salaries, really good jobs and are considered senior

38
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,430
developers are the ones that fully understand all the meaning behind the things that they do.

39
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,500
We're going to be taking that throughout the course and making sure that we develop those fundamentals.

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,110
But any time, like I said, you have any questions or you don't understand something fully, I do encourage

41
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:26,210
you to Google and get the answers because there's a ton of free resources out there for you to get fully,

42
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,310
fully comfortable with a topic.

43
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,910
I'll see you in the next one.

44
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,490
Bye bye.
