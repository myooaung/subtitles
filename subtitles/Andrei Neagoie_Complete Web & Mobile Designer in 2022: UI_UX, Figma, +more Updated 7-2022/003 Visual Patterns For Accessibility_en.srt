00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,530
Hey and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,410
We're going to talk about visual patterns for accessibility.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
There's several things we can do as designers to really make our designs accessible.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:14,850
And also, there are things that we can do as designers and to influence developers to ensure that our

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,550
products are live products are actually accessible.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,840
So let's jump right in.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,420
The first thing is color contrast.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,920
Now, this is the first step towards an accessible UI, and it's to get the color contrast for your

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,280
product.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,790
Right.

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,990
Color contrast is a really, really important part when it comes to visual impairments.

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,570
So getting this right will help those with visual impairments to see and to discern information on the

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,150
screen.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,750
You'll notice over here there's a little screenshot I took from a tool that I use called Color Safe

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,280
that actually shows you the current ratio of your contrast and the goal ratio.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,540
So this is double A compliant and all these colors can help you pick a palette that would actually be

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,470
compliant.

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,100
So what does that contrast ratio mean?

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:06,120
Now the recommended contrast is 3 to 1 for large text and 4.5 to 1 for small text.

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,530
This is the readability from the difference between the foreground and background color.

21
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:17,850
Larger font is categorized by any font larger than 18 pixels when bold or larger than 24 pixels for

22
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,110
regular font weight.

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,040
Small text is anything smaller than 18 pixels.

24
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,750
So you'll notice over here you could do it with UI components as well.

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,200
And we'll get into the different areas where we can essentially use these as guidelines rather than

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,020
rules, because sometimes setting contrast ratios don't necessarily work as well as we would think they

27
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,460
do.

28
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,660
But it's totally up to you.

29
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,880
Use your best intuition and test, test, test.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,700
So here are some of the tools that I actually use.

31
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,110
Color Safe is a great tool.

32
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,640
If you're starting a project fresh and you want to choose colors and check their contrast ratios before

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,900
you actually make a palette.

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,370
And in some products that have an established color system or a set of brand colors, you'll need to

35
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,790
find contrast ratios that work from the products palette.

36
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,669
And what I usually use for that is another site called Colorable.

37
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:15,030
I'll just input the colors there and it'll tell me if they are compliant with those standards.

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,880
There are some figma plugins as well that are really, really helpful if you don't want to use a browser

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,710
and I'll show you those later.

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,770
Now there are alternate ways to improve contrast, and sometimes it can be a really large task to check

41
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,470
each of your foreground and background color combinations.

42
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,180
An easy way to run through a test to find any issues with your designs is to use a chrome tool called

43
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,920
color contrast analyzer.

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,930
So this is another tool that I use.

45
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,960
There are multiple types of chrome extensions out there, but I like this one best because what it does

46
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,500
is it essentially identifies areas that will require work on the screen, areas outlined in white maintain

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,510
good contrast, and areas with poor contrast have subtle outlines that aren't as prominent.

48
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,940
So this is a good way to get a good understanding if your current design is accessible at all.

49
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,250
The next thing we can do is proper labeling.

50
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,050
I know it sounds kind of boring and rudimentary, but labeling can go a long way, especially with screen

51
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,130
readers as they're jumping around the screen.

52
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,000
Your developers probably know a lot about this already, but designers don't adhere to proper labeling,

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,300
and it's an easy thing that we can all do to make things a bit more accessible.

54
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,760
And what I mean by that is that when you're designing a form, rather than having a placeholder inside

55
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:34,740
the input and which possibly acts as the inputs label, just have your label be a label.

56
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:41,940
You could have a placeholder that then on Focus acts as a label, but a placeholder that goes away upon

57
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,500
Focus is a huge no no, not only for user experience, but for accessibility.

58
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,250
So labels on top like this and as a separate element, are a really great way to go and achieve that.

59
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,280
And then there's also menu labels.

60
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,890
So think about like a hamburger menu.

61
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,450
A lot of people use hamburger menus for hiding menus on mobile, which makes a lot of sense.

62
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:10,260
If you're going to use a menu icon, then you should have some other indicator because the icon alone

63
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:16,350
isn't necessarily accessible unless it's being properly coded and things like icons, even though you

64
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:22,710
can put a title in the code to help screen readers actually read them, it's a better practice to put

65
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,340
a label beside an icon or any sort of menu icon.

66
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,000
Now let's jump into Figma to talk a little bit about the tools I use.
