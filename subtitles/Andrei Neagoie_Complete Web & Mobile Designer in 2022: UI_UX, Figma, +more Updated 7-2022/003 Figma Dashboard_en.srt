1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,920
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,830
So by now, you should have signed up for Figma.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,450
It's really straightforward.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,950
I usually just use a Gmail account or whatever account that I'm using if I'm working at a different

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,640
company.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,700
But when you come to Figma for the very first time, what you're going to see is this screen.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,650
This is kind of like your dashboard.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,440
So let's go through all the different things you can do here.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,500
So these are some basic files they set you up with.

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,890
Over here, I have a shared file, so we'll get into that later.

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,930
But we have your colors.

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,490
We have figma basics.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,100
You can go in and learn about.

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,500
You have wireframe and figma, you have prototyping.

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,240
So they have a bunch of different things that you can already access.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,220
They kind of give you these little starter kits.

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,240
Now, if we look to the left, we have our little account section.

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:55,530
So if I go and click that, I'll see my email here, I'll see my name, I'll see all these different

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,170
things that I could use, like especially if I'm in a team or if I'm working with an organization,

20
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,000
a lot of that kind of stuff will be here.

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,000
And if I download any plugins, I don't have any installed on this account since this is my test account,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,490
but if you have any installed plugins, they're going to show up in this area and if you're part of

23
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,050
any team, generally, any file contributions will be here.

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:25,710
So since I have a Figma Basics resource file for you all, that's going to be my shared file to myself

25
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,550
so that I'm using.

26
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,070
So I'll teach you how to use shared files as well.

27
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:34,710
So right now I only have Daniel's team and Daniel Schiano's team, so I really don't have any teams

28
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,070
created because, you know, I'm not on a team right now.

29
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,500
I'm just working solo and I know most people will do that on their personal account, so no need to

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,460
worry about that.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,330
We also do have search.

32
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:52,910
So if you want to search for a particular file, if you have like 100 files or even like 20 files,

33
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,380
it's easier to search for them.

34
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,460
Or if you need to search for people in your organization, really easy to search them.

35
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,490
You can even search based off of community if you wanted to.

36
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,980
And that's the next thing we're going to get into, which I think this is one of the most amazing features

37
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,300
that Figma has.

38
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:14,840
You can use this community little tab over here to find different plug ins.

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,000
You can learn about different files that they have that you can duplicate.

40
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,210
So let's go in and see what we can find for wireframes.

41
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,340
So I'm just going to click wireframes over here.

42
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:35,100
And if you notice, you'll see all these different files and plugins you can sort by one or the other.

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,770
So if I wanted to say use this user flow kit, I would just open it up.

44
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,950
I can like it if I wanted to.

45
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,050
Or I can duplicate it.

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,920
So I've duplicated this.

47
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,310
And now, as you can see, this is the file and it's open.

48
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,650
Now, this may be a bit confusing.

49
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,670
But here, all I would need to do is.

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,590
I'm just going to go back to this little button at the top here and click back to files.

51
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,520
And you'll see this next tab, the drafts.

52
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,800
So this is where all my drafts live.

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,340
And drafts are essentially just little files or big files that don't have a project.

54
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,830
Now, I duplicated that file, and that's what you're going to be doing with the files and resources

55
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,700
I give you.

56
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,050
So if you can see right here, Figma Basics is a file that I have.

57
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,960
And I also have user flow kit.

58
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,250
So if I wanted to create a project, I would just come over here.

59
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,680
So this is called First Project.

60
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,760
If I wanted to, I can even create a new project.

61
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,760
I can just say this is test.

62
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,100
So I have a test project.

63
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,920
So I'm going to do is I'm going to go back into my drafts.

64
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,030
I'm going to click this, I'm going to open it up.

65
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,340
So it's open up in this tab and I'm going to click this little dropdown.

66
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,820
And I'm going to click Move to Project.

67
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,860
And over here I can select which project or I can search.

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,720
So I'm going to click test and I'm going to move it.

69
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,760
So right now you'll see that it's in your test project.

70
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,000
So if I click that, I can see that little checkmark.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,260
We're good to go.

72
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,900
So when you do get a file in the resource section, what you're going to need to do is you're going

73
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,750
to need to go to the file because you won't be able to edit it right away.

74
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,850
You're going to have to click this dropdown, click duplicate, and once you duplicate it, you'll have

75
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,950
to go to your drafts and you'll see it in your drafts and you can go and move it anywhere you want.

76
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,820
Now we can see that I have my project here, I have another project, we have our drafts.

77
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,810
You can have teams, you can create new teams if you want to.

78
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,480
You don't necessarily need to create any teams, especially if you're using it personally for yourself.

79
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,340
But that's another option that you definitely do have.

80
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,630
And that's it for the basics of your dashboard.
