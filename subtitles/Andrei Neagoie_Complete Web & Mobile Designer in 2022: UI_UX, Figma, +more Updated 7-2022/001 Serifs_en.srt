00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,240
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,540
We're going to be talking about a big topic and that is typography.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,090
Now, where do I even begin?

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,660
There are so many different things to talk about, but what I want to do is I want to start right at

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,530
the basics.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,650
So let's talk about the different categories of type.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,990
Now, the first category is something we're all familiar with, and that is SERP typefaces.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,220
Now, the first word that comes to mind when I'm thinking about serif typefaces is traditional.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,450
Now the little curls at the end of the letter forms are called serifs.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,750
Now these are these little, little curls.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,220
You see them on the edge of the SE, you'll see them at the bottom of the are the even on the top of

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,080
the R you get the point.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,930
Now Sarah's are generally used in body copy and they embody a more traditional feel.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,520
Some even say elegant.

15
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,110
It really depends on the typeface.

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,260
Now, even though they have their standard applications, we usually can bend the rules if it needs

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,340
to suit our need.

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,400
And you'll see that later on in these lessons.

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:09,900
Now, you may be thinking, Daniel, there are so many different types of serifs and some look so different

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,850
from each other.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,930
And you know, you're definitely right.

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,850
Serifs are categorised into four categories, so let's jump right in.

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,750
So that first category or that first subtype is called old style.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,580
Now also serifs.

25
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,770
These are generally referred to as humanists or, you know, the oldest typefaces in the classification.

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,940
And this will date back all the way to the mid 1400s.

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,480
Now typefaces in this category include Jenson, Center and Goudy.

28
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,700
Now we're using Goudy over here.

29
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,170
It's a really nice typeface.

30
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,800
The next subtype is transitional.

31
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,990
This is a transitional type phase where we're using.

32
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,050
Here is times in your Roman now, times near Roman Baskerville.

33
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,440
Now those are both transitional serve fonts.

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,010
And one thing you'll notice is the difference between thick and thin lines over here.

35
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,630
These strokes, they're bit more pronounced here.

36
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,100
If we're going to compare this to like, say something like old style, you know, we start seeing a

37
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:18,800
little bit more contrast between those strokes when in comparison, but not as much as modern or didn't.

38
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,580
And that is our next subtype.

39
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,110
So don't enter modern.

40
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,480
And this includes typefaces like Dido Bertone.

41
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,260
Right here we have Dido.

42
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,380
And you can tell that these strokes are very, very contrasting.

43
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,840
They're much more pronounced.

44
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:43,180
You'll see them right here in the counters in the O, like in the inside of the E over here.

45
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,910
That thick to thin up here.

46
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:52,570
In the end, you'll see the difference between the strokes on the the left side of the M and the the

47
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,630
far side of the M So you'll see much more contrast with these types of typefaces.

48
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,000
And lastly, we have slab serif now slab serifs.

49
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,380
They have little to no contrast between thick and thin lines.

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,700
You also notice that at the end their serifs are much more rectangular or boxy and typefaces.

51
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,020
In this category they include typefaces like Archer.

52
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,980
We're using courier over here, and that's going to be it for serif typefaces.
