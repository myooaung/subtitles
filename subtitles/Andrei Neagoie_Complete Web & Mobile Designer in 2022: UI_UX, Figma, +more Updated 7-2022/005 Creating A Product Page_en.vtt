00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.990
Hey, everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:08.970
So in our last video, we built a quick home page and I am actually going to build another page.

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.580
I was thinking about building like the product image page or product description page.

4
00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.230
We'll just call it product page for now until we figure out a better name for that.

5
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.730
So we got product page.

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.630
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to start copying some of the stuff that we made.

7
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.500
I mean, this is where using these types of things comes in really handy.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.580
Okay, so what do I have here?

9
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.740
I have 40%.

10
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.550
Let's just copy that.

11
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.610
And when I think about the product page, so I've just laid out my navigation because I may repeat it

12
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.820
there.

13
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.570
I don't know yet.

14
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.320
I'm not sure what's going to be best for this page just yet.

15
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.470
I'm going to go and reference some of my do I have a product page here?

16
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.580
My site map.

17
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.960
Mm hmm.

18
00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.820
Mm hmm.

19
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.220
No, not yet.

20
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.580
So I'm going to actually go to my user flows.

21
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.770
So I have my product page here.

22
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.250
And what I see is I probably like a full screen image.

23
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.450
I may have some similar products.

24
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.820
They obviously have a description of some sort.

25
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.760
There's probably going to be much more there, some content there.

26
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.700
Let's take a look at my sketches as well.

27
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.700
So that's making a purchase.

28
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.670
So let's take a look at my sketches.

29
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.780
So, yeah, I do have like an image with the content.

30
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.220
An ad button.

31
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.900
Mm hmm.

32
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.320
Mm hmm.

33
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.720
Yeah.

34
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.350
Okay.

35
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.000
So this is going to give me a little bit to start off from.

36
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.420
So let's take a look at what we can do.

37
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.510
I'm just going to start copying some content here.

38
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.380
I'm going to just remove this.

39
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.000
We'll keep the price.

40
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.830
Maybe we'll keep that for now.

41
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.660
I think we can keep that so we can definitely create our own.

42
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.000
I think it's fine to be, like, featured there.

43
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.400
We're going to create some.

44
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.640
So I'm thinking like a carousel is going to be here or something.

45
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.490
Just so users can see multiple images.

46
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.270
Okay.

47
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.160
So we have that.

48
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.270
What else do we have?

49
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.350
Let's turn on.

50
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.990
So I'm just going to actually make a grid style.

51
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.000
So I'm just going to call it Grid and I'm going to bring that grid into here as well.

52
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.670
There it is.

53
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.960
Perfect.

54
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.870
So we have a grid, and we're just going to give this a generic product name.

55
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.060
That's cool.

56
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.600
It's not going to expand more than that amount.

57
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.960
Maybe we'll have some copy in terms of like if the description, let's build this over here.

58
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.330
So price is of the utmost importance.

59
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.450
That's my assumption right now.

60
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.010
I was thinking maybe something along the lines of like 18 pixels.

61
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.210
Yeah.

62
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.310
Okay, maybe bolt.

63
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.080
Yeah, that's much better.

64
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.660
Okay, so we have our price.

65
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.880
We have our product name.

66
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.950
I think that's a good start.

67
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.380
Let's think about, like, maybe we'll need a button.

68
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.980
Okay.

69
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.070
Perfect.

70
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.390
I can use this.

71
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:19.170
So what we can do is we can actually make this button hours if we wanted to.

72
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.070
We can just.

73
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.440
I'm going to go over here and Press Option Command B, and that's just going to detach that instance

74
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.640
and we'll be able to essentially do what we kind of want to with it.

75
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.490
We'll have to do the same command.

76
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.440
B You can also right click and detach instance so you can do that as well.

77
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.950
So I'm just going to bring that in.

78
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.430
Two cards.

79
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:48.770
I like it.

80
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.980
That's good.

81
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.040
So we have our big button here that just says Add to Cart.

82
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.890
Let me turn off this grid so you can see it better.

83
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.940
And now a little description here.

84
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.850
So I'm going to just go to my ipsum plug in.

85
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.880
You're like three sentences worth.

86
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.320
Okay.

87
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.760
In 16 regular.

88
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.600
Oh, that's a little bit.

89
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.470
It's maybe like 14 regular four text like that.

90
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.450
Okay.

91
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.460
And obviously it's not looking beautiful.

92
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.970
Beautiful.

93
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.780
But I mean, we can start seeing like how the hierarchy of this page set up.

94
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.710
So when they do come here, they're going to see this big like Call to Action or CTA button to instantly

95
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.880
add this to our cart.

96
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.490
They'll be able to like it if they want to look at all the details they need right up front, they'll

97
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.850
be able to even swipe through a carousel.

98
00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.710
What else should we give them?

99
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.930
When I think of product pages, I'm thinking about reviews.

100
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.000
Definitely reviews.

101
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.630
Let's think of how we can layout reviews.

102
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.800
Let's go to our assets.

103
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.750
Perfect.

104
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.340
Actually.

105
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.720
Let's just grab that.

106
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.500
We can detach this instance.

107
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.200
We can just delete these.

108
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.160
We don't need them.

109
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:44.430
So what I like to do is sometimes I mean, because it's such a vague component library, it's not going

110
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.990
to suit all our needs.

111
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.170
I don't expect it to, really.

112
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:56.250
But we can just start using the components and then just like editing them, removing them, we don't

113
00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.530
need to necessarily keep them the way they are just because I mean, at the end of the day, you need

114
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.030
to use it the way it's going to work for you.

115
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.810
So don't just stick to it even though it's a pain.

116
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.080
So edit it in any which way you need.

117
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.500
So we have a name that I just randomly came up with.

118
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.630
What we can do is maybe have an avatar.

119
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:19.820
Perfect.

120
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.260
I mean, we can use a real image, or we can just.

121
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.770
Do something like that for now.

122
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.280
Maybe like the name goes beside it or below it.

123
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.320
Okay.

124
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:45.850
Okay.

125
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.460
That's good for now.

126
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.100
This is just going to be.

127
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.420
Confined to the size of the content.

128
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.540
And what we're going to do here is we're going to.

129
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.840
Maybe like the date.

130
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.510
Maybe it's a dated review.

131
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.530
Look, we need to start thinking about these types of little.

132
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.480
Pieces of content.

133
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.610
So I want a date on here.

134
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.970
We need a name.

135
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.570
Most definitely.

136
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:26.560
Or username or whatever we decide to go with.

137
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.590
So the name can be the fact that we have our stars.

138
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.990
So we have like a five star, just general one K.

139
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.510
We can even copy this down here and.

140
00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:40.230
Amazing.

141
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.390
This can be like the title of the review.

142
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.520
Amazing product.

143
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.770
This board that.

144
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.740
You can copy this down here.

145
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:58.800
So like, as you can tell, like my workflow is pretty quick now that I have all the pieces I kind of

146
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.210
need and like, there you go.

147
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:09.120
We kind of have a review already built, so just don't get bogged down by too many details, worry about

148
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.280
the type of content you're working with.

149
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:19.230
So I'm going to just group this and just call it review and I'll put it right here and we can just copy

150
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.070
and paste it.

151
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:27.660
And right now I'm just going to think about, okay, three reviews if there's here, let me just fix

152
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.320
this.

153
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.290
Got to fix the constraint.

154
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.750
Top and left is fine.

155
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:37.520
Okay.

156
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.840
So there we go.

157
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.260
Yeah.

158
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.850
So just think about the type of content you need.

159
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.530
Like, I was just thinking about reviews.

160
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.940
What do I often expect?

161
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.170
I expect the user's name.

162
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.430
I expect like maybe an image possibly not required.

163
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.290
Definitely the review.

164
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:57.780
So if we're going based off of stars, I'm going to need that maybe like a title and some content.

165
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.030
Like their actual review is helpful.

166
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.620
Maybe they have images in their review, so I need to maybe think about that in the future.

167
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:13.800
But for now, for our V one or our version one, we're just going to stick to this.

168
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.380
So maybe like there's a secondary button.

169
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.050
And it says something along the lines of See more reviews.

170
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.410
And there we go.

171
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:32.090
So we already have like our product information, we have reviews.

172
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:38.450
And I think maybe like the last kind of bit would be to have.

173
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:54.090
Let's bring this like we created this before, and we can just reuse it and call it, like, similar

174
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.080
products.

175
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.510
So if they don't like this product, maybe they'll find another one that they do like.

176
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:06.800
And without the actual description.

177
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.660
And there you go.

178
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:14.250
I mean, we've just come up with our own product page pretty quickly, just by kind of like thinking

179
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.040
about the details that we wanted on this page really quickly.

180
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.530
Definitely we needed a name, we needed imagery and the ways to kind of customize that.

181
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.050
I'm probably missing some things.

182
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.270
I'm guaranteeing you I'm missing some things.

183
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:33.000
There's probably stuff like if what happens if this certain product has like options like color.

184
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.400
So we need to also think about that maybe sizing if it's like a shirt or something like that or shoes.

185
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.210
So we need to think about all those different types of options.

186
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.090
I think reviews is pretty solid for now.

187
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.460
Similar products looks pretty solid.

188
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.900
See more reviews?

189
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.550
I have to think about that interaction.

190
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.830
Will it go to a new page?

191
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.490
Will it just expand?

192
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:59.700
So there's definitely a lot of work to do here, but I think this is very good for like a first pass.

193
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.680
So what I would do here is just kind of like bring your teammates in and get their feedback on this,

194
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.760
maybe even start testing with some people if you can, if you have the time.

195
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.270
So this is how you make a quick product page in Figma using our library.

196
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.750
In the next video, we're going to create one more page.
