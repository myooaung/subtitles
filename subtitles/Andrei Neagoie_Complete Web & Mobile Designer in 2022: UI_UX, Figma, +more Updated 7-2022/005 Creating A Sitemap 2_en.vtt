00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.580
Hey, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.740
So we finished up our first section or our first tier in terms of our site map recently.

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.149
And there's other things we can do that we haven't necessarily thought about because our actual site

4
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.790
map doesn't necessarily start at our home page.

5
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.790
It starts with our onboarding.

6
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.240
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just duplicate that.

7
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.410
And this is where I kind of like to merge these site maps with a flow chart.

8
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.380
I like to call them product maps.

9
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.220
I mean, it's whatever you like to call them, just make sure you don't call them something that totally

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.830
doesn't relate to what you are doing.

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.100
But so when I come to the onboarding, I will have an option to go to registration.

12
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.880
I will have an option to log in.

13
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.160
This could be like our welcome screen.

14
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.790
If I if I've logged out from the app and I will have the option to skip the onboarding.

15
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.820
So this is like generally we have to think about first time users and also for users that log out,

16
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.520
even though that's probably doesn't happen as often.

17
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:16.520
So if the user decides to log in and register, look at a log in register screen, and that's where

18
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.080
they can log in.

19
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.100
And that's where it will be able to register.

20
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.990
So we're going to make those instances log in and sign up.

21
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.310
We will make those instances login and sign up.

22
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.670
Perfect.

23
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.240
And if they do register.

24
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.660
Remember when we created this user flow?

25
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.580
They'll go through a registration process.

26
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.440
And that will be profiled.

27
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.730
Details.

28
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.350
That they'll have to enter an interest based details.

29
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.660
So I'm just going to do that and I like to line everything up with each other.

30
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.490
So it's nice and neat.

31
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.039
What else is next?

32
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.090
We have to also think about search so we can actually link these.

33
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.020
So if I bring in auto flow onboarding kid leads directly into there, that's where it will typically

34
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.530
lead.

35
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.170
If they do skip the process, it can go there.

36
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.170
So what we can actually do is let's delete that line.

37
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.040
Another thing with auto flow is you can select directly from inside the container as well.

38
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:39.970
So I'm going to take my login that's going to go there and my registration is going to go right there.

39
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:48.820
I can also go from registration to there and this is going to take me back, but I'm not going to actually

40
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.170
do that right now.

41
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.830
So, okay, that looks good.

42
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.940
I like that.

43
00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.430
And this login will take me back into there.

44
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.660
So actually that's getting a little confusing.

45
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.500
I don't think we need that.

46
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.690
I think that's pretty self-explanatory.

47
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.070
What else do we need to do?

48
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.870
Let's talk about search.

49
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.120
If we just.

50
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.930
So now it's not necessarily looking like a sight map anymore.

51
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.640
I mean, this portion is we know the hierarchy of our entire product.

52
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.320
But over here, we're just thinking about like what happens even before the product and what that hierarchy

53
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.070
looks like.

54
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:35.140
So it's just something that helps me figure out how I want to approach framing and actually kind of

55
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.720
helps me think about the different types of.

56
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.200
Inputs or elements.

57
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.780
I'm going to have to design four.

58
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.760
So we're going to have a search.

59
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.430
And we'll have the input.

60
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.300
We'll have a way to have previous searches.

61
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.280
So this can be like a member only thing.

62
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.110
And I'll just change it in a second.

63
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.490
Actually.

64
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.310
Let's just leave it at that.

65
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.940
I like that.

66
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.330
That's totally fine.

67
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.590
So what do we have here?

68
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.910
We have members only.

69
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.260
So that's good.

70
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.510
And search results.

71
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.970
I wanted to kind of just create a little screen for let's fix that search results.

72
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.079
Perfect.

73
00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.430
So we'll have.

74
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.940
Totally that and listening about the content here.

75
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.110
So we'll definitely have an input for research.

76
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.250
We'll have filters.

77
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.920
We will have items.

78
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.680
So now I know essentially what this is going to have.

79
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.190
Let me just make sure everything is.

80
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.400
Aligned.

81
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.940
Let's just bring in auto flow one more time.

82
00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:03.800
And I know that search is going there and I know that this is going to lead to my search results.

83
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.540
So I could actually go in and individually link all the different pages to their part.

84
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.560
I mean, you could do that.

85
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.110
It starts getting confusing because there's so many crossing lines, but this is what our map has begun

86
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.680
to look like.

87
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.290
And you can definitely build this out more.

88
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.540
You can go into here and think about what do categories mean?

89
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.580
What do those pages look like?

90
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.480
But as you can tell, we're probably not going to go past another level.

91
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.320
We'll probably grow one more level in certain areas, and that's it.

92
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.320
The main content that we're really focused on, like searching, is going to be very big primary action.

93
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.470
Same with things like shopping interests and habits.

94
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.870
I have it structured so that these are this is the way that you're necessarily going to come across

95
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.890
on the screen.

96
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.370
That could change, but that's the way I'm thinking about it right now.

97
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.580
So I want you to continue building out this site map as you see fit.

98
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.040
I mean, go for it based off of your sketches and your user flows.

99
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.270
Think about those a bit more.

100
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.880
If there's pieces that you think come up that you or I have missed, I mean, fill in those blanks,

101
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.790
have fun with it, and yeah, go ahead and build your own sitemap.
