1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,450
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,470
So I'm going to be talking about something really interesting, and that is motion.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,960
Now, motion is something I love to use in designs, and I think everyone should be using them in design.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,560
And it doesn't necessarily mean that you need to incorporate some complex animations or complex micro

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,240
interactions and stuff like that.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,830
But motion can really, really help add that level of polish, but also just overall create a great

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,050
user experience for your users.

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,870
So I want to start right off and talk about the importance of motion, because it is incredibly important.

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,390
Just look at this screen.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,420
Beautiful swipes, beautiful state changes, moving to a detail screen, seeing the little micro interaction

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,390
when something is added to a cart.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,780
Let's take a look at that right there.

13
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:57,080
Little subtleties like that just really improve the user experience and you know, users are easily

14
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,700
able to follow along.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:05,239
It's such a crucial element in making those interactions with a brand's digital product more streamlined

16
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,290
and intuitive.

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,160
Now, this is a quote I really love motion tell stories.

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,090
Everything in an app is a sequence and motion is your guide.

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,040
For every button clicked in screen transition, there is a story that follows now.

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,180
This is by Craig Denner.

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,000
He's part of the former human interface team at Apple.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,500
And this is so true.

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:31,010
I mean, your motion should help you tell your app story, whether that be moving from one screen to

24
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:37,940
the next or just adding something and getting some sort of visual cue, it could really help not only

25
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,590
tell that story, but just heighten that brand's experience for the user.

26
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,000
But the truth is it's often an afterthought.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,010
So although it's very, very important, designers who try to incorporate motion usually do it based

28
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,530
off of gut feeling, or they do it way too late in the process and it comes off looking kind of amateurish.

29
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,740
And, you know, there's just not a lot of thought put into it.

30
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,870
And that's just a wrong way to go about it sometimes.

31
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:11,000
You know, I understand there's tight budgets, tight deadlines, and we can't always put that level

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,590
of polish into our designs.

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,520
But motion is incredibly important and we should strive to incorporate that earlier in our design process.

34
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,820
Although motion is very important, it should be used with a light.

35
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,320
Use it as a tool for providing users with easily noticeable smooth feedback.

36
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,160
So let's take this for example.

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,510
This is really beautiful.

38
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,210
I'm not saying this is bad or anything.

39
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:42,100
This really suits the type of website and the brand's tone I can see right off the bat.

40
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,750
So this fits perfectly.

41
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,530
But could you imagine if somebody did this for like a financial institution?

42
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,420
Just a different type of brand?

43
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,260
I don't think that would be something that's fits and, you know, too much motion, especially maybe

44
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,680
on a smaller screen like mobile that has this much motion.

45
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:05,640
It just may not fit and it may just degrade that user experience if it isn't really relevant to the

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,350
task.

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,510
So this is a nice kind of like an intro screen animation.

48
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,010
But if something like this happened, every single time I click something that would get really old

49
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,510
fast.

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,000
So really think about the user's experience and that user flow.

51
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,480
Think about the type of brand you're designing for as well.

52
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:30,220
Now when you are animations are subtle like this, you know, that's really unobtrusive and it's brief

53
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,440
and they can improve the user experience and can really communicate feedback and stay changed and stuff

54
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,140
like that.

55
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,460
I mean, this is a nice little animation and we don't necessarily need to do this, but this is really

56
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,680
nice and thoughtful and it really kind of probably fits into what this designer is using it for.

57
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,110
So little unobtrusive animations like that are really nice for the user experience.

58
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,800
You know, they create delight, but that's not all what motion is used for.

59
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:03,190
Let's take a look at things for motion, for like state changes and, you know, just preventing any

60
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,750
type of disorientation.

61
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,750
When a user clicks into a card in this app over here.

62
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,160
You can tell easily where you're going.

63
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,980
And there isn't any disorientation.

64
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,019
I mean, it's not instantaneous.

65
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,690
There's a nice flow in terms of going from that card to this screen.

66
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:31,260
So even going back when the user clicks back on the back button at the top left, it just smoothly goes

67
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,250
back up to the card.

68
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,240
So I mean, that's just really great use of motion there.

69
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,660
It's not too much.

70
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,740
It's just the right amount and it's totally unobtrusive.

71
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,930
It just adds to that user experience.

72
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,120
And overall, I feel like it just adds to that level of fidelity that I think we all kind of strive

73
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,630
for.

74
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:56,940
So this is a great example of just using it for the just purpose of state change and just visual cue

75
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,600
as well.

76
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,000
This is another great example.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,580
I mean, motion should not be overused and it could be really overwhelming, like I mentioned before.

78
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,960
And it could distract users.

79
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,530
If you can tell, like when they swipe that card and they go into this card, motion here is very subtle.

80
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,810
And the user knows exactly which page they're on.

81
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,700
See, there's personal, there's work, and then we're going to write into the work screen.

82
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,690
So this is really, really subtle and it's a great example to show the different types of state changes

83
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,180
when the user is clicking on things or swiping through things.

84
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,960
Just generally interacting with the app.

85
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,380
So remember, good motion is really invisible.

86
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,850
Users shouldn't notice that they're looking at like animations or motion or like too much motion.

87
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,300
It shouldn't be distracting.

88
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,480
They should just notice the great experience that you have provided.

89
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,030
Now, this is an example of maybe too much motion.

90
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,660
Now, these are great, great types of animations we have going on here.

91
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,740
I think they're pretty interesting.

92
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,930
And I think this is a great visual exploration because, you know, over time we can fine tune these

93
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,940
types of things, you know, to swipe through like I can imagine this could be like a record cards and

94
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,140
you just swiping through a click like a music, a record and listen to music.

95
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,440
Same with something like this, that you can just be swiping through different cards, you know, may

96
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,500
not show all the information, but it really depends what the content is there.

97
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,600
But the reason why I have this example is because, you know, if this isn't fine tuned and it's just

98
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,440
provided for the user just like this, this is a lot of motion.

99
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,000
Like, let's take this, for example.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,780
So many things are flickering on and off the screen, so many shadows.

101
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,250
The contrast is really high.

102
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,060
And when the user actually clicks on something, things start to flicker.

103
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,620
So you'll see it right about now.

104
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,480
And yeah, it's just it's a lot of motion.

105
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,230
So over time we should just fine tune those little things and get that right.

106
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,820
So in our next video, we're actually going to jump right into Figma and we're going to talk about like

107
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,990
the purpose of animations and how we can make our animations much more purposeful.

108
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,650
So I can't wait to teach you that and I'm super excited.

109
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,790
Let's jump right in.
