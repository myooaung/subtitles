1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.890
Okay.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.660
Now we learned a bunch of different concepts.

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.960
We learned about different tools, we learned about different panels.

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.720
And you're probably thinking, Daniel, I just want to kind of get started.

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.540
I want to jump in and trust me, I truly believe you.

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.860
And that's what we're going to do right now.

7
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.820
We're going to build a very, very quick learning hero section just to test out what we just learned.

8
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.510
Now, I have a couple of images that I dropped into here.

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:32.549
The easiest way to drop in an image is to either if you go in here, you can place an image which is

10
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:38.790
like literally it is uploading an image from your desktop or a file folder over here.

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.160
You can even get these images through a plug in.

12
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.150
And we're going to learn about how to use that in different lessons in the future.

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.290
But I have these images here and I make them available for you and you'll be able to use them in your

14
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.950
file.

15
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.460
I really encourage you either to follow along and try to recreate what I'm doing or just try and do

16
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.180
your own thing.

17
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.860
I mean, it's just for fun.

18
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.780
It's just to get used to the program before we actually jump in and start doing some more complex things.

19
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.069
So let's do it.

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.250
So one thing that we didn't necessarily go over really quickly was the grid and auto layout.

21
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.010
So the layout grid is really important for laying out things on your frame.

22
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.750
And so if I select the frame, I'll notice in the Design Properties panel, I'm just going to click

23
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.560
layout grid and this little grid comes up and that's not what we're going to use.

24
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.600
That's more for creating icons.

25
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.030
But if I click on that grid and I click columns, that's what we want.

26
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.010
So just follow along and I'll teach you how to create better grids in the future.

27
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.050
We're just going to set the count to 12.

28
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.490
We're going to set the margin to 100.

29
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.120
Your margin is your side on the left and right, and we're going to set our gutter to 32.

30
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.270
So let's just stick with that for now.

31
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.830
But this is going to be our guide.

32
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.080
Now this isn't going to show up in the final designs.

33
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.920
You can toggle these on and off if you go to your view section here.

34
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.250
You can show your grids, you have your pixel grid, which we have shown, but your layout grid now

35
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.310
this is my shortcut which is controlled.

36
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.230
G So if I click control.

37
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.320
G It's going to toggle it on and off, and that's just there for you to use for your guide.

38
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.390
It's not going to show up in your final designs, like I said, but we're going to do that and I'm just

39
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:40.040
going to place this here and we can scale this image any which way we want, so we'll just place that

40
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.880
there for now.

41
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.290
Now we're going to do is we're going to create a company page, we're going to create some shapes.

42
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.210
So I'm going to select my rectangle tool.

43
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.890
I'm going to go up here.

44
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.320
I'm just going to select my rectangle tool like that.

45
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.310
Let's zoom in.

46
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.620
And let's give it a fill of say like.

47
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.100
Like a read like that.

48
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.110
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to maybe create another shape.

49
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.670
So I have polygon.

50
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.980
This is my triangle.

51
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.260
And let's give that another color.

52
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.290
Maybe like a yellow.

53
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.200
Bring that over here and I'm going to select my circle shape.

54
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.150
And make a circle.

55
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.840
And make this one maybe like blue.

56
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.210
And there we go.

57
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.130
So we kind of have like these shapes.

58
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.650
I'm going to actually use them as my logo.

59
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.100
So I'm going to just like rotate this any which way I want circles, obviously.

60
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.940
Fine.

61
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.170
We'll just keep these together.

62
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.520
So we have our little logo here and if we wanted to, we can group these.

63
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.990
So if I right click.

64
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.470
I can go in here and group this selection so I can easily move that any which way I want.

65
00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.410
It's going to be on my grid.

66
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.550
It's going to be at the top.

67
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.690
Perfect.

68
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.130
So I'm going to create like a consultancy website, hero page.

69
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.300
Look at these people.

70
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.040
They're talking about something really important.

71
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.450
Let's get some text.

72
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.330
So I'm going to write T, I'm just going to drag.

73
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.830
And so I have some text.

74
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:24.430
So let's write Transforming the way or organizations

75
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.970
define design and build software.

76
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.510
And if I select it all, I can go over here and change the font.

77
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.540
Now, a really nice font I like is Merriweather.

78
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.940
I'm going to change the font weight.

79
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.150
And keep it to regular.

80
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.330
We can even change the font size.

81
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.190
That's going to be fine.

82
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.690
These different options here.

83
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.810
So I'd like to do is I'll just do an auto height.

84
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.540
So that's based off of how many lines of text you have.

85
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.730
So I'm going to do that.

86
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.840
And I'm going to let that go all the way.

87
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.930
Or we can just do something.

88
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.400
There we go.

89
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.240
So it's going to take up five columns and my image is going to take up.

90
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.240
Seven.

91
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.300
So that's looking really good.

92
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.270
What else I'm going to do is I'm going to make another text.

93
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.040
And we're going to write some more copy.

94
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.250
We connect strategy.

95
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.530
Now I have all this text prepared.

96
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.660
And.

97
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.590
You can either just like redesign somebody's landing page for this little test.

98
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.890
That's what I'm kind of doing.

99
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.990
So data services.

100
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.010
What else do we have here?

101
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.050
To bring your organization's

102
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:16.480
most valuable, software driven experiences to life.

103
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.120
Now I'm going to select this all with command, and I'm going to make this a different font.

104
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.580
Let's do something like Open Sans.

105
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.290
That's nice.

106
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.350
And we're going to bring that down.

107
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.540
14 is a little too small.

108
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.890
We can go up a little bit.

109
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.030
18 is fine and we'll keep it on regular.

110
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.320
And once again, I'm just going to make it auto height and it's going to be the same width if we wanted

111
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.530
to.

112
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.140
We can even bring that in a little bit more.

113
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.900
And what we're going to do next is we are going to make a button.

114
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.280
Now, the way I like making buttons is I like making them within a frame.

115
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.990
So you can put frames within frames.

116
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.490
Like I have a frame tool selected right now and I can make a frame and I can make another frame if I

117
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.270
wanted to.

118
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.680
So this is my button.

119
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:09.250
You can't really see it right now, and I'm just going to put it right here, but I'm going to fill

120
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.610
it.

121
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.910
I'm going to fill that frame with my team colors.

122
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.020
So let's say black.

123
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.450
Uh, no.

124
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.510
Let's do blue.

125
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.000
There's my button.

126
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.110
And inside my button, I'm going to select a text tool, and I'm going to select inside that frame.

127
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.270
And if you notice inside my layers, my text will go underneath my frame.

128
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.210
So now we have kind of this layer within a layer here.

129
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.460
So I'm going to say let's do learn more.

130
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.240
So I'm going to select all of that.

131
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.000
I'm going to select the fill and let's do white.

132
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:50.410
I'm also going to set that to centered and I'm going to make sure that it's auto width.

133
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:57.100
So that means it's going to grow with the actual width of the copy inside.

134
00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.740
So I'm going to select that text again.

135
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.920
I'm just going to center it within this frame.

136
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.250
Now, this is where things get a little bit interesting.

137
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.280
Now I'm going to set this frame.

138
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.610
And what you can do is you can do this in two ways.

139
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.740
We're going to rename this to Button first.

140
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.960
You can do this in two ways.

141
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.520
You can select your text and you can go to your constraints.

142
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.040
Remember what I said about having something within a frame?

143
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.580
Resize easily.

144
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.789
You can send it to center and center and every time you move your frame it's just going to move.

145
00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:40.230
If you set it to left and right, what's going to happen is it's going to shrink because it's only the

146
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.130
size of the text.

147
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.950
So that means you would need to expand the text.

148
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:50.310
Now I'm holding option here while I'm expanding it all the way to each side.

149
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:57.810
Now, if I go back and I send it back to center, that's one way to make a big button and we can round

150
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.130
the corners on that.

151
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.660
So I said It's a five.

152
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.800
And clicked enter to confirm that and I'm going to hide my grid.

153
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.420
It's controlled g for me.

154
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:12.460
So I have a nice button, but if I wanted to do, say, an auto layout.

155
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.500
I can click this little auto layout while I'm selecting the button frame.

156
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.540
Click that.

157
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.610
And what it's going to do is if I have two or more items within this frame, it's going to automatically

158
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.980
lay it out in a horizontal direction.

159
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:35.350
So if I say copy this and paste it, it will be automatically added and it will grow the entire frame.

160
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.500
You'll see that the space between is ten.

161
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.820
If I make it say something like 24, it's going to grow.

162
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.550
If I make the space around, you can make that over here.

163
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:57.400
So this is your top and your bottom, your left and your right and where it is within this actual frame.

164
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.460
So everything is to the left and the right.

165
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:06.280
So your auto layout right now is these are kind of like your constraints of your auto layout, all the

166
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:06.790
content.

167
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.000
I want them to be centered to the middle in this case.

168
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.040
Right now they're packed together, but you can also have space between.

169
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:23.610
So if I select this frame and I scale it, they're going to be to the left and the right in this case,

170
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.580
or top to the bottom if there's positioned vertically.

171
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.410
So let's remove all this.

172
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:32.460
I'm going to command Z all the way back, but we're going to keep the auto layout.

173
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.670
Mm hmm.

174
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:40.450
And what we're going to do is we're going to set this can be set to zero, because we only have one

175
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.290
thing in here.

176
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.880
We're going to go in here.

177
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.440
We're going to set this to the center.

178
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.020
We're going to do 16 for the top.

179
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.000
16 for the bottom.

180
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:57.260
We're going to have space of 40 on the left and space of 48 right, and that's perfect.

181
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.790
So it's packed in there and we are going to set the constraints.

182
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:07.580
So if it's hug contents, that means it's going to not grow when I move it left or right.

183
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.810
So if I select this frame.

184
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.860
And move it left or right.

185
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.620
Those things are not going to grow.

186
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.150
So let's make this a little bit smaller.

187
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.850
So I don't want that to grow.

188
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.510
I just want to stick it to the left and the right.

189
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.230
Perfect.

190
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:27.990
But I want all these to be in their own frame as well so we can do that.

191
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.400
So I'm going to select them all and I'm going to put them in a frame.

192
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.410
Now, there's a couple of ways we can do this.

193
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:43.720
If I right click, I can go to frame selection and the shorthand for that is Option Command and G.

194
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.050
So now they're all in their own frame.

195
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.570
So I'm going to rename that content.

196
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.040
And here I'm going to go to auto layout again.

197
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.460
And I'm going to position them apart.

198
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.520
16.

199
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.420
Let's make it 24, a little bit more space, maybe 24.

200
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.410
And what I'm going to do is.

201
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.540
I'm going to leave everything like that.

202
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.470
That's perfect.

203
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:19.140
The constraints I'm going to put fixed and I'm going to make sure that it's going to scale left and

204
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.680
right.

205
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.880
We can leave it to hugging content because if I add, say more text at the bottom, so I'm going to

206
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:31.130
command C, command V, this frame is going to grow and this is great for adding content.

207
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:37.700
Like if you have lists and you want to constantly add new items to your list, you can do that with

208
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.350
something like auto layout.

209
00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:45.020
It's really great for growing lists or shrinking things, awesome especially for content like this.

210
00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:50.840
If I wanted to say add more content, everything's going to grow the more I type.

211
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.280
Okay, so now that we have that set up, it's going to be left and right.

212
00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.050
And if we go back to our frame.

213
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.420
Now that is going to shrink once we set the content within.

214
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.880
So the content within is right now is a fixed width.

215
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:13.020
But if I do fill to container and this one is filled to container, so it's going to go all the way

216
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.860
to the edge.

217
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.830
Let's see how everything moves.

218
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.680
So now it's automatically responsive.

219
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.270
Now that is pretty wild for me.

220
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.160
I love that.

221
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.420
That about figma.

222
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.070
Perfect.

223
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.560
So we have that built out.

224
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.030
The image is very similar.

225
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.920
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to select that.

226
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.510
I'm going to do left and right.

227
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.580
We're actually going to bring this image in.

228
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.740
Let's overlay it.

229
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.710
And we can do something like this.

230
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:49.410
And we can make the image left and right.

231
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.100
We'll make this left and right, and you can start seeing how this plays nicely together.

232
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.320
So we kind of have like our own responsive.

233
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.490
A little design, really cool stuff.

234
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:07.280
Next we're going to do is I'm going to select the text layer again.

235
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.910
And I'm going to have some navigation options.

236
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.480
I'm going to have home on a command C, command v.

237
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.780
I have a about.

238
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.430
I have services.

239
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.570
I have case studies.

240
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.820
And the last one, I have contact.

241
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.490
So these are all my options.

242
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.840
And I can do that same thing.

243
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.850
I can right click in while I select all of them, frame that selection.

244
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:48.470
We committed to an auto layout and we can space them any which way we want.

245
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.650
And I'm just going to put them all the way on to the right for now.

246
00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.000
In center it.

247
00:14:55.060 --> 00:15:01.030
If I select all these, I'm going to go up here and I'm just going to center them on that vertical axis.

248
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:04.630
And now we kind of have our header really cool stuff here.

249
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.810
So this button, let's talk about quickly components.

250
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.870
So now we have this button that I want to reuse, say through the website as our primary.

251
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:18.640
What I can do is I can create a component out of it by clicking that button up there and I can rename

252
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.380
this component to primary.

253
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:26.350
Now I'm going to go into my prototypes and I'm going to want to use that primary.

254
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.030
So I'm gonna go into my assets tab.

255
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:34.120
It's on desktop right now, and now I can reuse that primary button that we just created.

256
00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.580
I'm holding down option while I'm dragging it.

257
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:44.650
Option and shift is going to let me drag it while keeping it on the on the same vertical axis.

258
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:51.460
You can space that and snap it to grid and we can modify this and create different variations of that

259
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.320
primary button if we wanted to.

260
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.060
But this primary button.

261
00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.050
Is reusable now, so I'm going to delete those and go back.

262
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.940
So as you can see with what we learned, we could easily create a little web page.

263
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.410
We created some shapes here.

264
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.300
We learned how to use our text layers.

265
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.850
We learned how to create components with buttons.

266
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:19.100
We had images, constraints, creating a responsive website, using frames, and using the new auto

267
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.590
layout feature that Figma had just released.

268
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.850
And we were easily able to create something that looks really great.

269
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.770
So let's toggle that grid.

270
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.450
So I have control.

271
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:34.730
G Let's toggle that and that looks really, really nice.

272
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.910
It looks really professional, and now you're ready to go.

273
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:43.280
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me and I'll get back to you really quickly.
