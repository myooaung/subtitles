00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.330
All right, everybody, let's keep going.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.070
What else can we do to this page to make it look more like this one?

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.550
Well, I want the text uppercase here.

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.300
You can see over here that this is all in capitals.

5
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.590
This is not.

6
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.020
I mean, I could change this if I want to.

7
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.110
Capital letters.

8
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.440
I can also add a style.

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.380
To make everything uppercase.

10
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.850
But there's also another useful one that comes with bootstrap.

11
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.070
I can actually add a class.

12
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.800
And use a class in bootstrap called text dash.

13
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.000
Uppercase.

14
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.840
If I save this and refresh, look at that.

15
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.820
Everything is uppercase.

16
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.320
That's awesome.

17
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.010
Now, what about the button?

18
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.510
Let's add some bootstrap styling to the buttons.

19
00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.120
Again, let's say you don't know how to add bootstrap styles or you don't know the classes.

20
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.330
We can always go to the documentation and search buttons.

21
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.320
There we go.

22
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.070
We see that we have some button classes that we can use.

23
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.500
In our case, let's use this one button primary.

24
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.550
So I'm going to copy.

25
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.280
Come back.

26
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.830
And with this button, let's give it a class of button primary.

27
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.100
If I save and refresh.

28
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.120
Hey, look at that.

29
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.550
We have a bootstrap on already.

30
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.590
That's really, really cool.

31
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.510
But you know what?

32
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.600
I want to have a different color, right?

33
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.810
I want the bun to look more like this.

34
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.890
Something nicer.

35
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.790
So we can add our own custom CSS.

36
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.120
Let's call this class button Excel for extra large button.

37
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.150
And this isn't a bootstrap class.

38
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.010
If I save this and refresh, nothing will happen.

39
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.850
Instead, we can create this button, excel right here in our own stylesheet.

40
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.300
So let's say button or dot button.

41
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.550
Excel.

42
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:23.990
Is going to be let's make this a little bit bigger, is going to have padding of, let's say, one REM

43
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.080
on the sides and to our M top bottom.

44
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.860
If I refresh this, that's better.

45
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.820
That's a lot bigger.

46
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.060
So we have an extra large button now.

47
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.840
We can add sizes or we can add different properties here.

48
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.900
But since we named this class button XL, we should just leave it the way it's describing things.

49
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.880
That is to make the button larger.

50
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.240
So instead, let's just modify the existing classes that we have.

51
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.500
Which is the bun and bun primary.

52
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.480
So if I go back here.

53
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.810
We can say that the button class.

54
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.560
We'll have a font.

55
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.760
Wait.

56
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:15.840
Of, let's say, 700 and a border radius, that is to make the edges more circular and we'll give it

57
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.220
300 pixels.

58
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.810
If I save this and refresh, that's a lot better.

59
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.350
I like that and I want this capitalized as well.

60
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.150
And I can use the.

61
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.260
Text uppercase class as we've seen before.

62
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.450
Or I can just in here say text transform.

63
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.820
And just say uppercase.

64
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.180
So just use a CSS class for a refresh that looks really, really nice.

65
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.530
Now, let's keep going here.

66
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.850
Let's add another.

67
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.800
Class here, which is button primary.

68
00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.610
So we're just adding on to the bootstrap styles that we have and we'll just give it a background color

69
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.760
of what should we do?

70
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.670
Well, if we go back to this page again, we inspect right here by hovering and we click.

71
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.460
We see over here as we scroll down what color we're using over here.

72
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.180
Let's see.

73
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.190
Where is the color?

74
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.700
Let's see.

75
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.410
Let's see.

76
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.710
Oh, there it is, right here.

77
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.390
So I'm going to copy.

78
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.660
The color added here.

79
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.150
If I hit save and refresh and look at that, that's really, really nice.

80
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.150
But one thing you'll notice is that the border over here, if we scroll or zoom in, you see that the

81
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.740
border has a bit of blue and that's default for.

82
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.390
The bootstrap theme.

83
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.230
So instead, let's add a border as well.

84
00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:00.470
So call it border color and give it the same color if I refresh.

85
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.820
That's much better.

86
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.730
Although now we're hovering and it's turning blue.

87
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.310
That's okay, but I don't like it.

88
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.300
Let's make it hover.

89
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.020
So it's still orange, but maybe a little bit darker orange.

90
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.970
So what can we do here?

91
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.930
Again, we've seen this before.

92
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.130
We can just say button primary.

93
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.220
Colin Hover.

94
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.070
And in here we can just add background.

95
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.680
Color to be something a little bit different than this.

96
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.790
In this case, we're going to use a color that is E.

97
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.280
Four be zero eight.

98
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.240
Don't worry.

99
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.490
I didn't memorize this.

100
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.090
This is just something that.

101
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.380
Well, I knew that I used when I made this website first.

102
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.340
So don't worry.

103
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.620
You never need to memorize hex colors.

104
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.350
Next, we'll do the same for the border color.

105
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.250
So once again, we'll make the border color the same as we have here.

106
00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.930
That's great.

107
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.850
I also want to increase the border width actually to just make it a little bit bigger when we hover

108
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:07.240
over it.

109
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:14.770
So let's just give it an extra four pixels and let's save if I refresh and hover.

110
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.970
Hey, look at that.

111
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.680
That's awesome.

112
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.450
So that's looking really, really nice.

113
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.130
So we have the button.

114
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.760
It's looking pretty good.

115
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.800
We have our header that's looking pretty great as well.

116
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:35.900
The other thing I want to add is this little line here just to give it a little extra flair to the page

117
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.600
and we can use something called an h r here or a horizontal line.

118
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.250
So the h r tag which we can just put in between.

119
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.670
So let's say H are.

120
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.130
Is a horizontal line.

121
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.720
So if I refresh here.

122
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.250
I don't know if you can see it.

123
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.390
Well, because it's dark, but let's add some styling to it.

124
00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.490
So let's say in here that we want the cars on our page to have a border.

125
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.820
Color.

126
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.160
Of the orange that we've had before, which is this one over here.

127
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.980
So let's say border color is this.

128
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.420
If I save and refresh.

129
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.360
All right, look at that.

130
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.940
There's our little line.

131
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.770
It's a little thin, though, so let's add a bit of sizing.

132
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.780
So I'll say border.

133
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.740
With.

134
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.690
And give it, let's say three pixels.

135
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.570
And if I refresh, all right, that's getting bigger.

136
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.170
That's good.

137
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.200
But I don't want this to be the entire page.

138
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.860
I only want it a little bit just like we see it here.

139
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:49.860
So we have a CSS property here that we can use called max width, which as the name suggests, tells

140
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.460
us exactly what's the maximum width of this thing.

141
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.210
In our case, let's say 65 pixels.

142
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.070
So if I save this and refresh, that's much better.

143
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.800
All right.

144
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.950
We're making progress here, but there's an issue, right?

145
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:12.350
Right now we have the content that we want, but it's all all over the place.

146
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.560
It's kind of ugly, isn't it?

147
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.480
We want everything centered, maybe around this laptop over here.

148
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.990
And this is where bootstrap really shines.

149
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.660
So let's figure that out in the next video.
