00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.390
Hey, everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.950
So we've been talking a lot about cars, and I think that's totally fine.

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.080
And I think we're going to do a little bit more actually.

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.980
Now, I've been working on the order list, so when you make an order, it has different variations

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.390
like ship.

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.280
I have one that's almost there.

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.470
I have one that says Delivered.

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.590
And we also have a list like you can probably filter.

9
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.620
And that list has a title and you know, different cards look different for things that are in the shipping

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.370
process.

11
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.110
And I've actually started to build out like a little card like that.

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.160
So I have one that's over here and this is just like kind of like a live tracker.

13
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.040
And maybe this becomes a component.

14
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.390
It probably should become a component, but we're going to create a recipe for now and then that's another

15
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.780
thing.

16
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.480
As I said, design systems will evolve.

17
00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.050
You will add to them, you will remove from them things that were once useful don't become useful anymore,

18
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.810
and things that are needed become components so you can reuse them.

19
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.570
So in this case, this will probably become a component.

20
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.080
Now let me show you what it will look like.

21
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.240
So if I had an order card.

22
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.910
Okay.

23
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.500
So I'm just going to grab just the regular order card.

24
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:29.510
So this will be that with this, like I said, we can make this into an auto layout.

25
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.850
So let's bring this all the way up so we can see exactly what we're working with.

26
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.810
So we have an order shift card over here and we have our product.

27
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.690
So this is probably like a $15 book.

28
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.510
I mean, start up.

29
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.320
So we have our shift.

30
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.500
And what I've done here, I've gone ahead and I started thinking about creating like, you know, like

31
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.010
a little tracker, something very nice for people to kind of see how things are panning out with their

32
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.800
package.

33
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.289
You know, there's probably a portion of this that we're missing something here.

34
00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.850
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to take pills small.

35
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.140
We can even use the base pill in this instance.

36
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.360
I'm going to use the base at least.

37
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.980
And I'm just going to say something like Delivered by.

38
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.820
0808

39
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.610
2020.

40
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.380
Even though we are past that date at the moment, so we are going to be delivered by then and that base

41
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.030
pill, we can also just.

42
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.630
Change that UI we can do a couple of different things.

43
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.470
It really depends.

44
00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:00.140
Like we can make it background of yellow and so the text can be dark like that.

45
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.310
This is, I think, fine for now.

46
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.410
So maybe delivery by that date, that looks good.

47
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.070
What I'm going to do is I'm actually going to turn this into an auto layout.

48
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.690
Big surprise.

49
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.900
Well, so let's see what happened here.

50
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.880
So we have a package tracker.

51
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.930
Let's see what happens so that.

52
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.880
Interesting.

53
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.410
That didn't.

54
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.910
So what we can do is rent a copy of that.

55
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.100
Select where I want it.

56
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.320
So that is one.

57
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.830
Piece of the list.

58
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.460
And over here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create an effect.

59
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.490
And the background product we can call this medium.

60
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.720
So this is the problem.

61
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.560
We have a package tracker and so we're using the background color.

62
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.850
That's the problem.

63
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.910
OC, OC and this is going to be our background color.

64
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.530
We're going to just use a frame.

65
00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:25.140
And we are going to use ten pixels for the radius and then we are going to apply the recipe to that.

66
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.050
So let's not clip that content right now.

67
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.010
And there you go.

68
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.090
We have a card that is probably.

69
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.640
To unnoticeable.

70
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.900
So we have a card here.

71
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.180
So this probably should become a component.

72
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.200
I'll leave it up to your discretion if you want to do that.

73
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.530
We have UI stroke just just that border there so that you can distinguish between that and the next

74
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.040
card.

75
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.330
So we have our order status shipped so we can say order shipped.

76
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:06.970
And what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to create another frame and I'm going to call this order

77
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:16.870
list and you guessed it, all the layout and we're gonna use 16 pixels and we are going to go ahead

78
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.910
and grab one of our cards here.

79
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.250
We're going to go and find our order card.

80
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.320
Where is it?

81
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:28.750
And we'll find a delivered card and we'll just place it there for now.

82
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.600
And this delivered card will go into our order list.

83
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.610
Perfect.

84
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.900
So that is fine.

85
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.640
So I can actually remove this background.

86
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.320
Let's.

87
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.310
Make that like that.

88
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.050
Let's.

89
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.390
To that.

90
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:12.620
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove the background color or the background.

91
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.350
So we have our map tracker.

92
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.550
We have our map.

93
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.800
We can just pump that up.

94
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.310
And yeah, so I am going to actually remove the stroke because I think, you know, we can just keep

95
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.920
it flat and these can be maybe spaced outs.

96
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:45.690
Let's see, these can be spaced out probably by 24 and these ones probably around eight.

97
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.620
So we have that connection.

98
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.860
So I think that's kind of fine for now.

99
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.030
I'm liking it.

100
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.270
What we're going to do is we can add another item.

101
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.680
So when I think of these lists, I think there's something here.

102
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.380
We probably put a horizontal rule, but let's move ahead.

103
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.860
So I'm going to go back and I'm going to make that title.

104
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.930
So if I want to think about order list, we probably should be able to filter it.

105
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.570
Let's do that.

106
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.890
And then let's grab a filter button.

107
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:40.030
So I've been using like this checkbox variant that I've made where it's so let's do grow.

108
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:47.050
That's been really good and we're just going to call this filters so we can probably filter by different

109
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:52.390
things, price and maybe just timeline.

110
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.620
Let's.

111
00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.740
Bring that together.

112
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.460
We can.

113
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.980
We can just call this filters.

114
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.390
And I'm going to expand that all the way to the full width.

115
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.260
I'm going way out here.

116
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:27.640
So I'm going to take that and I am going to make sure they are center to each other.

117
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.530
And then I am actually going to take my friend as now.

118
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.220
Not resized.

119
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.270
And I'm going to put the filter list in there.

120
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:47.780
So I have my order list, I have my filters, and I'm going to create another frame which called this

121
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.980
a filter list.

122
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:55.250
And yeah, order layout 24 pixels.

123
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:01.560
Maybe this one is 16, but.

124
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.690
Let's clean that up.

125
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.980
So now, like, you can create an easy list of different types of products.

126
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:15.980
You'll notice that like we have our last three months plus our filters, we have like a current shipped

127
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:16.910
status.

128
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:23.090
I mean, you can also go ahead and change some of these things.

129
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.250
Like you can say this is in transit.

130
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:32.210
So you have different variations, kind of like a live tracker that we've designed here that you can

131
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.870
just kind of like copy, I can just take this like this.

132
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.880
I need to use an order list right now for what I'm designing or a filter list, and I'm just going to

133
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.650
drop that right into my designs.

134
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.170
Easy peasy.

135
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.590
So yeah, definitely use recipes.

136
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.030
Recipes are going to speed up your workflow.

137
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:55.730
Recipes are going to set a good standard for your team on what different collection of components look

138
00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:00.110
like, what components are going to interact with each other, whether that be like these cards or like

139
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.790
buttons, checkboxes.

140
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.830
It also sometimes make you and force you to think about what you may be missing from a component.

141
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:12.380
So we may go back and add this map tracker as a component where people can kind of use that default

142
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.870
map just to display a map.

143
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:23.990
And also using this kind of pinging thing, we can possibly even animate that so we can make it go in

144
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.280
and out or more specifically, just the background.

145
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.450
We can just make it pulse when we think about like micro interaction.

146
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:38.180
So pull those different things out of your designs, they're going to really help you figure out what

147
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.240
you need to build and also make your workflow much more easier.

148
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.650
That's why I do a lot of these things.

149
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.920
This design system is just going to help us, you know, add to this app, we can turn it around, make

150
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.970
something else from this.

151
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:54.200
But it sets a good standard on what a design system should kind of look like, and it's going to be

152
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.280
different for everyone.

153
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.300
So this is my design of the orders list.
