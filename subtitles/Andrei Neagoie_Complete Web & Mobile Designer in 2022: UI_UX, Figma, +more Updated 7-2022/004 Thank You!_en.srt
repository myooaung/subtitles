00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,870
Hey there.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,800
I wanted to take a second at the end of it all, at the end of your learning journey, to just say this

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,330
one thing and that is.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,230
Thank you.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,860
I know your time is valuable.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,079
We have limited time on this earth.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:23,490
And you decided to spend your time and your money, frankly, with us doing something that takes a long

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,770
time to learn so truly from the bottom of our hearts.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,800
I know it sounds cheesy, but thank you for dedicating your time and effort to this course.

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:40,320
I hope you got what you wanted out of it and congratulate yourself for getting this far because a lot

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,220
of people start.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,300
A lot of people have hopes of learning, but they give up along the way.

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,800
But you didn't do that.

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,850
You work through the challenges, the problems, and you got here.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,390
Now, your learning journey doesn't end here.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,410
It keeps going.

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,790
But I hope this created a foundation for you to go off and learn things on your own, get a promotion,

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,560
get hired, start a new business, whatever it may be.

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,920
Again, thank you and best of luck with your learning journey.

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,300
This is just the beginning of whatever you decide to do in the future.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,640
So thank you and good luck.
