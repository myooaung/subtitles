1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,569
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,990
Now we're going to talk about how we can create our very own form and the questions we often ask ourselves

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,510
in terms of the types of inputs we want to use.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,140
We're probably not going to create our own components and go really deep here into what that looks like

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:23,130
just yet, because we want to just come up with some quick concepts in terms of what types of content

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,390
we're going to see on the page.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,170
Step number one, where are we going to find a form on our page within our product for our client?

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,009
Habitual.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,500
I think like you'll probably see like log in and sign up.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,260
And I think probably like the biggest form we'll probably see is like the registration and that's about

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,100
it really.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,440
This is a type of product that doesn't necessarily have a lot of forms, but registration is huge.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,090
And especially with this product, I think it's going to be pretty integral to the way people kind of

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:02,130
like maybe talk about like why they're joining the product or maybe to pick some interests, maybe narrowing

15
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,180
down those interests.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,810
So let's jump right in to how we can create some form elements for our client.

17
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:16,290
When I think about our client, they need to have a registration and I need to think about those different

18
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:16,830
types of elements.

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,630
So I'm going to just kind of create a frame.

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,460
Let's press F and we're going to just use one of these screens.

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,570
We'll just call it registration.

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,450
So we're going to kind of just create like a wireframe, just so we get a good indication of what we

23
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,840
want to build.

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,950
And then we can eventually get to a higher fidelity.

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,580
So when a user comes to the page, they'll probably see like an input.

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,110
Uh, let me just.

27
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,490
They'll probably see 48.

28
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,540
It's probably good.

29
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,750
Don't want to get too fancy just yet.

30
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,290
Let's give it a stroke.

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,760
We can actually start creating some pieces if we wanted to.

32
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,510
We're here.

33
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,460
I'm going to create a couple of elements that I can just easily reuse.

34
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:17,280
I know I said I wasn't going to go for grading it, but, you know, maybe maybe that's the best course

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,090
of action.

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,750
What else do we have here?

37
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,910
Let's make a button.

38
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,420
And we are just going to fill that with brand color.

39
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,700
I don't know if I have the brain color, but we can just kind of get close to it right now.

40
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,770
Oops.

41
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,160
Maybe that's like our primary button.

42
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,990
And we'll put some text in there.

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,700
Same primary.

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,170
OC.

45
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,720
I like.

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,740
I like a lot.

47
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,620
This could be like 16 pixels.

48
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,400
Make this bone, we'll call it primary button.

49
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,040
So we are kind of creating our own little components we can make this way.

50
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,810
I know it's probably not accessible, but I mean, we can kind of fine tune.

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,210
Like sometimes accessibility could be like a little wonky in terms of like.

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,570
What is actually readable and what isn't like this is probably like bordering that line.

53
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,490
It's probably not accessible.

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,310
Like if we check right now, let's do contrast.

55
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,820
Like it's probably not, yeah, it fails, but it may be more legible than black, which is probably

56
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,800
actually accessible.

57
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,510
So that's our primary button.

58
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:45,480
We can just go over here, we can make a secondary, so probably have a secondary like a back button.

59
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,510
And that frame.

60
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,880
We won't have anything in it.

61
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,850
No, Phil.

62
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,380
But the primary buttons color will probably be like a black.

63
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,880
So that's good.

64
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,520
We'll just call it secondary.

65
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,480
And remember what I said about constraints.

66
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,950
So you can do that?

67
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,540
I can do that.

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,660
Perfect.

69
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,370
So we have a secondary and a primary.

70
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,930
We have an input up there.

71
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,110
I think that's fine for now.

72
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,490
I guess let's just call this our components for now.

73
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,980
Just so we have some basic inputs, like we may have some checkboxes.

74
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,160
So it's like this is an input fields.

75
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,300
And we'll just call it Field.

76
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,070
We probably should have some text in there.

77
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,440
Input text, that's totally fine.

78
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,630
And we could bump that to regular.

79
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,450
Okay.

80
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,080
I'm not going to worry too much.

81
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,830
About that.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,200
We do need to, however, create some checkboxes.

83
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,220
Possibly.

84
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,240
I'm envisioning that there will be checkboxes in our future.

85
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,490
30 to 40.

86
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,650
So I'm still using that base unit.

87
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:11,120
If eight pixels to create my components here that's a little big bump it down to 32.

88
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,210
Change the border radius.

89
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,510
I think that's fine.

90
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,000
We do need some text for it, though.

91
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,660
CheckBox.

92
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,120
Text.

93
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,850
So just do this.

94
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,420
So, I mean, we can start creating some of our components.

95
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,950
I mean, they don't necessarily need to be components.

96
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,700
It's good to just kind of prep before we even start.

97
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,690
I think that's enough.

98
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,370
Cool.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,560
Let's create another frame.

100
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,910
Select F.

101
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,780
So when a user first comes to our registration, I think like the first thing we'll probably ask them

102
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,320
to do is maybe like we'll probably see something like welcome.

103
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,680
It's a type that in their.

104
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,860
We'll see something like welcome.

105
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,420
How are you?

106
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:13,370
And we'll probably ask them to possibly, like, you know, add a profile image and like in terms of

107
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,290
the input.

108
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:23,400
It's kind of tough because we don't necessarily have like an input for the actual like it could just

109
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,660
be a button that like uses their phone to find an image.

110
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,770
And that's all handled on like the iPhone side or the Android side.

111
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,330
So that's a discussion to have with your developers.

112
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,700
So we'll just do this

113
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:50,610
and let's just go to Icon Ify or let's use material design icons and we'll just say profile person.

114
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,620
It's like, okay, there we go.

115
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,200
So I'm going to take that.

116
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,330
I'm just going to detach it.

117
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,510
Command, see?

118
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,520
Let's bring that into our registration.

119
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,200
And there we go.

120
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,890
So we have, like, a thing here, like a little image.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,750
Maybe we should have some text below because it's very fake.

122
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,640
Add a photo.

123
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,400
So other members.

124
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,360
I don't know if other members know who you are.

125
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,870
Or actually add a photo.

126
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,460
So.

127
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,420
Hmm.

128
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,580
Why would they add a photo?

129
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,260
So you can customize your experience.

130
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,260
This is probably, like, a nice to have feature.

131
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,170
Like, Do they really need a photo?

132
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,960
Probably not.

133
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:56,690
It's really about exploring if you need something versus like if it's a nice to have.

134
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:08,810
So the button here may say upload a photo and the secondary could be something like Skip this for now.

135
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,340
So we want that primary action to be much bigger, much more prominent.

136
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:22,210
I mean, we can even, like, go over here and make this a little bit less obvious.

137
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,810
And I think another thing is we need to let people know this seems like it's going to be a multi step

138
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,800
process.

139
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,990
So we need to let people know like what step of the process they're in and that's just change that.

140
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,179
So step one of four.

141
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,210
OC and let's just bold that.

142
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,820
So it's pretty obvious.

143
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,890
I mean, we can actually just leave it at the top.

144
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm not sure about the whole layout of the pages yet.

145
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,670
So if we copy that, we can just change that over there.

146
00:08:53,670 --> 00:09:01,440
And the next one could be like, What's your main reason for joining?

147
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,300
It's good to understand why they want to join.

148
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,590
I can just pop this up here.

149
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:16,630
We're not being too, like, crazy in terms of, like, how we structure just yet, but we could like

150
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:23,370
essentially put these items in a frame that has auto layout and thought whenever we adjust something,

151
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,500
it's going to bump it down and I'll show you what that looks like.

152
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,350
So if we select these and we do option command G, we have a frame and if you select auto layout, it

153
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,030
will automatically position them vertically.

154
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:39,150
You can even do it horizontally, but it's going to push it to the right over here so you can space

155
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,590
it any which way you want.

156
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:48,870
So if I want to like adhere to a pixel base like 24 pixels and if I add to this, it's just going to

157
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,030
keep on pushing the content down and you can just like keep things incredibly consistent.

158
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,670
It's just it's for your own sanity, to be honest.

159
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,200
Okay.

160
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,030
So this will help us make some great.

161
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,070
Recommendations.

162
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:13,070
So when I'm thinking about this registration, I want to get as much info about the user as possible

163
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,600
with kind of making it fun.

164
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,510
CheckBoxes are kind of hard to hit on mobile sometimes unless you make this whole tappable field like

165
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,490
tappable or like just easy to interact with.

166
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:32,390
So we can like do optional kind of like checkboxes or like radio buttons and I'll show you what we can

167
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:32,840
do here.

168
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:40,640
So I've taken like the primary button over here, and I'm just going to make this fill, like, white.

169
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,620
We're going to go in and I'm going to make that Phil Black.

170
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,910
Perfect.

171
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,360
And I am going to also apply a stroke.

172
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,450
And that stroke is going to be like a.

173
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,850
We'll just do 50% of block.

174
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,010
So, I mean, there you go.

175
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,440
We kind of have like a radio button that they can click.

176
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,780
So we can give them some options.

177
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,870
Like maybe one of them is Discover.

178
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,800
New and exciting.

179
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,450
Products.

180
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:28,990
The next one could be make month to month shopping.

181
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,300
Easier.

182
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,920
So that is like a definitely a big thing in terms of like shopping and in terms of like the usefulness

183
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,490
of this product.

184
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,930
If you do a lot of month to month shopping, you have a lot of like things that you constantly buy over

185
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,730
and over again.

186
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,670
If we know more about you, we can easily make that experience.

187
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,050
Much better yet.

188
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,810
Hmm.

189
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,760
Get relevant recommendations.

190
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,170
So there's a couple of options and like if I select one, so for this use case, I'm just going to select

191
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,590
it just to kind of showcase what that's going to look like.

192
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,450
So I'm going to.

193
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,540
Do that.

194
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,590
And that is going to be white and that's what it could look like.

195
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,200
So all of a sudden, we kind of have.

196
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,910
A nice little active state there, too, and we can create a component for that.

197
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,400
What I've done here is I've actually removed this skip because this is a mandatory.

198
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:38,100
I'm thinking about this actually being mandatory because it's pretty it's pretty big in terms of like

199
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,620
the type of question we're asking.

200
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,790
And if they don't fill it out, we can give them like a disabled state.

201
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,450
So just make sure you disable.

202
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:58,890
States are easy to read in terms of contrast and when they do select that it will move to the active

203
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:59,190
state.

204
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:04,620
Here you can work along with me and just think about the type of content we are we're creating for in

205
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,700
terms of the registration.

206
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,250
I mean, there's so many different things we can do.

207
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:17,270
We can just think about like the different types of like inputs that we need and the different types

208
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,080
of processes that we're going to like design for.

209
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,830
So I'm designing this registration process actively as I'm kind of coming up with these concepts.

210
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,800
I'm thinking about the different questions I'm asking users.

211
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,500
So like I probably at this point, I want them to just start picking some like interest.

212
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:38,390
So I'll get started by picking some interests.

213
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,820
And I mean, I don't even know.

214
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,950
I think that's pretty self explanatory.

215
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:51,240
And they can essentially like we could create like cards for them to make it a little more fun.

216
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,920
Like checkboxes are kind of boring.

217
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,210
So for something like this, we could create.

218
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,600
Like cards.

219
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,150
I'm not sure what's in the cards, maybe.

220
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,560
Actually, I think it would be best if we do something like this.

221
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,180
Let's create a frame.

222
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:14,470
For a square and we'll put a text in that frame and we'll call it something like music.

223
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,300
That's a little too big, but let's go down to 20 pixels.

224
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,350
And that's fine.

225
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,170
This is going to be a different type of checkbox.

226
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,220
And the background color.

227
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,320
Let's give it a fill.

228
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,870
So it's a little bit more interesting than it is now.

229
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,640
And there you go.

230
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,110
Like, we easily have like a checkbox that we can select.

231
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,110
So there it is.

232
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,660
Remember what I said about constraints.

233
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,200
So if I position this like that.

234
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,180
I'm going to try and make this almost a square.

235
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,990
So if our position is like that, there we go.

236
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,730
It doesn't need to be perfect.

237
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:22,750
We have a bunch of different options and if they will do the same thing over here.

238
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,150
Oops, I forgot to actually make that continue.

239
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,370
Um, this one can be continue as well for now at least.

240
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,800
I don't know what this is going to be.

241
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,910
It could be like an image.

242
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,500
It could be like a colored square.

243
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:40,540
I think we need to really kind of think about that a little bit more in terms of what that active state

244
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,440
looks like.

245
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,370
But that's when we get more in-depth in terms of like actually creating the component.

246
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,620
But now I know what types of questions I'm asking.

247
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,230
I'm asking them to upload a photo for customisation purposes, you know, making their experience a

248
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,370
little bit more delightful.

249
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,030
It's not needed.

250
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,190
So I gave them like a skip option.

251
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:03,220
I asked them why they're joining because maybe the types of products we do push to them is relevant

252
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,840
based off of this question.

253
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,970
You know, if they want to have like a month to month subscription of things like we could do something

254
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:16,420
like that, if they also discover new and exciting products, like we can push like new products to

255
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,460
them, but if they want relevant recommendations, it's like a little bit of both in terms of the types

256
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,930
of products we decide to push them.

257
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:29,350
If we think about this from a data collecting perspective, this will definitely help us kind of learn

258
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,550
more about our users.

259
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,590
So if people keep on creating this, we'll know the types of users we're getting in terms of like what

260
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,970
they're trying to achieve.

261
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,440
Are they trying to like are the majority of our users doing month to month subscriptions or something

262
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,040
like that?

263
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:47,800
If that's the case, then it could actually force us to pivot the purpose of the application.

264
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:53,890
It moves away from relevant recommendations to more so like a one stop shop where we constantly just

265
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,900
ship to you every single month, and that's constantly relevant and it's constantly based off of what

266
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,500
you need.

267
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,079
So take that into consideration in terms of the types of questions you're asking even for over here,

268
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:11,290
like getting started, I've kind of given them the option to select different types of interests.

269
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,099
I could have sports, I could have like tech.

270
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,950
Another option could be like gaming.

271
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,180
I've given them a bunch of different interests.

272
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,589
I don't know why I have four.

273
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,329
I mean, we could have four.

274
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,440
We can even go a deeper level and think about, like, now, like narrow it down.

275
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,580
What type of music do you like?

276
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,250
Do you like to listen to, like vinyl?

277
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,140
Do you like to listen to live music?

278
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,550
Are you thinking like buying speakers?

279
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:41,090
Like if you've selected something like fashion, like are you into sneakers, etc. or if there's anything

280
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,620
else, can you add that?

281
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,010
So we could even go even deeper here.

282
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,690
I think we're at a good spot right now just to get some basic information for from our user.

283
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,600
What we can do for now is what I would do is actually.

284
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,270
Put this together and put it into a prototype and test with users.

285
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,950
Immediately test fast.

286
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,450
We're here, we can just get started at the end.

287
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,980
We'll probably have like a nice little screen that just says like, woo hoo, you did it.

288
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,590
Like, These are your results.

289
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,960
Or we could show them our results if that's important.

290
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,770
I don't know.

291
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:23,120
It's really going to depend based off of like how we validate our assumptions.

292
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,790
But this is essentially how you go about like thinking through a form.

293
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:34,430
You've got to ask yourself the questions of like, well, especially with this case in terms of registration,

294
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,010
what types of questions am I going to ask our users?

295
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,570
And like, how do I break that down?

296
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,290
Like what types of inputs am I using based off of those questions?

297
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:47,330
Now, this is a really simple form, and I'm sure eventually in your career you are definitely going

298
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,940
to have much more complex forms.

299
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:57,440
So take it step by step, start with sketching, move on to like user flows in terms of like figuring

300
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,130
out what that process kind of looks like and then jump into like a product like Figma and really start

301
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,810
to figure out those details.

302
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,080
So that's how you create your own form within Figma.
