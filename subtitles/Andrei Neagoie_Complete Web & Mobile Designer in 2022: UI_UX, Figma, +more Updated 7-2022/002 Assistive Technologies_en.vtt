00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.910
Let's talk about some assistive technologies.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.130
So, you know, when people come to our site to use our products, those that have disabilities are

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.170
typically using what's called an assistive technology, whether that's a device or software.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.660
And there's a wide range of them that are important to understand because it's going to open your mind

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.760
to some of the ways that people are interacting with your content and the user experience you're creating

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.450
online.

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.800
So here are some of them.

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.960
We have screen readers.

9
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.290
Now, this is probably a more common one that we've all heard about, but it's a program that helps

10
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.890
the visually impaired understand the content displayed on the page.

11
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.260
So it basically converts digital text and labels and images and descriptions to something that is more

12
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.270
readable by this piece of software.

13
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.870
So you could imagine that they would all they would need to do is press play.

14
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.410
And they could read like an entire block of text.

15
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.540
They could read entire Web pages.

16
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.470
Something else people use are Braille terminals.

17
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.410
Now, those who can't see that well or can't see at all use Braille terminals, and the round tip pins

18
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.590
that come through the holes help blind people actually read and can see what's going on on the screen.

19
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.170
There's also something called a switch or some sort of tap control, which basically is like a joystick.

20
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.660
Or you can use the keyboard spacebar to do this.

21
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.360
But essentially as you tap on your trackpad or your keyboard, it will help you to navigate the screen.

22
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.360
Again, this may not be the best experience, but it is a way that people are interacting with various

23
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.750
pieces of our content and we really need to take that into account.

24
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.480
Next we have screen magnification software, which kind of works like a magnifying glass on the screen.

25
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.780
As you can see over here.

26
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.120
It's not like what you would typically see when you hit, you know, like a zoom on your browser.

27
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
It's not that everything scales up at once.

28
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.910
It's that the user has control over this little magnifier window inside of the software so that they

29
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.790
can magnify certain elements or a section of the screen or a design of a website.

30
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.070
And that reinforces the fact that, you know, all the elements of our design should be scalable.

31
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.740
So you can see over here he has this section actually magnified, so he can read it easily.

32
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.750
And lastly, what I have here are alternate input software and devices.

33
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.110
As you can imagine, there's also speech input software, which is a lot different than Alexa or Google

34
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.700
Home, but basically it allows people to control the computer with their voice.

35
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.540
There's also devices like we see here with the keyboard and the gentleman over here is using a stick

36
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.800
to actually type.

37
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.620
So once again, we need to take into account all the different ways people are interacting with our

38
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.440
website because it will affect the way we approach designing it and developing it.
