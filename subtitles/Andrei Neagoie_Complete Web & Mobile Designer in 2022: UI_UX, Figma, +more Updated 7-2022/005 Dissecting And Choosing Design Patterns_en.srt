1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,010
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,520
So we are on step four, which is dissecting that pattern.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,050
Now, the last step, like I said, dissect the pattern.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:16,050
In other words, we need to analyze other websites that use social login and basically we can use that

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,140
to customize our modifying the pattern for our needs.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,120
Let's take a look over here.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,930
So we have Etsy again, and I'm just going to add another item to our cart.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,710
What do I need to do here?

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,680
Let's actually pick another item.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,080
Okay.

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,730
Let's just pick a quick item here.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,390
Perfect.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,990
So we're just going to pick that OC so we're going to add that to our basket.

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,100
And I really like how it pushes us right to checkout really quickly.

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,770
I kind of really like the PayPal and how that's very up front.

16
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,920
So for users that do have PayPal, so I really like that about this, this type of checkout process.

17
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,820
So if we pay with PayPal, we can automatically jump right in.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,300
But if we don't want to do that and if users don't have the account, which is very convenient, so

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,440
if they want to use something like American Express, Visa or MasterCard, they can just go proceed

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,070
to checkout.

21
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,720
And they're right here.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,280
And the great thing is they are automatically hovered over.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,240
I mean, like the input for the sign in is automatically in-focus, which is great, but the primary

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,260
action is to continue as a guest or to log in socially, which is really, really great.

25
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,200
I think this kind of gives you like the best of both worlds.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,790
It gives you the ability to use PayPal and just check out quickly with that.

27
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:54,570
But also it gives you the ability to check out as a guest sign in if you do have an account really easily

28
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,720
and also potentially sign in or sign up with like a social media platform.

29
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,870
So I think this is a really, really strong design pattern that they've built and they've kind of modified

30
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,350
a bit.

31
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,610
Let's take a look at Cb2.

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,650
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to pick something.

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,600
Here.

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,720
We got some very, very overpriced furniture.

35
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:19,880
Okay.

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,620
So I'm going to pick this lovely sofa, going to add that to my cart and that's really nice.

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,890
It brings it right up so I can kind of like continue shopping or checkout.

38
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,270
Now, I like that better than how Etsy just throws you right into the checkout page.

39
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,800
I don't know if I'm going to be done shopping and I don't like how they kind of redirected me right

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,890
to that shopping basket over here.

41
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,620
So like they allow you to kind of keep shopping and go back, but this allows you to kind of keep your

42
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,730
process or your scroll position on the page if I just remove this.

43
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,070
So it's really easy to kind of get back.

44
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,930
So I kind of like that implementation.

45
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,500
So let's take a look at our car over here.

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,100
And they have something very similar, actually.

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,910
They have the ability to check out with PayPal right away.

48
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,960
I like that.

49
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,130
They allow you to apply a promotional code right off the bat.

50
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,120
And if I want to check out now, this is very interesting.

51
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,180
So they kind of have like a sidebar with the guest checkout, the returning customers section and this

52
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:33,370
is actually very similar and signing in with Google sign in and check out so you can so they have something

53
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:40,360
very similar, but they're limited the options to just Google here, which I think is I'm not sure if

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,380
that's the best pattern to use, but.

55
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,130
No, it may it may work.

56
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,130
So let's take a look at guest check out.

57
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,250
So yeah, checco is a three step process.

58
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,320
I do like how they've handled this though.

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,290
So they allow you to see what that process looks like.

60
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,820
You're going to have to enter like shipping and gift options.

61
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:08,270
So like your name, your street address in Canada would be your postal code town, city, province and

62
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,110
phone number.

63
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,360
And like I said, like when users go through your guest checkout, they're going to have to be there

64
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,610
and have to constantly do that process over again.

65
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,320
So I don't think that's the smartest way.

66
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:24,080
They do have PayPal, so you can click PayPal and just automatically check out through there.

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,930
And like I said, they do have.

68
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,650
So this is very interesting.

69
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:35,380
So if I click checkout now, again, it's bringing me to guess checkout and it won't let me go back,

70
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,800
which is very interesting.

71
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,500
So I think I'm personally going to stick with the Etsy pattern.

72
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,770
Like I'm going to tweak it for my visual style.

73
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,500
But I think I like the idea of giving them the up front ability to distinguish how they plan to pay

74
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,780
and how they want to sign out.

75
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,230
Because, I mean, if they have a PayPal account, everything's kind of handled for you in one shot.

76
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,840
But if they don't, they give you three other options.

77
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,710
So that's essentially how I dissect the patterns.

78
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,390
I take a look at very similar options.

79
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:10,400
I take a look at options that do like employ something like a social login, especially for like e-commerce

80
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,940
or something like this.

81
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:17,780
So in this case, like I took a look at like Cb2 Canada and I found that they are very similar, but

82
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,290
this one behaves much differently than Etsy's.

83
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:27,770
And for that reason, like I would probably follow Etsy's and you know, I can keep something from Cb2

84
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,040
here.

85
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,090
Like, you know, when you add something to the cart, it doesn't necessarily take a full screen and

86
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,590
put you in like a cart screen.

87
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:39,920
But I can take a look and analyze if each pattern which one is going to be best for my needs.

88
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,000
So when you're trying to find a design pattern, I mean, go through that same process, figure out

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,610
what your problem is, figure out the different types of websites that like are your competitors that

90
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,510
are very similar to you, that have some sort of pattern that solve the similar issue.

91
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:59,660
Step three, jump right in and figure out which pattern is going to be right for you and then dig a

92
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,480
little bit deeper and find websites that all employ that kind of similar pattern that you actually think

93
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,290
is best for you and figure out which one is going to be best.

94
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,590
And that's how you pick a design pattern.
