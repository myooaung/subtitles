00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.180
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.290
We're going to jump right into how we can make some imagery look really dynamic.

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.450
Now, remember what I said about stock photos?

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.130
Avoid them like the plague.

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.180
They are horrible.

6
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.680
They just don't really do anything for your product or your website or whatever you're building.

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.780
They just make your designs look really amateur.

8
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.050
So I'm going to show you how you can use the Figma plugin Unsplash to generate some really good imagery,

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.760
and then we can use a couple of other plugins that can make that imagery really stand out.

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.890
So let's jump right in.

11
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.100
What I'm going to do is I'm going to select Unsplash.

12
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.620
Perfect.

13
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.540
Now, this is the plug in and it's really great, really easy to use.

14
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.210
You can search based off of presets like these categories you can insert randomly, which I would never

15
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.630
really do.

16
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.540
But it's kind of interesting to if you just need a quick image and you don't care what it is, I like

17
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.860
just searching quickly by string, so I'm going to select that.

18
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.840
I'm going to type in like portrait.

19
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.240
Let's see what comes up.

20
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.320
Now, look at this.

21
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.730
They don't necessarily look like stock photos.

22
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.340
Some of them may be stock photos, but these are really nice images to use.

23
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.780
I think I'm going to grab this one.

24
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.610
I really like the background.

25
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.820
So we can click it and insert that image and bam, there it is really easy.

26
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.760
So we're just going to call this our portrait.

27
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.800
So we know what to do.

28
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.650
What we're going to do next is we're going to create another frame.

29
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.450
So what we're going to create our first frame.

30
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.120
We're going to press F, drag that mouse, and there we go.

31
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.970
We got our frame.

32
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.110
Take this image and throw it into the frame.

33
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.440
Perfect.

34
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.180
So we'll just rename that to Devo so we can keep track of it.

35
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.410
Sometimes we'll get images, something like this, and we'll just throw them into the layout, throw

36
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.460
the text beside it, we'll set the text and we'll forget about the image and kind of never look at it

37
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.990
again.

38
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.430
We won't necessarily do some extra work to it, but there are different ways we can like manipulate

39
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.500
our images or work with them to make them much more dynamic and just visually interesting.

40
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.789
So let me show you what plugins I usually use if I'm going to do that.

41
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.570
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into plugins again and here's another plugin I really love.

42
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.730
This is called Remove Background.

43
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.720
Now you'll need to set up an account and then set up an API key.

44
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.310
But it's super easy.

45
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.420
Don't worry about it.

46
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.710
You'll thank me later.

47
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.860
So I'm going to create a copy of this and I'm going to remove this background.

48
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.510
So it's running in the background there.

49
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.380
And there you go.

50
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.450
We have removed it.

51
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.560
That's pretty awesome.

52
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.100
Right?

53
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.280
Now, this image is now pretty cool.

54
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.660
We can work within different ways, like we can introduce other elements in the background.

55
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.540
We can make it seem like we're manipulating space with this flat image.

56
00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.920
So let's do that.

57
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.360
So sometimes I'll do something like this where I'll grab like a square.

58
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.410
Now, the other thing about removing background.

59
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.110
Take a look at the side of her face.

60
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.700
There is some sort of like purplish light from the original photo.

61
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.840
It fits in this scene.

62
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.480
But when you put it on a white background, it won't necessarily fit.

63
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.580
And it depends what you're going to do with your composition.

64
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.270
But keep that in mind, because that would look kind of weird.

65
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.480
Just because you want whatever you're removing the background and whatever's in the foreground here

66
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.000
to fit with whatever you're using it for.

67
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.520
So for the sake of this demo, what I'm going to do is I'm going to zoom out here so I can grab these

68
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.210
colors.

69
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.230
Now I'm going to select my color.

70
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.290
I'm going to go to my linear gradient.

71
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.600
And here we can start doing some interesting things.

72
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.500
So I'm going to select that.

73
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.100
I'm going to copy this color and I'm going to select that the opacity is defaulted to zero.

74
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.110
So we're going to bring that up to a 100.

75
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.980
And we are going to take the color picker and we're going to grab that color right down there.

76
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.940
So we basically just mimic.

77
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.850
That gradient to the best of our abilities.

78
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.649
And what we can do is we can right click and send it to the back.

79
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.720
And all of a sudden now this image is much more dynamic, much more interesting to look at.

80
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.110
And you can start seeing now her face, the lighting.

81
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.300
It starts matching with what we have here.

82
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.700
We can alternate it any which way we like.

83
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.730
We can make it a little bit more lighter if we want.

84
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.850
And there we go.

85
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.610
Like we can do stuff like that and it's super easy.

86
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.500
Let's group this so we don't get lost and let's do something else.

87
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.180
Let's manipulate how this two dimensional image looks like on your page.

88
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.370
We can give the illusion of three dimensional image.

89
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.710
So what we'll do here is we can just grab that.

90
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.470
We're going to put that there and we're going to actually copy that gradient wheel.

91
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.940
So we'll just select it on the side here and command C, we're going to open up a stroke, select there

92
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.140
and there we go.

93
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.660
Now our stroke actually has that.

94
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.790
You can faintly see that and we can bump that up to whatever number we like.

95
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.400
We'll just pick something like this.

96
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.550
And we're going to bring this down just a bit.

97
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.770
So as you can see, it's snapping to the bottom of the image, which is great.

98
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.960
Something like that.

99
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.560
Now, here's where we can use masks to really help hide certain layers of the image.

100
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.380
We can also even crop the image.

101
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.590
It can act as a mask.

102
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.620
So we can do it both ways.

103
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.120
And I'll show you how to do that both ways.

104
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.580
So let's select our main image.

105
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.920
We're in a command C copy it and command V and now we have a second image over here.

106
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.670
What we can do is we can take that image and just do something like this.

107
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.260
Crop it.

108
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.480
So it's only going to show what is within this actual these blue borders over here.

109
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.490
So we're going to crop it to there.

110
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.090
We're just going to call this one mass and we're going to call this one our OG or original.

111
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.740
And we're going to send that to the back.

112
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.090
And so you can start doing some interesting things, maybe not for the head like that, but let me show

113
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.260
you what else we can do.

114
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:40.680
We can take that original mask and we can apply that right to the top so we're not going to scale it.

115
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.450
You saw what happened when we scaled it there.

116
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.690
We kind of lost it a bit.

117
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.860
And we kind of scaled it and it skewed the actual image.

118
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.610
But there you go.

119
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.310
Like now we can have something that's really dynamic like that.

120
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.450
We can use it for like an avatar, we can use it for like a team photo.

121
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.050
But it's really simple to do something like this.

122
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.770
Now, if we wanted to do the same trick, but with like an actual mask, we can do that as well.

123
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.160
So we can copy our OG layer, which is in the background.

124
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:19.250
We're going to command C, command v, we'll bring the new one to the front right there and we'll call

125
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.370
this masked image.

126
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.800
We're going to grab our rectangle two so we're press are or you can go up here.

127
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:35.710
And we're just going to drag that to the top and we're just going to line it up with the top of that

128
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.910
image over here.

129
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.670
Just so it's going to show above the actual stroked rectangle square.

130
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.920
So we can rename this to Mask Rectangle.

131
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.090
And what we want to do is to make this mask work for the image.

132
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.480
We're going to send the mask to the back.

133
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.090
It needs to be behind the image.

134
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.790
So send it to the back.

135
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.270
We're going to select.

136
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.190
So grab that and grab the image in the front.

137
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.390
And we're going to select this right here.

138
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:13.460
This is our mask tool, and it's going to use that rectangle to crop the image to that portion, similarly

139
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.570
to what we did before.

140
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:15.740
And there you go.

141
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.790
Same effect.

142
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.290
Other people like using masks.

143
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.580
You can use cropping images as well.

144
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.860
It's totally up to you.

145
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.390
So now we have some interesting things that we can do like that.

146
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.430
There's other things that we can do even with like product based images.

147
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.630
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a new frame.

148
00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:38.770
We'll do this one more time with something else, something a little different.

149
00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.270
So we'll rename that to Demo two.

150
00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.600
Well, we're going to open up Unsplash.

151
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.680
And let's search for something like bees for.

152
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.540
Let's see something.

153
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.160
Oh, there we go.

154
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.790
This is.

155
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:57.420
This is good.

156
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.630
So we're going to insert that image.

157
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.630
Make sure it's in our.

158
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.900
Frame.

159
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.280
We're going to scale that and to scale to make sure that images scale proportionally.

160
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.560
We're going to hold down.

161
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.120
Shift.

162
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.330
You can do shift in options shift.

163
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.770
We'll just drag the corner to the other corner.

164
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.570
Shift option will kind of just drag everything together to center.

165
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.510
So I'm just going to hold shift in option do that.

166
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:30.250
And there we go.

167
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.510
We've got we've got an image here.

168
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.670
I'm going to duplicate that and you're going to rename these OG.

169
00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.550
We call this the new OG.

170
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.850
Great OC.

171
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.630
Let's make another copy.

172
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:49.060
So what we're going to do here is we're going to use that same plug in, remove background.

173
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.420
But that run over here, you'll see the status of it.

174
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.380
Perfect.

175
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.730
What I'm going to do is I'm going to crop that hand up because it looks kind of weird.

176
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.470
I mean, you could do interesting things with that.

177
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.440
So I'm going to crop that out.

178
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.260
And here we go.

179
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.280
We have our image.

180
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.160
Now, this is a PlayStation controller.

181
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.520
What we can also do is we can grab like.

182
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:16.840
A rectangle again.

183
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.210
So press r, grab the rectangle.

184
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:25.480
Let's send this to the back and we're going to rename this BG for background.

185
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.160
What we're going to do is we're going to do same thing.

186
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.420
We'll have a gradient.

187
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:35.230
And we'll set it to like kind of the blue colors that PlayStation likes to use.

188
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.890
So remember, this always gets defaulted to zero opacity.

189
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.270
We can fix that quickly.

190
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.670
So there we go.

191
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.400
Now we have kind of like a little product image that we can use.

192
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.390
We'll just move this over.

193
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.630
I don't think we really need it right now, actually.

194
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.560
Perfect.

195
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:58.740
And we can start actually introducing different things like shapes, shadows, like we can make this

196
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.250
image even seem much more three dimensional than it already kind of looks.

197
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.810
So we can actually go in here and apply some effects.

198
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.120
You can press the plus sign and it'll automatically apply a drop shadow.

199
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:17.710
And we can do something like a 20% blur, which makes the drop shadow much more blurrier and it expands

200
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.100
it.

201
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:24.070
So you'll notice if I change the opacity to 100%, that's going to change the shadow and you'll be able

202
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.450
to see it much more clear.

203
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.810
But if I change that blur, it looks a little more fuzzy.

204
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:33.460
So I'm going to bring it down to something like 40 maybe, and we're going to push it all the way to

205
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:33.730
the left.

206
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.960
So negative ten on the Y axis.

207
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.870
Maybe -20.

208
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.550
That's that's okay.

209
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.180
Because we want to kind of work with the lighting we have here as well.

210
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.610
So zero is fine.

211
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.270
And we're going to reduce that opacity.

212
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.280
So it's not as a parent.

213
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.350
So we can also reduce the blur.

214
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.450
There you go.

215
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.290
So we have something that looks a little bit natural.

216
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:06.810
Looks like light is shining from here, and we can even play with the way our lighting comes in from

217
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.740
this gradient.

218
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.000
So we can kind of like use this to our advantage a bit, can make that a little bit more lighter.

219
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:19.360
Great.

220
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.550
You can do some interesting stuff.

221
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:28.850
Also, we can add some shapes so we see the buttons are the typical circle, x square and triangle for

222
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.020
the PlayStation controller.

223
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.900
So we can just grab our circle ellipse tool.

224
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.620
You just press.

225
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.320
Oh, so that's the shortcut for that.

226
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.840
So we'll just drop that in there and change that to a stroke just by pressing that plus button.

227
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.820
So if I were to remove it, it's just over here.

228
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.500
Remove the fill and we're going to set that to read just kind of like that.

229
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.170
The same color as the controller.

230
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.030
We're going to bump that up.

231
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.570
That's going to be fine.

232
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.250
So we can just do something like that.

233
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.200
We'll grab, like, a triangle.

234
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.440
Is our polygon's rule.

235
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.520
We'll just drag that in there.

236
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.900
And same thing.

237
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.220
We'll just apply a stroke.

238
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.520
It's green, so we'll just pick a green.

239
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.500
Update that just a bit.

240
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.280
We don't want them to be too harsh and we'll grab a square.

241
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:28.100
So ah, for a rectangle if you hold shift while you drag it, it'll actually make that square instead

242
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.250
of just kind of going like this and skewing it to a rectangle.

243
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:37.280
We are going to make that a stroke as well and that is a purplish color.

244
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.280
So same thing.

245
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.070
And we can start to do some interesting things.

246
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.900
And we have an x ray here as well.

247
00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.900
So we can take our line tool, which is just by pressing L.

248
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.410
Holding that down.

249
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.120
We can create a line and do that.

250
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:04.440
And what we're going to do is we are just going to create a blue for a lighter blue.

251
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:11.640
So a little more contrast with the background and we're going to click on that and Press Command C and

252
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.550
Command V and we're going to take the second one.

253
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.250
And it doesn't need to be perfect.

254
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.450
And we'll just grip that.

255
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:25.620
And now we have our own little thing here.

256
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:32.730
Our own little X we can also do is we can take these lines and we can right click and go over to outline

257
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.560
stroke and they'll turn them into actual shapes rather than strokes.

258
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:43.290
So we're going to turn these into shapes and we are going to use our union tool up here.

259
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.270
So we're going to a union selection.

260
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.290
And there you go.

261
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.980
If you press command e, it'll merge these layers together.

262
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.290
So I'm gonna press command and there you go.

263
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:56.940
We don't even need this group anymore.

264
00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:05.910
So we have some cool images that we can kind of play with in here and we can just bring this into our.

265
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.720
Composition.

266
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:14.500
If I send this and this to the buck, if I hold those together.

267
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.860
Now, I got something really interesting.

268
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.630
I can even apply a gradient to it.

269
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:30.550
If I put the gradient like that, like this, and I change this color to the same type of purple but

270
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:35.980
darker, it's going to make it look like the actual controller is on top of it.

271
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.790
So it looks like it's actually hidden by its shadow, which is really neat.

272
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:45.490
So we can play with that.

273
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:52.550
We can take our little x here, which looks like a plus sign, but now it's an x and we can overlay

274
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.200
that on top and we can do the same thing.

275
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.410
We can grab a linear gradient on top.

276
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.730
And we can just angle that to kind of show that there's some sort of light.

277
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.470
And we could just pick that color.

278
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:13.820
We can make it lighter and we can pick that color and just use the same color that we had before.

279
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.800
There's some visual consistency.

280
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:17.870
Now.

281
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.920
That's cool.

282
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.900
We're going to grab.

283
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.290
Our triangle.

284
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.330
Well, hold that.

285
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.870
We're going to click this click shift and we're going to click the background.

286
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.470
Select everything and send it to the back.

287
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.500
And we can do the same thing now with this.

288
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:49.960
We're going to make it look like the controller's just on top of it just a bit.

289
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.120
So we'll do that.

290
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.500
And this will be the same color.

291
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.040
And let's take our last.

292
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.619
Little shape and bring that to the front.

293
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.810
And we can apply another gradient to that.

294
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.670
And there we go.

295
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.010
Like it was super easy.

296
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:29.410
And now you kind of have an image here that really works.

297
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.330
Within its setting.

298
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.980
And it didn't take much time.

299
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.850
Now it looks really three dimensional.

300
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.450
Now you can go around, you can fiddle with this just a little bit more.

301
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.540
But I urge you to kind of play around when I'm doing this.

302
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.080
And also, I mean, think about the type of images you have.

303
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.880
Don't just throw them into your layout.

304
00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:56.260
Don't forget about them, but try to make them a little bit more dynamic.

305
00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.800
There's other ways you can do that and we'll get into in the next video.
