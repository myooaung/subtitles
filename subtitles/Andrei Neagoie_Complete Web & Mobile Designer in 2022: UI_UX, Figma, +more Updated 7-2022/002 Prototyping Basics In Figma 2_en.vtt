00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.350
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.870
Now we're going to go over some prototype actions next.

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.510
So what we've been basically doing is some basic stuff.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.510
Like if we click on something like this, it goes to the next page and this is essentially the prototype

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.290
action.

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.820
Do you want it to navigate to?

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.110
Do you want it to open up overlay?

8
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.440
Do you want to swap with you want to go back close overlay, open a link.

9
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.650
I mean, there's a bunch of different things you can do.

10
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.710
So I'm going to demonstrate a couple of them.

11
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.280
So navigate to we've been doing and that essentially just goes from one page to the next, very simple.

12
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.290
And you know, at this stage, like when you're early on prototyping, that's all you really need.

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:49.770
But if you want to do something a little bit more complex, let's just drag this all the way down to

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.730
our search.

15
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:05.650
And what we can do is I'm just trying to think, let's create a new search and we're not going to have

16
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.760
anything in here.

17
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.390
We're not going to have a background and we're just going to call this keyboard overlay.

18
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.160
So.

19
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.680
What we can do is let's just delete that.

20
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.750
Let's put something together.

21
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:30.660
So if I click my prototype and I click the trigger just to go over to that page, once I top the search,

22
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.750
what will happen is it will come to this search page.

23
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.630
And what we can do is.

24
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.000
Let's take a look.

25
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.180
So we've gone to this page and like on this, what we can do is after delay.

26
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.850
You can open up overlay and that overlay can be this and we can have it like move in from the bottom.

27
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.560
We'll get into this a little bit more.

28
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.680
But this can happen like 200 milliseconds after the initial click and I'll show you what what it looks

29
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.800
like.

30
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.960
So I'm over here, I want to search, I click search and the overlay comes up.

31
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.120
So that's a little weird how it happened and we can actually customize that behavior.

32
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.780
So this will come up?

33
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.640
No.

34
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.900
Hmm.

35
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.140
This will open up overlay.

36
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.890
There you go.

37
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.880
That's why.

38
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.450
And this overlay will be sticky to the bottom and the center.

39
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.060
You can specify where that happens.

40
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.310
So this essentially will be really.

41
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.060
Affixed to the bottom.

42
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.530
And when you click outside, you can remove it.

43
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.300
Let's take a look.

44
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.420
Let's press our to restart.

45
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.810
Boom.

46
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.750
There it is.

47
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.910
If I click outside of the overlay.

48
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.400
It should have closed it.

49
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.420
Let's take a look here.

50
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.790
So let's see.

51
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.350
Close one clicking outside.

52
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.350
Oh, it's probably because it's the whole frame.

53
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.600
So if I do something like this, there we go.

54
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.630
Now it closes.

55
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.400
So let's go back and restart that.

56
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.870
So search on overlay, click it perfect and we can even like link this together again.

57
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.720
If I click that again, I want it to open and it's going to automatically select like open overlay over

58
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.870
again so we can kind of create a little bit of a loop here.

59
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.610
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

60
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.130
So let's actually keep on going with this.

61
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.580
The next is to swap.

62
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.430
Now, swap allows you to replace one frame with another.

63
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.680
This will kind of behave similarly to the navigate option when triggered from a hot spot like in a regular

64
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.180
frame.

65
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.830
If you apply a swap to hot spot in an overlay, it will replace or swap that current overlay with a

66
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.120
new destination frame.

67
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.440
So.

68
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.030
I'll show you what that looks like.

69
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.320
So if I create another one over here and like, I change the background color.

70
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.290
The black.

71
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.580
I mean, don't do this.

72
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.990
Okay.

73
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.560
Let's see what this prototype looks like.

74
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.190
So if I click prototype and I click on this, I can.

75
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.710
Swap it so on top swap with.

76
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.090
Then your keyboard overlay.

77
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.280
And let's see what that looks like.

78
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.910
Do you see how it just swaps the overlay?

79
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.890
So that's very useful if you need it.

80
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.580
That was kind of like a terrible color choice for that keyboard, but it gets the point across.

81
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.850
Now, another thing we can add to this is like back.

82
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.210
So I have the the icon selected here that tappable area.

83
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.640
And on top I want to just go back that's essentially is going to navigate back to the previous screen.

84
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.720
This is perfect for assimilating the back button in your prototypes, which we're doing right now.

85
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.750
So this will go back there.

86
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.570
Let's go search overlay, click outside the overlay, go back and you'll notice that even though we

87
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.280
brought in a new frame as an overlay, it doesn't affect that when we're actually going back and forth.

88
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.180
What you can also do to simulate the back button is to actually link it if you want to.

89
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.940
That previous screen, I mean, you're really only coming in from search in this prototype from this

90
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.580
screen, so you can easily just link that back to like that.

91
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.450
So let's see.

92
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.240
There we go.

93
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.100
Perfect.

94
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.870
Now another action is like close overlay and we've kind of done that already.

95
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.010
Like, if we want to click on this, we can actually do like on top.

96
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.020
Close overlay and essentially that will remove the overlay.

97
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.990
So let's go back.

98
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.400
Let's search what that looks like.

99
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.300
Boom.

100
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.900
And there you go, removing the overlay.

101
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.330
So this actually allows you to close or dismiss any overlays that have appeared over that original frame.

102
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.700
And essentially, those are all the different types of prototype actions that I use.

103
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.400
Overlay is really nice for simulating stuff like keyboards or like models and stuff like that.

104
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.010
Like you can add stuff to that overlay.

105
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.100
So an example is, let's see, I haven't used overlay in a long time.

106
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.880
So what we're going to do is so this trigger is going to open up overlay and you can add like a background

107
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.420
behind it and I think you need the whole frame to do that.

108
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.890
So let's take a look yet.

109
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.150
So actually, no, it's fine.

110
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.840
So you can add the background around the overlay, which is really nice.

111
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.560
I mean, in this case, when you're using a keyboard, you probably may not want to because if we're

112
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.380
doing like predicting the type of head in terms of what the user is typing here, we probably want to

113
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.000
see what's showing up over here.

114
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.750
But like if you're using a modal, you'll definitely want to add an overlay just to kind of hide that

115
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.710
background information and create more contrast for that modal to kind of pop on the screen.

116
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:31.620
So yeah, that's definitely an easy way to use prototype actions within Figma.
