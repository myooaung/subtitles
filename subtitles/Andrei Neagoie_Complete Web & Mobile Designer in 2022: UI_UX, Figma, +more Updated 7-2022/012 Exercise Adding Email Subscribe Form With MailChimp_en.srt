1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:08,540
All right, everybody, this is the exciting part, because up until now, well, we've created our

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,890
startup landing page.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,980
It looks great, but it's only on our laptops.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,500
Right?

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,380
If you're starting a business.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,190
You're not going to go to every customer, give them your laptop and say, hey, check on my start up

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:21,980
landing page.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,160
No, we want to use the Internet.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,550
Right.

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,580
We want to be able to put this website online.

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:34,180
But we also want people to be able to click on this and have a way to submit their email address so

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,400
that maybe when your startup launches, you can email them and ask them to make a purchase.

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,500
So this is the fun part now that we've created the page.

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,170
How can we make it interactive?

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,030
Well, for this section, we're going to use something called MailChimp.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,500
And MailChimp is a email marketing service.

17
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:04,690
There's other tools like Miller Lite and a ton of others that allow you to have this exact functionality.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,840
A way for users to click on a button, submit a form, and save that information somewhere for you to

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,680
use later.

20
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,800
Now in order for this part to work.

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,430
We need to create an account and sign up for free with MailChimp.

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,730
Now.

23
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,200
I've already gone through the steps, so you don't have to watch me type along.

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,910
But just the heads up.

25
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,960
What we're going to do is completely free, isn't going to cost you anything.

26
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:38,830
But we do want to create an account with MailChimp so that we can create our email form.

27
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,290
So I want you to go ahead do this.

28
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,250
It might ask you for your home address.

29
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:51,760
And that is actually a requirement, especially in some parts of the world, where to avoid spam and

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,540
spambots.

31
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:59,590
You have to provide your home address or some sort of an address so that they know that you are a real

32
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,730
human who is asking people to sign up to their newsletter.

33
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,280
But just go through the steps here.

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,680
Just create your password, get started.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,950
You might have to confirm your account with your email, but it should take you no longer than 5 minutes.

36
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,440
Once you have done that, you can pause the video.

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,560
Otherwise, let's sign in to MailChimp.

38
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,340
Now, one thing actually before we sign in is if you look at the pricing, there is a free tier and

39
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,910
this is where we're going to use where we can just create a form.

40
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,980
And as long as we have less than 2000 contacts, it's going to be completely free.

41
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,770
Again, if you're creating a startup landing page and you're getting more than 2000 people interested,

42
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,510
well then you're probably going to make some money so you can start paying for this service.

43
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,590
But up until 2000 sign ups, well, it's completely free.

44
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,000
So that's really, really nice.

45
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,210
All right.

46
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,670
Once you've created an account, let's log in.

47
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,700
All right.

48
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,350
There we go.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,830
We have our dashboard.

50
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:07,790
Now, I want you to keep in mind, when you work with a service like this, which is essentially a website

51
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,920
online of a company, they're always going to change how the website looks.

52
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,960
So when you're watching this video, you might not have the exact same look as I do.

53
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,280
Don't worry about it.

54
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,360
Most of the core functionalities are going to be the same.

55
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,720
You might have just different buttons organized differently, but what we want to do is essentially

56
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,100
go to audience.

57
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,300
If you click on Manage Audience.

58
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,270
Click on signup forms.

59
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,360
You can actually create.

60
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,510
Your own audience.

61
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,430
So let's just call this 102 Mastery Students.

62
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:58,480
You can have different settings such as enabling capture, enabling double opt in, which again sends

63
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,130
contact in confirmation.

64
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,420
So when people sign up, they'll get a confirmation email that they've subscribed.

65
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,400
And you can also enable GDPR fields.

66
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,340
Now, we don't need to worry about that too much.

67
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,230
Let's create a form name.

68
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,690
Call it zero to mastery.

69
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,660
You can provide a default email address if you want.

70
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,550
Scroll all the way down.

71
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,440
And we don't need to worry about too much.

72
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,180
Let's just save audience and campaign defaults.

73
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,580
All right, we've created our list.

74
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,910
So now if I click back on audience.

75
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,990
You see that I have zero to mastery students.

76
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,490
If I go to campaigns now and say Create campaign.

77
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,420
And instead of a signup form, we're going to click on landing page.

78
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,100
Now, the landing page name can be whatever you want, let's say start up.

79
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,880
With an exclamation mark.

80
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,510
We want to target the audience zero to mastery students.

81
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,890
We can click begin.

82
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,720
And here we can select a template that we want.

83
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,000
Now in our case, we can just have the Grow Your List template.

84
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,830
And you can customize this however you want.

85
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:23,750
You can have different headings here, such as This is the best business in the world.

86
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,470
We can have a logo if you want.

87
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:36,010
We can use the Zero to Mastery logo that I've already uploaded and we can just leave the email and subscriber

88
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,820
the way it is.

89
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:43,300
Again, this website is going to let you customize things differently and depending on when you watch

90
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,240
the video, these might be a little bit different.

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,360
It doesn't really matter as long as we get this email form.

92
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,100
So if I click Save and Close and I go Save and close.

93
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:04,460
We now have my startup page, which I can just add a page title, let's say startup idea.

94
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,060
We can add a URL.

95
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,790
So this.

96
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,920
Allows you to have your own custom URL if you want, but in our case we want the free option.

97
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,360
So I can just create, let's say, XHTML.

98
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,170
Students endpoint.

99
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,390
So if I safe here, I now have a page title, a URL.

100
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,450
We have the audience, which is zero to mastery students.

101
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,270
We have the content, which is what we just created.

102
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,150
And all I need to do now is say, publish.

103
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:39,870
Hi.

104
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,470
Five.

105
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,000
Thank you very much.

106
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:43,970
Now.

107
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,990
Your landing page is now live on the Web right here.

108
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,530
So check this out.

109
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,340
If I copy and paste this into the link.

110
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,590
There's my page.

111
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,950
Now, all we need to do is copy this link.

112
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,910
Go to my find out more.

113
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,370
And make it so that when a user clicks on it, it goes to that page.

114
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,990
And that's super easy, right?

115
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:17,030
We can just create an A tag with an H ref and this H ref will have the link that we just copied.

116
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,400
So let's close that.

117
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,590
Close the attack.

118
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,440
If I had save.

119
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,400
And refresh.

120
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,990
If I click now.

121
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,330
How cool is that?

122
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,700
But this isn't even the coolest part.

123
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,750
The coolest part is now I can create just a random email.

124
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's say one, two, three, four, Andy.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,960
One, two, three, four, a gmail.com click subscribe and oh, we have almost finished.

126
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,050
So you see over here how I got that.

127
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,340
You need to confirm your email address.

128
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,500
And that's because we clicked on that setting where people had to confirm their email address because,

129
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,800
well, we don't want just anybody to sign up to our newsletter.

130
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,130
We want to make sure they're human and not just bots.

131
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,840
So instead, let's go back and actually give my email address.

132
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,890
Subscribe.

133
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,140
I now go back to go to my email.

134
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,860
Hey, check it out.

135
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,400
Look at that.

136
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,730
I have the zero two Mastery students.

137
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,240
Yes.

138
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,100
Subscribe me to the list.

139
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,450
So if I click on this now, I'm now subscribe to the list.

140
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,320
And if I go to my campaigns.

141
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,780
You see that?

142
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,870
I have two clicks on this campaign.

143
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,679
So if I now actually go to View Report.

144
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,440
I'll have a new subscriber that if I go to audience now.

145
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,380
You can see that I have a new contact.

146
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,620
And there we go.

147
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,320
We have myself as a new subscriber.

148
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,960
And as people get more and more interested in your startup, they're going to sign up more and more

149
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,840
and you'll be able to send them an email.

150
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,940
How cool is that?

151
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:16,080
Let's take a break and I'll see you in the next video so that we can actually put this website online

152
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,960
instead of just on our computers.

153
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,130
I'll see you in that one.

154
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,180
Bye bye.
