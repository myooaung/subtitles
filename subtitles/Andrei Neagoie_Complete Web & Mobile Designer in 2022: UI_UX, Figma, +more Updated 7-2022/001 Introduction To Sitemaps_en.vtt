00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.810
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.390
We are back at it again.

3
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.890
And today we're going to learn about site maps.

4
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.440
So before we even get into creating them, we're going to talk a little bit about the anatomy and why

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.370
they're so useful.

6
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.460
And yes, they are still useful.

7
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.760
So the big question is people still use site maps.

8
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.720
Of course I do.

9
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.360
It's not just limited to information architecture.

10
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.910
Everyone should use site maps, especially designers.

11
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.940
They help provide structure for your product.

12
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.020
Like, look at this.

13
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.720
We have the primary navigation or secondary navigation.

14
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.060
We can really plan out all the different navigation schemes within our product so that maps help a lot.

15
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.590
So what are they?

16
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.620
Site maps are hierarchical diagrams of a website or an application that shows how pages are prioritized.

17
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.440
I want you to think about the last lesson that we went through.

18
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.570
User flows that we did prior are kind of like a street view of what we were discovering in terms of

19
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.370
how the user should achieve goals and where we discover different types of content we needed.

20
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.590
You remember this user flow over here.

21
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.360
This is making a purchase and we discovered a lot of different things we discovered like the different

22
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.090
steps that it took to actually complete a purchase.

23
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.240
We discover different types of micro interactions, all the different close up details that we didn't

24
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.590
necessarily know before.

25
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.560
Now, a site map is essentially a bird's eye view.

26
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.140
This way we can take an early glance of what our product looks like from the treetops.

27
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.810
So when do we use sight maps?

28
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.420
Well, site maps are generally used in the beginning or really early on in the design process, like

29
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.460
right after discovery or kick offs, right after you get all that information from your clients or from

30
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.480
your product team, kind of like what we're doing right now with application that we're trying to build.

31
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.290
They'll really help us when we need to start working on our wireframes.
