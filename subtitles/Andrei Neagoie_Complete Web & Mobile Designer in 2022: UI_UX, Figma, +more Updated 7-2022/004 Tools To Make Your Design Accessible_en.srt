1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,220
Everyone.

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,020
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:06,380
We're going to be talking about some of the tools that I use to check, color, contrast and make my

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,240
designs a bit more accessible.

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:15,770
Then we'll jump quickly into Figma to debunk some things around our contrast ratios being a rule rather

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,790
than a guideline.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,730
So let's take a look at color safe over here.

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,930
So this is color safe.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,230
Allow me to pick color palettes based off of my goals.

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,320
And let's just jump in and get started and I'll show you what that means.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,050
So I'm going to click Get Started, and right here we can set up our canvas and our text so I can set

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,360
up background colors, I can set up font families, all the font size, font weights.

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,460
I can even set up standards.

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,280
You can go and learn more about the website over here.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,830
But typically we're aiming for double standards and this is what the text would look like.

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,260
I think this is fine to just get started.

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,570
So I'm going to do is I'm going to click generate color palette.

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:00,830
So what this does is it generates a ton of color palettes based off of different colors like green,

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,030
blue, purple.

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:08,110
You can also sort by all and you'll be able to see all of the contrast applicable colors.

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,930
So what I can do here is I can pick this purple and you'll notice that the current ratio meets the double

22
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,980
standard.

23
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:22,520
I get a little hex value here that all I need to do is click on and I copies to my clipboard and I can

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,770
bring that right into figma and start creating a color palette based off of some colors that I've picked,

25
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,210
which is really cool.

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,850
You can see that this one's been copied.

27
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,360
You can see all these other ones over here, which is really great.

28
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,430
And you can just start over if you want to if you want to go back and set up that canvas again.

29
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,030
Now, the next tool I like to use is called Colorable.

30
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,370
Now, I just love this interface.

31
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,230
It's just nice, it's punchy.

32
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:57,530
And what's really nice and cool about it is that you can see if it's a compliant or AA compliant right

33
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:57,980
at the top.

34
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,720
You don't necessarily need to set anything.

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,760
You can just jump right in and start fiddling away.

36
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,720
If you have a couple of colors that you already have in mind.

37
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,620
It's a great way to just kind of input them right away.

38
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:15,200
Another thing is like, if you really want to just fiddle around with colors, this is probably the

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,610
best tool to do so.

40
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,910
So you can see like white on this very, very light.

41
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,550
Sky blue fails in all aspects.

42
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,720
And you'll see that it still keeps on failing, probably until we get a little darker.

43
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,590
So you can see this is good for larger text and.

44
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,920
Smaller text and now it's Triple A compliant.

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,460
So this is another really cool tool where you can also do is you can reverse these.

46
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,420
And you can see what it looks like reversed when you reverse the foreground and the background colors.

47
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,750
So this is an awesome tool.

48
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,490
If you want to fiddle around with colors really quickly or test a color or hex code that you have in

49
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,000
mind.

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,770
Now what I typically use are figma plug ins because it's just so quick for your actual workflow.

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,450
The main Figma plugin that I actually use is called.

52
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,250
Contrast.

53
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,900
So I'll bring that up right now.

54
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,880
So I have a couple of buttons here, and I'm going to show you how that works with contrast.

55
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,900
But what I really want to show you is that these buttons are actually accessible and they are readable.

56
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,280
And but I think that they're not the greatest.

57
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,890
So I'll show you what that looks like.

58
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:39,130
So all I need to do is I need to select this text inside this frame and it'll show me exactly here if

59
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,140
it meets the contrast standards.

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,060
You'll see the foreground and background and it meets all the standards right across the board.

61
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,660
Let's see.

62
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,680
Even with the orange.

63
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,720
Same thing.

64
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,280
I'll show you the contrast ratio here as well.

65
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,590
And I find this is the quickest way to just test your designs, even when you're just creating concepts.

66
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,520
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to actually create a double a duplicate over here, and I'm

67
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,860
going to show you what it looks like with white.

68
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,240
So I'm going to change that.

69
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,050
And another great thing about this is that it's going to update on the fly.

70
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,960
So let's go and pick white.

71
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:22,500
The color hex code for that is f f for a short form or three or six FS.

72
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,850
Now what we got here is that it totally fails.

73
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:33,280
The contrast ratio is not good enough and I think it's going to fail as well for the orange.

74
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,200
Let's change that.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,340
And yet it does fail here for the orange, the contrast is just a bit better than it is on the blue.

76
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,470
Oh, actually, no, it's the.

77
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,500
Oh, yeah, it's just a bit better.

78
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,330
Just a tad.

79
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,780
So let's just close this plug in.

80
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:56,710
And if you notice, I feel like I can read the white on the blue better than I can read the black on

81
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,320
the blue.

82
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:03,220
And so this is going to come down to you testing with your users, because those are guidelines and

83
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,760
you don't necessarily need to follow them like they're law.

84
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:13,570
So take that into account when you're designing and coming up with color palettes or intended uses for

85
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:20,290
your colors, because there may be a case like this where a white on a blue may actually be really readable

86
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,830
and it doesn't necessarily meet a contrast standard.

87
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,170
So keep that in mind.

88
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,330
Another plug in is Stark, which is pretty, pretty popular.

89
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,960
All you need to do is like check contrast.

90
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,170
So I need to select a layer.

91
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:41,950
So I'm going to select that layer and check the contrast really quickly so you can see that it comes

92
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,820
up right away.

93
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,340
You can upgrade and pay.

94
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,420
But I mean, I feel like.

95
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,190
This does it much better color.

96
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,090
Where is it?

97
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,160
Contrast right here.

98
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,590
This plugin is much better just because you can do it on the fly.

99
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,030
You don't need to keep on selecting it or closing it or you don't even need to pay for it.

100
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:06,870
So this is a great way to check what colors will work right on the fly.

101
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,960
So like I said over here, keep that in mind.

102
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,940
These are guidelines.

103
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,500
They aren't necessarily law.

104
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,430
So use what is best for you and what's best for your users.

105
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,700
And yeah, that's basically it for the tools that I use to check my contrast.
