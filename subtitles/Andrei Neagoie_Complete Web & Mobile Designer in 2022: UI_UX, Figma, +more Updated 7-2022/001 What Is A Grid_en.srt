1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,280
We're going to talk about the grid today.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,280
Now, what is a grid?

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,950
Lots of people are scared of it for some reason.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,010
You know, I get it.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,070
Grids kind of look really restrictive and they look scary.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,200
I mean, just look at this thing.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,800
Wow.

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,180
Even though they look like prison bars, they aren't as restrictive as you may think.

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,690
The grid is a structure comprising of a series of lines that divide the page into columns.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:34,690
We have vertical and horizontal, and this structure helps designers arrange content on a page.

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,850
Like you can see here, everything is sitting on a grid.

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,670
This is something we never include in our final designs.

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,320
You'll never see somebody print a poster like this and have a grid showing, or you'll never see a website

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,990
with a grid showing unless somebody purposefully did that.

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,600
But usually that's incredibly rare.

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,220
Maybe as a stylistic approach, but I don't really recommend it now.

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,870
It serves as a skeleton for your layout, and originally the grid came from print design.

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,730
But if we ever think about where there are our grids, I mean, they're basically applied in a lot of

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,390
places.

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,200
Let's take a look.

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,120
We've got bookcases.

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,940
We even have subdivisions.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,010
I mean, they are everywhere.

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,550
I want to show you more about grades, but I want to teach you a little bit about history, because

26
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,510
I think understanding the past will really help you understand the basics.

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:22,840
Now.

28
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,830
Grids have always been linked to typography over here.

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,320
They were first used to arrange handwriting on paper, and then later on we're transformed into the

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,310
manuscript layout.

31
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,600
You could see this over here and we're going to get into what the manuscript layout looks like and what

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,560
it comprises of.

33
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,890
Since the early days, grids were used to help aid readers in reading.

34
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,670
Now let's fast forward all the way to the Renaissance.

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,590
Now, this era had a profound impact on great systems.

36
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,890
I mean, many artists strived for perfect geometry.

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,180
Many paintings resulted in the centered, symmetrical layouts like this.

38
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,790
We have very centered layout.

39
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,990
You can see all the symmetry and hidden geometry within this painting.

40
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,970
You wouldn't necessarily notice it if these guidelines were in here to show you, but this was a lot

41
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,310
of Renaissance paintings really strived for.

42
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,560
You ever heard of the golden ratio in the 13th century?

43
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,970
Vlad DeJong created the diagram to achieve harmonious design.

44
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,490
This diagram was a merger between the grid system and the golden ratio, and it was created to produce

45
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,910
page layouts based off of margins with fixed ratios.

46
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,340
And this technique is still used in today.

47
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,670
You can see that this is a fairly recent layout and it is in fact using it.

48
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,790
Jumping forward to the industrial revolution, getting of mass production and the rise of newspapers,

49
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:51,480
posters, etc. with so much content on one page like Look at this, it's hard to read as is even with

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,060
a nice little grid layout, but with so much content on one page, designers needed to develop a way

51
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,600
to communicate their message while allowing for natural reading behaviour.

52
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,040
They've achieved that here.

53
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,500
There are newspapers that were much worse than this.

54
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,430
Now last stop, the grid.

55
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,580
We know when used today is very much tied to Swiss design.

56
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,600
It doesn't look like much, but many systems were born from this.

57
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,800
I want you to pitches World War One and Switzerland was neutral.

58
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,880
Of course, they all kind of became a common meeting ground for creatives.

59
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:29,810
And because publications had to set three separate languages, which were German, Italian and French,

60
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,060
because there were so many, or there was such an influx of people.

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,330
Designers needed to come up with a solution.

62
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,270
Typographer is like John Child and Herbert Bayer.

63
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,040
They stepped up to address that and for the first time, white space was used as an element in layout

64
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,640
design.

65
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,800
And you can see that in a lot of layouts today, a lot of white space, and they all kind of came from

66
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,100
that.

67
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:55,040
Even if you look at the print design that we saw earlier, showing that first grid, that kind of system

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,820
was born from this and Swiss design had a profound impact on layout.

69
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,000
Now we're going to jump into some more basics.
