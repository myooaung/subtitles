00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,520
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:10,500
Now up to this point, we learned about HTML, CSS templates and learned how to do layout with things

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,600
like Flexbox and CSS grid.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:19,980
And probably the most important thing that you need to know from the sections is how to create a website,

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,300
right?

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,440
How to lay out a website, but also not spend a lot of time on simple tasks.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,980
Because when we get to the JavaScript section, which is the more exciting actual logic programming

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,130
part of the course, that's when you truly become a developer.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,610
Up until now, what we've learned is the foundation that that allows us to build web apps and applications,

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,640
but you're never going to actually get interviewed about these specific topics.

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,870
I mean, yes, in small cases, you might be if you're a designer, you might get asked questions about

12
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,040
CSS and HTML.

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:03,060
But most of the time the questions you'll be asked is on things like JavaScript logic and more complex

14
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,390
topics that we're going to cover later on in the course.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,330
But the one thing that I really want you to take away from this section is being able to build websites

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,720
fast or at least get to the part where you need to start writing JavaScript, because that's where your

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,000
real job begins.

18
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,570
So I have a task for you.

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,270
Using all the skills that you've learned up until now, I want you to create a layout of a website,

20
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,360
something that you're going to do over and over throughout your career.

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:41,090
And I've created a small starter file here where we have these little button like containers or divs.

22
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:49,430
But as the name suggests, I want you to align these in a responsive way to something that looks like

23
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:49,970
this.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,380
I know it's not the prettiest thing right now to look at, and we're only focusing on layout.

25
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,140
But what I want you to do is to make the header green button over here.

26
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,910
Be an actual header.

27
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:10,220
We want the cover to be well, the actual cover of our site and then maybe have a project grid where

28
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,830
we list all of our projects like we have over here and then obviously a footer at the bottom.

29
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,460
And I've selected this layout because it's a very common pattern that you'll see in a lot of websites.

30
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,300
So you're going to be doing this a lot.

31
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:31,300
So let's figure out the best way to go about doing this so that when I make this smaller, it's all

32
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,140
responsive.

33
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:42,310
So your task is to use whatever you've learned up until now to create this using the starter files.

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,210
And don't worry, I'll have a solution video for you after this.

35
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:52,030
And we'll also go into how easy it is once you have a layout, which is the recommended way to build

36
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,980
a website, starting with the layout first and then once you have the layout fixed.

37
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:04,050
Converting this into something usable like this because styling becomes really, really easy once you

38
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,460
have the layout in place.

39
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:14,790
Now, the one hint that I want to give here is to use both Flexbox and CSS grid to accomplish your goal.

40
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,630
Although anything you can do in Flexbox, you can do with grid and vice versa, or at least most things

41
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:29,040
using the tools and combination Flexbox and CC Grid together is really, really powerful to allow you

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,750
to build a layout like this.

43
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,960
So good luck.

44
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,820
I know it's going to be tough, but I'll see you in the solution video.

45
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:36,870
Bye bye.
