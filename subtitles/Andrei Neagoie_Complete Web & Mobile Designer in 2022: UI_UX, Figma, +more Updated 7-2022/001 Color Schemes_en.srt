00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,090
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,560
We're going to be jumping right into color.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,020
This is a really interesting topic.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,420
I love talking about color because color really impacts a lot of different things that we don't think

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:12,780
about.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,810
So let's jump right into the basics.

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,820
I talk about color theory.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,550
If you know your color theory, that's awesome.

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,900
But if not, we're going to go through a little refresher and there's lots and lots of resources out

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,200
there, so I'll touch upon it throughout this whole lesson.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,660
So let's get started with some color schemes that create the basis for color palettes.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,910
We can refer to these tried and true formulas to help ensure we're creating good harmony.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,350
So the first is monochromatic.

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,930
Over here, you'll notice it.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,700
These colors will share the tints, hues and tones of one primary color.

16
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:54,070
In theory, it's the simplest of all color schemes, and these are mostly used in minimal designs because

17
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,160
one hue generally results in a less distracting layout.

18
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,650
The price of simplicity is that you cannot use multiple colors that could help with visualizing information

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,580
in the UI.

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,280
So you'll see that they've chosen this color right here, which is kind of like in between a red and

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,090
an orange.

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,370
And there are just several colors that share the same tint in hues afterwards.

23
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,980
So we got like a lighter version.

24
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,920
We can also probably just get a little bit more red if we wanted to, but still, this is a monochromatic

25
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,030
color scheme.

26
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,370
The next is analogous.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,440
This is based off of three colors located next to each other on the color wheel.

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,850
You'll notice them.

29
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,830
Over here we have like an orange, a lighter orange, and we're getting into kind of yellow territory.

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,710
Now, this can easily be found in nature.

31
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,070
You got to think about like trees in autumn as a leaves change color.

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:51,220
So these can be warm colors like orange and yellow like we see over here, or cooler colors like blue

33
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,060
and purple.

34
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,720
I find that they're pretty easy to work with to the next color scheme is complementary.

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,370
Now this scheme uses colors that are on the opposite sides of the color wheel.

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,040
We have purple and yellow.

37
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:11,050
You can play around with the saturation and brightness to create some refined color palettes.

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,270
So over here this looks okay.

39
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,910
I mean, we can go in to Figma or whatever program you're using and really kind of adjust to get the

40
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,950
right amount of color or the right amount of contrast and brightness.

41
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,160
It doesn't necessarily mean that both colors need to be extremely vibrant.

42
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,760
Over here we have split complementary color schemes.

43
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,080
This scheme uses colors that are on either side of the colors complement.

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,760
So we'll have like a red orangish color right here and then.

45
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,860
We have two colors right here.

46
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,320
We have the green and we have the blue.

47
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,840
So they kind of form like a triangle at the bottom.

48
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,520
Another example would be like a purple and then like a little bit of an orange in more of a brighter

49
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,160
yellow.

50
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,020
Or we can do like a red and a green and a yellow.

51
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,850
So that is split.

52
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,930
Complementary.

53
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,310
Next is Triadic.

54
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:08,150
Now these colors are evenly spaced in equilateral triangle on the color wheel.

55
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,750
The three colors will be exactly 120 degrees from each other, like an equilateral triangle.

56
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,090
These schemes are considered to be more vibrant.

57
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,910
They keep harmony but deliver some high contrast.

58
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,970
So you've got purple, green and orange.

59
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,890
And these are the color schemes that I use.

60
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:30,830
Probably the last one is patriotic and this scheme usually utilizes two sets of complementary pairs

61
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:38,360
and they're so hard to balance and pull off because of one color needs to be the primary without overtly

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,470
dominating the others.

63
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:44,000
And that's why I kind of avoid that color scheme when I'm trying to create a user interface.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,010
So I would stick to these as your go tos.

65
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:53,060
Next we're going to jump into what questions I ask myself before I even start looking for color palettes.
