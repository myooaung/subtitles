00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.120
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.720
We're going to talk about the sketching process in a little bit more detail.

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.800
There's a couple of different steps and steps within those steps that I want to talk about and touch

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.920
upon so that when you start sketching, you're just ready.

5
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.450
That first step is be prepared.

6
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.510
Always be prepared.

7
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.430
You know, prepare your tools beforehand.

8
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.710
Lots of papers, pens, markers, pencils, whatever works for you, even if it's like a tablet.

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.050
We also want to think about what our goals are.

10
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.990
You can think about what you're trying to solve for.

11
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.230
Maybe it's a certain flow, maybe it's a certain interaction.

12
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.270
But that should always be the center of your attention.

13
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.450
We're also going to think about our audience.

14
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.610
This is really important.

15
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.990
If it's for yourself, I mean, go crazy, be as messy as you want.

16
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.090
I mean, you don't really need to annotate anything as long as you understand your own process.

17
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.060
But if it's for somebody like a client or a stakeholder or your teammates, I mean, you need to clean

18
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.630
them up a bit.

19
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.140
So maybe add a bit more detail and explain your thought process so you don't waste time trying to explain

20
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.730
it while you're presenting it to them.

21
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.490
Remember, always time box yourself.

22
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.580
This is like one of the best pieces of advice I ever got in my career is to time box anything.

23
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.150
Time box.

24
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.400
You're sketching presentations.

25
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.620
Keep yourself under a time limit because it'll help you focus on sketching for your goal, and it'll

26
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.030
put a little pressure on you to just throw out those ideas, not get bogged down by those details like

27
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.200
we talked about earlier.

28
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.450
So don't worry about them being messy.

29
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.260
Just time box yourself, and I promise you you'll just produce a bunch.

30
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.170
Step two.

31
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.100
Now, what you want to do here is just start.

32
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.310
Just go draw a frame for your device.

33
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.820
Is it a browser?

34
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.950
Is it a desktop window?

35
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.880
In this case, right here we have a mobile frame, so it just needs to be a frame.

36
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.700
It's just going to help you kind of guide your sketch a bit.

37
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.310
The next step is to think about the bigger picture and more basic elements, elements that are much

38
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.080
more redundant that you'll see.

39
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.890
They'll really help you kind of frame your sketches, whether it's a footer or it's a header.

40
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.700
Think about those elements that you're going to be seeing a lot of.

41
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.920
And then from there, move on to some of the more detailed elements and the more detailed interactions.

42
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.810
Know, have fun.

43
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.100
Start sketching those interactions.

44
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.000
Keep them very simple.

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.030
At this stage, all you need is one or two shapes, squares, circles, rectangles that can make up

46
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.080
any sketch.

47
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.430
You'll notice here that they're just using rectangles.

48
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.590
We have circles, we have lines.

49
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.900
They get their point across pretty well.

50
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.750
Now this is really important.

51
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.260
This is one of my messy sketches.

52
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.010
So I want you to just annotate and document your sketches.

53
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.680
The worst thing is looking back and not understanding what you sketch before you're going to be creating

54
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.820
messy sketches.

55
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.820
And sometimes you may not understand what you drew the day before or the week before whenever you revisit

56
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.200
them.

57
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.730
So the thing you need to do is just be as detailed as you can, but just quickly point out some certain

58
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.040
reasoning or proposed interactions like over here I have some titles, I have some just some text explaining

59
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.450
what the interaction is.

60
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.200
It just really helps give a little more context to what you're drawing.

61
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.130
Now, what I need you to do is just keep going, find the sketches you like, and start building alternatives

62
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.580
from that.

63
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.720
Don't just stop.

64
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.860
Organize the ones that you think of the potential and keep on going.

65
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.040
And what's going to really help you do that is by sharing them.

66
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.370
Share those sketches, bring them to your product team to discuss.

67
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.190
I mean, if you're working beside them, just tap them on the shoulder, set a meeting time, just get

68
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.990
everyone in a room to just talk about certain things that you've been working on, whether it's an interaction,

69
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.700
whether it's an overall flow.

70
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.740
I like uploading my sketches into Figma sometimes, and I share that document with the team and people

71
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.490
can comment.

72
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.980
I also just bring printouts or originals, so if I'm sketching on paper, I'm just bringing my paper

73
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.290
there, or if I'm sketching within like a tablet or something, I'm bringing that print out.

74
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.840
What I'm doing is I'm just talking to everyone.

75
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.740
It doesn't matter.

76
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.280
Developers, product managers, QA, everyone has valuable insight that you should really tap into.

77
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.270
And after you get some feedback, you can start building off of those sketches a bit more.

78
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.990
This is an ongoing process for every type of feature that you're going to design.

79
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.269
The last step is refining.

80
00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.250
So how do you clarify your sketches?

81
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.840
So you have some sketches indicating some sort of flow or interaction and you want to clean them up

82
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.030
a bit or think through them a bit more, but they're a bit messy and unorganized, and that's okay.

83
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.990
So what do you do?

84
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.760
Add titles.

85
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.370
You really want to add titles for all your sketches, they really help you understand which screens

86
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.580
are relevant and without thinking too much about it.

87
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.300
This is so useful if you have a bunch of sketches like we see here and yes, annotate again.

88
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.160
I know I mentioned this before, but here it is.

89
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.530
Get annotations are like little notes right beside elements that explain its purpose.

90
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.870
They also really help clarify certain things that are just too hard to draw.

91
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.250
So it's really great.

92
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.960
So I mean, like over here you can see that there's a bunch of different annotations in regards to the

93
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:12.520
sketch and these different UI elements, but we also can use numbers, try numbering your sketches.

94
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.960
It can really help define where certain sketch is within a flow or interaction.

95
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.570
It helps speed up discussions and it really helps others to try and make sense of where something fits

96
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.920
in within your sketches.

97
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.690
It also helps others to point out certain numbers when they're giving you some feedback so they can

98
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.660
just say, Hey, Daniel, screen three.

99
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.440
I love it.

100
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.940
We're going to keep that the same.

101
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.280
And it really helps you gather that feedback as well.

102
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.490
If you're taking notes, definitely use arrows.

103
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.950
Arrows help to indicate a transition.

104
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.260
So we can see here that if somebody interacts with this element, something else is going to happen

105
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.870
and may push them in two different directions.

106
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.060
Even though I don't necessarily understand this flow, I do know that something's happening here that's

107
00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.040
going to push them into different directions, and that's with no context whatsoever.

108
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.250
You can only imagine what somebody with context could see and the level of detail and context you can

109
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.880
give them.

110
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:13.690
So remember, use arrows that can really help indicate where there's a page transition or even an interaction

111
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.470
transition.

112
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.080
And lastly, if you're feeling a little brave, you can start drawing some gestures for certain interactions

113
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.550
that are a bit hard.

114
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.190
And there's a bunch of different ways you can kind of do this.

115
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.320
You can like try to use like little circles, you can use arrows to indicate them.

116
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.290
But what I usually do is I sketch really quickly and I'm not really worried about like refining like

117
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.940
these gesture sketches.

118
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.700
What I'll do is I'll just go right over to the developer that I'm working with or developers and have

119
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.600
a conversation.

120
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.700
I mean, I run it by them and try to explain this in person, maybe even sketch on a whiteboard.

121
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.680
And so they can really understand my intention and I can get some insight into what they think about

122
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.550
the interaction.

123
00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:01.450
These are the different types of things you can do when you're thinking about the actual sketching process.

124
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.900
Next, we're going to jump into actually sketching some UX flows.
