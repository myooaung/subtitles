1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.950
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.830
So we are going to start working on this little search.

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:13.290
So I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate that search button and I'm actually going to take this

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.220
background.

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.770
Just expand it a bit.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's see what that looks like.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.250
So what I'm going to do is on hover.

8
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.680
It's going to.

9
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.410
Click that.

10
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.680
So on.

11
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.130
We're celebrating 100.

12
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.680
Open overlay.

13
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.180
Let's see what that looks like.

14
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.410
So that's not matched up properly.

15
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.040
So what we're going to do is we're going to.

16
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.480
Manually do it.

17
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.500
Oh, there we go.

18
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.720
So we have a little kind of hover interaction.

19
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.490
Let's bring that up in size.

20
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.620
So we have a nice little.

21
00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.630
Now.

22
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.940
This interaction isn't perfect, but.

23
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.780
We are still kind of showcasing.

24
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.730
What would happen if we had to hover?

25
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.870
It would just grow in size.

26
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.040
So that's really cool and what we're going to do next.

27
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.910
We are going to take this rain.

28
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.450
We're going to duplicate it.

29
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.460
Down here.

30
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.660
Are going to take this.

31
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.160
So.

32
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.860
Let's actually go and search for a an icon.

33
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.460
So I'm going to go to feather icons.

34
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.080
Perfect.

35
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.540
I am searching for an ex.

36
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.510
Beautiful.

37
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.240
So we got our X over here.

38
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.660
You're gonna change that to white.

39
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.570
And copy that.

40
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.050
Throw that in there.

41
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.960
Plus delete search.

42
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.050
We'll have our X.

43
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.090
So what's going to happen is on this overlay because we're going to be hovering on it and the only way

44
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.150
to click it, it's going to be to actually click the overlay.

45
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:22.190
So while we click on this overlay, so let me just make that frame a little bit larger.

46
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.980
So let's go to prototype again.

47
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.380
So on click we are going to navigate to.

48
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.930
This second, Nev.

49
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.460
Let's see what this looks like.

50
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.320
So we just run it dissolve.

51
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.290
We can actually just smart animate.

52
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.240
So let's see what that looks like.

53
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.600
So we've got to fix that.

54
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.510
Let's do that again.

55
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.490
So this.

56
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.910
Should.

57
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.370
Perfect.

58
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.970
This will not have anything on it.

59
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.580
So let's see what that looks like.

60
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.170
Let's restart it.

61
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.080
Pressing our.

62
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.540
And then we have an X all together into a larger interaction.

63
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.760
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to press F and I'm going to get just a screen over here.

64
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.440
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to place this a nav.

65
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.450
Let's go back to our design tab because it's near impossible.

66
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.140
Okay.

67
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.200
So we have that.

68
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.910
They're perfect.

69
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.560
And.

70
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.900
Let's see what this looks like.

71
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.450
Nice.

72
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.520
So when I click this, it will.

73
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.160
Navigate to.

74
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.840
This screen going to delete that.

75
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.530
So a prototype.

76
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.760
And so when I click on this, it's actually going to go to the screen and everything should smart animate

77
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.830
this should swap perfect.

78
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.500
Perfect.

79
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.320
Now what I want to do is.

80
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.770
Let's think about an overlay.

81
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.580
So.

82
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.600
We can do a couple of different things here.

83
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.020
We can actually keep this out of this frame.

84
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.530
We can remove this.

85
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.600
Actually, you know, we're going to need that because we can't have more than one thing at a time.

86
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.990
But let's just create this.

87
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.300
This is going to be.

88
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.330
Let's create a background color.

89
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.090
So I'm going to make like an overlay for search.

90
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.240
It's not going to be anything final or anything, but I want to create something pretty cool here.

91
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.820
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do that.

92
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.850
I'm going to just make like a rounded, rounded corners for this card.

93
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.840
And who knows?

94
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.120
Like, this could pop like a search up.

95
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.240
And.

96
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.460
We can have.

97
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.600
A search form input and that can be.

98
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.870
Right there.

99
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.810
We can even just steal this icon.

100
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.370
Putting something really quickly together.

101
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.380
Och this is going to be rounded as well.

102
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.520
And we need some text that just says search.

103
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.600
So I know that a lot of these interactions aren't really viable.

104
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.900
I mean, hover isn't viable on mobile, but we can start playing around with cool things that we wouldn't

105
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.010
normally think about.

106
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:53.320
And when we're working on desktop and stuff like that, we will definitely be working with Hover, so

107
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.760
it's good to think about that.

108
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.320
So what do we got here?

109
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.860
What do we got?

110
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.750
I'm going to show you something pretty cool.

111
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.520
So we're going to have smart animate.

112
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.020
This is actually going to be in here.

113
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.780
What I'm going to do is I'm actually going to.

114
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.580
Let's see if it works the way I want it to work.

115
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:25.210
So when I click this and when I click this, we're just actually going to go back to this screen.

116
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.480
So prototype doo doo.

117
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:35.230
We are going to go back here on click navigate to a smart animate.

118
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.730
Perfect.

119
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.400
Let's see what we've put together here.

120
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.300
Let's get a block background on this

121
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.940
just so we can see where we are.

122
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.940
So we have all our different items.

123
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:59.190
If I hover over the search, I can see that it will get larger if I click and I get an overlay.

124
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.400
So that's pretty cool.

125
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.200
If I close it, it goes away.

126
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.470
So I mean, you can create all these little micro interactions, incorporate motion into them to create

127
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.330
like little types of experiences like that.

128
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.590
Like this is probably not a good search experience just because we don't have like an actual search

129
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:14.800
bar.

130
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.270
But if you wanted to kind of create an overlay, I can imagine this working really well for something

131
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:24.160
like Cart where it may not be a whole page, it may just be like a little overlay that shows your cart

132
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:24.790
items.

133
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.570
So think about all the different ways you can incorporate that.

134
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.250
Like this is pretty awesome.

135
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.130
I love it.

136
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.470
I think that's a pretty cool way to create a micro interaction there.

137
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.780
So something is happening over here.

138
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.100
Yeah.

139
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.580
So that's pretty cool.

140
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:50.820
Now, like I said, that may not be the best interaction for search, but I thought it was pretty interesting

141
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:57.000
because you could just, like, pop a modal and having the search like turn into an x is pretty cool

142
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.170
little micro interaction.

143
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.040
You get that nice little feedback after you've clicked it.

144
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.920
So I think Cart is another kind of a good candidate for something like that where you would just pop

145
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.770
an overlay and it would have like cart items.

146
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:18.720
Apply that structure to micro interactions, trigger rules, feedback and modes and loops.

147
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:26.360
So that way when users go back and use the interaction, I mean it's just very seamless.

148
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.880
It's very good in the sense that this one is triggered by a user.

149
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.360
It is a giving me feedback.

150
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:39.420
The rules behind the scenes are that if I click on this, I will hide and show.

151
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.330
I will get the feedback that something's happened.

152
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.130
These are individual micro interactions.

153
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.350
I am seeing the the different item.

154
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:54.570
I'm noticing the color change and in terms of modes and loops, in this case, it may change in terms

155
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.260
of like, if I have something in the cart, it'll change.

156
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.450
Or if I've searched in the past, we may have type ahead like previous searches or saved searches that

157
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.190
could apply to the micro interaction.

158
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.400
So apply all those rules I spoke about earlier.

159
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:14.610
Remember those tips just about motion in general and you're well on your way to creating beautiful,

160
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.930
seamless experiences.
