00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,960
Hey, everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:07,500
So the last thing I want to talk about, really, is that what happens when you have your content written,

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,230
you have the imagery picked out, like, what do you do?

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,000
Like, you know, how to code?

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,970
Do you want some website builder to really help you?

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,140
And I'm going to give you the rundown a couple of different options that you can go through when actually

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,730
posting your portfolio website.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,660
So last video we talked about Ryan Scott and his kind of like case studies and they're really thorough,

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,560
they're really beautiful.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,320
I love them and I can see that like this.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,910
This person has a lot of experience.

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,400
They know what they're talking about when it comes to just like coming up with thoughtful solutions.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,290
Now, they've actually used Squarespace to build a website.

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,850
They haven't coded it themselves.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,140
It's very simple.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,510
So they've used Squarespace.

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,460
So you can tell by that little icon up there.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:00,030
And Squarespace is a great way for you to just come up with a quick design template and just get it

19
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,850
live really quickly without worrying about it being responsive, without worrying about coding, without

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,530
worrying about all that kind of fuss.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,430
Now, I view Squarespace in the past.

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,230
I don't anymore, but I would definitely recommend it to somebody who just wants to get something up

23
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,590
and running.

24
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,640
They don't want to fiddle with code.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,120
You can if you want to, but they provide beautiful templates for you to just showcase like your work

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,810
really, really easily and make it look beautiful.

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,290
Now they have their own way of hosting websites, so you don't even have to worry about that as well.

28
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,750
They have, like I said, a bunch of different templates.

29
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,250
So if we go through kind of their template over here, we can just.

30
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,400
Like pick.

31
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,480
Different types of things that we may want over here.

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,640
So design.

33
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,300
Showcase work and expertise.

34
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,660
Right now, where are you in your process?

35
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,930
So I think I'm I'm just going to replace my site with one from Squarespace.

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,080
Here are the different types of kind of portfolio based sites that they offer.

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,890
And all of them are nice.

38
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,730
Like this one is really nice.

39
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,570
Let's choose this one.

40
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,530
So let's a preview, Nolan, and you can see what it looks like.

41
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,570
So we have an artwork section.

42
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,330
Very easy, nice little animation.

43
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,470
So I'm going to click one.

44
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:30,620
And really it's just really easy to kind of place and drop content into something like Squarespace once

45
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,980
again, like it's already responsive outside of the box.

46
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,320
It's actually kind of looks like my site, which is really funny, but I would definitely recommend

47
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,720
something like Squarespace for people who don't want to fiddle with anything or any problems with code

48
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,860
and stuff like that.

49
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,480
And it's really nice and aesthetically pleasing right out of the box.

50
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,940
So that is one option, Squarespace.

51
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,480
There are other options similar to Squarespace, like WordPress and stuff like that.

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
But I digress.

53
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,860
I think Squarespace is probably one of the better options out there just for out of the box functionality.

54
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,170
Next is something like GitHub pages.

55
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,460
So this is what I use.

56
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:13,010
I've coded my own website and I just hosted on GitHub and I've turned that repository into an actual

57
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:13,670
website.

58
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,500
So that's what GitHub pages does.

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,660
So you can host it there for free.

60
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,310
It's just really, really easy.

61
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,260
A lot of times people have trouble with like, where do I host my website?

62
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:30,620
Where do I like access all my files if I want to kind of redesign it or like update it and stuff like

63
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:30,890
that.

64
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,960
And you know, the thing about GitHub pages, like if you're not constantly coding and like if you're

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,540
not in that realm, which I'm not anymore, like I haven't really updated my portfolio website in some

66
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,830
time and I may actually switch back to something like Squarespace just for the, the actual ease of

67
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,520
use.

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,530
But in this case, GitHub pages is really great if you're already integrated with like the GitHub ecosystem

69
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,440
and you've already familiar with it and you can easily just kind of upload all your files there and

70
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,530
create a public website and it will automatically be hosted.

71
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,900
So easy way to do that.

72
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,560
And you can also like easily download those files and run them in your terminal and use whatever code

73
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,710
editor or text editor that you have, whether that be something like Sublime or Adam, it doesn't matter.

74
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:21,980
I mean, you can just easily edit and then push once again to that repository and have it update and

75
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,550
be live.

76
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,690
So if you're into that, if you want a more tactile approach to building your website, this is what

77
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,790
I would definitely use.

78
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,140
But like I said, if you don't want that, you don't want the fuss, go with something like Squarespace

79
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,670
where you can just automatically get your website and your portfolio up and running easily.

80
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,690
So that's how I would approach getting your website up and running really quickly.

81
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,060
And yeah, go ahead, go out there.

82
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,360
And remember I said about content like you don't need any projects, only several and build some beautiful

83
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,030
case studies and beautiful websites for potential employers and just for colleagues to kind of look

84
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,380
at and give you some feedback.
