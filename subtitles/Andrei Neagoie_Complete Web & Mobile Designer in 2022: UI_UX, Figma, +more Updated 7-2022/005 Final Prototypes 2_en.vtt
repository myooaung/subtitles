00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.970
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:08.310
So what I want to do is I want to show you how we've created our login screen prototype.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:15.540
Now you can see just an overview on how complex that can be just from going from one page to the next.

4
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.190
You'll also notice over here I have different variations of a certain page just to showcase how interaction

5
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.350
will happen and what that may look like.

6
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.990
So we may need to even break this down further if we want to get really into the nitty gritty details.

7
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.759
But let me show you what it looks like.

8
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.650
So what I want to do is we've gone to the home screen from the last prototype.

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.220
We have our login CTA over here.

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.280
And what I want to do is I want to go straight to our login.

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.010
So this is the login section I've created.

12
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.930
Now if you go to a profile without being logged in, we have a login screen.

13
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.210
If they click this, what I want to happen is this button shrinks a bit, so I want to showcase that

14
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.280
interaction and maybe it lightens a bit.

15
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.570
If they want to go back home.

16
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.250
So I've connected that backwards.

17
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.540
And what will happen here.

18
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.280
This is the active state and we're actually not going to be doing much here.

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.850
After they click this button, I have a delay.

20
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.400
So 50 milliseconds afterwards.

21
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.780
We're just going to pop to the next screen.

22
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.770
We're going to dissolve.

23
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.590
And that's going to pop into this screen.

24
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.090
So I'm going to show you what that looks like.

25
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.310
Let's just click play.

26
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.300
So what we have here is our screen.

27
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.010
We're going to click log in.

28
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.690
Perfect.

29
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.460
So now I can see what I can click.

30
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.040
If I wanted to go back, that screen just kind of pushes itself back in and go there.

31
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.690
So if I click log in, you're going to need to catch this little interaction.

32
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.780
So you saw how that button just kind of like.

33
00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.870
Plopped itself back down and up, but there was definitely some clear feedback in the type of animation

34
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.000
we had there, the little micro interaction.

35
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.670
So it was just very subtle and that's how you would create like prototypes just for that.

36
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.050
Now what happens here is actually, if I just click down the button, like I said, it shrinks, it

37
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.830
goes back up.

38
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.100
Now, in the instance, we're trying to show like some connection of screens alongside those micro interactions,

39
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.470
and that's what makes this so complex.

40
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.130
So after this kind of shrinks down, it goes back and shrinks back up.

41
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.540
So you can tell we're creating like a lot of duplicates here.

42
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.010
And then after a 300 millisecond delay.

43
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.610
Overlay will pop up, so it's going to move in from the bottom.

44
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.010
No smart animating match layers.

45
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.580
We just want a brand new screen.

46
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.830
So that's where we are right now.

47
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.340
So we've showcased that button interaction if we want to close this.

48
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.650
So we are using some components here.

49
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.410
If we want to close this, it's just going to shrink back down.

50
00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.890
So.

51
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.910
We have that.

52
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.950
Right back down.

53
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.350
So this is a large overlay that we've created.

54
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.230
Now, the next fun thing we're going to talk about here is the different types of input states.

55
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.500
So I've set up this login page and sign in page.

56
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.290
So if they want to sign up they would go to a new sign up page.

57
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.160
But I have like social logins, I have our main logins and what will happen here is if I click this,

58
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.510
it's going to.

59
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.410
Move in the Apple keyboard that I have here, I've created a component.

60
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.940
It's actually in our design system.

61
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.990
So what's going to happen is it's going to pop this up, it's going to start animate, so nothing else

62
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.560
is going to move.

63
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.560
So you'll notice that this will change.

64
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.960
And this is what I'm talking about when we have to rename our components, which makes it a little bit

65
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.120
confusing, but it's okay.

66
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.270
So I've just renamed it to Input and this one is rename to input as well.

67
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.600
So they're both named email and then input.

68
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.480
That all matters if you want it to match properly.

69
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.080
So this is going to pop up like a little carrot indicating that you can type.

70
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.940
You are active on the input.

71
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.540
We have a little bit of shadow here showcasing that it is active.

72
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.920
We have the outline.

73
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.660
We want to make that really clear.

74
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.640
So let's take a look at what that looks like.

75
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.810
So I'm going to look log in.

76
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.410
Not bad right now.

77
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.560
If we want to even go the extra mile, we can create like a little gif of that component carrot over

78
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.410
here that's just kind of on the side and have it blink over and over again to even get the further detail

79
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.390
of what this interaction looks like.

80
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.180
But if we go back, I'm just going to click the back arrow.

81
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.820
So this should still be fixed in this instance, if we click out, then this will drop back in.

82
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.710
But this is what we have.

83
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.230
Let's show that again.

84
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.020
Boom.

85
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.060
Really nice.

86
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.030
So the next step is to just showcase.

87
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.420
I've actually selected all the different keys here.

88
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.320
I mean, you don't need to do that.

89
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.550
You can just if you want to just showcase the interaction entirely.

90
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.400
I went a little above and beyond and did that, but when the user clicks the key, I want them to navigate

91
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.300
to this section.

92
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.210
So we have this same same page duplicated once again.

93
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.000
The only thing that changes on this page is now it's filled.

94
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.300
The password is filled.

95
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.990
We're still active on the here and the get started button changes from disabled to primary.

96
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.610
So we have the disabled.

97
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.420
We have I think I've yeah it's primary now.

98
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.890
And we have the enabled go button over here for our iOS users.

99
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.440
So I've set just a smart animate.

100
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.900
Anything that is named the same will kind of like either behave accordingly.

101
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.550
Other content that isn't we'll just kind of apply a dissolve effect and you'll probably see that with

102
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.480
the get started button.

103
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.350
So let's take a look.

104
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.940
Yeah.

105
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.940
So the dissolve effect applied on there and from here I can click get started.

106
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.000
So as you can tell, we have a couple of different options here.

107
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.210
Let's take a look so we can close this all over again.

108
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.640
We can click the go button or we click to get started.

109
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:16.300
If we click to get started by then, we go through that same process of, you know, losing the focus

110
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.320
of this.

111
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.330
This will kind of shrink and then we will pop back up into here.

112
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.210
And there you go.

113
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.480
And we're back to our home screen and now we're locked in.

114
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.650
I mean, if they don't have an actual login, they'll probably have to go through a signup registration.

115
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:40.950
But if they do, then their profile will be found and we'll go back to relevant details for them.

116
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.390
And that is how you create a little bit more of a complex prototype with different types of mini interactions

117
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.070
like this, where we're kind of focusing on state changes within inputs.

118
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.500
Those are incredibly important for users.

119
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.870
Also, just state changes on buttons.
