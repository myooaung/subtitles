00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,270
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:07,280
Now that we've gotten used to the CSIS grid system, let's introduce a few more properties.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,590
Now, another thing we can do with CSIS Grid, because remember I said it was two dimensional.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,350
That is, we can control the rows as well.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,980
So far, this is something that Flexbox can do as well.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:28,850
We can do something like grid template rows now and actually define the way the rows should look as

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,210
well.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:36,190
So let's say I want to do one far too far.

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,140
What do you think will happen?

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,160
Let's see.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,440
I'm going to save and refresh.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:54,950
The first row has always won fr, but the second row is twice as big as the first one.

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:03,380
As we can see here, and because of the way CSS grid works in the third row, because we haven't really

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,450
added a third column automatically if there's more items.

15
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,880
It's going to just start repeating.

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,080
So the next row, which is the third row, we'll have one fr.

17
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,530
So I can define different things here.

18
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,850
I can say three fr for the third row and let's say five fr for the last row.

19
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,950
If I refresh and save here.

20
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,520
Whoops.

21
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,140
VI save and refresh here.

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,650
We see that we have our new columns or rows.

23
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,130
But that looks ugly.

24
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,230
So let's just keep it at 1fr, which is the default.

25
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,960
Now, another thing that we can do and that you'll see a lot of is.

26
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,800
The repeat function that we can add to something like grid template columns.

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,720
So instead of doing this over here, I can say repeat.

28
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,150
Brackets.

29
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,250
And now I say how many times I want to repeat something.

30
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,070
So the first number is how many times?

31
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,480
So let's say three times.

32
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,450
Repeat one, f, r.

33
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,940
So that's like saying 1fr1fr1fr3 times.

34
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,050
If I save this and refresh.

35
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,890
I get one, two, three.

36
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,020
If I do four here and I refresh, I get four.

37
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,050
And you can imagine what happens if we do six.

38
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,180
We just keep repeating things.

39
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,910
Another thing that we can do is the auto property.

40
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,210
And the auto property just simply means.

41
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,240
Fill in whatever available space we have.

42
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:04,090
So if I do something like auto one, f, r to f r and I refresh here, you'll notice that.

43
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:13,400
The first column doesn't really have any spaces outside of the emoji, and auto can also be thought

44
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,340
of as the max size of the content.

45
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:23,330
If I make this fox, let's say, have a content of two and I refresh.

46
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:31,210
You'll see that the auto property automatically resizes to fit the content.

47
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:38,080
And because this entire layout is on a grid system, it will make sure that the ones below it will have

48
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,190
the same size.

49
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,940
If I do one fr here and I refresh.

50
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:51,850
You'll see the difference of what we're talking, but it's not automatically scaling this first grid.

51
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:59,090
Instead, it's going to keep the proportions that we have and extend anything below it that doesn't

52
00:03:59,090 --> 00:03:59,540
fit.

53
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,080
So Otto is another really, really good feature to use.

54
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,160
But let's fix that.

55
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,320
All right.

56
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,050
Let's tackle a few more properties in the next video.
