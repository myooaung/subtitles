00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.990
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.060
So we're going to be learning about inspiration.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.790
And inspiration is a pretty tough topic because I always get the question of like, how do you stay

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.720
inspired?

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.690
Where do you find your inspiration and things like that?

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.120
I mean, it is a tough question to answer.

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.310
And, you know, we're going to get right into that.

8
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.370
I often get the question, how do I stay inspired?

9
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.650
And, you know, it's easy to go to a site and find like mobile design and, you know, you may get

10
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.490
excited about that, but I mean, that just kind of burns out eventually and you don't know where to

11
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.330
go from there.

12
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.740
It's tough to stay inspired.

13
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.480
And this is what we're going to learn right now.

14
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.560
So it's not a secret that being creative, like you can get drained of ideas.

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.380
You know, it could be like you're working at work and you're on a single project and it's just like

16
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.970
it's draining the life out of you.

17
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.500
And that does happen, and it's hard to stay inspired in moments like that.

18
00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.200
So creativity is kind of like a muscle and you know, if you don't use it, you kind of lose it.

19
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.590
I mean.

20
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.200
Well, not entirely, but it may get weaker.

21
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.560
You must constantly stimulate your creativity so that whenever you're asked for like a great idea,

22
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.450
you're like, you're just ready and you're on the ball.

23
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.470
That's the goal.

24
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.260
This doesn't mean that, like, you're hanging out on like Dribble or Behance or any site like that

25
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.390
and looking at pretty screenshots.

26
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.460
There's a couple of things that I do and a couple of things that my coworkers do a lot of.

27
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.230
So you want to learn.

28
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.250
Let's jump in.

29
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.280
Number one, this may kind of seen all of this, but I mean, talk to the people, you know, your peers.

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.270
I mean, having engaging in conversations with the super smart people you work with is going to be amazing.

31
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.560
If you're not doing this, you should.

32
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.960
Some of the most inspiring conversations I have had have been with my peers over lunch or coffee or

33
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.770
a walk.

34
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.320
Sometimes these chats end up with you maybe helping out with a design challenge of some sort or just

35
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.390
understanding what they're going through.

36
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.730
It may make you think about your problem a little differently or may inspire you to do something differently.

37
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.110
So definitely talk to your peers because they are where you are.

38
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.450
They're smart like you, and they have a lot to talk about and they have a lot to share.

39
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.070
So tap into their brains.

40
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.440
Next is study others.

41
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.880
This is another big one.

42
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.730
So I kind of lied a bit when I said that you should be studying your peers and what your peers are doing

43
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.390
at all times.

44
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.550
I mean, it could be on dribble or something like that, but it's important to study their work and

45
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.180
break down their solution to discover how they thought about it.

46
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.850
It's not just about looking at what the solution is, but it's also about dissecting it, understanding

47
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.520
what their solution was for what the problem was.

48
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.680
I like building little collections of these solutions that I can always pull from as inspiration.

49
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.040
So if I'm thinking of like a certain design pattern, like social login or something like that, I may

50
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.020
have like just a collection of screenshots and how people solve that that I really like.

51
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.900
I think you should collect examples of great techniques don't copy, but learn from them so that it

52
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.570
can inspire better solutions for the products you build.

53
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.410
The next one is you should surround yourself with great design.

54
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.650
Try thinking about how you can surround yourself with that inspiration.

55
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.440
You know, it could be your home, it could be a desk like this, you know, it could be digitally if

56
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.480
you have like a dribble collection or something like that.

57
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.070
I know I keep on going back to dribble.

58
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.180
Keeping inspiration around you allows you to pull from whatever you need to.

59
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.360
It also serves as a great reminder for what you want to achieve.

60
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.530
I also find that even making like your workspace just very comfortable and very much attuned to how

61
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.940
you are as a person could really help just your workflow in general.

62
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.750
Like a desk like this is really nice and you know, it may not suit all of us.

63
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.460
I have a really nice desk at home and I really love just sitting there and working there.

64
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.560
You know, there's some plants on the desk, there's some lights just to have less strain on my eyes.

65
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.500
It's just a more comfortable workplace, and it's really Zen for me.

66
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.040
And I also have some paintings that I really love hung up around here.

67
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.530
So surround yourself with great design.

68
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.810
Surround yourself with things that inspire you.

69
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.780
I think this one's kind of it speaks for itself.

70
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.560
You know, you should really educate yourself and stay educated.

71
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.780
Reading books is huge.

72
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.740
I love to read.

73
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.690
I love to read on a variety of different topics.

74
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.980
I mean, not just design.

75
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.710
I like to learn about product management and how to increase my workflow and increase like team velocity

76
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.790
and stuff like that.

77
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.550
So stay educated on a variety of topics.

78
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.170
Remember to always try and learn.

79
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.980
It's huge.

80
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.170
Read books about your discipline, read books about other discipline, read articles.

81
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.170
You don't need to be an expert in terms of the different types of disciplines that you're reading about.

82
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.570
But you should want to learn about like things like development or like facilitation or user patterns

83
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.620
or marketing.

84
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.450
This really helps you contribute thoughtful ideas whenever you discuss those types of topics.

85
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.910
And sometimes it's good to have that extra context so that you can approach it from your design or mindset.

86
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.110
So if there's a problem with like marketing, maybe, you know, a couple of different things about

87
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.700
marketing, you can approach it differently.

88
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.420
It always helps me to read up about development and really lean on my peers who are developers to understand

89
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.470
how things are built.

90
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.460
So when I approach my design, I know that certain things are not feasible.

91
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.310
I know certain things that can be achieved.

92
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.300
So I.

93
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.450
Really try to learn about different disciplines.

94
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.430
And it has made me a much better designer, a more well rounded designer.

95
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.850
And the most important thing is knowledge is definitely power.

96
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.530
So this is probably the best thing you can do is just stay educated on a variety of topics.

97
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.640
Sometimes you have to take some time to design for yourself.

98
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.330
You know, it can be exhausting designing for a client, and sometimes it can get demoralizing at some

99
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.720
points.

100
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.190
You know, you may be stuck on a project for six months.

101
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.440
I know people that have been stuck on projects sometimes for a year, and it really depends on what

102
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.730
type of company you're working for.

103
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.200
But it may happen.

104
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.870
And at that point, you know, you could be, like I said, on a project for months and have total lack

105
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.990
of inspiration.

106
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.170
You may feel like your work or your ideas aren't inspiring you or anyone else, and you should probably

107
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.180
think about ways that you can design for yourself.

108
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.990
It can be anything.

109
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.040
It could be an app.

110
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.140
It could be like painting.

111
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.980
I sometimes like to paint on my spare time, especially with my children.

112
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.810
So I mean, stuff like that just really takes the load off your shoulders.

113
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.480
It allows you to kind of express some of your creativity and get back inspired to also design.

114
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.850
Now this one is another great one.

115
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.690
I don't do this personally.

116
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.660
I have a lot of coworkers that love to travel, and one thing they say is like travel exposes you to

117
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.860
new culture.

118
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.620
It could be like different people.

119
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.780
It could be different experiences.

120
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.150
And by immersing yourself in an area away from your home, you kind of push yourself out of your comfort

121
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.900
zone and it kind of opens your eyes to new possibilities.

122
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.810
So travel the world if you can.

123
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.990
I know a lot of remote workers that love to travel and work elsewhere, so that's definitely a possibility.

124
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.450
And I've heard great things.

125
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.240
And the next one I like to do.

126
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.970
I do this all the time.

127
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:12.080
It's so easy to just stick around at your desk and try to come up with ideas.

128
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:19.100
But scientifically, a 2014 study by Stanford University found that walking boosted your creativity.

129
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.570
And sometimes you just need to leave your office and go for a nice walk, you know?

130
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.220
You don't know who you may see.

131
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.410
You don't know what you may encounter.

132
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.710
I often like to chat with coworkers on a quick walk.

133
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:36.320
I like to go grab a coffee or something like that and just get a breath of fresh air and then come back

134
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.120
to a problem if I'm having a tough time.

135
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.610
So these are the different things that I do and my coworkers have done and they have been proven to

136
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.910
work.

137
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:50.090
I feel inspired all the time just because of my surroundings personally and like I love taking my walks,

138
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:55.100
I love talking to my peers and I'm just staying educated on a variety of different topics.

139
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.270
Take these tips with you and do your best to stay inspired.
