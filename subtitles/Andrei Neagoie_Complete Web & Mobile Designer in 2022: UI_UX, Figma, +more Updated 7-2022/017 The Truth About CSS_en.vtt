Hey there.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.330
I want to take a quick video to explain something.

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.320
And this is something that I made the mistake of when I first started off, when I first started teaching

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.520
myself programming.

5
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.320
You see, you start off with HTML and things are fairly simple.

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.780
You learn some tags, you learn some attributes, and you're starting to get it how websites are built.

7
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.110
And then you learn about CSS and all the things that you can do to websites to make them pretty and

8
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.800
beautiful.

9
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.760
But then you start encountering all these CSS properties.

10
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.000
There's so many of them, there's no way for you to remember all of them, and they each act differently

11
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.130
on the element so that things like positioning a navigation bar becomes really difficult because you

12
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.740
have one button that for some reason is styled differently and you can't figure out why.

13
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.450
And that is a problem that everybody has.

14
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.850
CSS is notoriously difficult and frustrating to learn.

15
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.900
But this is the mistake that I made when I first started off.

16
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.000
I thought I had to know everything in HTML, everything in CSS before I even touched JavaScript.

17
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.570
So I spent way too much time learning everything about HTML, everything about CSS.

18
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.380
Getting frustrated and frustrated because I couldn't get my websites to look like somebody that has

19
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.790
been doing it for years.

20
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.580
And here's the thing.

21
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.190
If this was that easy, then every single person would be doing it.

22
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.250
But it's not.

23
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.340
It's tough to master these skills.

24
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.750
But each day you make small, little progress step by step.

25
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.070
So you become better.

26
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.680
However, I don't want you to fall into the trap that I did.

27
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:04.060
That is to not start off learning JavaScript right away, because you see these circles over here,

28
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.220
these circle, the size of them, represent how important they are to your career.

29
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:18.170
Now, if you want to be a web designer designing websites and making things look pretty, then CSS is

30
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.460
quite important to you.

31
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.530
However, if you want to be a developer, somebody that works on logic, on JavaScript and builds applications,

32
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:36.320
well, you need to focus on JavaScript because although you need to know CSS, those are things that

33
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.230
you're going to work on while working on JavaScript.

34
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.970
So each time you're learning JavaScript and working with websites, you're also as an effect working

35
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.990
with CSS.

36
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.520
So although your knowledge might not feel complete right now with CSIS by using JavaScript and starting

37
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.560
with JavaScript as soon as possible, we focus on the most important topic at hand.

38
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.740
And little by little, as you're learning JavaScript, you're also going to learn more and more about

39
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.580
CSS.

40
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.020
So I encourage you trust me on this because I've been through it as well.

41
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.290
Don't start learning every single CSS property trying to memorize everything because that's not how

42
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.980
you work.

43
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:29.290
A web developer is somebody that uses JavaScript, JavaScript to make smart applications, and that

44
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.720
is what your focus should be on.

45
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.770
And along the way you will also build your HTML and CSS knowledge, and that is the path that we're

46
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.910
taking with this course.

47
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.500
Not the longest, slowest path, but the most efficient path.

48
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.840
I'll see in the next video.

49
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.170
Bye bye.
