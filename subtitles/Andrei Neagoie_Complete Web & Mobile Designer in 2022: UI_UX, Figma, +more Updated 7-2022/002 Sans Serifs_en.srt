1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,360
So we're going to talk about the next category, and that is Sans Serif.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,430
Now, I love sans serif typefaces.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,920
I think a lot of people love sans serif typefaces.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,240
They're basically make up a lot of different types of fonts and typefaces that we use today.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,120
What does sans serif mean?

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:23,680
Well, sans serif, that means without Serif in French, they lack those little serif details that we

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,660
saw in the previous typefaces, and they're much more modern in appearance.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,880
Now there are four main classifications of sans serif typefaces.

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,940
Let's get into that.

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,250
So let's get into the first one.

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,860
The first one is called Grotesque.

12
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,540
What a name, right?

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:47,190
Grotesques are the earliest and include fonts like Franklin Gothic and accidents grotesque.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,920
Really nice nice typefaces we got here is source sense pro, which is a really great grotesque typeface.

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:00,460
Their letter forms are pretty similar to some serif typefaces, you know, kind of minus the serifs.

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,760
So you'll see a little bit more contrast between the strokes.

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,650
So there is some thick and thin contrast here, but you know, they just have the no serif at the end

18
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,640
of the letter forms.

19
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,400
Next, we have neo grotesque.

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,760
Now, this includes some of the most common typefaces like Ariel Universe and, you know, everyone's

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,770
favorite Helvetica.

22
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:28,360
Now, when I'm comparing this to say something like a grotesque typeface, the one thing I'm looking

23
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,030
at is that the neo grotesque is much more plain in comparison.

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,970
You'll see that it's much more uniform within the typeface.

25
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,130
There's less contrast between thick and thin.

26
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,450
Definitely.

27
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,000
Definitely a good comparison between these two.

28
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,330
Now, the third is humanist typefaces.

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:53,380
Now, this includes Gill Sans, which we're actually using right here for Ruediger and Tahoma.

30
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,160
They're much more calligraphic than other sans serif typefaces, that's for sure.

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,880
You're probably wondering what exactly does that mean?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,260
So let's take a look.

33
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:07,360
Notice how they have greater variation between different line widths.

34
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,270
You'll see that right here in the A.

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,000
You'll see them in the S, just in the T, you'll see them in the U.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,020
So there's definitely much more contrast between different types of line widths.

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,310
You'll also notice that they're a little swooping, a kind of like it almost has a serif, you know,

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,900
the little swoop on the T.

39
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,810
It's kind of just arching a little bit more up than we'll see in something like a neocortex like Helvetica.

40
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,000
And lastly, we have geometric.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,080
Now, these are probably my favorite and this includes Futura, which is an amazing font and Proxima

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,680
Nova.

43
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,300
Now geometric sensors are more closely based on geometric shapes.

44
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,000
What gave that away?

45
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,710
If you look at the Oh, that is definitely just a circle.

46
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,550
You can see it even reflected in other letters, like individual letters, like C and E.

47
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,250
The T is just like a straight stick.

48
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,820
Let's compare that to like Gill Sands, where there's that swoop.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,930
So that's very calligraphic.

50
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,470
If you look at something like grotesques, even though they're very plain in appearance, you'll see

51
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,000
that there is a little swoop there.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,880
There is a little bit more life to this typeface.

53
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,280
This is just like us two sticks put together.

54
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,230
Almost looks like a cross there.

55
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,950
And that G is very, very circular.

56
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,760
You'll notice, like I said in the O.S, very circular.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,860
It's always the very simple.

58
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,720
So now that you know all the different types of categories and classifications for sensitive typefaces,

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,060
there's some really interesting ways we can use them.

60
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,770
And we're going to jump into Figma next.
