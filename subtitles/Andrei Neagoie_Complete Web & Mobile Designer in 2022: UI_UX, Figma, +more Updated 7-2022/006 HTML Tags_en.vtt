00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.589
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.100
In this video, we're going to expand on our knowledge and introduce you to a few more HTML tags and

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.500
make this website look a little bit prettier than just.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.220
Hello there.

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.950
To get started.

6
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.070
I'm just going to move the screens around so you can see better.

7
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.730
All right, so we have the left and right and.

8
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.070
Again just to make sure everything works.

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.850
If I change anything here to.

10
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.820
Boo.

11
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.990
And then I click Save.

12
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.910
And then I refresh the page.

13
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.010
I have everything updating.

14
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.610
Perfect.

15
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.340
Now, these aren't the only HTML tags that you'll encounter.

16
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.350
There's actually a ton of them.

17
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.590
And if you go back to the W three schools dot com you'll see over here.

18
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.560
All the HTML tags that exist.

19
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.630
There's a lot of them.

20
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:04.400
We're only going to be going through, I'd say maybe ten or 15 or so, because those are the only ones

21
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.540
that well, technically that I've used in many years of development.

22
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.570
There's a few things on here that I've never even heard of.

23
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.600
I've never used.

24
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.640
You can always look these up and learn them yourself, but I'll say that there's about ten or 15 tags

25
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.690
that are used 99% of the time, and those are the ones that you'll encounter.

26
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.360
So we'll go through some of those most popular ones.

27
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.640
And HTML doesn't really get any harder than than this.

28
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.880
This is the syntax.

29
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.950
As long as you get used to these little signs and structure, you're pretty much a HTML developer.

30
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.260
So the first tag that I want to introduce you to is the H1 tag.

31
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.410
So the way that I have it here is actually not right.

32
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.290
You want to make sure that everything is surrounded by a tag.

33
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.520
So a web browser right now can see bu and just print out bu.

34
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.100
But if you want to do it right, you'd want to put something like an h one.

35
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.370
And an H one tag.

36
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.789
If I save this and I refresh.

37
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.750
We get what we call a header.

38
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.460
So that is a header.

39
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.630
And then one.

40
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.710
What does one mean?

41
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.880
Well, it actually goes all the way up to six.

42
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.740
So if I change this to two and I'm not going to do every single one, let's just do another one each.

43
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.990
Six bu.

44
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.860
It's six.

45
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.790
And if I save this and refresh the page, you can see that there's different sizes in the text.

46
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.310
So that's the header tag.

47
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:52.380
And again, if I scroll through the W three schools and I go to the H, you see over here that there's

48
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.880
the header tax explained here.

49
00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.480
And this website is really, really cool because you can actually click on try it yourself and you can

50
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.180
play around with different things.

51
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.760
Click Run and it changes it for you.

52
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.470
So again, this is a really, really good website for you to get familiar with all the tags.

53
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.870
But again, we're going to stick to.

54
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.730
Our website for now.

55
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.250
Another thing that I want to introduce you to is something called a tag or a paragraph tag.

56
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.590
A paragraph tag lets you.

57
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.230
Have paragraphs.

58
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.120
So now if I refresh?

59
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.510
Well, there's not much different from what we have before, which was no tags and just saving it.

60
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.710
Refresh.

61
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.260
But.

62
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.580
You can see the difference when I copy and paste this and have a few.

63
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.580
Paragraphs versus.

64
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.020
This.

65
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.190
Let's see what happens.

66
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.360
So I saved this.

67
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.560
You'll see over here that with sublime text after.

68
00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.920
I don't know.

69
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.350
I want to say about maybe like 20 saves.

70
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.550
I'll ask you to make a purchase because technically this is an unregistered one.

71
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.540
You can ignore it for now.

72
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.220
Just click cancel again.

73
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.090
It's just one annoying thing that will pop up every now and then.

74
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.400
I actually have a registered sublime text.

75
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.760
I just want to show you this error so you're not surprised when you see it.

76
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.209
Use Sublime text for as long as you need it for free.

77
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.340
When you start getting into the developer role and working full time with it, I do recommend that you

78
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.910
make a purchase.

79
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.120
It's a great program and you still get everything through the unregistered.

80
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.720
You just have this pop up that shows up after a few saves.

81
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.630
But anyway, from now on, I'm going to be using a registered sublime account.

82
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.980
I just want to show you that error.

83
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.560
If I refresh the page here, you'll see that I have the paragraphs show up nicely.

84
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.420
But these unstructured pieces of tax, well, everything is kind of in line and HTML doesn't really

85
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.990
know what to do with it, so it puts everything on one line.

86
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.530
I also want to show you one other quick trick and sublime tax.

87
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.250
So writing this gibberish is not very exciting and kind of takes a bit of time and developers are lazy.

88
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.190
We want to make sure that everything is done fast and efficient.

89
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.820
So if you actually put Lorem here and then press tab, you'll get lorem ipsum paragraphs.

90
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.720
So let's do that and I delete that lorem tab and then one more.

91
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.660
Lower em tab.

92
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.680
Perfect.

93
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.250
Let's save that and refresh.

94
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.630
And we have nice paragraphs.

95
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:39.430
As you can see, we have some tags and what we call nested tags, so you can see that the body is the

96
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.300
parent and sublime text actually lets you close and open these.

97
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:51.130
So you have the body tag, you have the header tags which are children of the body tag and then we have

98
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.810
P Tex.

99
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.770
A lot of people get confused and the naming I've mentioned these as tags.

100
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:05.980
So essentially anything that has this syntax is a tag, but this is called an H one element.

101
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.320
So that's when it's an entire block of functionality with content inside it.

102
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:20.530
So again, tags and then this is an H one element, again it's just naming, but you'll hear tags and

103
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.820
elements kind of used interchangeably, but those are the specific differences.

104
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.600
All right.

105
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.200
Let's get into some of the more exciting things.

106
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.370
Let's say, for example, I really want to emphasize Lorem ipsum here.

107
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:42.610
Well, I can use another tag, b tag, and then we close it at Lorem ipsum.

108
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.260
And let's make the screen here a little bit bigger, just so you can see.

109
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.550
There you go.

110
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.300
So we have the B tags over here.

111
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.000
And if I click save, I refresh.

112
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.860
Oops.

113
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.740
No, we don't want to translate this page.

114
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.020
We see that this is now bolded again.

115
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.340
Let's make it a little bit bigger.

116
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.890
There you go.

117
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.890
Now, this syntax is actually not used anymore or it's not recommended.

118
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.360
Obviously, it still works.

119
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:17.040
But there was a problem that HTML was initially used for websites that ran on computers, on PCs, on

120
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.470
Macs, and now we have things such as mobile phones and iPads.

121
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.720
Although the bolded text and we actually have another one which was the.

122
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.820
Italicized.

123
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:31.450
I.

124
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:40.860
Although we had this for most phones, some of them didn't have ability to build attacks and didn't

125
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:47.940
have the ability to italicize or some screen readers, which people who are visually impaired use didn't

126
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.860
really understand the meaning behind italicize and bolt.

127
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.980
So now we use something called strong for bolded.

128
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.990
And refresh and therefore italicized.

129
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.280
We use em for emphasis.

130
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.100
And there you go.

131
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.300
Now.

132
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:16.920
The reason this change was made was a move towards something called Semantic HTML, and we'll get into

133
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.420
that into a later lesson.

134
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:26.640
But just know that there's some tags that have evolved over the years and it's part of why HTML five

135
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.180
exists.

136
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.560
We'll get into that a little bit more.

137
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.470
But just wanted to give you a quick note on that.

138
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.280
All right.

139
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.600
I think that's enough for now.

140
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.120
We're going to get into more tags in the next video.

141
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.030
For now, play around and I'll see you in the next one.
