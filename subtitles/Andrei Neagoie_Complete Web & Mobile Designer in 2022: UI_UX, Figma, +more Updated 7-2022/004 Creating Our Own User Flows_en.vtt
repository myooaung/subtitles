00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.720
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.950
We're going to talk about creating our very own user flow for onboarding.

3
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.710
So on our last video, we sped up our workflow a bit and now we have a bunch of different components

4
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.010
that we can just plop into our designs really, really easily.

5
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.550
And we're going to use those to just kind of signify fields text and we can work out those details just

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.360
a little bit later.

7
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.390
But we really want to understand what users need to click, what they need to do, what they see, and

8
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.890
what gets into the next step.

9
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.810
I think for the first user flow, we should probably do something like onboarding or those very first

10
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.380
screens that a user sees when they first come to our product.

11
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.390
We really want to make a great impression and we want to push them into the funnel of registering and

12
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.850
telling us about their interests.

13
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.460
So let's actually do that right now.

14
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.420
So what we're going to do is we're going to press F and I'm going to create a frame.

15
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.860
It doesn't matter which size.

16
00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.640
I like to have a big canvas to work with because we did actually show a couple of flows that went beyond

17
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.180
three steps.

18
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.750
But I think we're going to probably go to four or five steps and that's totally fine.

19
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.920
We're going to keep it simple.

20
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.780
So we'll call this onboarding flow what we're going to do here.

21
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.860
If you notice that we have our assets and layers tabs.

22
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.020
So if I go into assets, I can go into our local components and I'm going to go into user flow demo

23
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:29.440
and into there I have my components screen or my components section, which is actually this frame over

24
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.390
here and I can start pulling components from there into my user flows.

25
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.110
So I'm going to do is I'm going to grab that screen background.

26
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.480
I'm going to grab this as well.

27
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.140
I'm not sure what else I'm going to grab right now.

28
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.520
So let's think about this flow.

29
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.100
So step one of creating a user flow is to have a title.

30
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.100
So let's think about our title.

31
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.100
Our title should be What do we want the user to actually accomplish during the onboarding?

32
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.740
I want the user to register with our product.

33
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.400
Okay.

34
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.260
I like to keep things really neat.

35
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.000
I like using this font.

36
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.700
Gilroy It's really nice font.

37
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.760
Well, let's just set that.

38
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.320
Okay.

39
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.400
That's going to work for now.

40
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.580
So we want our user to register with our product.

41
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.490
Step one, when they come to our welcome screen, they should probably see something like.

42
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.390
I know.

43
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.670
Like a welcome banner.

44
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.710
Maybe a button.

45
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.340
Probably see some text to some welcome text.

46
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.400
That's just saying, hey, welcome to Habitual.

47
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.020
We are an awesome product and you should totally register with us.

48
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.100
If we think about this a little differently, we'll notice that there is probably a decision moment

49
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.520
here.

50
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.100
We shouldn't force the user to register.

51
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.070
We could probably give them the option to skip and go right into our product, and we can handle that

52
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.750
later.

53
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.520
But we should probably just.

54
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.620
Have a screen down here as well.

55
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:35.600
And maybe we'll have like this signifies some sort of like skip text.

56
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.920
Oops.

57
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.100
I didn't actually make a smaller one.

58
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.780
So what we could do, we can duplicate this.

59
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.460
Go into our stroke.

60
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.690
We're going to say none.

61
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.110
And we're going to say round.

62
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.410
On our cabins that way we have a nice kind of pill looking cup.

63
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.560
And there we go.

64
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.820
Let's actually open this up just a bit.

65
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.000
So that way we have a little bit more breathing room because we're going to have to write underneath

66
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.720
these.

67
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.339
So let's open up our frame.

68
00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.130
Like I said, like the size of the frame doesn't really matter right now.

69
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.290
We can clean that up just later.

70
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.690
Right now, I am focused on creating a good flow.

71
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.480
Okay.

72
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.700
So we'll group these, actually.

73
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.020
Let's go to our Layers panel.

74
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.550
So let's do command Z just to show you what just happened there.

75
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.790
We'll select both of these since they're instances of our initial arrow.

76
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.650
So we want to actually disconnect that.

77
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.110
So what you can do is you can right click and you can detach that instance or you can select them and

78
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.030
click Option Command and B and you'll notice that they're both frames again.

79
00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.370
And if we do Option Command K now we can name the second arrow.

80
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.860
And we can copy that and paste it and take this and put it into our components.

81
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.450
File up here.

82
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.690
So now we have another component to use.

83
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.520
Okay.

84
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.890
So now I know that step one.

85
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.460
Let's write step one.

86
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.910
And let's make that smaller.

87
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.260
And let's start writing a little bit of a description for it.

88
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.920
Okay.

89
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.250
Now we have our text.

90
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.210
Perfect.

91
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.840
So what we can do is our description should be something like.

92
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.410
What is the you see and what do they do to get to the next screen?

93
00:05:51.410 --> 00:06:08.930
So user arrives at our welcome screen and notices a button to proceed forward for registration.

94
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.890
This text is a little too big.

95
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.250
We can bump that down just a bit.

96
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.840
The user is also able.

97
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.610
Let's practice our second paragraph.

98
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:32.570
The user is also able to skip this step and goes straight to our home page.

99
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.710
So now we know what the user can do on step one.

100
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.270
And what they can do here.

101
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.880
So I know that in step one, I'm going to be able to click this big primary call to action and go straight

102
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:53.020
to the registration, or I can avoid that and skip it and I'll eventually have to register once I check

103
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.260
out.

104
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.420
But I can go right into the home screen and we can give them a little bit of a teaser on why our app

105
00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.170
is so great.

106
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.240
So step two, what happens on step two?

107
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.590
So step two, we're not going to really focus on the actual home screen right now, but we're going

108
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.970
to focus on step two.

109
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:20.260
And step two should be something like the user starts the kind of the registration process.

110
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:31.510
So maybe it's like the user is prompted to add their email and password.

111
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:40.290
They can confirm those details and proceed.

112
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:45.960
Okay.

113
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.490
So let's just build that out really quickly.

114
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.740
I'm going to use the assets tab right here.

115
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.930
There's probably.

116
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.900
This should be.

117
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.110
Let's go back to our components page so we can just fix that really quickly.

118
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.850
So another interesting thing you can do here is you can right click and go to master component.

119
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.170
And over here.

120
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.180
All we need to do is top.

121
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.690
Bring that right in.

122
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.620
And now.

123
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.990
We can select top and bottom.

124
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.720
So perfect.

125
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.040
Let's go back to our float.

126
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.940
So we have an input.

127
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.340
We have a couple of inputs.

128
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.070
And we have a primary button.

129
00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:34.210
Great.

130
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.070
That's step two.

131
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.570
Now.

132
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.380
Step three What should the user see?

133
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.850
The user should probably see a step to add their photo.

134
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.490
Possibly so we can.

135
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:04.100
The user can add a photo or skip that step.

136
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.570
So we do want to make this registration fairly easy.

137
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:12.930
So the ability to actually skip the step is kind of key, especially here where a photo isn't necessarily

138
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:13.560
needed.

139
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:20.190
So we'll just write that in and you'll notice the way I'm actually writing, it's not really friendly.

140
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.290
It's kind of extremely logical.

141
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:28.860
And the reason why I'm doing that is because I really want people to understand and be able to kind

142
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.910
of read this once and it's kind of like a manual or a blueprint in a way.

143
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.700
I really want them to understand it at first glance.

144
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.420
So that is step three, step four.

145
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:45.870
Now we probably get into some more interesting things like actually adding their interests.

146
00:09:46.410 --> 00:10:00.540
So step four, the user can now the user can now pick interests and hobbies to personalize their shopping

147
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.520
experience.

148
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.330
So this is probably like a headline.

149
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.970
There's probably some text here.

150
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:15.070
There's probably a bunch of little buttons like little pills or checkboxes that they can tick off.

151
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.500
So let's put a headline up here.

152
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.180
Let's give it some text.

153
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:28.030
Maybe there's a series of checkboxes, we can actually just modify these if we want, just to speed

154
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.110
things along.

155
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.440
Okay.

156
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:40.550
So now they are prompted to actually pick their interests and hobbies, to personalize their experience.

157
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:47.090
And the next step is which the next step be here?

158
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.770
So they've picked their interest.

159
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.800
They've possibly uploaded a profile.

160
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.680
Maybe we're missing a step here and that's totally fine.

161
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.930
We can review these.

162
00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:01.880
I often just go back to my team to just get some insight on what they think of our current flow.

163
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.510
So you should definitely do this, not necessarily in a silo.

164
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.250
Get some feedback really quickly.

165
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.530
We're going to end our flow right here.

166
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.620
So step five.

167
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.910
Success.

168
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:30.080
The user has registered for the individual product and can now access all of our features.

169
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.440
So essentially.

170
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.330
The user will see a success screen.

171
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.970
Maybe it is this little ball.

172
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.070
Maybe it's some like welcome.

173
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.460
Screen text that we've used there.

174
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.010
That is perfect.

175
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.330
And that's it.

176
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.700
That's essentially our user flow for onboarding.

177
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.170
It's really detailed.

178
00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.540
We understand the actual purpose of the flow.

179
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:04.290
We understand that there's a possible break here and we need to think about what that looks like for

180
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:04.950
the user.

181
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:10.290
We started building out these steps a little bit more in thinking about them that this is a pretty linear

182
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.030
flow right now.

183
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.090
There are some moments where the user can make a decision like over here.

184
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.830
They can actually just they can skip a step.

185
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.610
Now we're starting to think about all the elements that are going to be here as well.

186
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.840
If you have more refined sketches, you can actually start wireframe at this point.

187
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.760
There really is no right or wrong way to do this.

188
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.610
I like to think about this very conceptually, so I'm not really worried about like the visual design

189
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.230
or anything like that just at the moment.

190
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:42.540
But I do know that I'm starting to think about this from a user's perspective and what they should be

191
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.730
seeing and what they should be doing at each step.

192
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.930
So this is our flow for registering with our product.
