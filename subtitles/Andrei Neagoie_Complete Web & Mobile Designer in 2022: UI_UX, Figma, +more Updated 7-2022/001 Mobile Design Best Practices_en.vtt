00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.100
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.080
So in this lesson, we're going to be learning about mobile design.

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.950
Now, the reason why is because it's so important, especially if you're building a responsive product,

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.570
if you're kind of just building a mobile based product similar to what we're doing right now, we're

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.340
building a mobile app for our client habitual.

6
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.530
So I want to take you through the best practices for actually creating mobile design.

7
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.890
Now we all know one thing in the difference between a good app and a bad app is the quality of its experience.

8
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.020
Now, if we think about it, many of us choose our phone for a large portion of the day.

9
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.650
I know, like my phone is kind of replaced my laptop in many ways, and it's never been more important

10
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.750
to design a very good mobile experience.

11
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.130
You know, mobile users expect a lot from an app, whether that be like delight from, you know, interactions

12
00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.420
like this or fast loading times like how this kind of loaded as well to just general ease of use, you

13
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.690
know, just the clarity of like this mobile design over here and just how easy it is just to use.

14
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.500
I mean, all these different things make a great user experience.

15
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.730
So let me jump right into those best practices.

16
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.710
You know, number one, practices don't make users think.

17
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.330
I mean, that seems pretty standard.

18
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.590
But I mean, a lot of people kind of forget that we don't want to make users think too much.

19
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.740
Your product should really strive to be easy to understand and use.

20
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.340
If your app is too hard to use or understand, you really risk users walking away from your product.

21
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.370
So step one would be to declutter.

22
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.150
I mean, cut away.

23
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.180
All the unnecessary content is kind of like that.

24
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.120
One way to create good design.

25
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.100
I mean, this doesn't necessarily mean it's just for mobile.

26
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.880
I mean, you can do this for desktop as well, but keep things really simple.

27
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.550
Don't just smack a whole bunch of copy on the screen.

28
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.150
I mean, find ways to hide that or show that, but don't just make your screen incredibly cluttered.

29
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.690
You know, every extra button or image or paragraph makes your interface seem cluttered.

30
00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:13.800
And because we don't have the screen real estate, I mean, we also need to keep interface elements

31
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.610
to a minimum.

32
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.410
We want to keep our design simple.

33
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.570
You can also practice actually hiding different things under interactions like this.

34
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.350
So that content is hidden.

35
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.610
And it's kind of not cluttering the main homepage.

36
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.440
What you also want to do is to break tasks up.

37
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.230
I mean, if you have like a form similar to this, you want to kind of break that process up, especially

38
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.770
for mobile, because I mean, we just don't have the screen real estate.

39
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.370
This is really important, especially because if a flow consists of some sort of logically connected

40
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.470
step, the user can easily use it.

41
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.400
Another best practice is just to stick to the patterns.

42
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.360
I mean, think about the types of patterns that we normally see.

43
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.720
Mobile one being something like on boarding screens stick to those patterns that have kind of been proven

44
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.010
and just keep on using them similar to what we covered in design patterns.

45
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.250
Also reuse the elements and screens that users are used to that really decreases like the learning curve.

46
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.800
So like home screens are an example, setting screens, those are different types of screens that we

47
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.570
all kind of see in a lot of different apps, and it really helps us understand how to use apps if we

48
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.190
see similar screens over and over again.

49
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.820
Over here, we kind of have like a product description screen for a product and just kind of like a

50
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.560
very simple e commerce layout.

51
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.750
And this is kind of all very standard.

52
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.690
You want to minimize your user's input.

53
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.440
So, I mean, no long forms like over here, we don't have a very long form.

54
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.640
There's just a couple of options.

55
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.940
And they've also broken it up, it looks like, in different steps.

56
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.460
You know, typing on mobile is never really a fun experience and you know, we're often prone to errors

57
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.350
and, you know, we can really make this process easy by creating forms as short as possible, like

58
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.280
I mentioned before.

59
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.110
But also removing unnecessary fields are very key pre format, certain fields like this is a phone number

60
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.200
and it really helps to see it pre formatted just because I mean, if I want to review that content,

61
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.760
I can notice the errors right away, especially for things like even credit cards.

62
00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:24.200
This is an example of like a credit card that is pre formatted as well.

63
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.820
And another thing to do is like, you know, autocomplete were necessary.

64
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.330
I mean, this could be applicable to things like addresses like over here.

65
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.220
This really allows users to enter their address without necessarily having to enter the entire address.

66
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.510
And you should also think about validating your inputs dynamically.

67
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.070
So when users do create an error, they don't necessarily need to go back and go through that interaction

68
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.120
all over again.

69
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.300
They can just correct it while they're actually focused on the input.

70
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.700
Next is consistency.

71
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.160
Now, this is a fundamental principle of design, and it really eliminates a lot of confusion.

72
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.480
It is essential, like visual consistency, like typeface, buttons, labels, color.

73
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.700
It can be like functional consistency.

74
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.610
Interactive elements across the app works similarly.

75
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.730
So that could be like buttons a will move you in a certain way or swiping can move you to a new page

76
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.970
or the navigation is very consistent.

77
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.820
I mean, we're thinking about all these different things, even platform guidelines like iOS and Android

78
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.710
design systems like using that.

79
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.310
Like if you have two separate apps for both, I mean, you don't need to do that.

80
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.070
But say if you're creating an application for Android phones, you kind of want to stick to Google's

81
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.740
material design for a lot of those different types of design patterns, because usually users are more

82
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.740
familiar with that in comparison to something like on iOS, where those design systems are really different.

83
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.330
Next.

84
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.070
You want to give users as much control or the illusion of control.

85
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.160
So this can mean like just understanding where things are going, understanding how things work, and

86
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.530
that's just overall predictability.

87
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.120
You know, all interactive elements should be familiar and predictable when things work in the way you

88
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.720
just predict.

89
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.790
And they kind of sense that feeling of control.

90
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.590
So on mobile, we don't necessarily only have one way of interacting with an element to understand that

91
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.910
type of feedback that I'll introduce.

92
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.980
So if we stick to familiar patterns, our users will really understand how our system works already.

93
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:32.110
So I mean, if we notice like we have cards, that's a big example of like a pattern, just cards in

94
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.670
general.

95
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.660
We, we know we can kind of tap them.

96
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.580
Like in this case, too, they're very faint.

97
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.890
But we know that I can probably just tap on that.

98
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.240
And it's very familiar to me.

99
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.630
And the way that input is, I know that this is like a menu of some sort.

100
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.270
So I mean, introducing that sense of predictability really makes your application much more easier

101
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.930
to use.

102
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.490
Now we're going to stop here and we're going to pick up on navigation when we come back.
