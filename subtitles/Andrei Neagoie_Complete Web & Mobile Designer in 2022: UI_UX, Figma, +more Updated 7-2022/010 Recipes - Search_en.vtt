00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.380
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.260
So I want to show you how to create another type of recipe, which is like maybe a router search.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.730
And there are different types of recipes that have to do with search, because if you think of all the

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.120
different instances of search, that includes stuff like lists, results, type heads, and that's what

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.240
we're going to start right now.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.840
So you can actually go ahead and create a components for a text.

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.920
I'm not a big fan of doing that.

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.220
It gets a little hard to manage, but like, I'll show you what you can do here and how you can even

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.640
turn it into components totally up to you.

10
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.690
And it really depends on your application.

11
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.920
So I'm going to grab that iPhone again.

12
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.910
I'm going to actually apply a grid just to something simple, just so I can set my frame around it.

13
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.030
And I know that this is going to be like the.

14
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.280
With of these grids over here.

15
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
And I'm just going to name that type ahead.

16
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.980
West.

17
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.770
Now we need to actually create a list item.

18
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.780
So let me just fill this with a stroke so we know that that's our frame for now.

19
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.330
So let's move this out of the way.

20
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.920
Our list item.

21
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.860
When we think about type ahead, there's going to probably be like rules.

22
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.800
So I'm going to actually create a line.

23
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.250
So let's create a rule.

24
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.500
And that rule is probably going to have like a UI color.

25
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.260
Oh, that's a little too dark.

26
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.720
Maybe like 20.

27
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.460
Really subtle.

28
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.680
Maybe 40 is fine.

29
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.650
So we have that.

30
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.460
And now we need some text.

31
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.210
So let's think about which text we are going to use.

32
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.080
So say I start typing something.

33
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.380
Text type.

34
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.950
Fill list.

35
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.070
So there is my text.

36
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.800
It's not going to be 20 pixels.

37
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.620
I'm probably going to bring it down to 16.

38
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.600
That's good.

39
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.090
And, you know, some portion of it is going to actually not be pre-filled.

40
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.030
So you're going to have to do this manually for yourself.

41
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.580
So when we see pre filled text, that's how it usually is.

42
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.830
So we have our text set.

43
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.230
We also have maybe like an icon.

44
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.910
So let's grab an icon.

45
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.620
So you can very much make a list component.

46
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.930
I haven't.

47
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.550
What I are going to use.

48
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.470
We're going to use an outline 24 Pixel Chevron.

49
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.980
Right.

50
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.720
And like, very easy.

51
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.280
I'm just going to bring that in.

52
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.740
Just leave that there for now.

53
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.830
And I'm thinking about all the different parts of a pre filled list.

54
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.220
We have our text like if we're looking for something, it will automatically pre fill with bold and

55
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.140
whatever you've typed in with a t x over here is going to be just regular.

56
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.540
What I'm also going to do is I think like.

57
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.670
We may have a category indicator.

58
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.020
And that we can make a much smaller.

59
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.150
You know, maybe bold is way too much for a heading.

60
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.570
Maybe this is where, like our alternate small body copy comes into play.

61
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.020
And so what I'm going to do here is I'm actually going to create a frame and I'm just going to call

62
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.850
this text, I'm going to rename it to text, and we can use the label if we want.

63
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.190
And here we are just going to space that out maybe by four pixels.

64
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.250
And then we have.

65
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.640
Another frame.

66
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.380
So we're going to call this list item.

67
00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:25.540
And what we can do here is we can just select both and automatically space them out so they're centered.

68
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.580
We select both of these, we can make sure they're eight pixels apart.

69
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.330
Let's do that.

70
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.250
So we know that these are all eight pixels apart from each other.

71
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.690
Let's go ahead and just rename these.

72
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.220
We call them rule like a horizontal rule.

73
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.200
At this point, we can actually start creating.

74
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.230
Our list items.

75
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.570
So I'm going to actually put this into this frame.

76
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.590
And this frame is now going to be an auto Lego frame.

77
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.650
And everything within this frame is going to be spaced by eight pixels.

78
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.110
So if I go ahead and take my list item and duplicate it.

79
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.740
Text.

80
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.750
Oops.

81
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.510
I can easily put it below.

82
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.020
And if I don't want to show this any longer.

83
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.930
I can easily do that.

84
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.530
And how that variation like that.

85
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.570
And my list item will.

86
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.920
You can just like resize to fit like that.

87
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:01.790
And there we go.

88
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.140
We can easily create a variant.

89
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.300
So that's how you can create like a different type of recipe over here.

90
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.730
So I've created this one.

91
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.470
What I'm going to do is I'm going to actually select this and that.

92
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.340
And you see eight pixels may seem like a little too much.

93
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.130
And I see UI 40 gray is a little too dark.

94
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.630
That's a little bit more subtle.

95
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.070
I think that's fine for now.

96
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.670
But if we want to bump that up like say by 16 pixels.

97
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.190
So I've noticed that that 40 is too dark.

98
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.160
And this is what I mean about your design system starting to evolve.

99
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
You'll realize that, hey, I may need something in between here.

100
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:57.310
Maybe if I dock this by another 20%, the rule may actually be a little nicer.

101
00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.910
So if I say if I go 80% on that.

102
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.750
Maybe even 40% like that rule is a little bit more bearable, but that is something we just kind of

103
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.950
learn with time.

104
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.700
So I'm going to actually continue.

105
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:20.550
We can just see Command V, Command V and just create a huge list.

106
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.690
And there you have it.

107
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.430
That's your type of head list.

108
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.050
So we can go ahead and put that into our little section here.

109
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.900
Let's put into the recipe.

110
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.070
Perfect.

111
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.210
So that's one other type of list that we can create.

112
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.540
Obviously, you can turn these into components totally up to you.

113
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.330
If you feel like you're not using it enough, then you don't need to.

114
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.410
Another recipe that I thought about also when it comes to search is like your results.

115
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.590
So let's create a quick search result list.

116
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.130
So I'm going to actually.

117
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:07.320
Go to my cards and I'm going to grab like horizontal arrow search.

118
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.290
So we only really need one and then we can play with that.

119
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.310
So let's go back to our tab.

120
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.660
We can turn on our.

121
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.850
So I like to work within like a frame like that.

122
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.330
And what we're going to do here is when I think of search results, I'm going to space these out by

123
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.230
16 pixels.

124
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.330
We can even have a horizontal rule if we want.

125
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.190
We can also.

126
00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.020
Ad variations.

127
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:46.150
Let's call these results and these are going to be in an auto layout, 16 pixels apart, vertical.

128
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.110
Perfect.

129
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.610
And so like when I delete one, the whole frame changes.

130
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:54.770
Okay.

131
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.130
That is good for now.

132
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.180
What I'm going to do here is look another title.

133
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.320
I'm going to put like maybe like 100 results

134
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.070
for music.

135
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.760
Now, what I can do is I can create another auto layout.

136
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.950
Let me show you what that looks like.

137
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.810
So I'm going to actually just push that over here.

138
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.680
Let's bring this down a bit.

139
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:34.830
So 16 pixels and I'm going to command C and then command V, so this is going to probably be in the

140
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.030
darker text color.

141
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:43.200
So a gray 80 and this is probably going to be in a 16 pixel regular.

142
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.570
So we're creating a lot more hierarchy here.

143
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.200
And we're going to create a frame around this and we're going to call this text.

144
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.970
And within that framework is just going to do an auto layout again.

145
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.900
And this one can be like a zero or whatever you see fit.

146
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.040
Like it could be like four.

147
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.720
That looks like good enough spacing.

148
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:15.820
And then like once you change something like this, it changes everything and same thing for that.

149
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:22.710
So keeping things very kind of like responsive to this mobile screen, we have a text portion.

150
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.460
Let's make sure that we're like maybe spaced out by that increment.

151
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.170
We got 24.

152
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.870
That's perfectly fine for now.

153
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.200
And then maybe there is like button here.

154
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.080
Actually.

155
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.950
Maybe not, Abuddin.

156
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.590
Let's go check our pill buttons here.

157
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.400
So we have a pill, Gro.

158
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.930
That's good.

159
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.750
So I'm going to actually place that right there, and I'm going to call this filter.

160
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:55.040
So maybe we handle filters in a button like this and we're going to remove.

161
00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.190
Remove.

162
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.950
I'm going to resize that.

163
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.000
And let's take a look at our grid.

164
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.350
So we're going to resize that and we're going to select both.

165
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.550
And I'm going to center them.

166
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:24.250
And I'm just going to call this I'm going to make another frame option command G and I'm going to call

167
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:24.940
this.

168
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.200
What should we call it?

169
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.300
We should probably call it something like results info.

170
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.440
Then we can take this and call this.

171
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.700
Search results.

172
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.720
And there you have it.

173
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:50.010
You have an easy search result section where we can constantly add new items and this becomes like easy

174
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.810
way to just build up a page.

175
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.240
So I'm just actually going to.

176
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.140
Take this.

177
00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:05.190
You can make this an auto layout as well, and you can space these two things by 24 pixels.

178
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:11.760
Totally up to you and you'll see how everything just grows.

179
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.710
And that's why I really love the auto layout.

180
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:20.910
So I'm going to actually take that command, see, and let's put that into the recipe.

181
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.380
And that is how you can make different types of recipes.

182
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.880
So this is more in relation to actual searching, but I have like a type of head list.

183
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.180
So when I'm actually typing in to my search input and then I actually have a results list where I can

184
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.110
show users how many results there are for their actual search.

185
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.550
And if I want to pop a filters overlay, I can do that with this button.

186
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:51.430
And I have all the different types of well, not all the different types, but I have different types

187
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.140
of results that I can always pull from if I needed to.

188
00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:03.220
So this is how I would approach recipes for something like search that has different types of components

189
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.470
and different types of variations.
