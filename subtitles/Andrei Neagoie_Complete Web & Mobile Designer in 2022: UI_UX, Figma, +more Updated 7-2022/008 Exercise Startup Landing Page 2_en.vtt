00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.500
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.750
So how are we going to build this from scratch based on what we've learned so far?

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.250
Well, we're going to use bootstrap for this because we just learned it.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.480
And I actually gave you some starter files attached to the last lesson.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.060
If we take a look.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.470
That's right.

7
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.920
We had a header image.

8
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.780
We had an index, a HTML file, and then a style CSS file.

9
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.820
So you can open these.

10
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.370
Make sure they're all in the same folder.

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.060
I called mine, start up with an exclamation mark because this is an exciting project and in our case,

12
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.530
we'll use sublime text.

13
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.200
We should have something like this.

14
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.830
So we have our index.html file, our style dot CSS and then our header image.

15
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.200
Now.

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.590
I filled in a few things for you just to get us started.

17
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.910
Nothing too crazy, though.

18
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.540
Don't worry.

19
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.129
One is we've used some Google fonts so that we can use this monserrat font, which I think is kind of

20
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.580
nice from the Google fonts, and we enable that in our stylesheet by saying body and HTML.

21
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.270
I want to make sure that the font family has this setting.

22
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.640
If not, we'll use sans serif.

23
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.220
I've also set width and height for 100%.

24
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.170
That's always something good to have to make sure that the body and HTML cover 100% of whatever we see

25
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.890
on the screen.

26
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:38.050
Next we have our bootstrap CCIS from a seed CDN or a content delivery network.

27
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.890
And the reason I've added this here is that so you don't have to actually include a bootstrap file yourself.

28
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.720
If I actually go to the bootstrap page and I go to Quickstart, you'll see that right here.

29
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.800
We can just copy and paste this, just like here with the bootstrap CSS file.

30
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.340
So that way, right away, as soon as we copy and paste this line, we have bootstrap available to us.

31
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.180
Now notice here how we have versions of bootstrap in this case is 4.3.1.

32
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.440
Now, this number, as the time passes, is going to get bigger and bigger because bootstrap is a constantly

33
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.010
evolving library as developers make updates.

34
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.560
But as long as you use a number higher than this, everything in this project should work.

35
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.750
Like I said, most of the time, no matter when you're watching this video, as long as you copy this

36
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.810
or you use my starter files, everything should work.

37
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.980
And then finally we have our stylesheet.

38
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.140
Nothing new here, right?

39
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.700
Because we've already seen this before.

40
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.280
We have our style CSS file and our style file just has this for now.

41
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.160
We also have our header image, which again is a nice little laptop image for our startup landing page.

42
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.040
Now this is the website over here that is completely blank because we have nothing in the body.

43
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.760
So let's just have a header, one that says hello right here.

44
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.560
Save it and refresh.

45
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.730
Look at that we have.

46
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.750
Hello.

47
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.570
Now, notice here how fast I did that.

48
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.640
I just pressed command R on my laptop, which is a mac.

49
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.960
If you have windows, it's control r to refresh the web page.

50
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:33.610
And you notice here that the font is being applied once again because we have our font family CSS set.

51
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.660
So there's our page, our setup, and there is what we want to get to.

52
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.020
Now, if you want, you can go off on your own and try to attempt to build this from scratch yourself.

53
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.860
Otherwise, I'll see you in the next video to actually get our page to look a little bit more like this

54
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.110
and less like this.

55
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.520
I'll see you in the next one.

56
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.390
Bye bye.
