00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.080
Hey and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:08.290
So in our last video, we focused a lot on trying to find different types of typefaces that are going

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.810
to suit our brand over here habitual.

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.590
We went for different types of typefaces that are a little bit more humanist.

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.270
They have a little more variation in the types of like letter forms.

6
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.870
We tried some more safe bets like inter, which were kind of like throwbacks to like those grotesque

7
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.740
types of typefaces.

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.510
We got one geometric typeface and that was just and just to kind of like mimic what we have here, the

9
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.780
very round little counters.

10
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.390
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to start thinking about, well, I need to choose a typeface here

11
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.780
and I want to choose the one that is going to work best for the types of components and different type

12
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.790
of content I'm going to have on my page.

13
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.070
You know, the worst thing to do is just pick a typeface out of nowhere and then find out later that,

14
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.820
hey, this doesn't really suit what I'm trying to build.

15
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.170
It's not necessarily legible.

16
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.390
It's not really suiting the brand like I thought it would.

17
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.820
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a huge frame.

18
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.700
So let's create a big frame.

19
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.760
And we'll just call this concepts.

20
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.210
So I urge you while I'm doing this, to do it yourself as well.

21
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.460
Think about the types of content that we're going to be designing with like type elements that we may

22
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.030
have.

23
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.610
So I'm going to grab this brandy and I'm going to bring it over here.

24
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.020
I'm just going to convert this to group just to make it easier, because we're just playing around with

25
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.950
concepts.

26
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.180
So we have our brandy.

27
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.590
So when I think about the type of content I'm going to see, I'm going to think about like maybe the

28
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:53.880
home page is going to have like copy that says, find the stuff that you love and I'm going to start

29
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.630
using like here, let's use inter to start it off.

30
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.950
Great.

31
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.370
I'm probably going to use like 32 pixels and we'll make that bold.

32
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.900
A logo.

33
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.039
We'll just bring it over here.

34
00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.240
I think it helps to.

35
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.900
Really.

36
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.690
See how this plays, how these elements all play well together.

37
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:31.360
And I may write something like, take a look at what we found for you.

38
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.260
So this maybe like 16 pixels and like a medium.

39
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.010
Okay.

40
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.490
So it's starting to look really nice.

41
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.960
I'm going to just try to match this color here.

42
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.790
It looks like it fits really well.

43
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.130
What else can we do?

44
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.540
Well, let's get an image.

45
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.150
Let's think about like a product image because there's going to be a bunch of them on this on this app.

46
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.550
So I'm going to open up Unsplash.

47
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.990
And I'm just going to type in like headphones or something.

48
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.840
Cool.

49
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.000
That's going to work.

50
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.590
Okay.

51
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.270
It's not in our frame.

52
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.320
Now it's in our frame.

53
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.300
Okay.

54
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.090
I think that's that's good for now.

55
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.630
And what I'll do now is probably just write the product name.

56
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.170
So let's just say like Sony headphones.

57
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.170
And then I will write like up.

58
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:53.870
I think a price we'll probably have will most likely have appraise 65, 99 and we probably have some

59
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.560
copies.

60
00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:03.530
So let's go to our Lorem ipsum plug in, let's go to sentences and maybe we'll just have like two sentences.

61
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.280
Okay.

62
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.690
Now we can start creating a little bit more variation.

63
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.890
In terms of like the different types of type elements that we're going to see.

64
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.940
So that's probably like, maybe it's like regular.

65
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.210
It's probably like bull at 16.

66
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.710
I think that's fine.

67
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.040
We have this this may be a little bit larger, maybe like.

68
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.810
20.

69
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.410
And look at that like we we have a little bit of a product thing here, like a product image and everything.

70
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.230
Let me take it a step further.

71
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.600
And, you know, let's create a little pill that says like sale.

72
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.600
So we're going to do is I'm going to select it.

73
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.120
Option command g will make a frame, but just call it pill.

74
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.280
And what we're going to do here is we're going to go to order layout.

75
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.680
We'll do eight by eight.

76
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.800
Actually, we can probably just leave it at zero.

77
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.330
So eight by zero.

78
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.060
And we're going to go to our border radius or corner radius and select 100.

79
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.020
And we are going to turn that on.

80
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.600
Let's try to match our brand.

81
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.310
I think that's fine.

82
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.760
Okay.

83
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.820
And as for the.

84
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.060
Actual tape inside there will make it.

85
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:36.990
All caps probably make it like bolt or maybe semi bolt, maybe a little bit.

86
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.710
Of letter spacing.

87
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.810
And we can bump this up to like.

88
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.020
Actually, I think that's fine.

89
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:55.200
So now we have like a little more to see here, like in terms of just the actual versatility of our

90
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.740
typeface.

91
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.350
And this is definitely a much more versatile typeface than I thought it would be.

92
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.260
Everything kind of plays really well together, so.

93
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.430
Hmm.

94
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.380
I think this is fine.

95
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.860
What I'm going to do is I'm going to go all the way to the top.

96
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.830
And I'm going to make a couple copies.

97
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.810
So you have a bunch of copies now.

98
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.420
And what I like to do is I just like to select everything unless let's see what it looks like when we

99
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.020
start applying other typefaces and how they play together.

100
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.580
So that's one.

101
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.390
You know, you may need to change the styles around just a bit to get it the way you like.

102
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.480
Um.

103
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.990
Okay, that's going to be good.

104
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.650
This one will do overpass.

105
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.930
Okay.

106
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.520
I think we need to just change the board on that to like an extra bold.

107
00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.850
Maybe this is like an extra bowl.

108
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.960
I like overpass a lot, actually.

109
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.100
I think it looks a lot like our wordmark there.

110
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.560
What was the other one?

111
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.550
Just.

112
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.330
Okay.

113
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.480
There's a lot of.

114
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:18.200
I think we're going to see I we're going to run into the problem here of just a little bit of legibility,

115
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.570
just the way the typeface is.

116
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.870
So I'm not sure if that's going to be a good choice.

117
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.660
And I think Haben was the last one.

118
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.860
Same with Cabin.

119
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.370
I mean, there isn't enough variation here.

120
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.140
So it may run into that problem.

121
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.570
So that's something definitely to think about.

122
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.760
So if I were to go through these different typefaces, I'm going to really think about, okay, well,

123
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.910
what is going to suit my content?

124
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.880
Number one, what matches like the tone of my brand?

125
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.440
So I think like Enter is a really nice one over here.

126
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.130
Definitely a really nice brand.

127
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.300
I mean, it matches our brand really nicely.

128
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.150
Definitely.

129
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.160
We have Lito.

130
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.960
I like that one a lot too.

131
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.710
I really like just the numbers on it as well.

132
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:08.190
It's.

133
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.640
Those are nice.

134
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.340
Maybe a little bit too much contrast.

135
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.100
So I like Leto a lot, actually.

136
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.010
It's like this in between.

137
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.250
Between like a surf and a sand surf.

138
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.910
There's these nice rounded corners.

139
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:30.950
I mean, it's not too alike in terms of, like, the actual brand, but it's not to not too different.

140
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.740
And when we kind of zoom out, it's really legible.

141
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.200
Overpass over here is really nice.

142
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.970
I mean, there's, like, kind of like.

143
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.870
A throwback to the word mark.

144
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.580
But one thing I don't like about it is it's not as legible as the others.

145
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.280
It's a little bit more convinced than I thought it would be.

146
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.880
And plus those little intricacies, especially like the K, if you look at that or what's another letter

147
00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:03.680
here that has something like the short, like tip of the F and the high cross, you know, it makes

148
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.670
things a little bit harder to read, especially like the P over here.

149
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.790
So I'm probably not going to go with Overpass.

150
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:12.830
Same thing with Jost here.

151
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:20.630
I mean, we have the issue of like it having low X Heights, tall, tall heights over here and.

152
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.460
That makes it a little bit harder to read it.

153
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.200
Smaller sizes.

154
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.050
So I think what else we have, we have cabin.

155
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.770
So cabin.

156
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:31.710
I like to.

157
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:37.640
The only issue is like this is bold and this is regular and those are the two extremes and there isn't

158
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.900
enough contrast.

159
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.530
So if I'm going to squint and look at it, I'll notice that.

160
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.400
I mean, they kind of blurred together and this is probably not going to be a good choice since we're

161
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.020
going to have a lot of this together.

162
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.970
So my goal here, let's see if I bring this down a notch.

163
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:58.400
I mean, even then, it's still a little too close for my liking.

164
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.400
You know, for the sake of X, I really like the font.

165
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.600
I'm going to bring it in to my next round.

166
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.240
Same with Inter and Lito.

167
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.570
So let's bring those in because I like those.

168
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:17.370
So at this point, I mean, you can go ahead like you can use whatever fonts you want.

169
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.360
I'm just showing you my process for elimination.

170
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.490
When I'm choosing fonts, I may start creating a little bit more variation in elements to see what really

171
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.850
suits us or what's really going to suit our brand.

172
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:36.020
I'm thinking of going with Lito right now just because it's just a really nice typeface in relation.

173
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:42.620
Like I think the contrast between this and the brand in general is really nice and it has a sense of

174
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.640
like, I don't know, I think like you could just say like trustworthiness in a way.

175
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.860
Like it just it seems really professional.

176
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:54.950
The only problem I have right now with Inter is that it just seems like it's it's kind of devoid of

177
00:10:54.950 --> 00:11:00.500
all emotion if you want to say kind of like a Helvetica and other neo grotesques.

178
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.740
So I'm having a hard time kind of settling on that.

179
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.340
What else is there?

180
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.000
And I mean, carbon just there's just not enough variation there.

181
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.590
So I think I'm going to stick with later.

182
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:17.260
Right now that may change, but what I would do is I would start creating different elements like buttons

183
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.730
or like paragraphs, body copy to really see.

184
00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:27.280
I mean, we may not have a bunch of that in our application, but it's just good practice just to see

185
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.930
the variance in your typeface.

186
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:34.630
And I think this is going to work really well if we use it just as a solo typeface on our application.

187
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:39.940
So that's how you pick typefaces for a brand with no type system in place.

188
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.950
What I'm going to do next is I'm going to jump into Figma again and I'm going to start building out

189
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:45.820
a type system.
