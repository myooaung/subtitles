00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:04.420
And we got another Q&A video for you.

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.330
And this one is going to be talking about something that you may have seen yourself while following

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.290
along these videos.

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.740
And that is the fact that this file over here is different than, let's say, if you go to a website

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.960
and you see https.

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.940
What does that mean?

7
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:30.560
If you go into our example, you also saw here that we have an anchor tag that references new page dot

8
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.290
HTML.

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.500
It has nothing like file or HTTP in front of it.

10
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.950
And then you also saw that the images here are referencing some sort of a website that links to a picture.

11
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.960
So what's the difference here?

12
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:55.780
The difference here is that the first is using the file protocol, and that means that this Web page,

13
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.230
I can't really access it outside of my computer.

14
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.480
This is using something called a relative path.

15
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:16.760
If I go into my index html, i am saying to link to new page html relative to where indexed html is.

16
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.580
So if we go to our desktop, you see that indexed HTML lives in the same directory, which is the desktop

17
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.660
as new page.

18
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.600
So I can reference it through here.

19
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.400
If I created a new folder, let's say test.

20
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.010
I would have to reference it this way.

21
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.540
So let's let's check here.

22
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.750
If I save this and going to the Web page, refresh and click new page, I'll get your file.

23
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.860
That was not found.

24
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.480
But now if I go into my desktop and create.

25
00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.030
Test and I put the new page in here and let's bring back.

26
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.530
Everything refresh and click on new page.

27
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.039
This is now working and you can see over here that I'm accessing it through desktop test, new page

28
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.030
HTML.

29
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.950
So that's called a relative path.

30
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.160
So relative to where indexed HTML pages, I am saying indexed html.

31
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.390
I want you to access from test new page html.

32
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.160
If you look at the images.

33
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.240
You'll see that we have something different.

34
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.910
We're accessing the image through HTTP, which we'll get into later videos when we talk about servers,

35
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.720
but this is how we access files over the internet.

36
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.290
If I wanted this anchor tag, this new page to actually link to something, maybe another website,

37
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.230
maybe to this hilarious gif.

38
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.330
Well, I can copy this link.

39
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.210
Open up.

40
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.370
My sublime text.

41
00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.460
And now I can just copy this with the HTTPS protocol.

42
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:09.150
And now this is an absolute link, no matter where I reference this, if I put it into new page HTML

43
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.870
or indexed HTML no matter what this link.

44
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.750
Well, get me to this gif, so let's test that out.

45
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.150
I save this, I refresh and I click on new page and look at that.

46
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.430
We have the gif.

47
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.830
All right.

48
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.690
Hopefully that answers your question.

49
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.880
We'll get into HTTP and https later on in the course.

50
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.300
But for now, keep that in mind that there is absolute path and then there is relative path.

51
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.220
I'm going to fix that.

52
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.860
So we have it back for the next video.

53
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.570
I'll see you on the next one.

54
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.200
Bye bye.
