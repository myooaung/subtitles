00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.290
All righty.

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.320
Welcome back.

3
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.910
So the goal of this video is going to be to add our image assets that we have in Figma into our own

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.840
project.

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.040
There is a principle of layout and design when it comes to print for newspapers and magazines, and

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.450
that is that you always want the image to be larger than what it will be on the page in order to make

7
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.550
sure that it remains sharp.

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.520
If you've ever had a really small image that has been made bigger, you can see that it pixelate and

9
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.780
loses quality.

10
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.780
We want the opposite to happen in this case, to have a bigger image become smaller on the page.

11
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.820
So we need to export the elements.

12
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.310
We can do this in different formats.

13
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.840
So let's say that we click on one of the layers here.

14
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.820
So if we were to click down on the arrow, we can see that it's made up of an icon as well as the text

15
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.300
here.

16
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.080
If you wanted to, you could actually export each of these letters individually and apply the styling

17
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.980
individually.

18
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.190
But for me, that's a little too in-depth.

19
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.430
I want to just actually export the entire layer.

20
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.350
So the logo plus the branding itself.

21
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.490
Once I have this layer selected, we're going to start with the branding.

22
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.870
I'm going to go over to the export option here.

23
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.980
I'm going to click on it.

24
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.880
And you can see that there's multiple formats that you could export in.

25
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.740
For me, I'm going to stick with P&G because it allows us to maintain quality by exporting at a bigger

26
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.550
size, as well as maintaining transparency, which is especially important for these images that have

27
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.040
boxed shadow with them as well.

28
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.360
So we're going to switch this to two times.

29
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.230
You can see if you want to preview it.

30
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.030
You can see that the checkered background is showing that the background is transparent, which is also

31
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.320
going to be super important because we are going to be changing the background color later on in the

32
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.590
project so we can just click on this button export and you can see we have our PNG here.

33
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.070
We're going to do the same thing for our main image.

34
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.510
But once we click on this, we can see that there's actually a whole other image here.

35
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.050
So we have the iPhone that's made up of the swipe indicator, the screen, the device and the frame.

36
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.540
You can see that as I hover over it, the blue changes to show which one is selected.

37
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.240
In this case, we're going to just take the iPhone itself, which has everything together, including

38
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.260
the box shadow.

39
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.130
So we'll now click and export that you can see.

40
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.180
We have a preview here.

41
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.230
We have the box shadow and the rest of it is transparent.

42
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.650
And again, I'm going to export it at two times.

43
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.150
Export that.

44
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.610
And we can minimize that.

45
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.640
I'm going to do the same thing for the rest of these.

46
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.470
So each of these images.

47
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.400
So we have exported each of our image assets here.

48
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.540
Now we're going to jump into where we've downloaded them.

49
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.390
So we're going to show them in our folder here and we're going to copy all of these into our Splash

50
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.120
Page project inside a folder we're going to create called IMG.

51
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.550
And I'll put this here.

52
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.420
Open it up and we're going to drag all of these inside.

53
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:30.190
So there should be two, four, six, eight, nine images total going to drag them and we're going to

54
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.420
clean these up.

55
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.490
Okay, let's just view them like this.

56
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.600
So we'll switch that.

57
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.380
Okay.

58
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:43.150
So I am going to change all of the file names to be more simplified in order to remove the spaces and

59
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.640
just be easier within our project.

60
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.880
So again, I will kind of fast forward through this.

61
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.560
Okay.

62
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.200
So for all the one word file names, I just made them lowercase just to match everything.

63
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.510
The iPhone 15 image I rename to B Main Dash Image.

64
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.000
I added the dashes to habitual branding, made it lowercase, and then I simplified these to to be app

65
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.060
dash store dash button and Google play dash button.

66
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.600
All right.

67
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.430
So we have all of our images sorted out there now in our project.

68
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.890
It's time to actually add them to our code, into our index HTML.

69
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.100
And we're going to start with the branding, which is actually going to go above our title and text

70
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.720
as it is on the page.

71
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.610
So first, we're going to comment on a title for our brand logo.

72
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:41.680
And I'm just going to add this as a straight up image so I can just type IMG and press enter and the

73
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.750
source I'm going to do Dot Slash and then it'll automatically come up with image.

74
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.170
I'm going to press enter and now you can see that it automatically shows all the possible options here.

75
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:59.020
And I actually want habitual branding, so I'm going to highlight that and press enter and I'm going

76
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.250
to give it an alt description as well, habitual logo.

77
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.970
And I'm also going to give it a class of brand IMG.

78
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.020
All right.

79
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.990
Next, within our text container, we want to add our app icons below this.

80
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.350
Okay.

81
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:25.300
I'm going to create a parent div just with period app store BTN and press enter and you see it creates

82
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.720
the div for me inside of this I'm going to have an anchor element so I'll just type A and press enter

83
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.970
this would link to the App Store for the splash page that we have, but because we don't really have

84
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:47.030
an app to link to, I'm just going to put in a HTTPS colon, slash slash and then apple dotcom.

85
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:55.990
And we're also going to give this a target attribute of underscore blank so that it opens in a new page.

86
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.590
And then we're going to press enter here again.

87
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.640
And then inside of this anchor is going to be our image.

88
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:10.660
So I'm going to have my image here and the source, I'm going to do dot slash again into our image folder.

89
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.170
And then I want the App Store button.

90
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.730
PNG and then the alt.

91
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.730
I'm just going to have app store and I can actually copy this now.

92
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.920
And we'll pace it again.

93
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:37.390
And this time I'm going to change this class of the parent here to be Google dash play dash BTN and

94
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.880
the link is going to go to play dot google.com instead.

95
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.870
And we still want our target blank.

96
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.920
We need to change the source.

97
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:55.810
So this time it's going to be our Google play button PNG and I'm going to change the alt attribute as

98
00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:02.380
well to be Google Play OC so we can save that and check that out so far.

99
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.470
Okay.

100
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.370
So we have our branding here and we have our App Store icon and if we click on it, can see that we

101
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.200
go to the Apple website and if we click on this, we see that we go to Google play.

102
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.050
All right, so that's working how we want it to work.

103
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.770
So far.

104
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.000
You can see that they're also way too big, especially compared to the text.

105
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.800
But we will get to that in the next video when we focus on our styling.

106
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.860
Let's keep adding our assets though for now.

107
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.770
So next we have our main image.

108
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.650
So we want this to be below our text container.

109
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:42.970
So we'll go below that and we're going to comment on a title for our main image and we're going to use

110
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.250
a parent div for this as well.

111
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:53.530
So we'll just do a dot main dash image, dash container and then press enter to create our div.

112
00:07:53.560 --> 00:08:01.960
And then inside of this we're going to have our image and then IMG press enter to create our image and

113
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:08.110
our source dot slash and then enter for our image and we want our main image.

114
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:15.340
IMG and the alt will be our landing page mockup.

115
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.240
Okay.

116
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.740
And then below that, we'll comment on another title.

117
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:25.440
And this is just going to be four images and then we're going to just add in the rest of the images.

118
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.480
I'm going to fast forward to this part.

119
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.230
You can see that each of these will also have their own unique class.

120
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.630
So this first one is profile image.

121
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.390
It'll follow that same format for the rest of them.

122
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.159
I can actually copy these.

123
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.200
So I have five in total.

124
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.290
And now fast forward through renaming them.

125
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:45.910
Okay.

126
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.130
So we're done here.

127
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.720
We have a class corresponding to each.

128
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:56.080
We have the correct images in here and we have an alt description for all of our images.

129
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.780
Let's save that now and check it out.

130
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.130
Okay.

131
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.750
So we have our main image here.

132
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:07.660
It's definitely too big and we have all of our other images here.

133
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.240
They are also definitely bigger than they need to be.

134
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.000
Okay.

135
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:19.190
So in the next video, we will get to actually styling everything to make everything fit and position

136
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.170
the way that it should be.

137
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:22.730
I'll see you in that one.

138
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.930
Bye for now.
