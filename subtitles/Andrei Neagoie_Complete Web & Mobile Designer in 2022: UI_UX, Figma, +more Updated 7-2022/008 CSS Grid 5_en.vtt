00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.780
And now the thing I want to show you with the individual item in a grid is that we can do something

2
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.250
like justify.

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.070
Self.

4
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:20.380
Remember up here we did justify items and align items, but when it comes to individual items, we have

5
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.520
to use self.

6
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.070
And as you can imagine, if I do self start and I refresh here.

7
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.490
We go to the start of the column.

8
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.520
If I do a line.

9
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.850
It's going to go to the start of the row.

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.180
And if we do end and refresh again, we see that the same thing is happening.

11
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.220
I'm going to leave this file for you as well so you can play around with it.

12
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.210
I encourage you to try to create different types of grids and looks that you want.

13
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.960
As you can see, it's pretty powerful, but also very, very simple and allows us to create responsive

14
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.480
grid systems very, very easily.

15
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.030
Now there's actually a cheat sheet that you can use to summarize everything that I've taught you up

16
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.970
until now that I'll link to in this video.

17
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.830
It's called the Well The Grid Cheat Sheet, and it shows you exactly why you need to do for the container.

18
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.210
We've learned about great gap grid templates, a line items.

19
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.670
And also what to do with the children such as grit, column, justify self, align self.

20
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.650
And it has all these little snippets that you can just click on and copy.

21
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:49.270
So I recommend you play around with some of these properties on your own, because in the next part

22
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.320
we're going to use CSS Grid to build a complete website layout.

23
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.970
I'll see you in that one.
