00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,720
Hey and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,500
We're going to be talking about visual assets.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,600
Now, I promise you, visual assets will be a part of every single project you work on, whether it's

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,210
imagery, illustrations or iconography.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,900
Sometimes your clients may come to you with assets of their own.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,620
And the ugly truth is, sometimes they're really bad.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,960
It's something that we got to learn how to navigate.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,300
But let's get into something else.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,050
Projects in deadlines, just sometimes they move so quick and you don't have that budget to hire a photographer

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,790
or even hire an illustrator.

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,290
And that sucks.

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,030
But if you do have budget and if you do have the time, please do hire a photographer.

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,100
It does make a world of difference, especially even with illustrators as well.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,340
Please hire them if you do have that budget and that time.

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,800
So sometimes you do get lucky.

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:55,570
Sometimes you have amazing assets to work with, whether they're good photography like this.

17
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,060
This is something I quickly put together with Unsplash.

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,710
But if your client comes to you with something like this, this is something that's great to work with.

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:08,190
Maybe they've had good photography done beforehand, maybe some illustration and iconography.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,260
I feel like iconography is never really the problem on this list.

21
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,310
They generally trust a product designer or UX designer to do what's best.

22
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,290
And the other scenario is that you're not so lucky.

23
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,090
You may get stock photos.

24
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,090
You know, stock photos are horrible.

25
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,940
Some of them are okay, but most of them are bad.

26
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,230
And please don't ever use them.

27
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,780
This is the moment you should really sit down with your client or product team or both and talk about

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,070
ways you can improve on that because anything is really better than this.

29
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,040
Now there are a couple of resources that can help you.

30
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,230
I really love using Unsplash.

31
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:49,390
You can use your website or you can use the Figma plugin, which we'll get into later.

32
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,490
Now this is totally free and you don't need to really credit anyone.

33
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:01,120
All the images on here you can just use and you can also just search by keyword, you can search randomly,

34
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,160
you can search by category.

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:10,509
They have a great like foundry of imagery and some of it's really amazing actually for illustrations.

36
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:15,850
I love using Figma plugins like blush illustrations and there's humans.

37
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,010
So these are really great.

38
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,510
This is Blush over here.

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,040
It will allow you to kind of mix and match some illustrations.

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,110
The only thing is it's paid, but you can get a good sense of, if you like, an illustration and want

41
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,130
to use it later.

42
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,960
This is called humans.

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:38,470
This is another plugin that allows you to kind of piece together different types of scenarios you can

44
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,430
use, like a head, whatever shirt you want and we'll get into that as well.

45
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,260
And illustrations is another fun one.

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,260
You'll get the SVG as well as for Figma plugins.

47
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,420
This is what's really great and you can go out and buy illustrations as well, but sometimes they do

48
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,050
get expensive.

49
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,780
So I suggest using something like this and seeing where you can go from there for icons.

50
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,180
I love using material icons.

51
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,760
They're easy to use, the website's easy to use.

52
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:11,170
You can pick out whatever you want, whether the themes are filled, outlined, rounded to tone or sharp,

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:18,100
you have the ability to just search by whatever keyword you want and you can easily grab an icon and

54
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,750
upload that into figma.

55
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,580
Figma also has several plug ins that will go over.

56
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,730
One is called Icon Ify and the other one they do have a material design plug in that we can use as well.

57
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,950
So let's jump right into Figma and I'll show you how to work with different types of imagery and illustration

58
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,820
and icons.
