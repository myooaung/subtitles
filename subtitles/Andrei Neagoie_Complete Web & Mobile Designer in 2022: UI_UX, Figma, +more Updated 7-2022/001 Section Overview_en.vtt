00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.710
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:07.360
In this section, I want to tackle the problem that we have, especially when we're starting out.

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.650
That is, how do I create a layout of a website?

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.690
And it's probably the hardest thing to learn when you're starting off.

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.870
How do you create something, let's say, like this, that is responsive that we see all across the

6
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.990
Web, a navigation bar, a header, some grids, a footer down here?

7
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.610
And how do we really make it responsive?

8
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.220
In this section, we're going to build an ideal web page layout so that moving forward you have the

9
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.420
baseline and foundation to go off and customize and build whatever sites you want that are responsive

10
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.730
without spending a lot of time, trial and error, trying different things with CSS, hoping that it

11
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.360
works.

12
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.410
So I'm going to show you my recommended way of laying out web pages that is responsive and have that

13
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.540
template available to you moving forward.

14
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:16.090
We're also going to learn about a new feature in CSIS called CSIS Grid, which is really, really powerful

15
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.380
and as you'll learn.

16
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:26.750
Allows us to use this CSS grid combined with Flexbox to honestly not even need things like Bootstrap

17
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.700
four or other libraries that are allow you to do grids back into the day.

18
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:40.100
It was really, really hard to do layout in CSS, but with tools like CSS, Grid and Flexbox, you now

19
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.280
have the abilities to really build beautiful responsive layouts really, really fast.

20
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.410
So let's get started.

21
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.210
I'll see you in the next video.
