00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.290
Hey, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.870
So the last part of this canvas and this is something that's happening throughout the entire canvass,

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.000
is mapping your assumptions.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.720
Now, risky assumptions are one of the primary sources of wasted effort.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.020
When we're building applications in general, the team has the opportunity to really help each other

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.060
and reduce that risk and uncertainty involved in the success of the project.

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.740
By calling out all this information during this canvass that we're kind of hosting now, the recommendation

8
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.250
is to put an asterisks next to any information gathered where the confidence isn't really high and it's

9
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.180
and if proven wrong, could lead to the project goals not being met.

10
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.030
So there are many common assumptions that if they're proven wrong, they can really affect the success

11
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.540
of the project.

12
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.980
And here are some examples.

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:58.080
If we put too much effort into minor things, our assumption is that a more personalized shopping experience

14
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.550
is going to be better for users.

15
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.010
So that definitely is an assumption.

16
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.900
And we're going to put this in the middle.

17
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.460
Like we do know that personalized shopping experiences are generally better, but if we don't get it

18
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.220
right, this is very high risk for us.

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.860
Let's think of another example building features of little value to end users.

20
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.350
So let's think about some features within our app interest picker.

21
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.650
Generally, when people are searching for products, they really just want to find their product or

22
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.240
they want to be served up products.

23
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.810
And maybe this interest picker is a little bit too much for a minimum viable product.

24
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.050
So we're a little uncertain if we need this, but the risk is a little bit lower.

25
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.960
You know, we may spend a little bit time building this, but, you know, it may be risky.

26
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.510
Let's think about another assumption focusing on the wrong part of the user journey first.

27
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.580
So let's think about our user journey.

28
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.080
We're going to go back up here.

29
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.770
This is something that we quickly built out if a user wants to get relevant results and that's our goal

30
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.830
over here, maybe something that we should figure out first is how we're going to serve up those results.

31
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.390
So maybe the onboarding experience is really in depth and so like.

32
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.080
People are maybe really want to focus on deals.

33
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.530
We do know people like deals, but if we focus on this now, it's going to give us less time to actually

34
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.640
finish the project.

35
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.860
So maybe this is in the middle as well.

36
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.490
Another one.

37
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.450
Let's think of another one.

38
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.340
We are assuming that all users want to be on mobile since this is a mobile app.

39
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.780
Now this is a high risk and we're definitely uncertain of this.

40
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.280
We don't know the type of user.

41
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.440
We don't know if they're primarily mobile users.

42
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.560
These are the types of things we're going to actually be putting in this kind of like parking lot throughout

43
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.500
the entire canvas.

44
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.560
We're marking all these things with an asterisks as they're on the whiteboard or within Figma.

45
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.230
We're making copies of this and throwing this on our large assumption grid.

46
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.580
Probably larger than this.

47
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.980
And these are the types of things at the end that we're going to do our best to validate.

48
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.560
We really want at the end of the canvas to understand what the project goals are.

49
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.860
We want to understand our target users are less.

50
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.570
These are end users and these are our stakeholders.

51
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.350
We want to understand their goals and concerns.

52
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.940
We want to understand the user journey, the main user journeys that we are going to be focused on for

53
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.240
this project.

54
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.660
But another thing that we need to do is we need to understand the assumptions that we're making along

55
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.110
the way.

56
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.880
And our first goal after this in canvas is to validate all of these different things.

57
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:58.230
So one very large assumption that we all make is that we know this.

58
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.560
We know what the end user wants to do.

59
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.160
We may know, but this holds a lot of risk and we need to figure this out early.

60
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.240
This is what I usually do.

61
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.959
I map them out into a grid.

62
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.779
Sometimes I'll just list them and then we can prioritize them as a team.

63
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.830
That's probably quicker in the moment.

64
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.190
So remember to map this out throughout the entire process, and that's basically the end of the first

65
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.440
part of a product alignment canvas.
