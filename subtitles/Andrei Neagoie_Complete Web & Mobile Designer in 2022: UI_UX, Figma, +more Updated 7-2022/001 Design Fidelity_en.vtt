00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.070
Everyone in.

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.790
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:09.710
We covered a ton of content around different types of design theories, like anything in relation to

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.860
like the basics in terms of like typography, color forms, grids.

5
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.410
I mean, we've covered in the beginning more wireframe, basic stuff, user flows, and now I think

6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.840
it's time to start building up our fidelity.

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.560
Now this is a big topic in the design realm, I would say, in terms of like where do we start, how

8
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.850
do we end up somewhere?

9
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.990
And design fidelity is just it's something hard and I don't know if there's any really right answer.

10
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.930
I guess you can just say that we should always start just quick and start with your sketches.

11
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.470
I have here our wireframes that we designed, which were really great.

12
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.110
Here's our homepage and we should really start somewhere like here and build our way up over time.

13
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.180
Now nothing is ever designed and perfected in the same step.

14
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.210
This is something that never happens.

15
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.060
Getting to those final like beautiful designs that takes a lot of testing and refinement.

16
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.190
And that's why we use those prototypes that we made, and that's why we use like these wireframes and

17
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.480
sketches that we created.

18
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.880
You want to continuously build upon your learnings instead of jumping right into beautiful designs,

19
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.990
and you saw that and how we've handled that over this entire course.

20
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.730
We started with sketching and we gradually started to build our way up.

21
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.730
We've covered a lot of different topics around style, and I think now is the time to really kind of

22
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.170
start to think about that.

23
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.930
But before we get into that, I think it's a great segue into thinking about building, measuring and

24
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.790
learning, and that's something I always try to incorporate in my designs and my design process.

25
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.200
This is something you should really apply to everything you do, and you should go and read the book

26
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.220
Lean Startup.

27
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.990
It's amazing book and it really teaches this build measure learn cycle.

28
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.360
So Build is to explore your ideas and prototype those possibilities like we were talking about with

29
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.590
those basic prototyping and wire framing, measuring, testing.

30
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.100
Your assumptions always go out there and use your tests.

31
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.560
Just put it in front of a user, get their feedback quickly, and the next step is learning.

32
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.860
So learn from that feedback, learn from your users and validate just so you can squash your assumptions,

33
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.050
just so you can get right back into building again.

34
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.480
Think of it as a circular cycle.

35
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.450
So build, measure, learn, keep that always at the center of your design process.

36
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.390
That's what I feel like we've done here thus far.

37
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:40.580
I mean, we haven't user tested just yet, but we've built a lot of designs just basically with wireframes,

38
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.450
sketches.

39
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.750
We've also went into different things like typography.

40
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.160
So this is the type system that I've started to build out, not finalized just yet.

41
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.150
I've picked a typeface, I'm using Lito or Lotto and I've created a bunch of styles and just headings

42
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.570
text.

43
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.240
So I've started to think about these types of things.

44
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.460
What I would do in my process is to, you know, see what works in terms of visual exploration, in

45
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.150
terms of typography, and start to build up to that and see what we need.

46
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.980
Even color palette, this is what we've kind of built together and this isn't finalized at all.

47
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.510
And we should continuously try to incorporate that into our designs and just see where we kind of lead.

48
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.030
We may cut colors like these colors.

49
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.970
We may just stick with like a monochromatic scheme.

50
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.670
So it's that's just something to think about.

51
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.120
You have to kind of explore all these different styles.

52
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.600
We also kind of jumped right into our form exploration when we were talking about form best practices.

53
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.550
So you could see that we're using some of our own colors here.

54
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.320
We were starting to see what different types of inputs could look like when they're disabled.

55
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.510
Like these buttons, we could start seeing what these types of things could look like are these little

56
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.070
checkbox squares.

57
00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.070
We also start to think about like just general hierarchy when it comes to copy and the way we lay that

58
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.580
out.

59
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.160
In essence, what you want to do is you want to seek your feedback early and go on to learn and apply.

60
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.810
This is how you build an understanding about the product you're building, but this is also how you

61
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.770
build and reach that level and type of fidelity that resonates with your users.

62
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.200
So the reason we seek feedback is to use those learnings to inform and improve our designs.

63
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.250
Waiting too late to test or find that feedback, then it often is just way too late to actually act

64
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.130
on that feedback and it could be way too costly.

65
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.320
So use those low fidelity wireframes.

66
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.300
Let's just go back to that quickly.

67
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.360
So use these to start getting feedback early and then you can continue to improve on your product and

68
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.800
build up that fidelity and continue to test.

69
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.770
You shouldn't just test with these designs.

70
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:54.060
They may not actually do good testing like those small micro interactions or just motion in general

71
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.320
and stuff like that.

72
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.580
And we'll get into that.

73
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.250
But these are great for testing things like hierarchy, layout, the type of content you have, that

74
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.300
placement, maybe just navigation, a hierarchy as well.

75
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.860
So use that as a way to just validate your assumptions.

76
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.460
This can really have a massive impact on how we build out certain elements.

77
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.930
So in the example, typography, are things legible?

78
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.450
Can people read this small copy?

79
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.830
Are things readable?

80
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.400
Is there enough hierarchy and contrast between typographic elements?

81
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.150
Like, if I were to think about contrast and hierarchy, I would go right into like just product details.

82
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.560
If I squint, are things blurring together?

83
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.850
So I'm looking to create that contrast early on and test that.

84
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.680
What about the hierarchy of information?

85
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.090
Are things in the right place?

86
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.530
Does this make sense?

87
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.720
In terms of the home page.

88
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.150
How about does a navigation structure need to be reworked?

89
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.260
Is this accessible?

90
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.290
Is it usable?

91
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.430
Should we stop using the search at the top?

92
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.630
And incorporate it maybe into the navigation.

93
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.640
So these are questions are we're asking ourselves what will the style of our components does the style

94
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.050
of this card over here make things look too condensed?

95
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.370
Does this button.

96
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.600
Like these kind of square buttons that I have or this button.

97
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.610
Do they look clickable or does it seem clickable?

98
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.590
Does it seem like the user can interact with it?

99
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.020
Are inputs actually working properly?

100
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.760
Let's move that.

101
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.310
Let's go back to our our registration form.

102
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.640
So we have all these inputs.

103
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.800
I mean, do they do they work properly?

104
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.050
Do users easily interact with this?

105
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.820
So we're testing all of these assumptions that we have.

106
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.670
It has a really profound impact on all of our choices, and you shouldn't be making large decisions

107
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.830
without proper feedback.

108
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.390
So I just wanted to take the time to stress this because a lot of people like to really jump into high

109
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:56.630
fidelity designs right off the bat, and that is just a no no start with your sketches.

110
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:03.290
Gradually build yourself up, because if you start with beautiful designs without figuring out if certain

111
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:10.700
things do not work or do work, then you're setting yourself up for a big surprise later on when you

112
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.770
actually deliver that to users and you find out maybe users aren't interacting, users aren't getting

113
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.090
too deep into the funnel of like checking out or even using your application.

114
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:27.650
So remember to always test your wireframes, just get feedback early and learn from it, and then jump

115
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:33.760
into designs and visual exploration later on and gradually build up that fidelity.

116
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.340
That's all I wanted to say about how to build design fidelity.

117
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.060
Next, we're actually going to jump in and start doing that ourselves.

118
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.400
We're going to start working on the home page next.

119
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.800
That will be, I think, a great start to figuring out the type of color palette that we want to incorporate

120
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.650
our typography system, fleshing that out some more, just generally seeing what types of components

121
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.650
that we're going to have to build for in the future.

122
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.830
Can't wait to get you back in here and working on the home page.
