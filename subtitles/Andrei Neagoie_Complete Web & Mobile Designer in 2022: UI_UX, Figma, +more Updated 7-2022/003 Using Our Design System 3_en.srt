1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,720
Hey, everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:07,490
So we're going to talk about our cart and checkout compositions that we've created based off of some

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,370
of the components that we've created in the past and recipes that we've created.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,830
So you may notice that we have our cart here.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,740
And what I've done with our car is I've made it really simple.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,020
I've used it as just an overlay.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,060
Now I have just my header.

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,710
Now this is a component that I've created, but I actually didn't use the component in this instance.

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,570
We can use that because I just pulled this because I had a previous design of cart where it took up

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,880
the whole page and I thought that wasn't necessary and I thought a better implementation of CART would

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,470
be to actually have it just pop up from the bottom as an overlay and to keep that really simple and

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,900
small, not have that take up too much of the screen.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,480
Because if we think about cart in general, when we buy stuff off of like different types of marketplace

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,510
websites, we don't necessarily buy like ten things at once.

15
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,590
I mean, that's a rare occurrence.

16
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,880
Maybe if you're shopping for a holiday or something like that, but generally you're buying like maybe

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,940
one or two things, maybe three things at once.

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,370
And what I wanted to do is I want to make that very simple in terms of the experience.

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,850
I want them to press that cart button, see this pop up.

20
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,550
They can add to it really easily.

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,710
I have these two variations here.

22
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,880
Like I said, when you were starting to like build out the design a bit more, we have to start thinking

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,910
about all those different types of scenarios.

24
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,340
We also think about those scenarios in the beginning as well.

25
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,500
When we're building our site maps, when we're building, we're sketching still when we're, you know,

26
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,890
building out user flows.

27
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,590
The thing is, user flows and sketching that's kind of thing is going to just happen throughout the

28
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,880
entire design process.

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,550
So don't worry about forgetting something in the past because new features will come, new problems

30
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:48,770
will need to be solved and you'll need to kind of go back to the drawing board, quite literally, share

31
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:54,800
those with your team or your stakeholders like clients, and come to some sort of solution.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,940
So this is my solution for CART, and I've used the same type of recipe that we created back in our

33
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,010
design system, which was like our cart list.

34
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,490
And I have the different car components.

35
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,979
So you'll notice that this is not a component.

36
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,930
That's the default component over here.

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,230
That is just because of when I was using it within a prototype.

38
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,810
So if I go to actually update this, like I'll need to do is copy that.

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,850
I can bring that down the list, I can remove that one.

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:38,690
Now we're going to do is I'm going to command see and I think I have this price that 75, 99 and like

41
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,160
you can just easily update it like that.

42
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,350
Perfect.

43
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,160
So there you go.

44
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,570
Now we have a component.

45
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,470
You can even have that reflected.

46
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,460
And here it's pushed out all the way up.

47
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,920
Let's get rid of the one that isn't a component.

48
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,700
And there you go.

49
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,320
Everything's kind of back to normal now.

50
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,500
Now, like I said, I have two variations here.

51
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,550
I have a variation where we have the cart when the user first pulls it up.

52
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,480
And then I have a variation where we have a cart where somebody swipes.

53
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,500
And I just want to show that because when you're working closely with developers, they want to see

54
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,680
all these different types of interactions and we'll get into prototypes later.

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,830
But they want to see the different types of use cases we have for different types of models, overlays

56
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,470
or just like compositions in general.

57
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,210
So at the bottom I've decided to kind of go with just showing off the total.

58
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:39,480
Like I said, like we haven't seen this all types of version yet as typographic elements, but we've

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,200
seen them in the pill.

60
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,660
So I found like maybe like a double use case for this.

61
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,770
So I may create another style just to have for something like this.

62
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:53,760
I have the checkout button with an arrow trying to create a little bit of like FOMO, which is fear

63
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,400
of missing out or just trying to create some sort of urgency like, come on, let's go in this direction.

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,570
So when this happens, we're going to push them to a new page, which is the checkout.

65
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,810
So they've already reviewed their cart at this point.

66
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,460
And in checkout, what we want to just kind of focus on is do we have the right type of payment method?

67
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,360
You'll notice that I'm using the same card that we've created in the cart section.

68
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,380
So if we kind of go back to our design system, I'll take a look there.

69
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,180
Let's go back to cards.

70
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:29,640
You'll see that we've created a Bank of America card, just something small that we can kind of change.

71
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,070
If you want to like add a new bank, you can do that.

72
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,690
What I've done is I've just created a standard card that kind of fits our brand, but I've also just

73
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,130
kind of slot the name on there.

74
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,410
I've also kind of swapped like a MasterCard logo, and you can you can do that too.

75
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,800
It's there for you to kind of go ahead and edit.

76
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,810
Now I have that.

77
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,450
I've also added like a carousel at the bottom.

78
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:59,400
So if users want to swipe through cards, maybe they have multiples.

79
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,950
There's a cool interaction to be had right there.

80
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:07,350
We want to make this really nice, really exciting even through the checkout process, because if we

81
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,970
take a look at all the different types of checkout processes that we've participated in, a lot of them

82
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,170
are really boring.

83
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,210
We don't even read anything.

84
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,890
We are just kind of like, Yeah, yeah, whatever pay.

85
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,940
But if we do need to change credit cards, that kind of stuff becomes a little bit more, less exciting.

86
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,150
And also sometimes the experience there is not nice.

87
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,010
So we want to make sure that these cards are right up in the user's face.

88
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,200
They're very familiar for the user, so they can understand that, oh yes, this is my Visa or my MasterCard

89
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,270
that I've put into this application.

90
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,000
So I can see that very vividly over here.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,460
I can swipe it if I need to add another one or if I need to use another one.

92
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,210
I also have like the important shipping information right up front.

93
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,130
Like I know where this is getting shipped to.

94
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,110
Below.

95
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,420
I've also added a very small section for adding a promo code, making that very simple.

96
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,810
The CTA like a bright yellow button.

97
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,760
But I mean, it's not necessarily the primary thing users need to do here, but I've kept it there just

98
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,310
so it will reflect in the total price right away.

99
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,290
And users can see that connection between here and here.

100
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:22,010
But like I said before, I'm using my placeholder unselected button, and if we want to show this interaction

101
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,480
in more detail, we would create another screen and have like a selected input as well.

102
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,100
And I'll show you what that looks like later.

103
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:34,520
I have my apply button over here, which is just kind of like my primary button that is a default.

104
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,400
And then I have like my delivery fee.

105
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,720
I have the order total and at the bottom I'm using our footer.

106
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,100
And like I've noticed that I'm starting to use a footer very much like I'm using a header within the

107
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,850
application.

108
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,940
And I thought, you know, maybe this footer becomes an actual component now.

109
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,070
So I may actually go back and create like a footer component section where I add this and I maybe add

110
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,810
different variations like you've seen in the cart where there's like a footer where there's a button

111
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,640
in text.

112
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,730
Over here we have just like kind of the primary button.

113
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,610
You'll see it also in like product pages as well.

114
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,560
And once that happens, this is the exciting part.

115
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,110
We have like a confetti pop at the end, you know, just showering down on our users, like, woo hoo,

116
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,250
you place your order.

117
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,290
And what will happen here is just a continue button would pop up and it would just go back to the home

118
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:24,560
page.

119
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,110
But we want to kind of make it a little exciting right now.

120
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,120
A lot of applications don't make it exciting when you do something really well.

121
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,540
And this is kind of goes back to what we talked about with motion and animation.

122
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,150
You know, it's okay to create these screens and like reward your users in a way.

123
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,530
They kind of love that kind of stuff.

124
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:47,600
And we want to make sure that it's reflected in our designs, you know, gives our product a little

125
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,880
bit more personality, especially with like the bright colors, you know, just the animation of the

126
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,550
confetti flying down whenever you actually complete in order, you do something successful.

127
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,670
So I wanted to reflect that also in the designs over here.

128
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:07,340
And like I've noticed that, well, I have a confetti frame and I may actually have to make this into

129
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,720
like an animation with fake motion or another type of application, like principal or something like

130
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,040
that or after effects.

131
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,810
So I'll just create this and I may actually put this in there assets within our components in our design

132
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,610
system if I want to reuse this elsewhere because we do use this screen a couple of times.

133
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,200
Yeah, you'll just realize that.

134
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:30,320
Okay then this is some sort of reusable component or animation that we can kind of keep to the side

135
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,000
and reuse whenever we want to.

136
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,740
And again, like we have the footer cut in here, it's a little different this time.

137
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,390
It's still a fixed footer.

138
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:45,090
As you can tell, it's fixed position over here, but it's not a primary button and it doesn't have

139
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,460
like a thin horizontal rule that we see at the top of this, that little gray line.

140
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,510
So there are different variations to be had for those components.

141
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,970
And we'll probably go back and actually create more components based off of all the different variations

142
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,870
we come up with.

143
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,880
So it's okay to start creating high fidelity mock ups without components and stuff like that?

144
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,870
Totally fine.

145
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,890
That's actually normal.

146
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,910
When you start kind of adding components to your designs and stuff like that, you'll start to realize,

147
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,920
Hey, like this is starting to come together.

148
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,270
It's really neat.

149
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,490
Everything is like in its own place, but like I'm finding that I don't have enough flexibility, so

150
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,200
I have to go back and think about maybe some more typographic elements and stuff like that, or more

151
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,130
recipes that can help bring this all together a bit more.

152
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,640
And that's it for cart and checkout.
