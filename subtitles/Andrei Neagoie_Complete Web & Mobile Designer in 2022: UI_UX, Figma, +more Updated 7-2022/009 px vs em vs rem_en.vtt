00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.400
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.890
Before we finish off this section, I wanted to show you one last thing, and that is, up until this

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.490
point, we've used pixels quite a lot, but there's two other options that we can actually use.

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.630
So let's remove our box models for now.

5
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.880
And instead let's create some paragraphs.

6
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.150
So using our Lorem shorthand.

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.350
And let's close this off.

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.570
Perfect.

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.490
Let's say that we also wanted to have another paragraph that says Introduction.

10
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.090
Save and refresh.

11
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.760
And there you go.

12
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.110
We have our paragraph now.

13
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.860
If we wanted to add some class to this paragraph, we can just go in here and we don't need the box

14
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.240
model so we can delete that.

15
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:57.460
We can do something like P and let's do font size and for font size, I've shown you that we can do

16
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.860
percentages, but you can also do pixels.

17
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.500
So let's do 20 pixels, save and refresh and we have pixels.

18
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.900
So let's say I want lorem ipsum to be a little bit bigger.

19
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.730
Can use span.

20
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.070
Again, that's kind of like the diff tag that you've seen before.

21
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.320
It's just good for inline.

22
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.110
So again, this way we can add styles.

23
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:30.260
So I save that, go to styles and now we can select Span and we can do something like this.

24
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.690
We can do font size.

25
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.420
5 a.m..

26
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.530
I refresh.

27
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:47.380
So what it's saying is we want the font size to be equal to five times the containing element, which

28
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.060
is 20 pixels, because if you remember, we're inside of a P tag.

29
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.700
Just to show you that that is right.

30
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.750
If I do 100 pixels and save and refresh, it's the same.

31
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:12.170
So M is, is kind of nice because if I do something like two M and refresh, well if I change this to

32
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:21.170
ten pixels and I refresh, this always stays relative to the P one or the one I want to show you is

33
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.770
r m and that is the size in relation to the size of the root element.

34
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.330
What is the root element?

35
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.520
Well, it's the HTML.

36
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.610
So whatever the document is, it's always going to be twice as big.

37
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.700
So if I do five and refresh, that's great.

38
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.760
But if I change the font size over here to five.

39
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.120
That won't be affected at all.

40
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.510
Good job getting this far in the course.

41
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.430
I know I've thrown a lot of properties and selectors at you, but I promise in the next section we're

42
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.330
going to start building some real websites and have fun with all this knowledge.

43
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.470
Can't wait.

44
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.690
See you in the next one.

45
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.390
Bye bye.
