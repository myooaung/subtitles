00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.550
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.070
So I wanted to show you how I started to actually build out the profile page, because I think that's

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.930
a very interesting section as well.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.960
So when a user actually hits the home button, let's actually go to home right now.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.930
If they've hit this kind of profile picture, what will happen is they will go straight to the profile

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.470
page.

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.660
Now, on this profile page, there are several different options we have.

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.210
If there was a login to if they weren't logged in, then they would actually go to sign up or log in

9
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.710
depending on their scenario.

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.870
But if they actually were logged in, they would come to this page.

11
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.130
And what happens here is I've set up like a header that has like this kind of like overlay effect,

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.130
you know, kind of just giving a little more depth to the application.

13
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.000
Now over here we have like a CTA.

14
00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.450
Now, this header isn't one of the ones that we currently use within our components, and we can actually

15
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.220
bring one in if we wanted to.

16
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.900
So let's actually do that.

17
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.440
What we're going to do is we're just going to create a duplicate over here and I'm going to show you.

18
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.890
So I found out that while I was continuing to experiment and build out this application, I found out,

19
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.500
hey, this is an interesting component that I never necessarily thought about, but I think we could

20
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.030
actually recreate this.

21
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.480
Okay.

22
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.170
So I'm going to do is I'm going to remove that and I'm going to place this in here.

23
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.560
So we have our component.

24
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.700
Let's get that.

25
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.450
There we go.

26
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.050
Okay.

27
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.680
So what we're going to do here is we're going to actually fill some of this information in again.

28
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.560
And I've been thinking a lot about what the style of the back button is as well.

29
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.660
Let's change that instance.

30
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.080
So as you can tell, this is how I'm starting to use our design system.

31
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.570
This is it's you can tell us really powerful.

32
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.510
I don't have to like go in search for a new icons.

33
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.080
I know which ones I'm planning to use.

34
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.090
Most of the time.

35
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.340
I want to go back to my Layers panel so I can see what I'm selecting.

36
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.780
So I have a background right here.

37
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.729
And I was using yellow.

38
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.780
And there we go.

39
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.230
So now we have like a different yellow background.

40
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.940
You saw that.

41
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.920
I kind of had that effect going.

42
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.390
So you can still recreate that if we want it to.

43
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.840
So we can create a frame that encompasses all of this.

44
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.620
If I hold command and I stretch that frame, it's not going to stretch everything else.

45
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.980
So if you see I'm not holding command and I'm stretching that frame.

46
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.750
I'm going to do is I'm just going to bring it above there.

47
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.150
I'm actually going to.

48
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.690
Change that to 15.

49
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.080
I'm going to change this to 15 and I'm going to make sure this background is white.

50
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.130
So we still get the same type of effect that we had before.

51
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.430
Now, we may need to do a couple of different things.

52
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.060
That's going to be fine for now.

53
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.560
What we can do is we can also set the background color of this actual frame to yellow.

54
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.580
It's not going to make a difference because we have.

55
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.520
All these different options here.

56
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.120
And this is kind of acting as our background color right now.

57
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.430
So I'm going to just hide this border.

58
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.360
And there you go.

59
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.370
Like we have like another variation of the header.

60
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.440
I like this kind of yellow that we've been using.

61
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.600
So what I've decided thus far for the profile page is to have a profile picture.

62
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.670
They can edit my profile, which probably brings up a modal like yet again, like we didn't necessarily

63
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.520
think about all these different things and where they'll be placed.

64
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.770
And once we start kind of piecing these things together, even at the High Fidelity Stage, we're noticing

65
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.800
that we even forgot some stuff while we're sketching.

66
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.620
So I have like edit my profile over here.

67
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.610
I thought about interest.

68
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.010
What happens if I have no interest?

69
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.730
Looked like I could hypothetically create an account and not have selected anything.

70
00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.650
So over here, as you can tell, I have like the same type of CTA that we've seen before.

71
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.360
I'm going to go into my content.

72
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:13.370
I've noticed that, hey, maybe we should create like a button with a little plus sign there that makes

73
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.330
much more sense.

74
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.510
So add my interest would kind of push them to do that.

75
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.250
Even edit so I kind of have like the secondary to keeping just in line with the consistency.

76
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.050
I have things like my payment information, my address.

77
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.900
There's probably more cards that we could add here.

78
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.520
And for the user to get back, they would just select that back button.

79
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:43.440
Now there's another section right here that is showcasing what happens if the user is actually logged

80
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.250
in and they have other interests set.

81
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.510
So I haven't created like a frame to hold these yet, but this is like something where we may be using

82
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.220
this particular card over and over again and in this same manner.

83
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.140
So we may make like a frame.

84
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.170
What we can do here is we can create a column.

85
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.520
So I can just.

86
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.160
Just go and encompass it within a frame and call it left column.

87
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.680
And I can set that to auto layout and it's going to be like 16 and it's going to grow and shrink based

88
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.840
off of the sizes of the elements within.

89
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.960
I'm going to take this and I'm going to call this right column.

90
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.940
So now we have two frames.

91
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.610
I'm going to also create an auto layout for that.

92
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.160
And then we can actually take these together and encompass them in the frame and just call them color

93
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.800
cards to call them.

94
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.030
So now we've created another recipe over here that we can probably reuse.

95
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.830
As you can see now, this will change based off of if we add new elements or not.

96
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.690
So let's actually take that over here.

97
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.520
And what we're going to do is we're actually going to create an auto layout for that.

98
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.640
So let's push that to the top.

99
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.540
Whoops.

100
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.980
So we have our right column push to the top.

101
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:12.180
So if we add like, say, another text image and button component that we have here, it'll start pushing

102
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.870
all of the other components down.

103
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.840
Same with if I add another one over here.

104
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.530
So let's see what we can do here for this.

105
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.970
Okay.

106
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.410
I'm going to remove that and I'm just going to say something like vinyl.

107
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.650
We noticed that, you know, we need to just bring that lower.

108
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.370
We can change it to whatever color we want.

109
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.100
Probably do like maybe like an orange or something like that if we were to do the same over here, let's

110
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.170
go to the image selector that we have.

111
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.340
Area of glasses.

112
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.700
So you can kind of go back to the components and add new images if you want.

113
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.580
So I have like a MacBook and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to write productivity.

114
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:11.420
So right now, Figma is not in a place to handle like auto layouts really well.

115
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.120
Like the frames sometimes won't grow properly.

116
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.030
Same with just regular frames and components, but it will eventually get there.

117
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:25.820
What I'm going to do, actually, is I am going to maybe I will create like green if you see, like

118
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:31.850
I can like switches around, I can like if I use my arrow keys on the parent container, I can just

119
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.870
switch these around.

120
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.760
And that's the great thing about layout.

121
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.820
You'll notice that, wow, that spacing looks really messed up.

122
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.280
So I'm just going to have to manually do that.

123
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.910
It honestly beats like recreating the wheel over and over again.

124
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.330
And there you go.

125
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:49.340
Look, we kind of have our own, like, Pinterest style stacking of cards.

126
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.780
So that's what I've done here.

127
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.310
I've started creating this, and this is like, obviously this can be a recipe that we now use over

128
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.270
and over again.

129
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:04.160
I have like another recipe that I had created before, which is like having these little icon text containers.

130
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.730
So what I can do is I can encompass these in a frame and create another kind of auto layout or something

131
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:11.600
like that.

132
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:18.380
But that is my approach so far for profile, and that's how you can use components if you need them

133
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:18.950
here.

134
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.650
You can also actually like if you wanted to say.

135
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.980
Let's make a duplicate of this.

136
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.340
And you want to select this component.

137
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.440
So I've selected that.

138
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.770
I can go to my instance and I can see all the different related components to these color cards.

139
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.409
So there's text, image button, just text an image.

140
00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:44.410
So if I wanted just the text in the image, I can get that really easily, everything sized in really

141
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.100
nicely.

142
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.810
Same with this.

143
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.580
If I wanted say just what do we got here?

144
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.120
Text and button.

145
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.560
I can get that really easily.

146
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:05.240
I don't want this one because, you know, maybe these are growing related cards.

147
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.030
So I have text cards grow, I have color cards fixed.

148
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.130
I have a text button fixed version.

149
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.780
That we can create.

150
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:21.640
So that is how you can use instances to just really bring in more variety in your designs, but also

151
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.810
just to get the correct component that you need really quickly without having to copy and paste and

152
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.770
stuff like that.

153
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.760
So that is how we've built out the profile page thus far.
