00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.720
Hey, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.000
We're back in Figma.

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.600
And this is the same app that we just built.

4
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.800
But I want to give you a couple of tips so you can get started on the right foot when you're thinking

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.560
about actually creating a sitemap and building off of it.

6
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.240
I mean, I want you to think about only the site map at this time.

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.170
I mean, don't worry about crazy user flows that we've been thinking about.

8
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.290
Don't go off and try to do two things at once.

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.620
If you're working on the site map, don't start thinking about where to put things while you're thinking

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.630
about what things to put.

11
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.980
So focus on one thing at a time and you'll make way more thoughtful decisions.

12
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.300
So you can see that I start to think a little bit about this here, but I didn't get too into it.

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.980
Right now I just know that I'm just thinking about basic hierarchy, and that's going to help me when

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.870
I kind of revisit that with those user flows.

15
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.520
So don't try to do two things at once.

16
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.560
You're going to move much more slower.

17
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.510
So stay focused.

18
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.680
Also use your user flows to help build your sitemap.

19
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.740
I have several over here that we've been using and I honestly recommend that you use these.

20
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.750
I mean, you should be using them because they just influence that sitemap so much.

21
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.890
They indicate the types of pages you need and where they may fit within your structure.

22
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.470
They also reference your user goals as well.

23
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.970
So higher priority goals like buying products on our product should be prioritized accordingly.

24
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.930
And that's what we've done because of our user flows in our sketches.

25
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.600
The next step is tools.

26
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.500
You can honestly start with sketching like we did over here.

27
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.830
I mean, this really helped us just get started so quickly.

28
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.680
But once you start to revise, move it over to an online tool like we did with Figma, you can use any

29
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.980
tool.

30
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.240
There's a bunch of different tools out there.

31
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.530
I use Figma and I think like if you're going to use Figma, just keep it all in one ecosystem.

32
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.790
So it's so easy to share everything with your teammates and with clients, so move it over to an online

33
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.770
tool when you decide to start revising.

34
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.780
Another tip is colors.

35
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.960
I mean, we spruce this up and it actually looks pretty fantastic.

36
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.680
I always use colors in my site maps because they help distinguish between certain things.

37
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.640
They also make them less boring.

38
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.840
I mean, this is kind of borderline boring, but can you imagine if it was something like this where

39
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.720
there were no colors at all?

40
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.870
I mean, we can just.

41
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.970
Let's see how it would look if we had no colors.

42
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.250
I mean, nobody really wants to look at that.

43
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.280
Let's just get a sense of what this could look like.

44
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.140
So I mean, this is much worse.

45
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.940
So don't be afraid to use colors.

46
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.180
I mean, just because it's a segment doesn't mean you should shy away from that.

47
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.520
You can use colors to highlight things like screens that are visible to certain users like we've done.

48
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.870
Also makes your system much more easier to remember instead of just thinking about it as like black

49
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.520
and white set of cards.

50
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.570
It's super boring.

51
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.170
Like, Look at this.

52
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.030
It's harder to remember something like this as opposed to something like this.

53
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.280
We know that this is like a member only screen, same with these types of screens, and it'll be easier

54
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.960
for others that don't necessarily have the context like you do to remember your sight map.

55
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.980
And my last tip is you don't need to aim for perfection.

56
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.330
If you've noticed, when I've talked about sketching, when I've talked about user flows and now site

57
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.140
maps, I mean, once you have a good idea of what your product structure is going to look like, just

58
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.400
move on to your wireframes.

59
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.210
You don't need to finish this to actually start wire framing.

60
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.770
There is no rule about that and you shouldn't limit yourself like that.

61
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.700
We're working in the industry where we constantly have to create ideas and move quickly and it doesn't

62
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.360
make sense to spend days and days on site maps.

63
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.980
You could probably spend like not even half a day building one, and you can already be on your way

64
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.870
to sketching and building wireframes.

65
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.490
So just use them as a way to get that view from the treetops and then just get going.

66
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.310
And the thing is, your sitemap won't necessarily answer all the questions, but it'll give you a good

67
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.220
starting point, like I said, for wireframes, and it will bring light to new insights and changes

68
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.090
within your story map when you actually start while you're framing.

69
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.070
So you're never going to get it right on the first try.

70
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.390
And don't worry about that.

71
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.820
Just be lean and that's it.

72
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.190
Those are the tips that you should probably follow when you actually start wire framing.

73
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.510
It'll make your process go by much quicker, and it's less pressure on you as the designer to create

74
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.500
something like this, which could get you wireframe so quickly.

75
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.450
And that's it.

76
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.040
Fun wire for me.
