00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.780
Everyone.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.520
And welcome back.

3
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.640
So we're going to talk about a couple of different things.

4
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.620
Just to start off, we're going to talk about smaller interactions and we can even go into creating

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.930
interactions like off of your mobile screen.

6
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.390
So let's jump right in.

7
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.900
So right now we have the home page over here.

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.270
And if you look over at the bottom of the NAV, we have it linked to this wish list page.

9
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.340
And essentially that's just going to pop over here.

10
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.530
But I want to show the interaction of removing an item from your wish list.

11
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:40.390
So in this kind of wireframe, my intention would be that a user clicks on one of these little hearts.

12
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.720
Over here.

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.790
And once they click the heart, they it will get removed from the actual list.

14
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.670
I mean, we can probably clean this up a little bit more, but I want for the sake of this prototype,

15
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.840
I want that to happen.

16
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.130
I want them to click this heart and remove it directly from the list.

17
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.480
So I'll show you how to do that.

18
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.820
You'll get a sneak preview of something called Smart Enemy, which we'll get into later.

19
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.170
So the great thing with Figma is you can kind of make these small little animations and you probably

20
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.010
want to start doing them or exploring them a little bit more now.

21
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.700
So when I click on here, I'm just going to link directly to there.

22
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.810
Right now on tap, I just want to navigate to Wishlist.

23
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:31.780
Over here.

24
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.920
I really would only start fiddling with animations if you want to start doing some quick interaction

25
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.030
prototyping.

26
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.590
I wouldn't really dive right into it like right right now because that type of fidelity doesn't matter.

27
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.930
But I'll show you certain things that could really help your prototype if you just add a little bit

28
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.680
of motion to it because certain instant animations are a bit jarring for users.

29
00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.400
So yeah, I'm going to show you something that's really smooth and I'll show you what it looks like

30
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.030
without it.

31
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.110
So, okay, what we're going to do here is we're going to click on this button.

32
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.690
This top layer is going to be removed and the rest of the content is going to shift up.

33
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.660
So I'm just going to remove this.

34
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.580
This is called Group 20.

35
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.310
When we do actually start animation, the key is to make sure that your names are the same.

36
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.900
So this is named group 20.

37
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.270
We'll call this remove.

38
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.480
So it's not so arbitrary.

39
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.580
And we'll call this one remove as well.

40
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.350
Perfect.

41
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.040
So I know that I need to just delete this.

42
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.300
You can do whatever you want with it.

43
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.220
You can spin it around, you can rotate it.

44
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.630
So let's just keep up there.

45
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.340
So we just have a point of reference.

46
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.380
So I'm going to just select the.

47
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.970
Let's go into our design.

48
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.740
Perfect.

49
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.880
So we're just going to move that up and to.

50
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.630
Whoops.

51
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.890
Okay.

52
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.700
Let's move up.

53
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.050
That's good.

54
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.240
We're going to get removed and we're just going to delete it.

55
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.380
Perfect.

56
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.570
We're going to shift this frame up.

57
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.740
You'll notice that the navigation actually moves with it, and that's based off of constraints.

58
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.770
So this is kind of the constraints are set to bottom.

59
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.390
So whenever I shift the entire frame that it's within, it's going to kind of attach itself to the bottom.

60
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.240
If I had it set to the top, you'll see what happens here.

61
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.210
It's just going to stay put.

62
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.440
So let's just keep that to the bottom and let's go right into this animation.

63
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.740
Let's just make sure we have everything set up perfectly.

64
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.780
So when I do, click here.

65
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.670
Let's make that an instant.

66
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.900
Animation.

67
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.100
Let's take a look.

68
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.350
So let's go over here.

69
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.640
See, even that is jarring in its its own way.

70
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.720
When you click the wish list, maybe we should have something like just slide in.

71
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.250
You know, at this stage.

72
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.770
I mean, if you have the time, it makes it look a little nicer.

73
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.360
It makes it less jarring.

74
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.300
So here it is.

75
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.830
My wishlist, if I click it, it just goes away really quickly.

76
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.020
Okay, let's go back.

77
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.550
That is weird.

78
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.930
So what we're going to do is we are just going to make sure that all our groups are product names.

79
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.790
I am not sure why that.

80
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.350
Okay.

81
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.520
And we're actually just going to.

82
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.420
Copy that again.

83
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.150
And we're going to make that same animation.

84
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.240
So we're going to prototype it on tap.

85
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.520
Navigate to wish list.

86
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.380
Och.

87
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.080
And we're going to make this a smart anime.

88
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.620
And we're just going to leave that for now because we're definitely going to get into this at a later

89
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.860
date.

90
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.420
But I just want to give you a little bit of a sneak preview of the different types of things you can

91
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.550
do, because, you know, at this stage, you do want to start prototyping some animations a bit.

92
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.500
You want to start thinking about how things move on your screen just because I mean, like I said,

93
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.890
you saw that instant animation.

94
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.470
It was just kind of jarring.

95
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.860
So let's go back to wish list and we're just going to do this and that's a little bit better.

96
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:31.300
So you'll notice that if you just click, it goes away and the items move up.

97
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.080
Now, in the actual case of a user interacting with that little element, I would probably have like

98
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.200
a warning come up that says, Are you sure you want to delete this?

99
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.180
Or maybe if we don't have a warning that prevents them from doing that right away or a confirmation

100
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.770
we have maybe like a little toast or a banner that says, do you want to undo that?

101
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.480
So let's actually prototype that.

102
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:59.770
So we're going to you notice how like we have similar screens repeated over and over again.

103
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.330
Well.

104
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.890
That really kind of.

105
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.530
Is the point.

106
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.750
I mean, you're trying to create these little interactions that are actually quite complex.

107
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.910
There's so many moving pieces that we don't necessarily take into account.

108
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.400
So let's just create that as a point of reference.

109
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.540
And what we can do is.

110
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.060
Let's just create a little toast.

111
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.010
We can just have it at the bottom, which would be pretty cool.

112
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.320
Let's just set the fill to white.

113
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.610
We can even give it a little shadow, so we have a little bit more.

114
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.040
You know, just contrast.

115
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.200
We are going to fix this positioning to the bottom.

116
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.130
Let's just position it.

117
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.050
Above the nav bar.

118
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.370
Perfect.

119
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.120
We can just give this like.

120
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.610
A little bit of a border radius and.

121
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.290
Let's just fix that shadow because it's a really hard shadow.

122
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.930
So that's fine.

123
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.710
We can give the blur like a 20.

124
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.020
We bring down the opacity on that?

125
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.310
I think that's totally cool.

126
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.000
For now.

127
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.920
Let's just drop some text in there.

128
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.140
Hey.

129
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.870
Are you sure you want to remove that?

130
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:30.190
So, I mean, like, even when you write copy, you should actually think about it from the user's experience.

131
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.620
Don't just fill everything with, like, lorem ipsum.

132
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.010
You have to start thinking about this kind of stuff really early.

133
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.380
So that's a little bit big.

134
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.800
We can actually just bump that down a bit, get regular.

135
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.450
Okay.

136
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:51.240
And we can probably have like some more text on the side here that just says Undo.

137
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:59.420
And let's just underline it to make it look like it's actually clickable and make it bold.

138
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.610
Okay.

139
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:05.540
Cool.

140
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.950
Right alignment.

141
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.660
I like.

142
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.320
Very nice.

143
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.630
Okay.

144
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:20.660
Okay.

145
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.710
So it's.

146
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.950
Very.

147
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.660
Very.

148
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.670
Very good.

149
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.110
It is definitely easy to see and easy to tap.

150
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:41.230
And if the user does top that, we need to think about them going all the way back here.

151
00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:48.810
And we're going to smart animate again because what that will do is it will essentially bring that product

152
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.620
back in the same way it was removed, or at least it should.

153
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.110
So after delay.

154
00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.400
What's going to do after delay.

155
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.150
So after that happens, 800 milliseconds.

156
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:07.330
Let's actually go to here and let's see what happens.

157
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.610
So actually, let's see how this works out.

158
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.700
Because there's a couple of ways we can do this.

159
00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.800
So let's start again.

160
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.510
We're going to remove this.

161
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.300
Oh, nice.

162
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.790
Let's take a look.

163
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.010
So we kind of have that toast as an overlay.

164
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.980
So like, if a user clicks out of it, I mean, we can hide it.

165
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.430
But I think it's nice this way because it's kind of like right in the user's face.

166
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.300
This is a pretty big thing, especially if they remove something from a list that they created.

167
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.540
You know, people can easily do that sometimes.

168
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.530
Maybe we hide this within like some sort of like menu button like this, like that.

169
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.220
Delete.

170
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.440
But this is really cool.

171
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.070
So.

172
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.620
It removes.

173
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.310
And then after the delay, this pops up and it goes back.

174
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.060
Cool.

175
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.670
So that's how you create some pretty small micro interactions and you know, not using much of your

176
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.170
time to create something like that.

177
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.500
But you can easily illustrate like what you're trying to get across.

178
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.730
So we have a little toast that pops up and it comes back perfectly.

179
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.320
So go out there.

180
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.400
I mean, have some fun.

181
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.750
Think about those little interactions like let's go back together and I can show you a couple that I'm

182
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.010
already thinking about.

183
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:25.520
So maybe when they click this product, you know, maybe the image expands to this section and it goes

184
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.720
straight to the home page.

185
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.580
Like you can already start kind of like prototyping that animation if you want, I'm going to teach

186
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.080
you how to do something like that.

187
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:39.650
When we get back into actually discussing motion and micro interactions, there's a couple of little

188
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:45.350
things like what happens when you click plus and minus, like it doesn't necessarily need to be an animation

189
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.530
or anything, but I just need to know like a feedback change.

190
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.380
So start thinking about these little things like that.

191
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.930
Maybe like if you remove everything from your cart, does the notification go away or do you even have

192
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:57.920
the notification?

193
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.000
So those are all small little micro interactions that you can start thinking about.

194
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:08.120
So that's it for the absolute prototyping basics and Figma like these are the absolute basics that you'll

195
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.000
need to know at least to just prototype quickly.

196
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:16.430
And yeah, you can just go out there really fast and put together a quick prototype like we did here

197
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:21.890
in terms of like an interaction or if you really wanted to, you can link together the NAV to just show

198
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.700
people just the entire overview of the application.

199
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.660
I wouldn't necessarily do that and like have all these built in.

200
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:36.470
You could, but it would be like a massive file that it would be so easy to kind of get lost in.

201
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:41.990
So take it easy, go out there, validate the things that you want to validate, like the small interactions

202
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:49.070
or just like certain user flows and get that feedback that you definitely need to just iterate on your

203
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:49.760
product.
