00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,770
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,290
We're going to be talking about a topic that a lot of people try to avoid, and that's feedback.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,590
Now, I feel like a lot of designers avoid feedback.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,420
There are reasons why it could be that they're scared to have their work critiqued.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:23,320
Possibly they don't know how to actually approach the situation with clients or team members.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,410
So I'm going to show you why it's so useful to get feedback and then we'll get into how you can actually

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,910
get good feedback.

8
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,140
So let's jump right in.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,090
So let's talk about receiving feedback.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,500
Feedback can be a frustrating part of every project.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,660
It may feel like a battle with clients.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,070
You know, with clients you may feel like you're coming to a compromised outcome when it should feel

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,390
like an alliance of ideas that, you know, elevates that design solution.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,180
Design critiques are full of little subtleties, just like any other conversation.

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,030
And it can turn painful quick when you can't define a process or if egos get in the way.

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,090
You know, sometimes we go out and try to get feedback and we don't necessarily let people know the

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,540
proper context of the feedback or what stage of the designs we're in.

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,450
And people may just be throwing out irrelevant feedback towards us and we don't know how to actually

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,360
use that to move forward in the design process.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,220
So if it's so hard, why is it so important?

21
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,770
Well, that's because you're doing it wrong.

22
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,940
And we're going to get into that next.

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,780
But it really helps you distance yourself from your designs.

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,850
You know, sometimes as a designer, you get so connected to your work that that may seem kind of dramatic

25
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,650
and over the top, but it's true.

26
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,290
That may lead you to start making some choices that don't necessarily benefit your users.

27
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,130
And it happens.

28
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,090
It really does.

29
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,540
Feedback is a nice reminder that design is a craft.

30
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,550
Feedback can also help you take a step back and see your designs from a different perspective.

31
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,560
Sometimes we get a little tunnel vision.

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,450
It's so easy to get stuck in a silo working at the same designs over and over again.

33
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,490
I mean, we've all been there and feedback really fixes that mindset and helps us improve.

34
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,190
It also really helps you grow.

35
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,740
You're going to inevitably work with other designers, and those designers may have different opinions,

36
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,140
skill levels and experiences.

37
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,770
Listening to their opinions and feedback opens up your mind to new points of view and urges you to try

38
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,200
new things that you may not have tried anyways.

39
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,960
Feedback gives you new insight and approaches to design, and you will ultimately improve because of

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,320
it.

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,270
Whether that be because of a team, like I mentioned before, in terms of people coming together to

42
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:44,090
share their experiences or look at things from different perspectives or working with clients and maybe

43
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,210
understanding a problem just a little bit better.

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,840
So how do we get good feedback?

45
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,390
There are two types of feedback that have a significant impact on your design.

46
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,820
The first one is constructive.

47
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,880
Now this will help you move the design forward.

48
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,930
It can also uncover clues to answering those open questions you may have.

49
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:12,500
It can also identify new blockers for your ideas, success, and can add momentum towards a direction.

50
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,340
Both negative and positive feedback can be constructive.

51
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:22,280
So when I say that, I mean that your designs may not resonate with the user base or your designs may

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,160
not actually solve the problem that you should be solving.

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,080
And you may get negative feedback.

54
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,760
But that feedback is still good because it's going to push you in a new direction that you need to go

55
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,120
in.

56
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,840
The second type is destructive.

57
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,960
Now, this will cloud the way your design moves forward.

58
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:45,190
Your design can be misled by asking unrelated questions or wasting people's time by derailing discussions.

59
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,750
It can be really difficult to understand what matters because there is just so much noise.

60
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,530
This really, really happens a lot.

61
00:03:53,950 --> 00:04:00,760
I feel like, especially with clients, a lot of design critiques or feedback meetings, they often

62
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,190
get derailed because there are so many irrelevant things that are popping up that aren't really relevant

63
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,420
to the types of problems you're trying to solve or your designs in general.

64
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,060
The goal is to get your group to give you constructive feedback.

65
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,149
And I'm going to show you how to do it in the next video.
