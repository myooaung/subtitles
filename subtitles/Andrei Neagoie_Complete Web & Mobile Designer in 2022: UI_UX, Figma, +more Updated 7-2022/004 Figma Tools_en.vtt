00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.890
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.400
So we kind of went over our dashboard a bit.

3
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.570
Now we're going to actually get into a file.

4
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:13.860
So on my test project here, all you need to do to create a new file is click this little plus button.

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.590
So in a click that plus button and I'm just going to click a blank canvas.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.980
You have different templates that you can use here, which are really great if you need to.

7
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.280
But let's just create a quick one now.

8
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.160
Let's go over what we have here.

9
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.290
So this is what your blank canvas looks like.

10
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.730
We went over a little bit about this kind of like middle bar over here.

11
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.370
You can show your version history, you can export this, you can duplicate it, you can rename it.

12
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.510
So I'm going to rename this to my test file.

13
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.610
Perfect.

14
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.650
You can delete this and you can move it to any other project.

15
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.020
Now, another important thing is in this little menu over here, getting back to your dashboard is really

16
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.630
easy just by clicking that, but you can also access any other thing here, like files.

17
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.550
You can save it if you want to.

18
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.150
You can export it.

19
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.400
You can save it as an actual figma file if you don't want to keep it in the cloud.

20
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.930
I never really usually do that.

21
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.440
I usually always keep it in the cloud and just send links to people.

22
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.390
But this is where you would do that.

23
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.360
You have your edit options here, your view options, object options, all these different options that

24
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.560
you can access.

25
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.230
You can even get the desktop app if you really want to.

26
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.060
But for the ease of use right now I'm just showing you how to use it within your browser.

27
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.360
That's why I really love Figma.

28
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.250
You can use it in your browser as well.

29
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.610
So the barrier to entry is very, very small.

30
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.400
So let's get right into this.

31
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.390
So we have all our different tools here.

32
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.920
We have our MOVE tool over here or scale tool.

33
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.280
We have our frame tool and your frame is essentially kind of like your artboard in sketch.

34
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.880
I can make a big frame like that.

35
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.470
Or if I select the frame tool, you'll see this is the shortcut, which is F.

36
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.560
So if I select F, which I just did, you can see all the different things that you can do here.

37
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.740
If I wanted a phone frame, I have options.

38
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.140
I'm going to go to desktop and I'm just going to select let's select a MacBook Pro.

39
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.490
So there you go.

40
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.960
You have your frame.

41
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.390
You also have slicing if you want to use slicing.

42
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.950
We won't be using that in this whole project.

43
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.250
And these are your shape tools.

44
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.700
These are your rectangles, your lines, your arrows, ellipses.

45
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.630
You have your polygon star.

46
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.190
You can even place an image.

47
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.300
And once again, they conveniently show you all the shortcuts.

48
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.750
So if I want to place a rectangle, I can select that or I can select ah.

49
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.770
If I wanted to make a circle, I select a circle and I can put that in if I wanted to keep the proportions

50
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.350
the same and make this an actual circle and not like an oval, I will hold down shift.

51
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.640
And I can scale that any which way I want.

52
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.880
Same with Rectangle.

53
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.830
So if I select R to select a rectangle tool, I can place that.

54
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.970
And if I hold shift, I can make a square really easy stuff.

55
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.080
Next we have our pen tool and our pencil tool.

56
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.890
Pen tools really great for making icons.

57
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.230
All you need to do is just click and you can make anything that you want.

58
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.690
You can make any shape.

59
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.160
You can edit that sheet by pressing that point.

60
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.070
You can even add a fill and we're going to get into that later.

61
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.360
But you can easily make vectors with that pen tool.

62
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.670
And next we have our text tool and all you need to do is press TW for textile.

63
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.250
So we have our text selected and you can either create a big box.

64
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.910
I'm on Mac so I press command z to go back.

65
00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.019
But.

66
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:20.860
Let's do that again.

67
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.000
So we've got our text tool.

68
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.100
You can just click and start typing.

69
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.590
And there we go.

70
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.110
You can just keep on going.

71
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:41.210
Press enter to go to a new line command a on Mac to select all and backspace and the text layer disappears.

72
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.780
Next.

73
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.330
We have our hands full and we have comments.

74
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.990
So this will get into a little bit later.

75
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.020
But comments, all you need to do to leave a comment.

76
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.280
See, this is a different state.

77
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.810
Now, if you notice the right has changed, you click and you can add a comment.

78
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.890
And quick comment.

79
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.560
And there you go.

80
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.910
This is a great way to collaborate with others.

81
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.820
So I'm going to delete this comment by just clicking on it and clicking delete comment.

82
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.760
And if I click v v is the shortcut to the move tool.

83
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.450
So if I click v, I will go back to the MOVE Tool.

84
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.410
So these are your basic tools for just getting things set up within Figma.

85
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.540
And using like just your basic shapes, your frames, using the pen tool, your text tool, that's all

86
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.640
you're really going to need to get going.

87
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.600
So I'm going to select all these, delete this, and we're going to move on.
