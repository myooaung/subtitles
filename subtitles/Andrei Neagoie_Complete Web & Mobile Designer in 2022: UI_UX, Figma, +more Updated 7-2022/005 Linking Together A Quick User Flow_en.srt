1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,260
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,180
So we're going to create a couple of little quick prototypes here.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,240
And this is what I usually do when I'm like just getting out of wireframe or I've wireframe the new

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,100
interaction or new flow.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,860
I essentially just kind of jump right into figma with my wireframes and I just link some quick things

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,280
together.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,220
Sometimes I don't necessarily link together a massive prototype unless I'm trying to test end to end

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:25,910
usability.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,670
But what I usually do is like link together some flows that make sense.

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:40,520
So what we're going to do is we're going to link together a search experience and then we'll link together

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,710
just some navigation pieces.

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:48,080
So we have some places to go and we'll kind of use some of the things we learned, like with scrolling

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,520
and stuff like that.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,000
So let's jump right in.

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,330
What we're going to start with is our little search.

16
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:02,540
So what we're going to do is we're just going to click prototype and we are going to do on tap.

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,560
So when a user taps that, we are going to navigate.

18
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,400
To.

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,090
So no scrolling behavior yet.

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,520
We're going to navigate to search.

21
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,230
Let's call this one search type ahead.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,210
Okay.

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,100
And we're actually going to take this out of here.

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,170
That's going to be its own frame.

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:33,100
And you know, what we're going to do here is we're just going to go on tap.

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,370
We're going to go navigate to home.

27
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,470
Where is home?

28
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,540
Boom.

29
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,390
Perfect.

30
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,420
And on delay.

31
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,860
So I just want to kind of link together what this search experience could look like.

32
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,700
And this is what I would do if I were working on this client project.

33
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,790
I urge you to kind of get your wireframes.

34
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:00,640
You can use these wireframes and your resources and you can actually design with me and prototype with

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,060
me.

36
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,100
Okay.

37
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,760
So after delay, 800 milliseconds, I think that's fine.

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:14,500
We're going to open the overlay and that overlay is going to be this and that's going to come from the

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,360
it's going to be locked to the bottom center.

40
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,420
You can click outside and close it and the animation you can have it as move in.

41
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,920
We can get into animations in a later lesson when we cover micro interactions and motion and stuff like

42
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,280
that.

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,740
That is going to be some really cool stuff and I'll show you what you can do.

44
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,960
A Figma right now I don't think it's necessarily needed, but it can help stimulate certain things like

45
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,630
quick move ins and move outs and all that kind of stuff.

46
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:45,190
In terms of like how things behave on the screen, you can start thinking about that and you should

47
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,200
definitely start thinking about that kind of stuff.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,590
So we're going to have that come up and the behavior on here is OC.

49
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,490
So if I search, I want this to come up again.

50
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,530
So it's going to actually behave like an overlay.

51
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,330
You'll notice that Figma already does the work for you, which is amazing.

52
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,190
So move in OC perfect.

53
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:15,700
And what we'll do here is if I do tap on here, I want to actually.

54
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,340
Have this come in.

55
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,110
Yeah, that's fine.

56
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,920
No, actually, I want this to be instant.

57
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:29,900
Yeah.

58
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,430
I think that's cool.

59
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,040
This will link back.

60
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:42,320
On top navigate to and it's going to navigate to our home screen perfect.

61
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,630
And if I click on this, actually, you know what?

62
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,980
Let's make a frame.

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,870
So I have those as a frame, so I'll be one large tappable area and we're going to actually go to our

64
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,270
search results and I'll be instant as well.

65
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,550
This is going to go back.

66
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,430
To our home.

67
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,860
As well.

68
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,350
Remember, this is not changing at all.

69
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,710
The only thing that's changing is the content within.

70
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,530
So we kind of have to simulate that behavior a bit.

71
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,970
Okay.

72
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,640
So this is navigating back to home.

73
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,250
Perfect.

74
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,340
If we do want to search, I do want to go back to here.

75
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,910
That looks good.

76
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,810
Okay.

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,780
I think that's good.

78
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,410
Let's take a look at what it looks like.

79
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,550
So as you can see, like once you're done linking together some things.

80
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,550
Oops.

81
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,150
This should go to home.

82
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,140
Perfect.

83
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,070
And.

84
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,290
Yeah.

85
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,710
Okay.

86
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,870
So you'll notice that once we kind of link together some things, it gets really messy really quickly.

87
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,270
And you can imagine on a larger prototype, it'll just be like complete chaos.

88
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,770
It really depends on what your goal is.

89
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,660
I feel like the main use for prototyping is to validate your assumptions.

90
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,190
Know we use them with users, get good feedback from clients.

91
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,110
You don't necessarily need to make like an end to end prototype from beginning to end of all your designs,

92
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,780
especially if you have a large product that it's kind of crazy.

93
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,220
So what I would do is I would kind of break it into pieces, maybe different flows that you want to

94
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,870
highlight, things that aren't maybe as clear, like certain interactions, like maybe how this could

95
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:31,410
play out, especially when you get to the high fidelity stage you may want to consider like actually.

96
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,220
You know, creating more like in-depth animations in motion.

97
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,700
So it's totally up to you and what your workflow may be.

98
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,890
But I would try to avoid creating like a crazy, huge prototype.

99
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,090
I mean, there's not many use cases for it.

100
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,700
The big one would be to show your developers, but if you're working really closely with them throughout

101
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,730
your entire product, like every day in terms of like your sprints or if you're just working from like

102
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:05,960
the beginning of like kick off with the development team all the way to like the end of handoff, you're

103
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,010
essentially they know what's going on and you should be really communicating all these little things.

104
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,350
They shouldn't need to wait all the way to the end of the design process to get like a fully animated

105
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,550
prototype, even though that is pretty cool, I'm not going to lie.

106
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,850
So let's take a look at what this looks like.

107
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,020
We're going to press play.

108
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,220
Whoops.

109
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:31,940
I am still in comment mode over here, so we're just going to remove that so we can see search.

110
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,120
So going to click on search and there's my keyboard.

111
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,620
I'm actually in Click Search again.

112
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,680
So I moved in from the right so we can go back and fix that.

113
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,800
So let's just.

114
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,900
I want that to come in from the bottom.

115
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,330
So if we just test that.

116
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,710
Cool.

117
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,370
I love it.

118
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,360
And if we do that, we have our results.

119
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,730
Perfect.

120
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,480
I love it.

121
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,550
And then we can go back.

122
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,160
If we want.

123
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,410
Or we can, actually.

124
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,000
I think we're missing something really cool here.

125
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,620
Yeah.

126
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,500
So you should be able to if we think through the flow of this, if I want to search again, I should

127
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,490
be able to search again.

128
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,370
So let's actually do that.

129
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,800
We're going to on tap.

130
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,290
We are going to actually if we link right there, they'll open the overlay for us again.

131
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,730
Perfect.

132
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,890
And.

133
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,890
Okay, so if I do want to search.

134
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,100
Um.

135
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,530
Actually, I feel like this one should actually go here.

136
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,870
Okay, so let's get going.

137
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,890
Let's see what it looks like.

138
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,330
Search.

139
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,610
Love it.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,590
Okay.

141
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,910
And I'm going to click that.

142
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,980
So that animation is a little wonky.

143
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,800
So if I go back and I click that, it should just be instantaneous.

144
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:14,070
So if I click search, actually, I would probably want to come here, maybe.

145
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,550
Okay.

146
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,130
So I mean, it's not going to be perfect.

147
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,080
You may want to certain things to happen all the time or certain overlays to happen all the time.

148
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,910
And that's where you kind of just have to have a really good discussion with your developers.

149
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,410
And there we go.

150
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,450
We kind of have like a little product flow.

151
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,190
What we can do is we can clean this up, like if we do want to have a navigation sticky to the bottom.

152
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,169
So we'll remember to fix that positioning.

153
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,840
We can also fix this positioning if we want.

154
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,940
We're going to actually create a frame.

155
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,960
Let's do this.

156
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,660
Perfect.

157
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:53,870
And we're going to fill that with whites and we're just going to call this header.

158
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,770
Okay.

159
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,950
Boom, boom, boom.

160
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,840
This.

161
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,110
Line 18.

162
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,720
Okay.

163
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,260
Perfect.

164
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,890
So that's in there as well.

165
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,970
And we can actually fix this to the top so we can perfect.

166
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,260
We can fix that to the top.

167
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,670
And I'll show you what that looks like.

168
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,890
So let's go through that search flow.

169
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,350
Perfect.

170
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,670
But it turns.

171
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,090
If I were to scroll, I would see that the content goes behind both the header and the footer.

172
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,070
So there we go.

173
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,000
We have our little own search prototype.

174
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,950
If you want to go back, we can go back to the home page.

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,190
I mean, this is not perfect by any means, but so we can see that we have our keyboard here.

176
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,010
Keyboard is a little weird and wonky, but that's totally cool and we can just click a result and it'll

177
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,600
bring us to results page.

178
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,710
Perfect.

179
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,030
So that's an easy way to create a very quick flow.

180
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,470
In terms of different types of like search interactions that we have.

181
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,600
Actually, we can extend this some more.

182
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,050
So if we do click that I would love this to come in.

183
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,500
This could be like navigate too.

184
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,340
It could be instant.

185
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,330
Doesn't matter.

186
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,210
We could just on top.

187
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,130
We can go back.

188
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,340
I want this to be sticky.

189
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,090
Perfect.

190
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,140
We can even make this sticky.

191
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,730
But it's all right for now.

192
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,380
Let's take a look at that one more time.

193
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,210
There we go.

194
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,480
We've got our filters.

195
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,140
Boom.

196
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:43,630
And I would have this be dynamic based off of the different types of filters so you can even go in and

197
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,040
make a smaller prototype.

198
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,740
This can update based off of that prototype, which is really cool, and that's it.

199
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,580
That's how you create a quick prototype within Figma just using a quick flow.

200
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,840
And in the next video we're just going to kind of get a little bit more in-depth in terms of like different

201
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,100
types of interactions.
