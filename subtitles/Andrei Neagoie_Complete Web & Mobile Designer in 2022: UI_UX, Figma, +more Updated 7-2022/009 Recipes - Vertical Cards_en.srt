1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,980
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,939
So what I want to talk about next is something called recipes.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,980
Now I call them recipes.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,010
People call them a bunch of different things.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,590
They could just be like a collection of components to make, like, different types of pieces that you

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,490
can put together.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,630
What I've done here is I'm going to actually create different variations of the ways like our vertical

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,700
product cards would look within our app.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,680
So one way to do that is to take your component.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,980
I have just a default large product card here.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,180
You'll see that over here.

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,140
Large default.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,290
And I'm going to take my frame tool.

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,740
I have it sorted already and I'm going to go to phone.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,380
And there we go.

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:46,890
So.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,670
This is the size the majority of our designs are based off of.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,680
I'm actually going to select one of our layout grids, just a standard column.

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,820
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take that large default card.

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,110
And as you can tell, it perfectly sits on that grid.

21
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,640
And then I'm going to take another one because the way I want to use this card is I want it to be a

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,410
swiped container.

23
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,830
So I'm going to actually.

24
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,900
Take these and I'm going to press command option G to put them in a frame.

25
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,750
And in that frame, I'm just going to call this large swipe container.

26
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,550
You can call whatever you want.

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,060
Now, I'm going to set this to auto.

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,020
Because it's just easier for now, at least.

29
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,760
And I'll show you why.

30
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,240
So I'm spacing out by 16 pixels.

31
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,820
I'm going to take my next.

32
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,320
Product and a command C command V You'll notice that.

33
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,680
I am creating a bunch.

34
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,800
So maybe there's like one, two.

35
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,860
I think there's five here.

36
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,310
Perfect.

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,680
So I can do that now.

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,570
I know that they're all spaced perfectly.

39
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,750
And I am going to actually remove that auto layout.

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,250
Now they're just a regular frame.

41
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,590
And if I hold command, well, I shrink this frame.

42
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,390
It's not going to affect anything.

43
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,690
And when I want to do is shrink it to the width of the iPhone frame that I have here.

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,740
So there you go.

45
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,410
Everything is going to be clipped.

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,980
And I'm creating just a nice, easy way for us to have a swappable container.

47
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,140
Now, if I were to press command G, this is what it would look like.

48
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,600
Actually, I think it's fine if I just clip it like that.

49
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,860
So this is what it's going to look like.

50
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,120
It's you don't need to make a component.

51
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:03,020
This is more so for people within your design team to actually have like a point of reference on how

52
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,820
certain components are used.

53
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:12,780
You can just keep these in one area like I'm going to do here, and you can easily just copy and paste

54
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,060
that while you have your design system open.

55
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,570
They won't appear in your assets tab because it isn't a component.

56
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,320
I mean, we can go ahead and create a component for this, but I wouldn't.

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,950
This way you can keep it up to the way you want to do it.

58
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,910
Like you can just say that I want this one to be an instance of large staff.

59
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,710
Pick and sell this one.

60
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,480
I want it to be large scale.

61
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,240
So I mean, it gives you a lot of flexibility in that aspect.

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,970
And if I want to actually prototype something like this.

63
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's see if it's going to automatically bring it yet.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,420
There we go.

65
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:49,520
So if I want to prototype that, I have it there and just what I'm going to do and click prototype and

66
00:03:49,530 --> 00:04:00,060
click horizontal scrolling on that, go back and now I have a beautiful swipe able container and that's

67
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,160
how I would use the large product card.

68
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,840
So really nice.

69
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,840
So that's one recipe that I would definitely make and I'm going to do it here is I'm going to drag that.

70
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,350
Actually, that's command C.

71
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,220
I'm clicking into my recipe here, so it'll be right there.

72
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,560
And over here the recipe will.

73
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,260
I'm going to go on my design.

74
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,800
I'm going to go clip content.

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,760
So it's going to automatically clip it for me, just like how when we create like an iPhone frame or

76
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,350
mobile frame or Android frame, it doesn't matter that we were setting that to clip as well.

77
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,030
So it's going to hide it automatically.

78
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,890
So let's remove this.

79
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,530
Perfect.

80
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,550
Now.

81
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,880
We can also create another version where let's create another thing.

82
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,770
If you notice, I'm very keen on actually making sure that everything in my system looks exactly the

83
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,580
same.

84
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,530
And just adjust that spacing between those frames like that manually.

85
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,270
What I'm going to do here is I'm actually going to go into my asset step.

86
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,230
I am going to find my card here.

87
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,190
So vertical cards.

88
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,100
I want a small default card for now.

89
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,750
So there it is.

90
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,190
Let's go back to our Layers tab and there we go.

91
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:36,500
So when I think about categories and how cards should be filled out, we can go ahead and turn on our

92
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,220
grid again.

93
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:45,230
But there may be other aspects of like this container that we aren't thinking about.

94
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:54,340
We may not have been thinking about aspects here that we really needed, like maybe like a title.

95
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,840
These are automatically set up to be.

96
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,180
Like a 50% card.

97
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,480
But are here we go.

98
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,810
We have our 50% card.

99
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:12,800
And even in our recipe, like I said, a recipe isn't necessarily meant to be like a component on its

100
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:12,980
own.

101
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,100
It's meant to also use like components and bring them all together.

102
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,040
So I may have like a title or you can adjust that.

103
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,650
And we can set it to only be.

104
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:39,740
That long, we can have another thing that says See more.

105
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,990
Now I'm just going right now I'm just going off the top of my head.

106
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,290
Give it interaction, maybe link.

107
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,850
16 pixels.

108
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,590
And then we can change the colour to whatever we want.

109
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,910
And in this instance, maybe we choose something like a gray.

110
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,620
That's fine.

111
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,860
So this is obviously link.

112
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,130
No, it's going to be a heading so heading in 20 pixels.

113
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,080
Great.

114
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,090
And this.

115
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,990
It can be confined to that side and it's going to be affected by the right.

116
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,840
This is going to be affected by the left.

117
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,790
And then we can take both of these and we can, like align them in any which way we like.

118
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,580
So I'll just align them based off of their baseline.

119
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,560
There we go.

120
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,760
And there you go.

121
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,300
So we have now we're starting to see like something come together here.

122
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm going to actually go ahead and, you know, maybe I'll swap this out for something that says like

123
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,680
a small cell one can be.

124
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,400
Small staff pick.

125
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,700
Oh no, that's a large stop.

126
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,480
Wrong one, small staff pick.

127
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,280
And then what I would do here is I would actually create another frame.

128
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,510
So option command g.

129
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,840
I'll call this left column.

130
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,690
And I'm going to actually create an auto.

131
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,520
And I want that spacing always to be 16 pixels.

132
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,490
So even if I write like 13 inch MacBook.

133
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:36,780
Pro, you'll notice that we start to see these different things actually expand.

134
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:44,400
So if I'm going to make sure that this is in line with that and that will make that column expand,

135
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,400
and I would do the exact same thing for this right column.

136
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,210
So I'm going to just duplicate that because I've already made the frame and I'm just going to rename

137
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,100
it to Right column and there we go.

138
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,760
Like now we can start creating like a larger list of items.

139
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,440
Maybe we just keep it to four and we show them a larger list once they click to see more just to save

140
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,250
real estate.

141
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:13,080
But that is one thing we can do, and I'm just going to actually collect this.

142
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,530
You can even, like, make another frame and just call these products.

143
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:31,310
And if we can create another frame around these and call it text and then create a larger frame and

144
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,900
call this category list.

145
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,850
And there you have it.

146
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,270
You have just a very quick way.

147
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,900
So let's just command C, let's go in there, take that container out.

148
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,310
And now we have another recipe.

149
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,490
And I can just like either copy this.

150
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,720
It's just easily made.

151
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,880
It's already has all our spacing in there.

152
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,100
It has different types of ways that we can make this responsive if we wanted to.

153
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:12,380
We can have like short product text, and if we go in there, we can just easily manipulate that.

154
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,330
And there you go.

155
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,140
So that's how I would approach creating recipes just for cards here.

156
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,670
So this is what I've done with our vertical cards.
