1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,150
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,260
So as you can see, we're back in this little canvas that we've been working on.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,540
We have our journey that we've been creating.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,160
We have an assumptions, grid, stakeholders and users.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,360
We have project goals.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,410
And what I would like to do is I like to create a story map.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,380
As you can tell, as I was building out this journey map over here.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,290
I started thinking about all the different requirements that are happening along the way, all the different

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,700
things we're asking users.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,400
And it's starting to look like a user story map.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,890
And you may be thinking, What is a user store map?

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,090
What's a user story?

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,620
Why does it need to be mapped?

14
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,690
Well, this really helps a prioritization and figuring out releases.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,600
Now, as a designer, I feel like this is super helpful even for myself when I need to think about the

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,840
types of things I need to actually design for.

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,630
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to run you through how we can do this for ourselves.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,440
So I'm going to just steal this journey map and we can start breaking that out a bit.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,950
We can.

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,660
I'm going to just copy it here.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,110
Okay.

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,130
So what is the user story map?

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:16,620
So user story mapping is how we consistently help either clients or our product team to release small

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:24,690
incremental portions of value with the ability to release at any time and know when the product is viable.

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,370
It is a product planning method that really helps the product owner and the team focus on end user business

26
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,570
outcomes when planning what to build and when to build it.

27
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,820
So these story maps complement a traditional flat backlog.

28
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,350
So if we think about the type of work that we're trying to build here, it's broken into a bunch of

29
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,890
different pieces and those types of things live in a thing called the backlog.

30
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,640
And the backlog is essentially just a long list of different types of features.

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,570
If we're thinking about like a traditional spec now by adding the context of the user's activities and

32
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:08,610
tasks to help design releases that address immediate priorities through a regular cadence of enhancements.

33
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,300
Flat backlogs really make it difficult to understand the different types of features and how these features

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,530
relate to each other and how do they create value for the customer.

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,660
So if I'm thinking about traditional specs, they don't really mention any of that.

36
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,620
The user story map really helps us focus on the activity that needs to be completed first and adds just

37
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,580
enough stories to allow the activity to happen in the first release, then follow up with enhancements

38
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,560
in subsequent releases.

39
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,350
So what is a story map and what does it made up of?

40
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,020
Now, let's take a look at this.

41
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,080
This is essentially a story map in a way.

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:02,170
But if we want to think about it a little bit more in depth story map has several different things.

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,090
It has the persona.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,680
And it has a backbone.

45
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,410
So we're just going to copy this line and bring it up here.

46
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,090
So this is the backbone.

47
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:23,000
And the backbone is made up of high level activities the app will facilitate in order of priority.

48
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,710
It's made up of two elements.

49
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,500
Your main activities and tasks.

50
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:36,710
Now the main activity could be something like onboarding, and the task could be something like Let's

51
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,480
think about a task with an onboarding.

52
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,200
Enter personal details.

53
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,280
Och.

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,520
Now the activities, this is the highest portion of this backbone.

55
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,810
These are usually thought of as like these large epics.

56
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,690
That is usually like an agile term to house all the different features within like a category.

57
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,950
But these represent an activity the user has in relation to this application.

58
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,180
So like I said.

59
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,680
On boarding.

60
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,440
Tasks.

61
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,630
Describe the events that need to happen in order for the user to complete this larger activity.

62
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,530
You know, an example is like entering personal details.

63
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,810
Let's throw that in there.

64
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,940
Another one could be enter interests.

65
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,950
Ad products that I am interested in.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,700
Maybe there's an education portion education around onboarding process.

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,370
So these are all the different types of tasks that need to be completed in order for somebody to complete

68
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,330
this activity.

69
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,830
So as you can see, we're starting to build that backbone.

70
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,890
Now, there may be more activities.

71
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,460
Like I said, there may be another one.

72
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,090
That is like what's an example of an activity?

73
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,610
I want to be able to find a product.

74
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,400
So that's a high level activity and some tasks could be search.

75
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,580
I want to be able to see results.

76
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,700
So you can start to see how we are building this kind of narrative in this backbone.

77
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:54,490
Now in the next video, we're going to be focusing on the bottom portion of a story map and what the

78
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,630
user story is.
