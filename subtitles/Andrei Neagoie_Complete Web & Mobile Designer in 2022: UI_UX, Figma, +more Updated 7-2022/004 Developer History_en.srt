00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,430
And welcome back to the final lesson from the history of the Web.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,760
I wanted to finish things off with this diagram that we've seen before in previous lessons with a few

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,290
minor differences.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,860
And that is I wanted to show you how web applications were built in the early 2000.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,560
So they were built with technologies that we've come to familiarize ourselves with.

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,700
We have HTML, CSS, JavaScript, but we also had jQuery.

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:36,240
And jQuery was a library that allowed JavaScript to be written in a simple, clean way.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:43,460
That allowed us not to worry too much about working in one browser then the other.

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,640
It created this environment for JavaScript to flourish.

10
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,390
But it is an outdated technology and there's better ways of doing things.

11
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,510
So it is not used very often, and you'll see it less and less in job postings.

12
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:08,270
And then on the back end we have the lamp stack and that stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP.

13
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:19,130
And in those days back end developers used PHP to write files that allowed us to have logic on the servers.

14
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,690
And then we had Apache.

15
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:29,480
So if you ever use something like HostGator and you have to log into cPanel or any of those very common

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:36,260
hosting platforms, most likely they're running Apache Server and what it is, it's a software that

17
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,660
really efficiently serves up files.

18
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,740
And PHP is a language that it's still being used today and Facebook actually uses it, but that's because

19
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,780
their website was built in the early 2000.

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:56,570
It is now a very unpopular, let's say, language in terms of growth and job opportunities.

21
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,410
Then we also had MySQL, which it's still being used.

22
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:06,920
But again, if you're looking to get hired, you want to look for skills that are highly employable.

23
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,160
People are looking for them and there are still very few developers that know it really well.

24
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,920
Well, that's what we're learning in these scores.

25
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:22,760
In this course, we're going to learn HTML five, CSS three, we're going to learn JavaScript, we're

26
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,280
going to learn React.

27
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,130
Probably the biggest library for JavaScript.

28
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,360
And we're going to learn about note servers.

29
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,170
No DJs, express DJs.

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,740
We're going to learn about PostgreSQL and also MongoDB.

31
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:46,070
So we're learning all these things in order for us to build clean, fast and bug free web applications

32
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:52,650
so that we can stand on the shoulders of giants and create wonderful applications that we're proud of.

33
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,110
So get excited.

34
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,560
All the theory stuff we're done with, we're going to start coding.

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,960
We're going to start off with HTML, then get into CSS and then finally JavaScript and react.

36
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,150
And don't worry, we'll get to the back end as well.

37
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,310
So I'll see you in the next section.

38
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,120
Bye bye.
