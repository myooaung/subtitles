1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,760
So let's talk about best practices for inputs.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,600
So I want you to take a guess which are the most complex UI elements.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,070
If you've guessed inputs, then you're correct.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,340
They may look simple, but in reality, due to their versatility, different states and frequent use,

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,370
they can be very hard to figure out.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,100
But when you do get inputs right, and they're designed really well, they allow users to input data

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,480
in a way that is quick, easy and correct.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,970
So let's jump right in.

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,650
So these are the types of inputs that you're probably going to encounter the most in your career.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,170
Here we got some basic inputs.

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,550
Now there are a variety of input types that we use to collect user data.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,480
Depending on what types of questions or requirements your form may have, you'll need to pick the right

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,050
one.

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,820
So the first one I have here is a text field.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,410
Now these text fields are used for short written responses.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,660
Users can add only one line of text.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,330
If your text does get too long, it will automatically scroll the content left so you can continue to

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,680
see what you're entering.

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,330
So if I were to start entering a name here, it would just push the rest of the content left and you

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,190
just be able to continue to see everything.

21
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,660
The next is a text area.

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,680
Now, sometimes you may need to incorporate an input for longer responses.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,870
This is where the text area comes into play.

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,570
These are taller than a regular text field.

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,670
And as you can see, look at the difference.

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:25,060
And allows for users to enter multiple lines of text when the text does reach the bottom of this container.

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,040
It will automatically expand downwards.

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,820
Some text areas allow users to adjust the width and height manually.

29
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,940
It's just going to depend how it's coded by the developers.

30
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,980
Next we have dropdown menus or selects.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,570
These are used when there are multiple options a user needs to choose from.

32
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:50,310
When you click the input, a menu will appear just below where the user will see the predefined options.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,760
When a user selects an option, it will appear in the input field that they just clicked.

34
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,790
It's best to use dropdown menus when a user needs to select from more than five options, but not too

35
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,820
many because then it becomes a little bit of an accessibility issue.

36
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,760
Next we have checkboxes.

37
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,860
CheckBoxes are typically used when there are one or multiple options for the user to select from.

38
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,170
Users can make multiple selections here.

39
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,580
As you can see, try using these one.

40
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,680
There are four less options to choose from.

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,670
And next, we have radial buttons.

42
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,650
Now, these look pretty similar to the checkbox, but the interaction is entirely different.

43
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,510
These are used for multiple options.

44
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,020
But.

45
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,340
And this is big.

46
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,820
Users can only select one option here.

47
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,770
So much of the checkbox try keeping the options to far less.

48
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:45,430
So if I were to have option three selected and I go to select Option one, it would automatically uncheck

49
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,320
or select three and one would be the only option selected.

50
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,930
If you do want to select multiple options, use the checkbox.

51
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,800
Now there are some advanced inputs and let's get into that.

52
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,180
So sometimes these inputs are not enough for what we're asking of a user.

53
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,140
Some questions can get pretty complex and also some interactions.

54
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,130
So let's look at some examples of that.

55
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,800
Right now we have the multi select text field.

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,360
So what you can do here is these fields allow users to add multiple inputs.

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,780
Generally when a user enters an input, it will be displayed like as a chip.

58
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,030
And this is what a chip looks like.

59
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,680
I mean, you can design it differently, but typically it's just a has the content in the middle and

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,250
then it has an exit or a removal icon to the right.

61
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,380
Now it will be displayed as a chip and the user can add another.

62
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,690
Users are also able to remove chips that they previously entered.

63
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,230
So this is typically what a multi select text field would look like.

64
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,760
And this is a dropdown search.

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,620
If there are a bunch of options within your dropdown menu, you should consider adding some sort of

66
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,090
contextual search.

67
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,580
The way this interaction works is when a user begins typing available options that match the user's

68
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,960
search will filter.

69
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,210
It saves the user a bunch of time.

70
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,560
So if I were to type in like an address or a country or something like that.

71
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,650
So this input says country, but it could just say something like address.

72
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,660
Then it's just so much more easier than just inputting everything manually.

73
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:16,329
Or if they need to search for a specific country, then they can just start typing and the list would

74
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,519
come up over here have suggested results.

75
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,320
So it just saves the user a bunch of time and that's it for advanced inputs.

76
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,450
These are typically all the types of inputs that you would see, both basic and advanced or some sort

77
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,550
of variation.

78
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,910
I mean, there are many more.

79
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,640
There are date pickers and date pickers are used when we want to our user to select a date or a date

80
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,250
range.

81
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,420
It really depends on the type of product you're building.

82
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,060
So there are a bunch of inputs out here, but this is what you're typically going to be using most of

83
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,630
the time.
