1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,710
Hey and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,820
We're going to be talking about sketching screen states now.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
I love sketching screen states.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,280
This focus is on drawing the entire screen or different interactions.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,830
An example is a user comes to a search page, clicks on a search bar, an overlay pops up.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,290
They type get suggested searches.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,320
You get the point.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,460
We start thinking about those little micro interactions as well.

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,910
That's the fun part, too.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,430
I spend a lot of my time actually drawing these, so let's go back to our client.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,540
Let's think about something that we can work on.

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,520
I kind of gave a little example about searching for a product, and I think that's a good way to kind

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,240
of start.

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,110
Let's think about our home screen just a little bit more.

15
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,060
So let's just title that.

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:49,000
And what I'm going to do is, well, you'll notice that I'm not really writing any annotations because

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,320
they're kind of illegible.

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,220
But since we're doing this together, get out your sketchpad.

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,150
Keep on going.

20
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,890
You know what I'm drawing?

21
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,870
And we don't really need them in this case.

22
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,959
So if I start to think about this in a little bit more detail, I start to think about what are the

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,300
kind of the different types of features and different types of elements that this page should have.

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,660
You know, we talked about a profile image.

25
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,330
We have a search here as well.

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,740
And we could start thinking about, well, we created a saved page.

27
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,620
How does a user save an item?

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,400
So we have our item here.

29
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,630
Maybe it's a little heart on each image.

30
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,450
Oh, no.

31
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,890
I kind of like that.

32
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,230
You know, I start to think about different things like the user can see in relation to that image,

33
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,010
that type of content.

34
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,420
That's really important.

35
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,410
So if we zoom in, I start thinking about the product name.

36
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,250
Start thinking about maybe there is the price.

37
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,460
Maybe there's some.

38
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,600
Product information, if that's useful?

39
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,650
I'm not sure.

40
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,700
Is there a button?

41
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,520
Can users click this whole section?

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,290
Is it like a card that's really going to be up to you and what you think is best for users?

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:11,310
Typically, I don't like placing like little buttons over here and just limiting a user because like

44
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,370
on mobile, you know, you want to tap larger surface areas, you got to make your buttons much larger

45
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:17,970
to.

46
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,870
In this case, I probably will use a card.

47
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,500
I'm not sure just yet, but something to start thinking about.

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,010
So this probably like this interaction when I'm thinking about it, maybe it's a carousel.

49
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,090
So when the user kind of swipes left.

50
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:43,640
What will happen is this will go there and we'll kind of start getting images that go left to right,

51
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,790
which is pretty cool.

52
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,490
So those will go left to right.

53
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,350
But let's think a little bit more about this homescreen I mentioned, like thinking about interest,

54
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,270
we can start thinking about like ways that fits into the app.

55
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,480
Maybe there's like an interest title and like a C all.

56
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,260
Thing where they can go find more interest or maybe edit their current interest.

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,440
Maybe they'll see items in relation to certain categories.

58
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,120
And.

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,820
They can click on them and put them into a different funnel.

60
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,810
So I'm starting to think a little bit more detail in terms of like what's on the page, what I need

61
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,790
to account for when I'm building a product.

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,850
And that's really helpful, especially with screen states.

63
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,100
So we did talk about search.

64
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,700
So what happens if you actually click this search over here?

65
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,130
Let's draw a state.

66
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,210
When somebody clicks a search, I'm thinking like an overlay will pop up.

67
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,860
What does that interaction look like?

68
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,550
So let's just start ground zero.

69
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,570
Number one, we'll just name it overlay.

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,960
Maybe an overlay pops from top to bottom.

71
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,740
There's a little X with the search.

72
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,000
We're on mobile, so we have to remember that there's a keyboard here.

73
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,450
It's a lot of rectangles.

74
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:13,760
We also need to remember that these keyboards have some sort of large button that can be used as an

75
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,420
enter.

76
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,360
So it's an alternate way for them to select something.

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,670
So if they're writing something in there, if they're typing something in there, we need to start thinking

78
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,930
about what happens.

79
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,880
So once they start typing.

80
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,170
We'll stay in the same screen.

81
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,270
Everything up here will stay the same, but now we'll start getting some type of head result here.

82
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,300
Let's zoom in so we can write a little bit more neatly.

83
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,810
So if I start typing in something like book.

84
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,920
We're going to change your pen, wait just a little bit more, and we can bold it and say something

85
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,160
like books for.

86
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
Eight plus.

87
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:08,670
And that's a great way just to kind of like make the user's life a little bit easier.

88
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,580
Maybe they're looking for a bookshelf so we can do the same there where we just bring that down and

89
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,830
it will be like shelf.

90
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,400
It'll just finish off the rest.

91
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,520
So it's just kind of auto suggesting, auto completing for them.

92
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,530
So we start thinking about those types of elements that we're going to need.

93
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,650
Obviously, this kind of stays persistent and we'll start thinking about, Well, what happens then?

94
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,990
Maybe it's like a 1.1, but the next step.

95
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,930
Is that they would go straight to search results.

96
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,750
Now, what do search results look like?

97
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,970
Maybe there's, like, a back button.

98
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,810
Maybe we got our search at the top, whatever we wrote.

99
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,440
Maybe we have some information about the amount of results.

100
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,030
Now, maybe there's a filter up here.

101
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,960
This draw little filter icon, not the best, but, you know, it works and they get the results here.

102
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,640
Now here we start thinking about, well, what do they see?

103
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,340
What can they interact with?

104
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,530
I know that they could be if we split these up, maybe they seem more like cards like before, so they

105
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:32,720
can tap the whole thing and go straight into a product page that we've been sketching a bunch lately.

106
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,140
But, you know, there's probably a couple of other things that we can pull out here.

107
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,520
Maybe we have that heart.

108
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,960
And users can go straight.

109
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,170
To.

110
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,300
Our saved page, whatever that may look like.

111
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,380
I started off with understanding that I'm going to be creating an interaction for this certain flow,

112
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,520
searching for some sort of product.

113
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,730
And I asked myself the question, well, what comes next?

114
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,450
And now I'm asking the question of, well, what alternate scenarios are there?

115
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,860
So there's a couple of different scenarios here.

116
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,050
Users can from here we have different flows.

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,600
Users can go see a product.

118
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,640
Users can save their products to a saved page.

119
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,760
Users also can enter a new search.

120
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,380
It can go all the way back.

121
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,780
And users could even filter.

122
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,610
You just could also kind of like just abandon the search if they want to.

123
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,630
Maybe we have a persistent navigation at the bottom.

124
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,190
So there's so many different scenarios like what happens with filters.

125
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,100
Maybe it's like another overlay.

126
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,950
It comes down from the top.

127
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,300
Nice little animation, and I'm starting to think about these animations a little bit more, these micro

128
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,620
interactions, because if I leave them all the way to the end of the project, they're not going to

129
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:54,970
look good.

130
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,000
They're going to look amateur.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,960
And you should really incorporate motion early on.

132
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:06,350
They really help a lot with different types of things, like feedback and understanding the state of

133
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,100
a screen.

134
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,230
And we're going to do a whole lesson on motion later, but it's great to just start thinking about it

135
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,010
right now.

136
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,380
So this is like our filters.

137
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,360
We're just going to call it Phil.

138
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,960
And now I could start thinking about the content here.

139
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,550
I mean, now we're branching out and that's totally fine.

140
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,820
Sometimes I don't branch out.

141
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,870
Sometimes I just kind of stop here and I start refining this kind of flow.

142
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,120
But it's pretty cool to start thinking about all the different types of things that you're going to

143
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,260
need to account for, like the different types of UI elements, different types of content.

144
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,610
So if I think about filtering for a product like this, if there's a title, maybe you're going to want

145
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,100
to filter for something like price.

146
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,840
So that may be an option.

147
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:58,270
You know, maybe it's by customer review or maybe it's by, like, newest items.

148
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,390
Maybe there's another section where it's by review, solely by review, so we can start thinking about

149
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,700
what we're going to need to actually implement.

150
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,320
Moving forward, it's going to really help us in the future.

151
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,720
And this is why we actually just kind of sketch and just do it quickly.

152
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,710
So take some time to really go through that.

153
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,110
Like I said, don't get bogged down by the details.

154
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:27,850
Like you could tell that we just went through it really quickly and we learned a lot about what possibly

155
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,380
could be in our application.

156
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,520
We created a bunch of screens and we have a really good jumping off point.

157
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:40,750
But now we can take these, use them for like user flows, use them for site maps and even start building

158
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,790
wireframes like ASAP.

159
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,730
The whole point of sketching is to just be lean, be agile, and don't get bogged down by the details.

160
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:56,050
Ignore things like dribble or where you see like really high definition, like sketches.

161
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,010
Just go for it.

162
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,820
Jump right in.

163
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,850
And that's it for sketching screen states.
