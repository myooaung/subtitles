00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,010
Let's talk about the differences between a designer and a developer.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,830
Now, you may know this already, but if you're just starting out, these terms are often confusing

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,580
and most people can decide whether they want to be a designer or a developer.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:24,030
So let's have a look at these two fields and see what their differences are and also where they overlap,

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,270
because there is a lot of crossover.

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,850
But the main difference is that a designer is focused on the aesthetics.

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:41,370
The experience of the user versus a developer is focused more on the internals and the things that make

8
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,840
a product work.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,170
But let's get a little bit deeper into that.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,170
You see the first phase of building any product is the planning phase.

11
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,730
This planning phase is probably the most important.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,080
This is where we decide and map the entire project.

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,900
How should the product look?

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,010
How should it feel?

15
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,390
What should it do?

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,020
This is also the part where you're usually interacting with the client and deciding what their goals

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:20,760
are, what the user's goals are, and planning out the project so that you have defined goals that you

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,980
want to achieve with your product.

19
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:32,610
From the planning phase, we go into the design phase, and the design phase is all about using all

20
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,260
the information in the planning phase and making it into reality.

21
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,720
Usually you'd create something like site structure or mobile structure.

22
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,300
You'll have visual representation.

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,950
How will the product look?

24
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,170
What would the users see?

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,350
By the end of the design phase, you usually know what the product should look like, what the product

26
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,220
should do.

27
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,210
From there, we get into the development phase.

28
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,980
The development phase is where we do the programming work.

29
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,979
We usually take all the assets and information that we've gathered from the previous stage.

30
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,640
That is the design phase and we try to implement it on a live website or a live mobile app.

31
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:27,150
You might use things like HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the designs come alive so that they're online.

32
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,890
They're on your phone.

33
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,840
Once you've build the product, you've developed the product, then we get into the exciting phase of

34
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,010
the launch phase.

35
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:43,340
This is where we deliver our product to the users, to the public.

36
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:50,660
Usually there is some polishing that we need to do, maybe some design tweaks, maybe some testing of

37
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,820
our site to make sure that it works properly.

38
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,030
But this is the critical part.

39
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,230
Once we launch our product, it doesn't end there.

40
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,620
The next step is the post launch.

41
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:14,430
This is usually where we hand off the product to a client, but we also monitor how the launch goes.

42
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,980
How do the users use the product?

43
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,720
Are there any issues?

44
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:25,020
Because most of the time when you create something, it's not 100% right from the beginning.

45
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:32,640
So instead you learn from your first version that you launched and then you iterate.

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,500
That is, you improve upon it.

47
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,700
You maybe do user testing and understand why users aren't clicking on this button, or maybe users are

48
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,700
confused how your product works.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,480
And this turns into a loop because from the insights that you get after the launch, you can now start

50
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
improving your product.

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,860
You can start planning again, designing again, developing again and launching again so that you get

52
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,480
better and better insights.

53
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,910
You improve the product over and over.

54
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,380
And this whole process continues.

55
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:15,350
You can never really finish a product because a product can always be improved.

56
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,950
But we're talking about designers and developers here.

57
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,300
So where do they come in?

58
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,480
Well, a simplified version of this is that a designer is in charge of this part.

59
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,260
They're heavily involved with the planning phase of working with the client and deciding what the goals

60
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,450
are.

61
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,570
What do we want the users to do?

62
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,430
They're obviously heavily involved in the designs they need to design the product.

63
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:48,590
So it looks nice, it looks friendly, it looks usable, it meets the client and user expectations.

64
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,580
But they're also involved in doing things like user testing, learning from the users and improving

65
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,070
their designs from what they learn.

66
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,300
The developers are mainly focused with this part.

67
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:11,170
They are usually the ones that receive the designs and start using things like HTML, CSS and JavaScript

68
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,170
to implement those designs into an actual working website or a mobile app.

69
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,890
They also might help with the launch by putting the code that they've created on a server monitoring

70
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,780
and launching the product.

71
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,520
But they are also going to encounter bugs in their code.

72
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,620
Maybe they've programmed something that isn't efficient or is incorrect and it creates bugs while they

73
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,240
have to fix those as well.

74
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,050
So they're also involved in the post launch process.

75
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,300
So remember what I said at the beginning.

76
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,910
Design is all about these aesthetics.

77
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:53,680
You don't necessarily need to code because you're involved more at the beginning stages and later stages

78
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,570
of the product development phase.

79
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:03,400
But it doesn't hurt to know how developers use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create websites, which

80
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:10,060
is why we've included those sections later on in the course so that you also understand how you might

81
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,740
want to do this yourself.

82
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:19,860
But as a developer, you also might want to learn how to design, how to plan things, because then

83
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,920
you're able to understand the whole product better.

84
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:29,310
So these borders, although might look rigid right now, can overflow into each other.

85
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,190
But if you want it just a guideline, this is it.

86
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,140
To be a great designer, you need to focus on these three things.

87
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,060
Sure.

88
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,480
HTML and CSS and some programming will help you.

89
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:48,060
You know, we've added a couple of extra videos in there for you to still see the whole picture.

90
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,630
All right.

91
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,770
This video is getting long, so let's take a break and I'll see you in the next one.
