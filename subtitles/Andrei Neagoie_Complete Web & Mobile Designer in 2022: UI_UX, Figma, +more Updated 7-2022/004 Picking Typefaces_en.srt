00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,110
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,520
We're going to be talking about how do you pick a typeface?

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,990
But the first thing that comes to mind when I'm thinking about picking at typeface is the emotion of

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,520
type.

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:15,140
Now, that may seem like a weird way to think about typefaces because, you know, typefaces kind of

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,190
feel, but they definitely do have their own mood or personality.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,740
Now, the mood of a typeface is in a very important part about how it should be used.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,870
You'll notice that some different typefaces have strikingly different moods.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,710
Some typefaces are very formal or traditional.

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,230
Others seem more light and modern.

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,940
And a lot has to do with the way that that typeface has been designed.

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,490
You know, sometimes it could be that there's a lot of contrast within that typeface like we saw before,

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:53,180
or sometimes typefaces just have really distinct moods like we've seen in some display typefaces.

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,520
For example, let's think about times in your Roman.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,730
It's pretty much always a traditional font, and some typefaces are a little bit more transcendent,

16
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,690
and they can pretty much convey almost any mood.

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,990
And when I think about that, I think about Helvetica.

18
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,000
So when I'm looking for typefaces for a specific brand or purpose, I think about how it could represent

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,020
that best.

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,780
Some typefaces could be perfectly suited for a fintech company or a bakery, or like the Swedish furniture

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,930
company over here that we just came up with before.

22
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,180
Typefaces can really help to represent and reinforce the voice of a brand.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,520
Now let's see how we can choose our own typeface based off of mood.

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,320
In a couple of different scenarios.

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,780
We're going to jump right into the figma in our next lesson.
