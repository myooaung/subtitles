1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.070
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.700
In this video, we're going to be learning about self-closing tags.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.770
Up until this point, we've used HTML tags that have the opening and then the closing, which has this

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.760
slash in it.

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.140
Now, there are a few elements that don't have this syntax, but they have something called self-closing

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.730
tags.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.550
So let's say here between Fuji and Honeycrisp, I want to have a bit of a line break.

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.560
I can use something like VR here break.

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.040
And if I save this and I refresh, we have a little line break.

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.040
There's also h.r.

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.890
Which is horizontal, so you get a horizontal line.

12
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.630
If i refresh right through here, h.r.

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.690
Break.

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.280
Just have one single element self-closing.

15
00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:01.050
You might also see something like this, and that is something from the old version of HTML which uses

16
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.220
x HTML.

17
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.310
You can read up more about it on your own, but just keep in mind that with HTML five, we're just going

18
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.180
to be using this.

19
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.630
So obviously on web pages, there's going to be images.

20
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.170
So would it be nice if there was a picture of a Fuji apple here?

21
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.390
Let's see how we can do it.

22
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.140
So with an image tag and let's think about this critically.

23
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.490
If I didn't know what an image tag is and I wanted to add an image to my HTML file.

24
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.540
Well, if I google image html tag.

25
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.030
Again, one of the first websites that pops up is the three schools.

26
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.270
And I'll show you exactly how an image tag works.

27
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.230
If I click, try yourself.

28
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.720
You can see it in action.

29
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.780
You can play around with it.

30
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.930
But you can see here that an image tag is a self closing tag.

31
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.950
There's no closing image tag.

32
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.110
Just just one single tag.

33
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.240
And if I do image and we have something called sauce here and this is something called an attribute,

34
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.900
some HTML tags can have something called attributes which adds special properties to the specific tag.

35
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.780
So an attribute always has a value attached to it.

36
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.750
And the image source, that's what Z stands for, tells us where the image is coming from.

37
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.050
So let's find an image of Fuji Apple.

38
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.780
Let's go.

39
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.920
Images.

40
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.450
I like this one.

41
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.780
Let's do a view image and I'll give us the link of where this image is.

42
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.530
So I'm just going to copy that, paste it in here.

43
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.400
Let's go back to our example here.

44
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.400
We can see here that there's a few more attributes that we can add to an image tag, but for now, we

45
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.340
can just leave it here, close the tag.

46
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.000
You can see that sublime text adds the nice.

47
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.120
Highlighting for us.

48
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.370
And if I save this, go back to our website and I click refresh.

49
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.360
I get this massive Fuji apple and obviously that's that's too big.

50
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.150
Ideally, we can make it a little bit smaller again.

51
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.520
If we go back and to the example, you'll see that it has width and height.

52
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.980
So we can actually just copy that and add it to the attributes.

53
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.390
So that we specify the width and this is in pixels.

54
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.650
So I save that.

55
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.410
I refresh and look at that.

56
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.640
We have the Fuji apple.

57
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.170
It looks very, very pretty.

58
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.100
Let's add the picture for Honeycrisp as well.

59
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.070
I'm going to do this fast.

60
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.190
You should be able to just copy this image.

61
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.160
And again, we want to make it the same size as the previous one.

62
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.350
So I'm going to leave the width and height the same.

63
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.430
And let's find a an image of a Honeycrisp apple.

64
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.350
So Honeycrisp.

65
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.240
Apple.

66
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.510
Images.

67
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.510
Well, it looks quite similar, doesn't it?

68
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.840
And few image.

69
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.060
Let's copy the source.

70
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.150
From here.

71
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.160
I'm going to save that.

72
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.019
Go back to our website and let's refresh and look at that.

73
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.250
We have our apples.

74
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.300
So image tanks are very, very useful.

75
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.220
You might be asking yourself, what is the alt?

76
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.380
Attribute meat, and this is something that you can actually read up on.

77
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.610
So if you scroll down, if you look over here, you can see that alt specifies an alternate text for

78
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.970
an image.

79
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.700
So again, this is something that can be used by screen readers and you can define what the image is

80
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.480
of.

81
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.650
So in here the alt is smiley face, so that when a screen reader reads, it says, Oh, in this part

82
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.080
of the website there is a smiley face.

83
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.230
Just to recap, we learned about self closing tags which don't require two of them.

84
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.380
So an opening and a closing tag, just a single one.

85
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.280
So we use VR for line break.

86
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:18.980
We used h.R for a horizontal line and then we have the image tag that also has to have some attributes.

87
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.420
So it has a source which tells us where to grab the image from.

88
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.350
It has a width attribute, a height attribute with a value of 42 pixels and 42.

89
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.170
All right, I'll see you in the next lesson.

90
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.800
Bye bye.
