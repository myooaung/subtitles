1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,050
I want to teach you about overflow behavior.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:09,470
So this is pretty cool if you want to like incorporate some horizontal or horizontal and vertical scrolling

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,990
and I'm going to teach you how to do that really quickly.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:19,790
Now, overflow behavior essentially controls how your users interact with content that extends beyond

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,450
a device's dimensions or within a frame's dimensions.

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,190
I mean, you can use this to replicate scrolling down a lengthy page of content as well as more advanced

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,380
like interactions, like scrolling left or right to switch between elements and a slider.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,400
You know, you can pan or scroll around an interactive map.

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,750
It's really awesome.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,140
You can apply the overall flow behavior just to the frame.

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,370
So I'll show you what that looks like.

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:49,400
I have a frame over here and there's an overflow behavior which is really easy to use.

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,610
Now let's start with just vertical scrolling.

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,820
So what I have here is just a long home page.

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,780
This is obviously going to be way too long for our actual device.

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,180
I fixed the bottom navigation bar.

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,370
You'll notice it over here and it's actually reflected in the bar over here in the side.

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,250
And we're just going to see what that looks like.

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,550
So you don't necessarily need to apply an overflow behavior to everything.

20
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,020
I mean, this is just going to scroll just fine and you'll notice that that's an easy way to make,

21
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,140
like a sticky nav or like a sticky search bar if you want it.

22
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:30,770
Now, let's see if we combine something like this into a frame, and then we shrink that frame and we

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,820
clip the content.

24
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,370
Now all of a sudden, like we can't see that content, maybe we would want to scroll based off of that

25
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,060
content.

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,580
Yeah.

27
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,270
There we go.

28
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,780
Maybe you just want to see just a snippet.

29
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,660
Let's clip it.

30
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,920
Snippet and clip it.

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,670
That rhymes.

32
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,810
We're going to prototype and we're going to do vertical scrolling.

33
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,040
So let's see what happens.

34
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,250
So you can scroll within this frame as well as scrolling over here.

35
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,260
I don't recommend doing this for something like this, but I mean, gets the point across pretty easily,

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,770
right?

37
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,850
So we're going to just reverse what we did there.

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,870
Another way to do it is to actually scroll horizontally.

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,070
And this is super easy.

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,520
We just need to ensure that this frame is within.

41
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,370
And we need to clip the content.

42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,820
I mean, we can clip it right there.

43
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,650
Perfect.

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
There we go.

45
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,390
Now, users can easily, like, swipe through.

46
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,440
We can even just, like, touch this up just a smidge.

47
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,000
If we go to our products inside this frame, so we have like three.

48
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,640
We can adjust the constraints.

49
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,920
So that way they don't.

50
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,480
To move while we touch this frame.

51
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,950
Perfect.

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,950
And so when we do swipe, it's going to go off the device.

53
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,760
So that is super cool.

54
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,130
So I mean, we can refine this some more, but you can tell that we can just easily simulate that sliding

55
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,370
and scrolling without necessarily going to a new page.

56
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,340
So super awesome if you want to do something like that.

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,780
Now, if you do want to do here, let's duplicate this frame.

58
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,450
We'll keep that there.

59
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,550
Let's just go back, actually.

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,640
Okay.

61
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,530
Let's duplicate this frame.

62
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,240
We'll keep that one as our original.

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:39,360
And what we're going to do is we're actually going to remove all this, remove this.

64
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,220
And we're going to create like a massive.

65
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,850
Nap.

66
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,400
Actually not here.

67
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,030
I will show you how to do this.

68
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,460
Let's create a frame.

69
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,020
And we're going to go to our plugins.

70
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,740
I have a great plugin over here called Map Cycle, so I'm going to open it up.

71
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,020
And you can just kind of set like any position you want 500 by 500.

72
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,710
So it's definitely big.

73
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,740
We're going to create a frame for that and we're going to shrink the frame in.

74
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,279
And we're going to clip the content.

75
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,030
And we're going to move that over here.

76
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,820
So we have San Francisco, beautiful San Francisco.

77
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,830
And what we're going to do is with our overflow behavior, we are going to do horizontal and vertical

78
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,430
scrolling.

79
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,620
And when we go into our prototype, oh, it's not in our prototype because it's not in the frame.

80
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,660
So let's push that in the frame.

81
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,940
There you go.

82
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,900
And we go into our prototype, we can easily scroll.

83
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,010
Or drag.

84
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,090
Horizontally and vertically.

85
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,530
So this is really great if you're creating an application with a map that you want to be able to do

86
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:00,380
that with or with whatever content you deem necessary so you can stick whatever size image in here.

87
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,450
And nice thing is it kind of has like this nice animation when you kind of drag.

88
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,020
So it really allows like users to swipe through both left and right, up and down within like that particular

89
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,670
frame.

90
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,110
So go ahead, go out there and test these little things out.

91
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,960
I know a lot of people like to do like horizontal scrolling, especially with images like over here

92
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,890
and products.

93
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,920
I mean, this is pretty cool.

94
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,700
Kind of like you don't necessarily need to get into any animation in order to create like a pretty awesome

95
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,270
prototype.

96
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,550
So that's overflow behavior within Figma.
