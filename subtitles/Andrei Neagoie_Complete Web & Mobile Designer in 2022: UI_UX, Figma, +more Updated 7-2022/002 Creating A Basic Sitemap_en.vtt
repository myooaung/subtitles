00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.910
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.330
So you may be asking yourself, well, how do I create a site map?

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.620
Well, let's jump in.

4
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.730
The first step is anatomy.

5
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.440
Let's learn about the anatomy of a site map.

6
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.240
So essentially, a site map will consist of all these linked pages.

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.370
So we have this as our page.

8
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.650
I mean, they don't need to necessarily look like this.

9
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.570
Like I said before, with other things.

10
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.070
It's all about what works for you, what best represents, what you're trying to get across.

11
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.250
So right now, I'm just kind of using a little card.

12
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.910
I don't necessarily use this when I'm creating this site map.

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.830
So this is the main card.

14
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.480
And within the anatomy you have a reference number.

15
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.090
Some people like to use reference numbers.

16
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.260
They really kind of help.

17
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.090
When you're creating actual wireframes afterwards, you can use that same reference number.

18
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.470
You don't necessarily need to.

19
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.530
I know a lot of people that like to, but it's a preference.

20
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.620
But one thing that is definitely needed is a label.

21
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.190
So this label over here is definitely going to be needed because it'll let us understand what the page

22
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.880
name is.

23
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.410
That is what we really want to know.

24
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.330
So what you want to do is you want to start with your home page always.

25
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.900
The rows that follow afterwards are by the highest priority.

26
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.130
So I say roads because typically people, when they build a site map, they're building it from the

27
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.120
top to the bottom.

28
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.160
You can build it from left to right.

29
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.380
Like I said before, it's all preference.

30
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.790
So I'm going left to right, right now.

31
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.180
So the next step of the same map would be like your primary, secondary and tertiary pages and so on.

32
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.860
So right now we have a primary page.

33
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.870
So if we were to think about our current client, we have our home page and you could access a category

34
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.090
on that page and that would be our primary level.

35
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.220
And then afterwards you may be able to select a sub category and that would be our secondary level and

36
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.590
it could go on and on.

37
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.140
I wouldn't advise doing that, but you get the gist.

38
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.850
So this is our primary and secondary and this is ground zero.

39
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.730
Now, you could use a legend if you'd like.

40
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.740
It's totally up to you.

41
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.910
That's another preference.

42
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.630
If you're sharing it with a lot of people, it may help if you have a lot of symbols in there.

43
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.620
If you have colours.

44
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.690
I like to use colours because it helps to signify whether like a page is public or a member only.

45
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.430
So totally up to you.

46
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.180
If it really helps to get through what you're trying to say with your product and your set up, use

47
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.850
a legend.

48
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.790
So there are two types of site maps.

49
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.610
This is a flat site map and this is better suited for smaller to medium sized products.

50
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.140
I'm thinking maybe like 10 to 100 pages, maybe even less.

51
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.680
To be honest, there are four or less vertical levels.

52
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.090
You'll notice that there's only two vertical levels here, and that's probably what we'll be using when

53
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.560
we create our site map.

54
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.740
But there are four less vertical levels and they all help enhance the discoverability of content because

55
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.600
there are fewer levels to click through.

56
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.150
So you want to use this for smaller products.

57
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.950
You don't want people to be going too deep unless it's absolutely necessary.

58
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.460
The next step of site map is a deep site map, so these are better suited for larger sized sites and

59
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.320
they help house a lot of information.

60
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.720
So we're talking like hundreds and hundreds of pages.

61
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.420
We're talking maybe pages for like a government website, maybe like a huge e-commerce website.

62
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.360
They can get around to five vertical levels, which is huge.

63
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.170
I mean, we're at four here and you can imagine the amount of pages that you can get into.

64
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.230
This ultimately makes it harder to discover content.

65
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.910
So you'll need to think about the different ways for users to get to places like Menu Shortcuts.

66
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.800
But yeah, so deep site maps, use them for larger products, don't use them for a product like we're

67
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.370
building.

68
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.920
So why are they so valuable?

69
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.930
Well, they help you plan for usability and it provides a full overview which can really help teams

70
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.600
simplify and trim unnecessary pages.

71
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.090
But really, when you build a site map, you can also strategically place content where users can find

72
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.450
it.

73
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.250
It results in the creation of navigation hierarchies and categorizations of your product.

74
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.590
You get a good understanding of your navigation.

75
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.750
You can calculate the amount of content you need and it gives you a good understanding of your scope.

76
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.840
So say maps are incredibly useful.

77
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.690
You may not create like a final site map and that shouldn't bottleneck you in terms of starting wireframes

78
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.180
or even like sketching and user flows.

79
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.760
But you should really start one to get a sense of what your entire navigation scheme is going to look

80
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.240
like.

81
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.600
Let's jump right into Figma and let's start building our own.
