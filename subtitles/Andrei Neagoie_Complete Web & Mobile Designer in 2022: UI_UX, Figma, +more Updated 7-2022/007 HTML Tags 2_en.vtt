00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.670
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.400
In the previous video, we talked about a few of the common tags that HTML uses and we're going to expand

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.110
on that knowledge and learn a few more.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.040
So I'm going to delete these and I'm going to teach you about something called a ordered list.

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.020
So an old tag.

6
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.200
And within this tag, we have list items.

7
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.820
Banana.

8
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.100
And another list item, do apple.

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.130
And lastly, let's do orange.

10
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.310
So if I save this again, I refresh.

11
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.500
And we have banana, apple, orange.

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.280
So you can see here, this is how you make lists.

13
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.300
And this is an ordered list.

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.460
So you can see we have one, two, three.

15
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.050
If we want to make it without the numbers, we use something called an unordered list.

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.950
And again, I save that and refresh.

17
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.220
And we have these.

18
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.130
Now, there's also some fields that you can use.

19
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.650
So, again, this is all about nesting and having parent tags and children tags.

20
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.250
So let's say within apples we wanted to have.

21
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.980
Let me structure that a little bit cleaner.

22
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.440
There you go.

23
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.490
Within Apple's we also want to emphasize that there is the.

24
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.080
Fuji Apple.

25
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.990
And there is Honeycrisp.

26
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.750
Well, I can't think of a third type of apple, so I'm just going to delete that if I save this and

27
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.280
refresh what?

28
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.840
We have a nested list.

29
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.730
There you have it.

30
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.790
We have your list items.

31
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.450
I'll see in the next video where we're going to learn about putting images into our website and self

32
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.470
closing tags.

33
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.580
See you in the next one.
