00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.530
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.860
So we are going to get into actually animating this a bit more, applying things like physics to it.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.820
One thing I just want to stress is when you're working with animations like this, they are time consuming.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.310
I mean, you can spend hours and hours perfecting these types of things and you need to really gauge

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.170
whether that's worth it for you.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.340
This like may not be worth it for a version one of your product, but it's really cool once you actually

7
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.390
have something like this.

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.680
So be very mindful of your time in relation to what you're doing.

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.670
Like you can create crazy quick animations doing something like this.

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.220
You can go ahead and create some very simple animations that don't take much time.

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.620
Like if you want to show like a slider or like a loader, like you can easily show like a loader going

12
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.120
from 0 to 100%, creating something like in fake motion.

13
00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.050
And it wouldn't take you that much time in comparison to like making like pouncing balls and other more

14
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.000
complex animations.

15
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.750
So just keep that in mind when you are trying to figure out what you want to build in terms of an animation

16
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.110
and just take into account the time it's going to take.

17
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.760
You don't want to go down that rabbit hole and not actually deliver anything.

18
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.230
Let's jump right in.

19
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.500
So I have my notification bubble over here selected.

20
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.660
I'm going to go into fig motion.

21
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.610
There it is.

22
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.200
So I think we have some pretty good timing right now.

23
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.300
So it's going to jump up and down.

24
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.510
Now what we can do is we can keep on like.

25
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.620
We can make this animation a bit shorter now.

26
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.640
Let's just see how that looks.

27
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.980
Start from zero.

28
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.390
I like it.

29
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.320
And then when it comes back down, it's going to just stop at like nine.

30
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.160
Let's just drag that over.

31
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.240
So that pause at the top was a little awkward.

32
00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.889
Okay.

33
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.840
We can even bring in drop just a bit more.

34
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.120
Okay.

35
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.500
So we have our basic draw up here.

36
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.780
Now, what I want to do is we're going to have to work with like just width and height as well.

37
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.470
Best way to do this.

38
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.100
So if we were to start at, say, like one.

39
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.180
And before we get there with our width, maybe we'll.

40
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.100
So let's see what that looks like.

41
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.850
So we probably so 17 is our normal width.

42
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.710
Okay.

43
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.350
So we can.

44
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.040
This is my only gripe with big motion is like I can drag multiple key frames and it's such a pain to

45
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.620
actually get that to work properly.

46
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.670
So this can be at 17 and this will not be a linear.

47
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.800
We'll just do ease in and out.

48
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.290
Let's see what happens.

49
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.760
So it's going to boom.

50
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.680
So I wanted to.

51
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.740
Let me see what's going on.

52
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.650
So it's going to go to 17.

53
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.120
So this is obviously like you just need to figure out what's going to work for you.

54
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.160
Okay.

55
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.000
So.

56
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.670
Her height needs to be different as well.

57
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.440
We will drop down to 15.

58
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.769
I think that's fine.

59
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.880
So 15.

60
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.510
And then when it's going up.

61
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.770
We are going to hit another key frame here.

62
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.650
So it's going to show you how to get this started.

63
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.140
So for our height, we are probably going to.

64
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.710
So is that 17 now we can kind of just go to like maybe 18.

65
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.810
So it's like a gradual thing.

66
00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.070
So boom, you see how that starts to come together.

67
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.080
Boom.

68
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.640
So a squish.

69
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.030
So that squishes a little too much over there.

70
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.570
So.

71
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.500
Squish.

72
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:23.730
And really that's where we're going to start seeing some more change so we can bring things in a little

73
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.600
bit more.

74
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.090
And that looks pretty nice.

75
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.720
And like right when we get to that top, what we want to do is actually.

76
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.880
So let me just change that.

77
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.920
And what we want to do is when we get to this top portion, we want our width and our our height to

78
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.940
just return back to normal.

79
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.500
So we're at 17 here.

80
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.440
I think we were at 17 here as well.

81
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.640
So that's good.

82
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.480
We can actually drag that.

83
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.670
That's just going to stay there.

84
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.340
We want our height to go back to normal.

85
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.520
So we're going to go back to 17.

86
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.420
We want to make that easy in and out.

87
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.660
So we're going to be like, boom!

88
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.340
And then drop.

89
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.080
And when we drop that's when we, we go back to squishing it a bit.

90
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.590
So.

91
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.580
Look at that.

92
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.050
That looks actually really cool.

93
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.450
So let's go ahead and do that again.

94
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.880
So when we get to the top.

95
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.280
We're going to do.

96
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.280
So that's when the drop happens.

97
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.030
Right there.

98
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.570
So I'm just going to set this keyframe over here.

99
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.850
I'm going to set this height keyframe.

100
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.180
So it's just going to persist at 17 across these blue lines.

101
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.410
So the ball is staying normal.

102
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.170
Now, what's going to happen is so actually, let's just put it over around here.

103
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.030
So it matches when that drop is going to start happening and then.

104
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.790
We can start messing with the height.

105
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.730
Now the height is going to stretch again.

106
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.090
So it's going to.

107
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.670
And when it hits there, it's going to shrink.

108
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.570
So let's do it.

109
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.280
An easy in and out.

110
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.150
Sorry.

111
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.130
This is where it should probably be so.

112
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.800
Do you see how it gradually picks up speed from the top as it's going downward?

113
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.630
So it's picking up speed.

114
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.390
We can even, like, if we wanted to, we can even make it skinnier.

115
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:53.410
Uh.

116
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.420
Let's do.

117
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.860
In and out.

118
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.000
Beautiful.

119
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.270
So it's going to shrink.

120
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:08.500
And then when it gets to there, it's going to be kind of instantaneous.

121
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:16.030
You know, at the top when we got to the top, we gradually got from like something that was more skinnier

122
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.860
to something that was much more normal over here.

123
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.290
So would we get we went from 17.

124
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.640
What do we have over here?

125
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.500
So we're at 18 in height.

126
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.750
Like we could have even went 19 in height.

127
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.960
So take a look.

128
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.179
Perfect.

129
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.780
So when we're out there, we can just go to the top.

130
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:55.560
And once we hit that bottom, I want to start to actually assign to actually.

131
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.020
So I'm just going to boom, boom.

132
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.310
So those are going to stay stagnant and we're going to hit that bottom really hard.

133
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.440
And let's see what it looks like.

134
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.330
So we're going to go back to 17.

135
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.800
17.

136
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.350
You know, just so it's a little smoother.

137
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.690
And let's see what that looks like.

138
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:41.460
So one thing you're noticing that is missing is when we do get here, our width should actually be like

139
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.390
15.

140
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:44.300
Oh no.

141
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.720
Sorry.

142
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.050
Ah.

143
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.070
With Shin be 15.

144
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.310
Ah.

145
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.280
With should be something like 19.

146
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:50.620
Oh.

147
00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:00.210
So it's squished and the height should be something like 15.

148
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.740
So this is just basically kind of getting you started.

149
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:14.630
You can tell that I'm going to leave this animation for everyone and you can just see that jump.

150
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.700
Let's see.

151
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.670
Squish.

152
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.840
Losing momentum.

153
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.920
And everything going back to normal.

154
00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:34.870
Hold briefly then everything gaining momentum and then spiraling downwards really quickly, much more

155
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.760
faster than it went upwards.

156
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.880
And when it hits the ground, squish.

157
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.300
So you can just kind of copy this and gradually go lower.

158
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.320
You don't have to.

159
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:49.900
What you can do now is you can just kind of hold this and kind of loop a gif together.

160
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:55.150
What I would do next is you can either export it as CSS or a JSON file.

161
00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:02.080
What I usually do is I go and I click render and you can choose whatever format you can choose GIF and

162
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.210
the frame rate and enable the loop.

163
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.050
And you can set any transparency color if you want.

164
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:13.030
If I have my frame with no transparency and then once you render it, it will actually take some time

165
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.020
to render in the background.

166
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:20.380
There's a little percentage and it'll give you an actual link where you can go and download it.

167
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.660
So that's it for how to use fake motion.

168
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.990
I mean, you can make some really awesome animations, as you can see.

169
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.110
Here's our render just plain out really nicely.

170
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:34.450
And once you get that gif, all you have to do is drag and drop that right into your file and you have

171
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.220
a gif that you can use.

172
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:43.870
Put it inside a frame and you can use it as an overlay if you need to for CART and anything else.

173
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:49.000
So that's how you make an easy animation within FIG motion.
