1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,630
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:07,750
So what I wanted to teach you really quickly is just how to create a very quick prototype.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,010
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create another square.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,090
Surprise, surprise.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,940
So we're going to create a square.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,400
We're going to set it to the middle here.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,670
And we're going to select this frame and we're going to copy and we're going to paste it.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,150
So I'm going to do a command C and command V and there we go.

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,550
We have two different.

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,380
Frames here.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,330
And we're going to rename these frames.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,650
So I'm going to select this frame.

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,840
I'm going to select my shortcut, which is command R or I can actually just double click in this layer

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,770
or this frame, and I'm going to need this frame one and I'm going to name this one.

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,730
Frame two.

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,010
Now, next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to click prototype.

17
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,160
Now we don't need to select a device, but if you're on a phone, you can do that if you like.

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,300
It looks really nice.

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,720
You can set the background.

20
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,700
You can set your starting frame.

21
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,310
In this case, what I'm going to do is I'm going to select this frame and.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,860
What I can do is I can even select the objects within this frame.

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,480
So if you had a button, you can imagine if I click this button, I want to go to this page.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,210
So all you're doing is clicking this and dragging it.

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,270
So on click you'll see these interaction details and we're going to get into this later in much more

26
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,200
detail, in depth, and we're going to talk about how to create some really nice animations.

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,600
We're going to talk about how to prototype some really cool prototypes, and it's going to look pretty,

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,620
pretty accurate.

29
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,680
It's going to look like it's a coded design or a coded app, and you'll be able to impress clients.

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,200
You'll be able to even press the users when you're testing with them.

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,610
But this is just the basics.

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,160
So let's just show you how to just make a simple click and we can go on from there.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,780
So we're going to select on click and we're going to navigate to frame two.

34
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,330
And this is going to be just an instant animation.

35
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,160
That's all we're going to do.

36
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,440
Now, I'm going to click this little play button up here.

37
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,890
Two Click present that's going to open up a new tab.

38
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,420
And this is my prototype.

39
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,080
You'll see, even when I'm in here, I can hover over it.

40
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,560
You have prototyping options if you want to kind of fit it to your screen, if you want to show hotspots.

41
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,150
So if I click anywhere away from here, it'll show me my hotspot.

42
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,390
So if I click on this, it's going to go to my next frame.

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,500
If I click, ah, I can restart that.

44
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,350
So if I click or go back to the beginning.

45
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,350
Pretty cool.

46
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,240
Now let's go back.

47
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,890
I'm going to close this tab.

48
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,610
And I'm actually going to make sure that if I click this, I'm going to go back and I'm going to add

49
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,650
something really cool.

50
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:55,960
I'm going to click Smart Animate, just to give you a sneak preview of what cool things you're going

51
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,220
to be doing in the future.

52
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,120
So smart animate is actually going to animate this because they're name the same.

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,870
So rectangle one and rectangle one, it's going to think they're the exact same layer.

54
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,590
And that means that when this clicks there, it's going to twist.

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,230
So let's see, I click play.

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,040
And click Ah, and I'm on my first frame.

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,820
I'm going to click it.

58
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,770
And you can fine tune these animations to do some really cool things like buttons, growing, cards

59
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,060
growing, all that kind of stuff.

60
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,800
And I'm going to show you how to do that later.

61
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,860
So that's how you prototype easily within Figma, just by connecting frames if you want to test something

62
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,990
quickly and just to see what it looks like.
