1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,469
Hey, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,180
Now, this is going to be a pretty exciting lesson.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,350
We just created some wireframes and I have several of those wireframes here, as you can see.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,070
And we're going to use them to actually create our first prototype.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,970
Now we're going to get into the basics of it and how you can link together something really quick that

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,310
you can test with users, or you can just show to your clients, or you can just show off to your team.

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,260
So let's go right over here.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,500
You'll notice that when you want to design, this is what you would click.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,050
You would click this little design tab.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,950
But if you want to get into prototyping, you click the prototype tab.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,470
Now we are going to be working on mobile.

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,200
The first thing you want to do is select a device.

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,540
Now they have a bunch of different variations.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,150
You can even create custom sizes if you want.

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:57,150
If I'm on mobile, I'll probably use like a phone size depending on maybe the type of frame I'm using.

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,750
So in this instance, I'm going to use the iPhone 11 pro device over here.

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,099
You can even like.

18
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,740
Select the model, whether that's gold, midnight, green, silver space, gray, like let's just go

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,560
for space gray, keep it really relaxed.

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,400
And you can even like adjust the background color.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,170
You can see like a little preview of that.

22
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,340
So.

23
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,590
There you go.

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,650
I just changed it to, like, a very light grey over here.

25
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,250
We can just see a preview of what that could look like.

26
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,480
If we go to present.

27
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,610
So this is our presentation view.

28
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,040
So now we can see, like, our app is actually in here.

29
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,250
Wow.

30
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,250
And.

31
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,970
But, like, we can't click anything, so it doesn't really work.

32
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,170
We can, like, tap through it.

33
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,330
Like, if we press our arrow keys, we can, like, go through all the different types of options there

34
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,350
are, but that's about it right now.

35
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,060
So let's get out of here.

36
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,530
So it opens up a new tab.

37
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,940
Like we'll I'll show you again.

38
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,130
Just opens up a new tab right there.

39
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,870
You can close that.

40
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,610
You can keep it open if you want.

41
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,590
And the updates you make here will reflect in that presentation, which is also awesome.

42
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:19,550
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you like you can also switch the orientation if you need

43
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,120
to.

44
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,140
This orientation like determines which way your prototype is presented.

45
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,550
Typically you just leave a vertical so you can leave that like that.

46
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,840
Your background color I mentioned, you can change it to whatever you want.

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,680
I like to keep it like a little bit of contrast between that and the device.

48
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,300
It really depends what I'm prototyping.

49
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,760
If I'm like prototype interaction outside of like a device just on a frame of its own, I probably may

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,850
keep it like white.

51
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,800
I don't know.

52
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,240
It's up to you, really.

53
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,330
And another very important thing is your starting frame.

54
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,340
So this is essentially.

55
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,760
Like a frame that your prototype should start on.

56
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,320
So I'm going to select home.

57
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,180
That is my starting frame.

58
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,920
So you can like set or update the starting frame from the prototype settings if you want.

59
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,110
There you go.

60
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,240
There's our starting frame.

61
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:08,660
Ooh.

62
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,740
So you can you can change that if you want.

63
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,880
But just because I made a connection, it goes away.

64
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,560
If there's no connections, apparently.

65
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,540
If I link it to this item, then it'll definitely stay.

66
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,370
So let's get right into it.

67
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,290
Triggers.

68
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,940
Now the trigger determines what type of interaction with, like, the hotspot will cause the prototype

69
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,630
to, like, advance.

70
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,760
So I'll show you what I mean.

71
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,350
So if I clicked on this little heart at the bottom here, this heart icon to go to the wish list page.

72
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,910
This is the trigger, this little dropdown.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,840
So there's different triggers right now we have on clicker on top and that basically like when a user

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,150
clicks on desktop or a user taps on mobile on the hot spot, and I'll show you what that looks like.

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,840
So there's my hotspot right there.

76
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,899
If I click that, that's what's going to happen.

77
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,010
So let's go back to our designs so you can use them for navigation, opening links, using menus or

78
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:30,680
exploring websites, or when you need input from a user to click on buttons, fill in forms, or confirm

79
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,060
and dismiss alerts.

80
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,680
You also have on drag.

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,810
So that allows you to perform an action.

82
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,240
When you drag an element on the screen, this can be like an entire frame or like a single element.

83
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,280
I'll show you what that looks like.

84
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,270
So.

85
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,540
I'm just going to create a copy here.

86
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,950
I'm going to remove this selection.

87
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,220
And.

88
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,560
I'm actually going to go into my design and I'm going to select these.

89
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,990
I'm going to Option Command G.

90
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,180
I go top, I'm going to option command g.

91
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,460
All right.

92
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,700
That's a frame one.

93
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,370
So that's another option.

94
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm going to show you what that looks like.

95
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm going to select this whole frame.

96
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,260
I'm going to go to my prototype and I'm going to do on drag.

97
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,780
It'll go to this.

98
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,190
So I'll go to this page and should drag the element.

99
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,320
Let's go take a look.

100
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,490
Whoa.

101
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,030
There you go.

102
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,200
You can even do on drag.

103
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,730
So that's another trigger.

104
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,560
The next trigger on our list is while hovering.

105
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,550
And what I'm going to do here, I'm going to select these.

106
00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:01,360
I'm actually going to make a copy of this home page and I'm going to make this fill.

107
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,030
Let's just turn it.

108
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,600
There you go.

109
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,690
I think that's fine.

110
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,590
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go to my prototype.

111
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,680
I'm going to select this.

112
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,610
And when I hover, I'm going to go to this page.

113
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,690
Look at that.

114
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,390
You can see that it is actually hovering really awesome.

115
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,830
That's the next trigger.

116
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,770
The other trigger we have in store.

117
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:46,940
So let's delete this kind of just creating like home page variants so we can show off all these triggers.

118
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,590
We can have like while pressing.

119
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,560
So triggers this action basically like you hold the mouse or trackpad on a desktop and when you tap

120
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,540
and hold on a mobile device.

121
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:02,030
So you can use this for navigating like dropdown menus or replicating long press interactions, you

122
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,250
know, like viewing a preview on iOS.

123
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,270
When you release this, we will take the user back to the original frame.

124
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,210
So I'll show you what that looks like.

125
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:13,730
Actually.

126
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,860
Let's do something with this over here.

127
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,050
We are just going to make that block.

128
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,480
So when we do.

129
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,270
While pressing.

130
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,530
We are going to go to this page.

131
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,060
Let's see what it looks like.

132
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,500
I just clicked.

133
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,600
And there you go.

134
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,000
You have a little interaction.

135
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,320
Some really simple stuff.

136
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,560
Let's see what else we can do here.

137
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,370
The next one is key or gamepad.

138
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,540
I mean, I'm not going to go over that one right now because we're not necessarily creating a game.

139
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,960
There's Mouse Enter, which basically shows the destination frame that you selected when the mouse enters

140
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,340
the hotspot area.

141
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,760
This could be like a small area, like a button or like an entire section.

142
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,530
So you can also like set up what happens afterwards.

143
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,540
So what I'm going to do here is.

144
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,010
I'm going to do something similar to what I had.

145
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,250
Let's change this, Phil to like red.

146
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,300
Ooh, that's really harsh.

147
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,320
Let's change the black.

148
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:25,060
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go into my prototype, I'm going to select Mouse Enter,

149
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,860
and that's going to go here.

150
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,960
And when I select, I'm going to go back.

151
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,720
I'm going to do on mouse leave.

152
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,130
So let's take a look at what that looks like.

153
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,640
So as you can tell, like mouse enter most mouse sleeve works perfectly and you can create a little

154
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,390
interaction like that.

155
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:52,780
This is great for like stuff like on desktop, the same concept applies to the next two which are like

156
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,790
touch down and touch up.

157
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:01,930
So all you need to do is like when you click and when you release or when you tap and remove the tap

158
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,320
so we can do the exact same thing.

159
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,760
Touch down.

160
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,370
Touch up and if we were to preview that.

161
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,000
So it's just going to always default to this one.

162
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,290
Touch down, click.

163
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,300
Touch up, gone.

164
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:23,990
Touch down.

165
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,940
Click a touch up.

166
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,520
Gone.

167
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,710
So really easy to use.

168
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,530
The triggers are pretty awesome.

169
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,680
Another cool thing is.

170
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,280
Let's just remove this altogether.

171
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,420
What we're going to do is we're going to create, like three frames.

172
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,390
Okay.

173
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,750
So I'm going to connect this to this.

174
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,520
Just by clicking.

175
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,660
Maybe we'll have a state change so we know that we're on this page.

176
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,730
So we'll change it to black.

177
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,370
And then after a delay, this is going to happen.

178
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,450
So let's go to our prototype.

179
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,640
It's going to go back to normal after a delay.

180
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,360
Or, you know what?

181
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,730
We can even, like, shift this whole thing over after a delay.

182
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,410
I don't know.

183
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,720
It's just something to show you how it works.

184
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,460
So I'm going to click the whole frame and I'm going to click after DeLay.

185
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,180
And I have 800 milliseconds.

186
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,950
And it's going to go to it's going to navigate to home.

187
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,100
So let me show you what that looks like.

188
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,840
So I see my hot spot there.

189
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,770
I'm just clicking.

190
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,210
I click.

191
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,450
And you saw that it changed after 800 milliseconds.

192
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,150
So if we go back to our frame you again.

193
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,130
Boom.

194
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,940
Gone.

195
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,250
So those are the different types of triggers you can use within Figma.

196
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,700
I mean, use them wisely.

197
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,940
Don't like do what I just did there because that's kind of confusing.

198
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,580
But you may want to use that for like if you're building like a email notification list and like a new

199
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,240
email pops up and you want to show what that interaction looks like, does it fade in and fade out?

200
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,360
I mean, we can get more in detail in terms of like what that looks like in a later lesson when we get

201
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,480
into like micro interactions.

202
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,490
But for basic prototyping, this is just really good to just do like instant actions just to get it

203
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,210
done quickly.

204
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,630
You don't necessarily need to spend so much time figuring out all these triggers.

205
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:26,290
I typically only use like on tap for like everything at this point because I just want to get like a

206
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,060
prototype link together to test.

207
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,390
We're going to learn a little bit more in our next video.
