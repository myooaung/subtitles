00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.390
Okay.

2
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.210
You may be asking some really good questions right now, like Daniel, how do I actually apply these

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.960
design patterns as they're like a process?

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.600
Well, of course there's a process, and I'm going to teach you that right now.

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.670
So there are so many design pattern libraries out there.

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.020
But I mean, that doesn't necessarily mean that you need to go through every single library and just

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.740
like start picking out all these different types of design patterns and applying all of them.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.000
Don't do that.

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.480
Now there are solutions to usability problems, and if you don't have a usability problem, then you

10
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.150
shouldn't necessarily apply some sort of solution where it doesn't need to be.

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.260
But I'll tell you the proper way to actually assess if you need to choose a certain design pattern and

12
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.720
what that process looks like.

13
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.970
So step number one, you need to have some sort of problem.

14
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.600
So figure out the problems that actually require the solutions.

15
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.610
Step number two, analyze other products that have found a solution.

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.970
So that means just kind of go and find similar websites, similar products to yours that have a solution

17
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.160
to your problem.

18
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.760
It could be similar to yours.

19
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.640
It could be almost the same.

20
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.930
It could us like variance.

21
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.310
It could be entirely different.

22
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.010
But take a look at what your competitors are doing.

23
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.400
Once we've examined how other products actually implement these solutions, or once we take a look at

24
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.010
what products actually do we need to actually analyze that efficiency of that solution.

25
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.290
So take a look in more depth on how each product actually works.

26
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.160
Like is it going to be a good fit for your product?

27
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.720
Is it working for them?

28
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.790
I mean, it's just take a deeper look at exactly what those people are doing.

29
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.010
And then once you've kind of chosen a pattern, analyze those patterns and decide which one is right

30
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.660
for you and your problem.

31
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.610
So, I mean, that could mean that you found a certain pattern that you like and you dig deeper to see

32
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.610
other similar products that have that pattern and you can decide which variant would help you better.

33
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.170
So step number one is to kind of detect those types of issues, but you should be doing that with actual

34
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.980
data.

35
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.759
Now you can detect that with things like user interviews.

36
00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.080
It could be with like data from something like amplitude that tracks like user inputs and drop off rates

37
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.140
and stuff like that.

38
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.870
Mixed panels, another one.

39
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.320
But you should always make your decisions based off of that instead of making it based off of assumptions.

40
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.380
Now let's take a step back and let's come up with an example.

41
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.620
So say we have an e-commerce site with a very high bounce rate.

42
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.900
Now we've checked like our mixed panel or amplitude, and we found that people are dropping off right

43
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.520
at checkout.

44
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.690
That's where the big bounce rate is from.

45
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.660
And based off of some feedback from users, we have a really long signup form and sign up all right

46
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.320
at the end.

47
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.390
And we think that's where the problem lies.

48
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.920
So step one is is pretty much done here.

49
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.580
We have our problem and it's very clear and we can kind of proceed to the next stage.

50
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.570
And that next stage is to analyze similar websites.

51
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.050
So the first step is, you know, visiting all those different websites or products.

52
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.060
So in our case, it's going to be websites and they may be similar to yours and we're going to analyze

53
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.860
their approaches to solving this issue.

54
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.450
So we have Amazon here.

55
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.860
So this is Mzansi and their solution is a sign up wall similar to ours.

56
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.430
It's not a long form, it's very short form, but it's a similar signup wall before actually purchasing

57
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.780
a product.

58
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.100
We're going to get into the actual efficiency of that later.

59
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.040
Now, the second option we have here is eBay.

60
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.210
Now, eBay has something similar.

61
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.420
There is a guest purchase at the end.

62
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.360
Users can easily check out with PayPal, and PayPal has your shipping address most likely.

63
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.770
That's another design pattern that we can use, like a guest checkout instead of having people actually

64
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.600
sign in.

65
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.100
So we'll take a look at the efficiency of that later.

66
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.840
And then we have Etsy.

67
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.010
Now Etsy has a social login if you don't want to actually sign up.

68
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.500
So we can have people actually sign in easily through social media and a lot of people actually have

69
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.980
social media.

70
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.070
So we'll take a look at that efficiency as well in the next section.

71
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.300
So these are three different design patterns and we don't necessarily need to use every single one of

72
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.570
them, but we're going to figure out which one is going to be right for us.

73
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:25.410
So I'm going to jump into Google Chrome to take a look at all these different websites, and we can

74
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.530
go through the efficiency of each and every pattern.
