00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.830
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:06.930
In this section, we're going to be talking about some advanced topics in CSIS, and I'm going to start

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.730
off with the critical render path.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.680
What is that?

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Well, we always should know how things work underneath the hood so we can make our websites as fast

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.270
and reliable as possible.

7
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.400
So based on what we've built in the previous section, let's look at what's happening underneath the

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.850
hood.

9
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.720
We are going to our website and ideally our website will be on a server and I'll show you how to do

10
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.250
that later on in the course.

11
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:40.360
For now, it's just our computer, but let's pretend we have a server where our files are hosted.

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.780
When we go to our website, we'll call it cool website dotcom.

13
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.350
We request the HTML file.

14
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.010
And the browser now sees our HTML file.

15
00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.750
So it's reached through this document and as it's looking through, it notices that, Oh, I need a

16
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.100
CSS file here.

17
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.910
So it goes back, makes another request and says, Hey, can you please give me a CSS file as well?

18
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.700
The server says, yep, no problem.

19
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.960
Let me grab that for you.

20
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.320
Grabs the CSS file and now it starts looking at both.

21
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.530
The HTML and the CSS file to try and figure out how the web page should look.

22
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.290
But then it also notices that.

23
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.820
Hold on a second.

24
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.770
I need some fonts as well.

25
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.940
So it goes to this address and looks for a font again.

26
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.010
The website now asks the website that the fonts are hosted at.

27
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.290
In our case is the Google API and it grabs the font file.

28
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.900
Now, here's the thing.

29
00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:02.260
While it's grabbing the font file, it could render the page, and rendering means displaying the website.

30
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.280
So it could display the website if it only has the HTML and CSS, but it might not show up the text

31
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.570
because the text is looking for the font file.

32
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.880
So when we talk about the critical render path, we like to mention that CSS is a render blocking file,

33
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.960
so you won't be able to render a web page until you receive your CSS.

34
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.450
And sometimes if you have font files, you'll also have to wait for the text to render on the page.

35
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.750
So keep that in mind when you build your websites.

36
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.600
But what are some things that we can consider when doing this so that our websites load up faster?

37
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.480
One is maybe to have our own font files.

38
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.040
Another one might be that you don't want to make your CSS too big.

39
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.460
If we had hundreds and hundreds of lines of code of CSS while the file gets bigger and bigger and it's

40
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.520
more and more that you have to transfer over the wire.

41
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.380
One method that people have used and you'll see often is something called magnifying your CCIS.

42
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.170
And if we open up a browser here not.

43
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.860
Good morning.

44
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.230
Yeah, it's early in the morning that I'm filming this.

45
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.180
And CSS minifie.

46
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.930
What it does is you can enter your CSIS here.

47
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.580
You can see an example over here.

48
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.020
So you enter this and you click Minifie.

49
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.100
And what minifie does, it removes all the white space.

50
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.970
So everything is on one line, just really tiny together.

51
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:43.500
So even though it's the same CSIS, it technically makes the file a little bit smaller so that the number

52
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.060
of bytes that you're sending over the Internet is a lot less.

53
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.160
And you'll see that technique used in JavaScript as well, and we'll talk about that in that section.

54
00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.870
But that is the critical render path, a path that a website takes to display something to the user.

55
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.120
I'll see in the next one.

56
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.930
Bye bye.
