00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.900
Okay.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.610
So next, what I want to teach you about is the left panel.

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.790
So we have the layers panel, we have assets and we have pages.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.230
So let's get right into that.

5
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.020
So this is the page that we're on right now, but sometimes a file could have multiple pages.

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.150
Sometimes I'm working on different types of concepts, or I may have the high fidelity designs and then

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.040
the prototypes right after that.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.430
So what I would usually do is I would select this page so you can see, and if I double click on it,

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.770
I can easily edit and I can say We'll call this one concepts.

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.830
And if I click this little plus button right here, I can add a new page and I can call this one something

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.120
like prototypes.

12
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.460
And if you just toggle between the two, you'll notice that I don't have anything on the prototypes,

13
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.500
but I have something on the concepts page.

14
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.720
I have this frame of this desktop.

15
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.010
Now this frame is a layer.

16
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.010
If I want to create a new one, I'll just copy that.

17
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.550
You can right click or double click.

18
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.570
It depends what your settings are on your computer, but if you right click, you can see the copy.

19
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.990
Right at the bottom.

20
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.030
You can copy properties and paste properties.

21
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.530
Or you can just in the case of a MacBook, you can just do a command C and command V and I'll have my

22
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.910
new frame right there.

23
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.190
And now these are two separate layers.

24
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:47.300
Now within the actual frame I can start placing stuff, so I will select R to select the rectangle tool.

25
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.200
And there we go.

26
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.370
That's a one layer.

27
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:58.710
But if I copy that layer, so I'm going to command C and I click this frame, I can paste it with command

28
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.380
V and now I have a layer here too.

29
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.620
So now I have two layers and I can rename that if I want.

30
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.680
They show you the shortcuts all along here.

31
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.870
So Command R is the shortcut in this case.

32
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:17.370
So if I click it Command R, I will have the option to rename this so I can say rectangle two.

33
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.160
And if I wanted to say Hey, I wanted to select both of these, I can click this and hold down shift

34
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.810
and click the next one and copy both of them and go to the next page and paste them.

35
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.290
And I can have my frames and my layers all there, all in another page, easily accessible.

36
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.460
And you can rename them any which way you want.

37
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:56.030
So this is essentially where a lot of our stuff is going to live, all within the layers and pages panel

38
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.960
on the left.

39
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.650
Assets are something else entirely.

40
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.040
Assets are four components, and we're going to get into how to create components in a second.

41
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.940
But.

42
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.100
If I were to make this a component.

43
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.420
I can find this in my local components now and I can reuse it, but we're going to get into that very

44
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.990
soon.
