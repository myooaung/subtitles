Hello and welcome to the intuition tutorials for the artificial neural networks part of the course.

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.760
Super excited to get these things started.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.870
And today we're going to find out how we're going to tackle this section.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.760
So in this section we will learn the following things.

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.550
First of all we'll talk about the neuron so there'll be a little bit of neuroscience and we'll find

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.700
out a bit about how the human brain works and why we are trying to replicate that.

7
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.160
And we'll also see what the main building block of a neural network of the neuron looks like.

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.740
Then in the next tutorial We'll talk about the activation function and we'll look at a couple of examples

9
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.980
of attrition functions that you could use in your neural networks and we'll find out which ones of which

10
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.770
one of them is the most commonly used one in neural networks and in which layers you'd rather use which

11
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.770
functions.

12
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.430
There was talk about how neural networks work.

13
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.990
So in contrast to what you would expect and what it was probably conveyed in other courses and tutorials

14
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.800
we're not going to go into the learning we're actually going to go into the working of the neural networks

15
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.690
first because that way by seeing a neural network in action that will allow us to understand what we're

16
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.740
aiming towards what our goal is.

17
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.120
So here we'll look at an example of a neural network we're going to look at a very simplified and very

18
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.060
simplified hypothetical example or when your own network working to predict housing prices are basically

19
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.830
real estate prices.

20
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.350
And by looking at that example we'll understand better exactly what we're aiming towards and what we

21
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.620
want to achieve in the end.

22
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.560
And then we will move on to understanding how neural networks learn because that way we'll be more prepared

23
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.070
for what's coming.

24
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.010
Then we'll talk about gradient descent.

25
00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.750
This is also part of neural networks learning and we'll understand how that algorithm is better than

26
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.670
just the brute force method that you might be intending or willing to take as a first resort or first

27
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.140
method that comes to mind.

28
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.400
So we'll find out how great the advantage of gradient descent are.

29
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.130
And then we'll talk about stochastic gradient descent.

30
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.580
It's a it's a continuation of the great and decent tutorial but it's an even better and even stronger

31
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.120
method and we'll find out exactly how it works.

32
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.060
And finally we'll wrap things up by mentioning the important things about back propagation and summarizing

33
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.400
everything in a step by step set of instructions for running your artificial neural networks.

34
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.230
I hope this all sounds very exciting to you because I am very excited myself and I can't wait to get

35
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.810
started.

36
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.310
I look forward to seeing you on the first tutorial.

37
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.420
And until then enjoy deep learning.
