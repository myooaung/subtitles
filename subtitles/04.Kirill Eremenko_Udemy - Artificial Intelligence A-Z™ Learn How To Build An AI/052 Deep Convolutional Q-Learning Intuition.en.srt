00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,850
Hello and welcome back to the course on artificial intelligence.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,260
In today's tutorial we're starting off the section on deep convolutional cool learning.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,010
So let's have a look at what it's all about.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,040
Previously we talked about deep cool learning.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,270
So we had an environment where an agent and we had a vector describing that environment which was fed

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,310
into a neural network and at the end we got the q values as our outputs.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,970
And then of course we found out how to restrain the learning part.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,650
We found out how actions are decided based on those values that's an action part.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:42,380
And we talked about action selection policies and different things about how deep learning works.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:51,240
But here the key concept for all of this is how do we get from this from the actual environment and

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,450
the states to the neural network.

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,190
Well the transition is over here.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,250
The input vectors so the input Lehre of our neural network and it is a vector.

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,570
So what we're looking at is OK so we're actually edging on the curve.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,830
That's not the correct term we're not looking at anything.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,330
The agent basically has this information.

17
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,490
So the environment is parsing it this information saying OK you the agent you're currently in this your

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,160
state is described by the sector in this simplified example it's described by this vector X-1 of 1 x

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,410
2 of 2 so your coordinates are 1 2 and that is your whole state in a in a more complex environment.

20
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,920
The statement and all other things that the agent can be observing but the point here is that it is

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,040
possed as a vector.

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,750
And the thing is that that doesn't happen in real life in real life except for GPS systems and other

23
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,470
things like that.

24
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,830
But in real life what do we use most of the time we use our senses we use our eyes even in GPS.

25
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,670
It's not built into our brain.

26
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,420
It's not telling us the coordinates through our brain.

27
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,880
So we're still using our eyes to look at at the GPS and understand what's going on there.

28
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:09,310
And so this is kind of cheating for AI to be able to get like information about the environment as a

29
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:09,620
vector.

30
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,030
It's too simple it's not how it works in real life.

31
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,040
That's not how we as humans operate and ultimately we want to create artificial intelligence which can

32
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,310
operate in a similar fashion to humans which is as it can take on the same challenges as humans.

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,740
And so in the human world we don't have that we don't have that we don't have these coordinates or other

34
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,870
types of vectors that are passed to us that explain the state we're in in that environment.

35
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,350
So we're going to have to remove that to make it more realistic.

36
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,180
And then what can we replace it with what do we see or what do we do as a human to get information.

37
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,860
Well most of the time we see of course all our senses but most of the information that we're getting

38
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,300
about the out the world around us comes through our sight.

39
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:59,340
And that is why we're going to change that little arrow which we had into a whole convolutional neural

40
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,090
network.

41
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,700
So this is from our Onix.

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,400
Number two we've got the convulsion Larry and that's why it's important to be quite comfortable with

43
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,290
evolution conditional neural networks and how that works are you if you've done ODP intercourse and

44
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,910
you should be comfortable with that.

45
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,490
Or you can just have a look at the next number two we've got some very good intuition tutorials there.

46
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,160
So here we've got the convolutional operation which happens so we're actually going to be looking at

47
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,330
this as an image.

48
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,350
So this is an image of Net environment.

49
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,990
And so the agent is actually looking at the environment.

50
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,870
So in this case not that he's like looking from within there he's like looking like that.

51
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,710
Let's say he's playing this on a computer and he can see this environment and therefore he can see like

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,480
where this figure representing agent is actually actually is.

53
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,340
You can see his whole in viral or whatever a human would see if it's actual maze and the human would

54
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,270
see the maze from inside.

55
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,480
And so the agent should be able to exactly the same thing.

56
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,000
So what he says is done goes through a commotion lair you go sort of fool pulling a leg goes there flattening

57
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:10,140
again you can find out about more about these different parts of convolutional a neural network in the

58
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,680
annex and then officers flattened.

59
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:19,950
Then we have inputs which go into the neural network and this is a way more realistic because the agent

60
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:29,010
has to use their sites and or has to process images which the environment is supplying to the agent

61
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,590
just as a human would be processing images.

62
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,410
And the beauty of this is not just that it's more realistic and it's kind of like more as a hue.

63
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,280
The age is actually the more as a human would be but it allows us to process much more complex environments.

64
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,050
For instance this is how we can play Doom or other games like that because instead of just getting a

65
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:55,980
vector of information which like somebody would have created for us in this environment we can just

66
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,230
hook up artificial intelligence to any environment which as humans have a vision of is and.

67
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,280
As a human when you're playing this game you can see exactly this picture and that's exactly what the

68
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,450
artificial neural network or the agent would see now.

69
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,580
So in this part of the course when you're going to probing the practical Tournelles the agent will actually

70
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,890
see this exact picture it'll see the pixels it will get this exact picture full of the pixels of this

71
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,410
person with this we've gone with this face with this percentage with everything exactly what we see

72
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,710
here that's exactly what the agent will see.

73
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:37,470
Then it will have to dissect that through pulling liff fattening and then it'll go into a neural net.

74
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,150
And needless to say that the neural networks actually be much more complex than that so let's replace

75
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,780
it with something like this.

76
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,480
This is not much more complex.

77
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,350
This is looks a little bit more complex but in reality the neural networks are going to be working with

78
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,140
and creating if you are going to be quite interesting and going to be much more complex than this.

79
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,910
But as you can see already here even if you just have five inputs and sort of two things become a much

80
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,380
more complex and here you can see we have many more actions that the agent can take.

81
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,850
So in the game of doom turn left and right look down look up Ron's shoot reload.

82
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:16,290
Or you know all those different actions that are possible in first person should like like do.

83
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,430
And moreover it doesn't have to be that you can.

84
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,190
You can touch this agent to another type of game.

85
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:29,940
That's the beauty of it that it's then realizes that it can now operate any kind of environment that

86
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,260
you attach it to because as long as there's like a visual representation of environment of that environment

87
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,940
it's already got the whole infrastructure the whole structure is ready to process that.

88
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,980
So that's what deep convolutional CULE learning is all about.

89
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:51,120
So we're taking it even to the next step we're adding convolutions into or convolutional Lares into

90
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,980
our agents brain now and we're making it even more complex and therefore we can we're bored with being

91
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,260
able to solve even more complex challenges.

92
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,720
So I hope you're very excited about this is going to be in an epic section and we're going to create

93
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,460
some amazing things and I can't wait to see you on that next tutorial.

94
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,130
And until then enjoy AI.
