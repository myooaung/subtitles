00:00:01,743 --> 00:00:04,037
Spring Boot has been a game changer for the Java platform.

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,922
Before Spring Boot came around,

3
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:09,287
it wasn't uncommon for a developer to spend a few days

4
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:12,063
wiring an MVC framework to a persistence framework and

5
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:14,535
getting that talking to a database.

6
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:15,587
Did you catch that?

7
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:20,244
Days to get the app propped up before any real coding can take place.

8
00:00:20,244 --> 00:00:24,606
Spring Boot takes an opinionated view on how a Spring app should be constructed.

9
00:00:24,606 --> 00:00:25,263
By doing so,

10
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:28,479
you can now stand up a fully-wired application from controller

11
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:32,016
to database in just a matter of seconds.

12
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:35,950
Spring Boot prefers Spring frameworks, like Spring MVC and Spring Data,

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,568
which is one way it makes it opinionated,

14
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:40,752
but this also serves another purpose.

15
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:43,467
Spring Boot makes building applications very quick,

16
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:47,019
quick like Ruby on Rails, and Django, and Python quick.

17
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:47,354
Finally,

18
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:50,351
Spring Boot got away from container dependence and really

19
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:53,561
wants applications to be standalone Java apps.

20
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:56,024
This makes a lot of sense for cloud deployments.

21
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,706
Instead of deploying a WAR file to a Tomcat container,

22
00:00:58,706 --> 00:00:59,549
for example,

23
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,768
Spring Boot embeds Tomcat inside of the app and produces a self-contained JAR

24
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:08,101
file that can be run on its own using the Java command.

25
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,829
As fun as it might be to talk about how awesome Spring Boot is,

26
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:18,000
I know that you're really here to code and get your hands dirty with Spring Boot, so let's go ahead and get started.
