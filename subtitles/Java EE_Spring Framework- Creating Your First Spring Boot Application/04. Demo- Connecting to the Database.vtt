00:00:01.588 --> 00:00:04.283
The Spring Boot app is created, we have a database in place,

2
00:00:04.283 --> 00:00:06.657
and we have a basic overview and understanding of

3
00:00:06.657 --> 00:00:08.422
what we're going to be building.

4
00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:09.138
So first up,

5
00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:13.276
we need to add a starter dependency that will include the Spring

6
00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:17.274
Data JPA library and then connect it to Postgres.

7
00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:18.934
If you remember, in Spring Boot,

8
00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.916
all of our dependencies are managed in the Maven POM file,

9
00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:24.342
so I'm going to go ahead and open that file up,

10
00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:27.104
and I'll scroll down to the dependency section.

11
00:00:27.104 --> 00:00:30.248
Underneath the spring-boot-starter-web dependency,

12
00:00:30.248 --> 00:00:36.796
I'm going to add the new dependency like this called spring-boot-starter-jpa.

13
00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:39.745
Since we're also using a Postgres DB for this application,

14
00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:43.550
we need to add the Postgres JDBC driver dependency so that

15
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.807
we can properly connect to the database.

16
00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:50.595
We can do that by adding this dependency.

17
00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:51.808
Go ahead and save the file,

18
00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:55.259
and you'll notice that IntelliJ is asking you if you want to

19
00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:57.212
import the Maven changes that you just made.

20
00:00:57.212 --> 00:00:58.506
We do want to bring these in,

21
00:00:58.506 --> 00:01:01.293
so I'm going to go ahead and click on that link to have

22
00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:04.552
those pulled in and added to my project.

23
00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:07.063
Once IntelliJ is done synching the dependencies,

24
00:01:07.063 --> 00:01:09.519
we can go ahead and close that tab.

25
00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:11.723
At this point, we're almost done with getting connected.

26
00:01:11.723 --> 00:01:16.981
The last piece is to tell Spring Boot what the Postgres connection URL is.

27
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:21.448
That information will be added to our properties file,

28
00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:24.991
which in Spring Boot, will be in src, main,

29
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:27.669
resources, application.properties.

30
00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:29.875
Go ahead and open that file.

31
00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:31.603
Currently, this file is empty.

32
00:01:31.603 --> 00:01:34.903
I'm going to go ahead and add the following properties.

33
00:01:34.903 --> 00:01:36.874
If you remember from the previous clip,

34
00:01:36.874 --> 00:01:41.094
you need to know what your URL is to your database.

35
00:01:41.094 --> 00:01:42.359
In this particular instance,

36
00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.854
my URL is located here at the datasource.url property.

37
00:01:46.854 --> 00:01:51.612
Your URL might be slightly different depending on what port you're using,

38
00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:53.975
what you named the database, and so on.

39
00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:56.830
I've also managed to set up my database that doesn't

40
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.398
require a username or password.

41
00:01:58.398 --> 00:02:02.602
Yours may need this information, especially if you're using the Docker container.

42
00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:06.346
And the last three properties should be able to be universal,

43
00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:08.720
and you can set those as seen here.

44
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.185
I'm going to go ahead and save the file.

45
00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:12.316
And at this point,

46
00:02:12.316 --> 00:02:21.000
we're now done getting Spring Data JPA and JPA installed into our application and connected to our database.
