00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.949
In some ways, deploying applications have gotten easier,

2
00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:06.724
and in some ways, deployments have gotten harder.

3
00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:11.687
You have a lot of choices you day in should I deploy to a cloud environment,

4
00:00:11.687 --> 00:00:13.113
should I run my app on rack servers,

5
00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:16.445
should my app be an executable JAR file or a WAR file,

6
00:00:16.445 --> 00:00:17.277
and so on?

7
00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:19.323
To help you pick a strategy that will work for your project,

8
00:00:19.323 --> 00:00:20.955
I'm going to run through these options,

9
00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:25.577
as well as discuss the correct way of packaging and bunding a Spring Boot

10
00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:29.852
application that includes the JAR option and the WAR file options.

11
00:00:29.852 --> 00:00:32.282
Now that we have a robust enough conference API-based application,

12
00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:38.000
let's take it to the last and final step, and that's getting it deployed.
