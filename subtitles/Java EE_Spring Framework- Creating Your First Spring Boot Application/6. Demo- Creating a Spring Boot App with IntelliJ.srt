00:00:01,604 --> 00:00:02,322
For this next clip,

2
00:00:02,322 --> 00:00:06,364
I'm going to show you an alternative way to create a Spring Boot application.

3
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:08,570
If you aren't interested in this or you don't have

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,999
a licensed version of IntelliJ, you can go ahead and skip ahead to the next clip.

5
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:17,320
If you do happen to have an IntelliJ Ultimate edition and a paid license,

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,857
you can also easily create a Spring Boot project right from the IDE.

7
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:23,740
This time, instead of importing the project,

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,492
we're just going to go ahead and create a new

9
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:29,644
project by clicking on that button.

10
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:30,758
On the left-hand-side menu,

11
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:33,943
find the Spring Initializr item and click on it and

12
00:00:33,943 --> 00:00:36,922
then select your Project SDK version.

13
00:00:36,922 --> 00:00:39,960
I'm simply going to use the default recommendation of

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,817
version 12 and then click Next.

15
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:47,491
At this point, IntelliJ has communicated with the Spring Initializr site,

16
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:50,529
and it wraps it in a nice IntelliJ dialog.

17
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:53,300
I can now set up the group and artifact IDs,

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,118
select my Maven, pom.xml, and Java version.

19
00:00:56,118 --> 00:01:00,227
So I'll go ahead and customize those quickly.

20
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:04,659
I've set the Group to com.pluralsight and the artifact to conference-demo.

21
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:07,490
I'll leave it as a Maven project with the Java language,

22
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,935
and I'm going to bump up the Java version to something a little newer.

23
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:16,163
And when I'm happy with my settings, I'll go ahead and click Next.

24
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:16,708
At this point,

25
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,991
I can select my dependencies and integrations that I want

26
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:23,603
to bring into my Spring Boot project, and I want to use the Web,

27
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:27,264
so I'll select that and click Next.

28
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:33,467
I'll leave the Project name and Project location as is and just click Finish.

29
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,907
IntelliJ will go ahead and download from the Spring

30
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:38,586
Initializr site and pull that into the app,

31
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:41,000
and you're ready to get started.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,706
I'm going to simply just rearrange some things,

33
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:46,736
close the Maven dialog, open up the Project tab,

34
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:49,508
and this should look pretty much exactly like the

35
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:51,640
community edition at this point.

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,694
There's one other way that you can work with Spring Boot

37
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:56,452
that's a little different than any type of Java development

38
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:58,549
that you might have done before.

39
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:04,000
Coming up next, we'll take a look at the Spring Boot CLI, command line interface.
