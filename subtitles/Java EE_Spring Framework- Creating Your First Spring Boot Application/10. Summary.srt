00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:05,015
Spring Boot makes configuration very easy to use and work with.

2
00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:09,440
There are, however, a lot of options on how you can customize your application.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,619
Here's what you should have learned in this section of the course.

4
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:12,863
First,

5
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:15,036
you should know that Spring Boot looks for

6
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:17,150
configuration files on the class path.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,227
Your project will typically utilize the src, main, resources folder for this.

8
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:26,718
Spring Boot can read and work with property files and YAML files.

9
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:30,878
There is also an order of precedence of when and their values are

10
00:00:30,878 --> 00:00:35,062
configured from external to internal configuration sources.

11
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:35,230
Next,

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,675
you need to be aware of all the common Spring Boot properties that are provided

13
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:42,612
out of the box by Spring and the various Spring starters.

14
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:46,963
These are your first area of customization when you need to

15
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,019
modify something in your application.

16
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:50,397
When it comes to your application,

17
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:54,722
Spring Boot can load in specific files based off of Spring profiles that

18
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:58,043
will override and customize your app per environment.

19
00:00:58,043 --> 00:01:02,377
This is the right, or correct, way to handle moving your app from development,

20
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:06,117
to test, to staging, to prod, and so on.

21
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:08,173
Simply provide appropriate environment files

22
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:11,039
configured for each environment profile.

23
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:16,126
Finally, you can start to get fancy with configuration and handle it all in Java.

24
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:18,336
You can even create your own auto-configuration classes

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,705
and starter JAR files for your apps.

26
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:23,701
And that's it for configuration.

27
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,882
The only thing that we have left to do is to figure out the right

28
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:34,000
way to deploy our Spring Boot applications, which we'll be covering in the next section of the course.
