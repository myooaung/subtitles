1
00:00:01,591 --> 00:00:04,554
If you've ever used a command-line tool like Heroku's CLI or

2
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:08,101
used Ruby on Rails with its command-line tools,

3
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:11,111
the Spring Boot CLI is very similar.

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,336
If you aren't a power user and don't use the command line much, don't worry.

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,993
You don't have to give the CLI a try.

6
00:00:16,993 --> 00:00:17,751
You will, however,

7
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:22,228
be surprised what you can do without ever leaving your shell or terminal.

8
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:24,328
There are a couple ways of installing Spring Boot CLI,

9
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:27,494
and you can check out the installation options here at

10
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,846
the Spring Boot documentation URL.

11
00:00:30,846 --> 00:00:33,536
You can do a manual installation, or an SDKMAN,

12
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:38,776
or a Homebrew if you're on the macOS to get stuff installed.

13
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:45,037
At this time, I prefer the SDKMAN way, and you can install SDKMAN at sdkman.io,

14
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:49,186
and this tool is like RVM for Ruby or NVM for Node.

15
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:51,696
And once you have the SDK installed,

16
00:00:51,696 --> 00:00:55,851
you simply need to open a new terminal or shell.

17
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:57,895
Once you have SDKMAN installed,

18
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:07,129
you can easily install Spring Boot by typing sdk install springboot.

19
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:09,713
SDKMAN will install the latest version of Spring Boot.

20
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:11,016
And once that is completed,

21
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:14,460
you can then type spring at the command line to start using Spring

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,562
Boot in a more interactive mode type of way.

23
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:21,136
If you type spring without providing any particular subcommand,

24
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:23,337
it'll just show some help.

25
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:27,160
You can also type spring help to give you additional

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,941
options to run with this tool.

27
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:34,748
One of the commands that you might be interested in is spring init,

28
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:39,430
and this is yet another way that you can create a Spring Boot project.

29
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,132
You can also run groovy-based Spring Boot application

30
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:44,303
from the command line using spring run.

31
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:47,190
Since this course is focused on Java and Spring Boot,

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,940
I'm not going to go too in depth with the groovy,

33
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,027
but there are some pretty cool things that you can do in this space.

34
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:56,505
If you like the terminal and you're comfortable with it,

35
00:01:56,505 --> 00:02:05,000
you'll probably like the Spring Boot command-line install tools, and you should go back to the documentation to find out more information.
