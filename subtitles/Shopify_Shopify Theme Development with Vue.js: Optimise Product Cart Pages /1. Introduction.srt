00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,995
Hello and welcome to Shopify Theme Development with Vue.js. I'm Christopher Dodd.

2
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm a freelance web developer and top teacher here on Skillshare.com,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,255
covering all things web development and online freelancing.

4
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:16,140
In today's class, we're going to learn how to integrate the JavaScript Framework

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,475
Vue.js into the product and cart pages of a Shopify theme.

6
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:24,510
This class is ideal for those of you who have taken some of my other classes on

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,690
Shopify theme development here on Skillshare.com and are

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,125
ready to take their theme development skills to the next level.

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,880
With Vue.js, we're able to bring Shopify data structures onto

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,070
the front end and allow for the user to live

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,910
update elements without reloading the browser.

12
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,474
Using Vue.js over other JavaScript libraries like jQuery,

13
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:47,735
we can create a more optimal experience for both us as developers,

14
00:00:47,735 --> 00:00:51,530
as well as the end-users of our e-commerce store.

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,165
If you're ready to get started,

00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:57,150
