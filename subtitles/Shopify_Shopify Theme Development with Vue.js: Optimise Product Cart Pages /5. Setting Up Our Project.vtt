00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
We're going to start off the screenshare portion of this class

2
00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:09.210
inside my usual testing ground for Shopify themes, Chris Testing Shop.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.675
Obviously, you're going to need a Shopify store to work on.

4
00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:16.890
This is the case in any of my other Shopify theme development classes.

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.300
Keep in mind here, guys,

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.465
that we are focusing on a very particular area of Shopify theme development using Vue.js.

7
00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:27.170
We won't be covering things such as CSS,

8
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.360
how Shopify works, or the other things that go along with Shopify theme development.

9
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.360
It's expected that you know how to use Theme Kit.

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.000
It's expected that you understand CSS,

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.535
HTML, a little bit of JavaScript.

12
00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:45.155
We're going to be focusing specifically on Vue in this class.

13
00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:50.585
That's why I've created a starter project for us to work through in this class,

14
00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:53.915
as we don't want to build a theme from scratch,

15
00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:59.050
but we also want to use a theme that is as simplified as possible.

16
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.410
The way we're going to access this theme is by going to my GitHub account.

17
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.354
So github.com, and I believe,

18
00:01:06.354 --> 00:01:08.865
it's just "Christopher Dodd".

19
00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:12.590
Here we go. Inside Popular repositories,

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.165
you can see Skillshare,

21
00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:18.270
but there is a new one I've created here called "vue-class-theme".

22
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.815
We'll head back to the Skillshare repository in just a second.

23
00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:26.370
But what I want to do here is grab this "starting point" in

24
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.750
my vue-class-theme repository here and bring that into our code editor,

25
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.845
which for this class,

26
00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:35.215
is going to be VS Code.

27
00:01:35.215 --> 00:01:37.550
Of course, you can use whatever code editor you want,

28
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.815
I just prefer to use VS Code.

29
00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:43.370
It's free and it's powerful. Why not?

30
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.980
I'm going to open up VS Code,

31
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.640
click "New Window" here,

32
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.140
and run a New Terminal.

33
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.000
The way to get this repository is to grab

34
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.675
the URL here and then "git clone".

35
00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:09.305
There we go. That will be somewhere in our file structure,

36
00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:12.400
wherever we've got our terminal set up to go.

37
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.200
For me, it's going to be here in my user accounts.

38
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.940
There you can see, I'm just going to move that onto

39
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.790
the desktop just to make it a bit easier.

40
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.760
Then now, I can open this up.

41
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.295
I'm just going to open,

42
00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:31.305
head to that folder,

43
00:02:31.305 --> 00:02:33.010
and here it is.

44
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.650
Now, as is the case with all Shopify theme development,

45
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.380
we're going to have to set up a config.yml file.

46
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.895
I've covered that a few different times in the different YouTube videos I've done.

47
00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:49.175
It's been covered in the first class on Shopify theme development here on Skillshare,

48
00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.890
so we're not going to go through Theme Kit.

49
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.615
What I have got already inside the shared folder here,

50
00:02:55.615 --> 00:02:57.930
I've got my config.yml.

51
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.595
I'm just going to bring that in.

52
00:02:59.595 --> 00:03:02.385
Of course, the config.yml file has

53
00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:09.425
all the authentication details and the theme ID in order to actually log into the store.

54
00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:14.210
I'm going to close that one down once we have that.

55
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.885
The next step for us is going to be uploading this theme to our Shopify storefront.

56
00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:26.100
What I'm going to do for that is zip this up,

57
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.620
do Compress on a Mac.

58
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.725
Now it's zipped up, going to go back to my testing shop, click "Upload theme".

59
00:03:34.725 --> 00:03:39.015
Select the zip file. Hit "Upload".

60
00:03:39.015 --> 00:03:44.340
That'll take a little bit of time to upload and then we'll see it come up.

61
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:53.385
I'm just going to remove that capital V. Now,

62
00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:57.855
we should be able to click "Preview" and see a preview of our theme.

63
00:03:57.855 --> 00:03:59.875
On the homepage, there's nothing,

64
00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:02.525
but what I've got here is two links,

65
00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:06.040
one to shop the tee or shop shoes.

66
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.420
Now, we'll talk about the store data in just a second,

67
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.210
but let's have a look at what we've got so far.

68
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.660
We've got our t-shirt here and then we've

69
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.260
got our collection page where we have a range of shoes.

70
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Now, of course, this is all based on store data.

71
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.905
I mention this in pretty much every class,

72
00:04:23.905 --> 00:04:27.290
this is pulling from the information you have inside your store.

73
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.180
You're not going to have the exact same information as me,

74
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.630
but I've tried to make it as simple and as easy for you to get

75
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.235
started and get this up and running on your store as possible.

76
00:04:40.235 --> 00:04:43.430
What I've done is I've exported all these products.

77
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.410
Just have to go back to GitHub,

78
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.280
go into the Skillshare repository.

79
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.255
Here shoes and shirt CSV,

80
00:04:52.255 --> 00:04:56.030
if we import that into Shopify,

81
00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.530
then we're going to have all of these products in our store.

82
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.990
Here's a little video of what it looks

83
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.320
like when you're importing that information into a new store.

84
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.330
Now, you should have your theme uploaded and you

85
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.985
should have these products uploaded as well.

86
00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:15.050
If you want to follow along,

87
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.920
you can just use whatever products you have in your store right now if you want,

88
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.135
that's up to you.

89
00:05:20.135 --> 00:05:22.995
But now we've got the theme here.

90
00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:26.175
Let's connect our Theme Kit.

91
00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:29.240
As I usually do, going to open up,

92
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.625
customize, grab the theme ID of this theme.

93
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.915
Go into our config.yml file,

94
00:05:36.915 --> 00:05:39.465
update the theme ID here.

95
00:05:39.465 --> 00:05:41.330
To confirm that that works,

96
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.340
I'm going to open up a new terminal and run theme watch.

97
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:54.530
Now, you can see we're connected to that theme and we're now watching for changes.

98
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.875
The next step is getting our environment set up for Vue.

99
00:05:57.875 --> 00:05:59.015
But before we do that,

100
00:05:59.015 --> 00:06:04.190
I just want to familiarize you with the project as we haven't so far.

101
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.210
It's a very simple one.

102
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.335
This is based off a starter theme that's quite bare.

103
00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:11.720
You will see that there aren't a lot of assets,

104
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.030
there aren't any snippets here.

105
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.290
In fact, there are no sections either.

106
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.930
This is a very simple theme.

107
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.790
Obviously, if you have a production theme,

108
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.610
you would have more folders and files here.

109
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.905
We're just keeping it simple for this class.

110
00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:26.780
First thing I want to draw your attention to,

111
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.240
is the theme.css file.

112
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.880
I've already created these style rules.

113
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.870
I didn't want to spend time in this class creating CSS,

114
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.855
so I've put this all in a CSS file already for us.

115
00:06:39.855 --> 00:06:41.830
There's a theme JS file here.

116
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.730
We can put in our general JavaScript for the theme in here,

117
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.975
but we're using Vue and plugging in to store data.

118
00:06:50.975 --> 00:06:53.570
It's not really required for this class and we

119
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.210
won't be actually using this file in this class.

120
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.750
But this is an option as well for your general JavaScript.

121
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.075
I've also got a site logo here.

122
00:07:02.075 --> 00:07:03.905
This is just Chris Testing Shop.

123
00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:05.615
No matter what your store is,

124
00:07:05.615 --> 00:07:06.965
if you're using this theme,

125
00:07:06.965 --> 00:07:10.910
you will have the same logo unless you change this file.

126
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.870
I've got a trash icon for the cart page,

127
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.110
and I've got this script here,

128
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.260
which you can find here on GitHub if you wish.

129
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.735
Otherwise, it's included in the project already.

130
00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:29.060
It's a way to do the money formatting in Shopify via JavaScript.

131
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.155
Otherwise, you are stuck with Shopify liquid money formatting

132
00:07:33.155 --> 00:07:38.105
and that's not going to work when we're using JavaScript and Vue.js.

133
00:07:38.105 --> 00:07:40.385
That's your assets folder.

134
00:07:40.385 --> 00:07:44.570
I want to bring your attention next to the layout file.

135
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.660
We've got a pretty basic layout file here.

136
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.210
I can see I've included slick slider,

137
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.785
which has been removed.

138
00:07:51.785 --> 00:07:54.875
That'll be removed for your version of the theme.

139
00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:58.190
Basically, what we've got is theme CSS included,

140
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.910
that's the only extra CSS that we've got included.

141
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:07.760
We're including this Shopify money script so it can format Shopify money values.

142
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.785
I've included jQuery as well.

143
00:08:09.785 --> 00:08:14.960
JQuery is handy for doing our AJAX requests.

144
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.630
Otherwise, if we use Vanilla JavaScript,

145
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.340
the code ends up looking messy,

146
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.160
and it's just so much easier to use jQuery.

147
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.785
I've included jQuery there as well.

148
00:08:24.785 --> 00:08:26.735
Those are a few dependencies.

149
00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:30.380
We're going to need shopify-money to format the money values

150
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.175
and jQuery for the AJAX requests.

151
00:08:34.175 --> 00:08:36.380
Again, we can use Vanilla JS,

152
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.390
but jQuery is a bit nicer.

153
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.805
That's about it for dependencies.

154
00:08:40.805 --> 00:08:44.760
Now, it's time to actually bring in Vue.js.

155
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.860
The way we can do that as stated in the docs is,

156
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.365
after our jQuery tag here,

157
00:08:50.365 --> 00:08:54.825
add in this script tag which brings in Vue.

158
00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:56.795
Now, if you're wondering where I got that from,

159
00:08:56.795 --> 00:08:58.775
it's in the Vue Documentation.

160
00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:04.250
This is a good opportunity now to show you where you can find the documentation for Vue.

161
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.220
The thing you really need to be aware

162
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.720
of is that in this class I'm going to be using Vue 3.

163
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.430
There's three different versions;

164
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.710
Vue 1, Vue 2, Vue 3.

165
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.350
Maybe if you're watching this at a much later date,

166
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.210
there's more versions after that,

167
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.500
but at the time of recording,

168
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.185
it is currently at Vue 3.

169
00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:28.445
Here you can see you're browsing documentation for Vue 2 by default.

170
00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:31.775
You need to click here for Vue 3 documentation.

171
00:09:31.775 --> 00:09:34.820
As you can see, the site looks pretty much exactly the same,

172
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.310
but your URL here is different.

173
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.935
Click on "Get Started".

174
00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:44.315
This is your reference for anything Vue throughout the class if you get stuck.

175
00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:47.015
As you can see down here,

176
00:09:47.015 --> 00:09:50.525
just the one before under installation,

177
00:09:50.525 --> 00:09:53.840
here is the script tag that I got.

178
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.435
That's the exact same as what we've got here.

179
00:09:58.435 --> 00:10:02.380
The next thing we want to install is Vue DevTools.

180
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.595
Trust me, this is so helpful when developing for Vue.

181
00:10:06.595 --> 00:10:12.965
Vue DevTools adds a extra tab here in our DevTools inside Chrome.

182
00:10:12.965 --> 00:10:15.260
I'm sure there's versions for other browsers as well,

183
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.745
but I recommend you do use Chrome when doing this web development.

184
00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:24.035
We're going to add an extra tab here that will allow us to inspect

185
00:10:24.035 --> 00:10:29.585
our Vue data layer and also our computed properties and all sorts of things.

186
00:10:29.585 --> 00:10:32.960
It helps a lot with figuring out what data

187
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.505
and things are happening in Vue while we're developing.

188
00:10:37.505 --> 00:10:44.915
For that, I'm going to look up the Chrome extensions store, Chrome Web Store.

189
00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:49.460
The thing to note here is if we're using Vue 3,

190
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.030
then we have to use the beta version here.

191
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.275
This is the one that works perfectly on Vue 1 and Vue 2,

192
00:10:57.275 --> 00:11:01.145
but we need to use the beta if we're going to be using Vue 3.

193
00:11:01.145 --> 00:11:05.000
Obviously, this will change depending on when you're watching this class.

194
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.655
But currently to inspect Vue 3,

195
00:11:07.655 --> 00:11:11.360
we're going to need to use this version right here, the beta.

196
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.924
I'm going to click "Add to Chrome",

197
00:11:13.924 --> 00:11:19.805
hit "Add extension", and you can see it has been added to Chrome.

198
00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:24.590
Now let's open up our theme and preview the theme.

199
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:29.240
I'm pretty sure in order to get that Vue DevTools to work,

200
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.660
we're going to have to create an actual Vue app.

201
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.460
Says Vue.js not detected.

202
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.720
I've included the package,

203
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.730
but we haven't created an app yet.

204
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.295
Just to prove that this is all working,

205
00:11:43.295 --> 00:11:46.820
what I'm going to do is go into the first template.

206
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.710
We're going to be working on the product template and open up some script tags.

207
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.075
Then inside here, I'm going to create a Vue app.

208
00:11:56.075 --> 00:11:58.370
Remember, in the theory section of this class,

209
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.505
we talked about how we're doing a one-to-one relationship

210
00:12:01.505 --> 00:12:05.360
between the apps and the templates in our Shopify store.

211
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:13.015
We're going to create an app called ProductPage to go along with this template.

212
00:12:13.015 --> 00:12:19.045
We're going to open up an object and then we're going to create an app from that object.

213
00:12:19.045 --> 00:12:24.130
Below this object, we're going to write vue.createapp,

214
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.380
and then load in our object there.

215
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:33.380
Then we're going to mount it to our DOM by specifying the ID of the elements.

216
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.175
I've already set it here to product-page.

217
00:12:37.175 --> 00:12:41.525
Using CSS syntax with the hash,

218
00:12:41.525 --> 00:12:43.760
putting in the product page there.

219
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.445
Now, guys, just to note here that this is Vue 3 syntax.

220
00:12:49.445 --> 00:12:51.575
If you're looking at examples online,

221
00:12:51.575 --> 00:12:56.795
the syntax might be different because that person might be using Vue 1 or Vue 2.

222
00:12:56.795 --> 00:12:58.040
Just keep that in mind.

223
00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.770
This is the newest syntax for Vue 3.

224
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.825
If you're looking at old examples,

225
00:13:02.825 --> 00:13:05.600
it'll look a little bit different to this.

226
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.995
But your point of truth here is you can always go back to the documentation,

227
00:13:09.995 --> 00:13:12.380
make sure you're on version 3.

228
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.445
Then if we go down to introduction,

229
00:13:16.445 --> 00:13:20.840
you can see here that this is the same format.

230
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.990
We might actually get an error if we don't include a data object.

231
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.670
I'll just check that first.

232
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.620
Let's go to our product template.

233
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.375
Let's head over to console.

234
00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:34.760
Doesn't seem to be any issues so far.

235
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.845
Head into the Vue tab,

236
00:13:36.845 --> 00:13:38.360
and here we go.

237
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.300
We've got this root element here.

238
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.005
There you have it, guys. We have just created our first Vue app.

239
00:13:45.005 --> 00:13:48.890
We can inspect it now in the Vue DevTools,

240
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:54.170
it's going to be the final tab probably in your DevTools over here on Chrome.

241
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:59.165
Now we're in the box seat to start creating our first Vue app.

242
00:13:59.165 --> 00:14:02.600
Without further ado, I'll see you in the next video where we build out

243
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.280
this product page app and add some interactivity to this page.

244
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.180
As you can see, we can change the variant here,

245
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.180
but it's not changing it anywhere on the page.

246
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.710
If I click "Add to Cart",

247
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.215
it's just going to add the first variance.

248
00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:25.050
We need to fix that and we'll do so in the next video. I'll see you there.
