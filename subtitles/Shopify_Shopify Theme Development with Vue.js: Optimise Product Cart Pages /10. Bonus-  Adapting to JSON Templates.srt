00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,605
In this short bonus lesson,

2
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:04,380
I'm going to show you how to move our Vue apps into

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,840
section files as opposed to leaving them in liquid template files.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,915
The reason I'm showing you this is because of Online Store 2.0.

5
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:15,255
If you're not familiar with Online Store 2.0,

6
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:19,079
I encourage you to check out my first class here on Skillshare,

7
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,745
Shopify theme development: How to build and customize your own online store.

8
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:29,085
I've added three additional videos in there to account for the Online Store 2.0 changes.

9
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:36,345
Essentially, what has changed is that template files can now be either JSON or Liquid.

10
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:39,035
To adapt for this new way of making themes,

11
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:43,040
I want to show you how we can move our apps intersection files,

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,920
and then transform those templates into JSON files instead.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,890
I'm going to dig into the theme here,

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,020
I'll just show you what I mean.

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,485
Here under Templates, you've got

16
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:58,040
all the template files coded as Liquid that, of course,

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,949
allows us to insert liquid code HTML,

18
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:05,105
CSS JavaScript, all in this template file,

19
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:07,015
and that's what's used as our template.

20
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:10,625
But if you click on this nowadays,

21
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,540
you will see that there is an option for a JSON template.

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,490
What I'm going to do is I've duplicated the theme to keep that one untouched,

23
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,095
and in here, I'm going to click "Edit code" on the duplicate,

24
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:28,165
and let's start to refactor our project here.

25
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:32,810
First things first, we want to create a new section to house.

26
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,925
Let's do product template first,

27
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:36,755
so I'm going to create a new section,

28
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:40,555
and I'm just going to call it Product Template.

29
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:44,570
Don't have to put the.liquid in there because that will be automatic,

30
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,245
and now we're just going to have to populate the section name,

31
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:53,440
just going to call it Product Template or Main Product,

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,525
something like that because we may want to put some other stuff on it.

33
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:59,480
Main Product Template.

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,770
Now I'll just hit "Save" on that,

35
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,285
and I'll go over to our product.liquid template.

36
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:09,470
This is where we have our Vue app for the product page.

37
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,120
I'm going to copy all of the code using Command A on a Mac.

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,770
I'm not sure what it is on a Windows,

39
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,415
then Command C. Then I'm going to go over here,

40
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:21,350
create some space at the top,

41
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,545
and paste in our code there.

42
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,890
Now that we have our code pasted in and saved,

43
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,175
we can delete this template file,

44
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:36,095
and this will give us the space to create a JSON template.

45
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:39,230
I'm going to click "Add new template",

46
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,375
and go down to product,

47
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:45,760
and here you can see we can create a product.JSON template now.

48
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,980
Going to hit "Create template" and now we've

49
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,185
got the basis of our product template. All right.

50
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:54,165
I'll go more in depth into this in

51
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:56,910
Lesson 11 of Shopify theme development:

52
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,095
How to build and customize your own online store.

53
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:02,190
I'm going to breeze through this a little bit,

54
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,025
but essentially what we need to do here is add the required fields in order to use this.

55
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:11,900
It doesn't allow me to save unless I make a change,

56
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,130
but you'll see that if you don't include this, it will error.

57
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,050
We need to include these compulsory fields.

58
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,125
First of all, we need to give this product template a name,

59
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:28,405
and I'm just going to give it the simple name of Product Template.

60
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:31,010
Now inside our section's object,

61
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,480
we need to link up that product template that we just created.

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm going to start off by calling it Main-Product,

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,885
and let's open up an object as the value of that.

64
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:49,545
Then all we need is to put in a type,

65
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:53,420
and the type needs to be equal to the section name;

66
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,630
the section filename minus the.liquid.

67
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,125
That's just going to be product-template. All right.

68
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,600
In our order array,

69
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:10,255
we need to put in the name that matches this, so main-product.

70
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:14,750
This seems redundant at this point because we only have one section,

71
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,800
but if we had multiple,

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,110
we can define a different order for them here in this order array.

73
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,355
I'm going to hit "Save" on that.

74
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:24,810
As you can see, no errors.

75
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,960
Then I'm going to hit "Customize theme".

76
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,780
Now that we're inside our store editor,

77
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,210
we need to click up here to change to the product template that we just created.

78
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,405
It's just going to be default products because it doesn't have

79
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,640
a dot after product, it's just product.JSON.

80
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,060
If it was product dot something else,

81
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,975
then it would come up as an alternate like this one.

82
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:51,270
I'm just going to click on that,

83
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,140
and here you can see we've got our product template still.

84
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,820
If I go to Shop the Tee,

85
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,085
you can see we've got our app,

86
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:02,165
and it's still working.

87
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:05,080
That's because we've included our section file here,

88
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,615
it doesn't have any editable sections,

89
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,325
but it has been linked.

90
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:12,250
Now this isn't the most exciting lesson because we

91
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,265
haven't added any new functionality whatsoever,

92
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:20,145
except for the fact that we can now add other sections and reorder them.

93
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:24,080
Because this is a bare-bones project with no other sections,

94
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,930
we don't actually have the ability to add another section here

95
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,865
because there are literally no other sections.

96
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:32,740
But using the Online Store 2.0 system,

97
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,375
if we were using a modern theme,

98
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,510
we could actually now move this around,

99
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,465
add new sections if we wanted to.

100
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:45,065
That has been essentially what this video has been about,

101
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:47,315
adapting to Online Store 2.0.

102
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:53,075
You might be using a newer theme that has all of its templates as JSON.

103
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:56,870
In that case, we need to adapt our practices just

104
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,855
a little bit to adapt for this new change.

105
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:05,855
All we've done here is just moved the Liquid code into a section file,

106
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:12,100
and included that section file inside our JSON product template.

107
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,860
We can still do it the old way,

108
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,380
we can still throw in or keep this code in a product.liquid template,

109
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,715
but now we're moving in this direction with Online Store 2.0.

110
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:27,140
I just wanted to throw in this video here for

111
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,545
those of you who are working with modern themes,

112
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:31,770
or have opened up a modern theme,

113
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,320
and wondered what the hell.

114
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,475
Hopefully this video has provided some context for you.

115
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:39,365
Any questions, as always,

116
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,410
feel free to leave them in the discussion box below,

117
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,650
and I'll see you in the final video for the conclusion.
