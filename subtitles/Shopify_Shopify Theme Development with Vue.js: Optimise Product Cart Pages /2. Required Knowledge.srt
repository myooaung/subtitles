00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,985
Today's class when using Vue.js inside Shopify themes is an advanced topic and therefore,

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:08,580
you will require some prerequisite knowledge in

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,610
order to understand and get the most out of this class.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,005
Before taking this class,

5
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,000
you should understand the difference between

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,430
front-end and back-end when it comes to web development,

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,895
this is also known as client-side and server-side.

8
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,520
If you're not familiar of why we would need to transfer

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,220
data from Shopify Liquid into JavaScript,

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,460
for instance, then I recommend you take a look at Lesson 4 of

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,330
my previous Skillshare class, Understanding Web Development.

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,000
Secondly, you're going to need to know JavaScript.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,650
If you need a refresher,

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,585
you can check out my Skillshare class,

15
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:42,120
Web Development Fundamentals: JavaScript.

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,660
Third, you should have at least some familiarity with the Ajax API and Shopify.

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,525
In this class, we'll be plugging it into view and using it to update our cart on the fly.

18
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:55,250
If you'd like a refresher of the Ajax API,

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,720
check out Lesson 8 of my class, Shopify Theme Programming.

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,280
Of course, last but not least,

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
you should have some general experience with

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,430
Shopify theme development and writing Shopify Liquid code.

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,910
If not, I definitely recommend my two previous Skillshare classes on the subject,

24
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,615
Shopify Theme Development and Shopify Theme Programming.

25
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:16,940
Other than that, even if you are new to Vue.js,

26
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,719
you should have enough knowledge to continue on with the following videos.
