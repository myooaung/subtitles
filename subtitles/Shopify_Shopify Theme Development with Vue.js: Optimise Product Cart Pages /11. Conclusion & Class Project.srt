00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,725
This concludes this class on using Vue.js in Shopify themes.

2
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:07,290
For your class project, I encourage you to integrate

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,295
Vue.js into whatever Shopify theme you're currently working on.

4
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:16,155
Keep in mind that most production level themes already use a fair amount of JavaScript,

5
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:18,120
so you'll likely have to refactor some of

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,110
that JavaScript in order to make room for Vue.js.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,060
As I've mentioned throughout this class,

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,585
this topic is quite a specific one within Shopify theme development,

9
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:33,060
so if you're unsure about anything regarding the foundational topics of HTML,

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,270
CSS, JavaScript, Shopify liquid,

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,280
you can find plenty of lessons on all of that here on my Skillshare channel.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,050
All you got to do is click on my name and

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,900
