00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Vue.js is a framework that can be used to create a single-page web application,

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.010
or it can be dropped into any single webpage.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.065
The Vue instance, as it's called,

4
00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:12.750
plugs into your existing HTML structure,

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.715
and through the use of custom tags,

6
00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.710
attributes, and template syntax,

7
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.195
enables binding of data and events from the HTML to the Vue instance.

8
00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:25.950
In today's class, we're going to create two Vue apps or instances,

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.910
one One the product page and one for the cart page.

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.380
For the product page,

11
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.635
we're going to use Vue to track the currently selected variant.

12
00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:40.845
This will be determined by the combination of options selected by the user via this form.

13
00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:44.510
We'll import the list of variants from the Shopify back-end and

14
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.835
use the values from these drop-downs to determine the current variant.

15
00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:50.045
For the cart page,

16
00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:52.325
we're going to import the cart data from

17
00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:56.810
our Shopify back-end into our instance using the cart AJAX API.

18
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.030
We're also going to import a specific collection to offer upsells below the cart,

19
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.750
as well as add transition loading states for the add to cart buttons and

20
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.975
the cart table given that we will be making asynchronous calls to the AJAX API.

21
00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:16.445
That's the overview of what we're going to use Vue for in our Shopify theme.

22
00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:21.530
Note that Vue instances and Shopify templates have a one-to-one relationship here.

23
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.635
As we start to build and then finish looking at Vue,

24
00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:28.460
it should start to become clearer why we're doing it this way.

25
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.930
At the conclusion of this class,

26
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.210
you might want to explore what other templates in

27
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.720
your Shopify theme might benefit from a Vue instance.

28
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.180
An example I can think of off the top of my head is the collection template.

29
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.815
The Shopify store is with a lot of individual products,

30
00:01:42.815 --> 00:01:46.520
you might want to create a more sophisticated filtering system

31
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.840
where the user won't need to

32
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.180
refresh the page after adding or removing

33
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.050
different parameters to filter a list of products.

34
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.030
This would involve a lot of data being updated based on

35
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.470
user input and would make a good opportunity for using Vue.

36
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.600
For now, let's focus on the two most common areas

37
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.990
where Vue.js makes sense on most Shopify sites,

38
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.690
which in my opinion would be variant selections on product pages and cart interactions.
