00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
Hi,

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.970
everybody,

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.410
and welcome this lesson on plotting with Matt Platt Lib from the previous lesson,

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.670
we prepared our data,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.850
make make sure there's all cleaned up.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.210
So next we can address the question at hand by plotting the average profit by year off the

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.120
Fortune 500 companies data that we had uploaded in the previous lesson.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.220
So you might as well plot that revenue as well to first weaken,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.800
define some variables and a method to reduce our code.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.050
So we're gonna do is we're going to group by year.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.460
After that,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.990
we're going to grab an average group by year.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.390
Mean next.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.640
We're going to specify access being the index and the Y one being the averages profit.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.380
Next,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm going to dis plot some labels for the X,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.340
The why the X,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.770
the title and the UAE label this so we can have everything nice and organized.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.420
So if we have that done,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.280
let's go ahead and punch in a small code to do the plotting and I stated about this is

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.140
basically to plot the increase in the mean off the Fortune 500 company profits.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.710
So as you can see,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.980
there's an exponential growth but it got some huge dips also,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.380
so there must correspond to the,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.080
for example,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.890
when there was a recession in the early nineties or the dot com bubble in the early two

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.470
thousands.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.030
So it's pretty interesting to see that in the data.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.040
But how come the profits recovered to even higher levels?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.350
Post East recession?

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.980
So let's see if maybe some of the revenues can give us a more deeper insight.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.430
So let's go ahead and plot the revenues to see what the increase in the mean Fortune 500

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.050
company revenues from 1955 all the way up to 2005.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.950
Does he begin analyze this data a bit better soon as we plot that now we can see another

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.250
side of the story was badly hit,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.550
as the profits were.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.870
And that's,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.450
um,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.300
pretty good accounting work for some of the finance departments.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.200
With a little help from Stack overflow,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.120
we can superimpose these plots with a positive negative,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.820
their standard deviations to give us a little more clear insight into what's going on.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.360
And as I mentioned,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.390
I have included this court in the Donald section of the score.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.850
So you guys condone loaded and use it on your own when you're doing this at home at home.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.750
Well,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.650
so now we can see that the standard deviations are huge.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.420
Some companies made billions while others lost billions on.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.050
The risk has increased along with the rise in profits over the years.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.460
So perhaps some companies perform better than others are the profits of the top 10% mawr or

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.590
less wild style than the bottom 10%?

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.080
So there's plenty of questions that we can look into next,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.160
and it's easy to see how the flow of working in a notebook matches our own thought process

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.160
.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.620
So this flow basically helped us to easily investigate our data set in one place without

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.240
context,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.950
switching between applications and our work is immediately shareable and reproducible.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.160
So if we wish to create a more concise report for a particular audience,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.430
we could quickly re factor.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.410
I work by merging the cells and removing the intermediary code and presenting it to whoever

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.720
we like to present it toe.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.390
Additionally,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.800
we can also download it in various formats to be shared with our team or with external

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.480
parties so it can be downloaded as HTML as pdf as a host of other.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:34.090
So this gives you guys a good or view off why Jupiter notebooks are used so often and why

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.570
they've become so popular.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.170
They're very easy to use,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.430
their very robust,

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.850
and they give us very good and quick insights into our data.
