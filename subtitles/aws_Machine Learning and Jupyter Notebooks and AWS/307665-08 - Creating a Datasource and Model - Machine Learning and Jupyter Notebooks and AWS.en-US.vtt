00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.210
Hi,

00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.540
everybody,

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.380
and welcome back.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:01.570
So,

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.070
Mr Trial,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.870
we're gonna go ahead and create our first training data source.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.410
Previously,

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.000
we had uploaded both of RCs REFILES,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.130
the one that's gonna be used for training and the one that's going to be used for

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.220
predicting unto our newly created as three buckets.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.990
So after we go ahead and do that,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.470
we wanna go where we want to create a data source,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.800
which is a object that contains the location off the input data and important metadata

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.250
about our input data and the Amazon machine Learning uses the data source for operations

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.760
like model training and evaluation.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.450
So before we create the nature source,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.820
we have to make sure that we have the following things.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.280
We have a location off our Amazon s three bucket the schema again,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.920
which includes the names of the attributes in the data and the type of each attributes.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.310
For example,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.910
if it's Merrick if it's taxed,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.780
if it's categorical or binary and the name of the ad true,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.670
that continues the answer that you want Amazon machine learning toe learn to predict which

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.340
in our case,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.350
is that why whether the customer is going to subscribe to our product or not.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.050
So let's go ahead and open up our Amazon machine learning console.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.220
We're gonna go ahead and choose on,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.070
get started,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.960
and we want to go ahead.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960
And since we have nothing launched,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.150
if we had stuff launched,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.780
we can go directly into our dashboard.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.380
But since the first loss that we're doing,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.290
we're gonna go ahead and click on launch.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.430
Now,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.390
here's where we can specify where our data is located,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.820
whether it's in the S three bucket or we can also use the Amazon red shifts.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.030
So if we have massive amounts of data than we would want the red shift.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.160
But since we have a small pieces of data,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.050
we can use our s three bucket.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.390
And just for your purposes of your information,

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.120
this is the same data that I've downloaded so that you have downloaded and I have provided

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.530
it's provided by AWS.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.370
So you can also download it right directly from here.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.230
If you have not downloaded it previously from the course section in you dummy.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.320
So here's where we can specify the ste locations.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.510
I'm going to type in the path of the bucket and the CSB file and for the data source,

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.170
I'm going to go ahead and type in.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.810
I'll just put a one just so I can differentiate.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.610
Are the two sets off data that I provided one for training and one for prediction.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:27.110
McGoohan Click on Verify and here is going to ask me that Amazon machine Learning needs

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.660
permission or read permission to the extreme locations.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.930
We want to make sure we grant it.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.760
Read permission.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.290
And once it can access and read,

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.290
you'll see a page.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.780
So most of what you guys he here interview their properties off.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.250
What the data is the CSE format.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.650
The schema is auto generated because I have not provided dot schema source for it.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.450
Number of files and the size I'm going click on Continue.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.510
So here's where we establish our schema on again.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.400
A schema is basically information that machine learning needs to interpret the input data

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.150
for the model,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.540
including the attribute names,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.070
the data types and any special attributes.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.100
And if you guys remember,

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.790
there's two different ways of providing the schema.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.370
Either let it'll be s do it automatically for you like it has done here,

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.350
or provide a dot schema file.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.180
So the one option we're going to using for this demonstration is allow it a B s in for the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.680
schema.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.470
And here's where you can see that in for inference that is made for us.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.520
So here we can review the data types that machine learning inferred for the attributes.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.700
And it's important the activities are assigned the correct data type to help the machine

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.400
learning in just the data correctly and to enable the correct feature processing on the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.950
attributes.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.460
So attributes that have only two possible states,

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.780
such as yes or no,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.080
should be marked as binary attributes that are numbers or strings that are used to denote a

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.820
category should be categorical.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.870
Mark one should be numeric and afterwards,

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.320
that are strings that you would like to treat.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.520
His words should be text,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.940
so you're more than welcome to go through each one of these attributes Bar.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.710
For the purposes of this demonstration,

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.340
let me just tell you that the machine learning has inferred the correct attributes or the

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.870
crack schema for all of these attributes.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.810
So next what I'm going to go and do is go to my last column,

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.030
which,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.700
if you guys remember is the White column,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.600
and this is where,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.570
where we had specified either a 01 or yes or no to let the machine learning know whether

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.800
this person had subscribe to the product or had not subscribed to the part product.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.200
So this is what I want to specify as my target attributes.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.360
And because remember,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.020
the target attribute is the one that we want the machine long machine learning while to

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.270
learn how to predict.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.450
After I do that,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.090
I'm gonna go ahead and click on Continue.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.410
So here is gonna ask if the if the data contains and identify and that's biscuit optional

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.270
roid and for helps understand how prediction rose correspond to observation rose from the

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.990
input data.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.330
So if you choose to make an attribute,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.450
the row identifier,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.910
the model will add that column to the prediction output and row identifiers intended for

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.820
reference purposes.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.460
Onley.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.170
So it does not really include the raw identifier when training the models.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.300
But for the purposes of this simple demonstration,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:12.100
we're going to just make sure we click on no and then click on review here.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.760
It gives us an option to go ahead and edit any of our options that we had done.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.610
If you want a cordon,

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.450
change anything.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.270
But let's just say that we have done everything correctly and I'm gonna click on Continue

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.300
so that we have created our training data source.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.410
We can use it to create the machine learning model,

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.610
train the model and then evaluate the results not to create the machinery model on because

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.100
I was on machine Learning automatically uses the training data source that we just created

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.100
.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.690
They'll take us directly to this model settings page,

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.050
and here we can give the model a name,

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.570
depending on how we want to classify it.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.740
And for the purpose of this demonstration,

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.990
we've just specified a default evaluation settings.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:59.720
We can specify custom settings if we want to go ahead and utilize some of the advanced

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.660
machine learning training features.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.160
Let's say if we want to change that 70 30 rule that AWS automated the offers in terms of

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.610
using 70% of the data for training and 30% for prediction.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.630
We can change all those variables through the custom settings less to stick to the default

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.260
settings.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.450
We're gonna go and give this evaluation that same name again.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.730
Well,

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.250
was classified as one.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.900
What a Glen Click on review.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.940
And here again,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.510
it gives us a chance to go ahead and change any of the options.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.640
And then we're gonna go ahead and create the machine learning model.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.680
So while your machine learning model is in,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.890
Q was processing is going to give the status as pending while gauze and creates all of your

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:42.350
model.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.040
Now,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.040
this will change to in progress and then finally to completed Once a model has been fully

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.220
completed and trained on there you have it.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:58.020
This is the steps that are involved to create your data source and to create the machine

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.970
learning model using the Amazon Machine Learning Service.
