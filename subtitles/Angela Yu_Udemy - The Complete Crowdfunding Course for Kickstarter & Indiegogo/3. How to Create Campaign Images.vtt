00:00.980 --> 00:06.230
Now as they say an image is worth a thousand words and there's no place there that's more true than

00:06.230 --> 00:07.740
on a Kickstarter campaign.

00:07.880 --> 00:12.660
So most people like to put images into the main body of their campaign text.

00:12.710 --> 00:17.960
And if you have a look at people's campaigns you'll see that they have image after image after image

00:18.260 --> 00:23.600
where all of the images are showing people some sort of perk or some sort of feature of the thing that

00:23.600 --> 00:24.920
they'll be pledging for.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.220
So these are all the thing that you can do with pebble.

00:27.260 --> 00:34.580
And for any backer who's usually just scrolling through very very fast you're pausing occasionally on

00:34.580 --> 00:38.310
the images you're going to see what each of these features are.

00:38.360 --> 00:44.230
And by the end of scrolling you might already be convinced and ready make an impulse pledge.

00:44.240 --> 00:50.450
Now you also have the types of people who like to read in detail about the technology about the features

00:50.510 --> 00:52.060
about what are the specs.

00:52.130 --> 00:58.010
But you want to address both of these parties and your description and the images are great for people

00:58.220 --> 01:03.620
who don't have a lot of time who just want to get the gist of what your project is about.

01:03.620 --> 01:07.160
And I'm certainly guilty of being one of those types of people.

01:07.160 --> 01:12.230
So whereas a lot of my friends have all these spreadsheets where you know when they buy a camera they'll

01:12.230 --> 01:18.590
compare and contrast everything from different makers and build the spreadsheet over a mom liberating

01:18.590 --> 01:20.390
over I'm more of the impulse buy.

01:20.390 --> 01:24.720
I will look at a couple and you know know where my heart is at basically.

01:24.770 --> 01:30.110
Now that might not be a great way of choosing cameras especially high end products but it's just something

01:30.110 --> 01:31.780
that a lot of people do.

01:32.150 --> 01:37.370
So you want to make sure that you have a whole bunch of images that shows off what are the top features

01:37.460 --> 01:44.190
of your product that people can see at a glance and they can understand they can get it straight away.

01:44.720 --> 01:50.900
So another thing that you want to create images for all your pledged is now in Kickstarter it's very

01:50.900 --> 01:54.980
very easy to get carried away with your pledged is and there's a lot of projects that have something

01:54.980 --> 02:01.340
like 30 pledged his now one of the things like human psychology is that the more choices we have the

02:01.340 --> 02:03.180
harder it is to make a choice.

02:03.260 --> 02:07.290
And we actually end up avoiding making a choice at all.

02:07.300 --> 02:08.740
It was cool decision process.

02:08.840 --> 02:16.000
So when you go into a high end shop and you see maybe two handbags is very easy to pick a or b.

02:16.010 --> 02:16.380
Right.

02:16.460 --> 02:21.610
But if you go into a shop where there's millions of handbags then it's almost impossible to pick any

02:21.620 --> 02:22.840
one out of the other.

02:22.850 --> 02:27.710
Now some people enjoy browsing but I'm more of the sort of person who just likes to compare A and B

02:28.010 --> 02:29.400
and make my decision.

02:29.420 --> 02:32.700
So there's a lot of people like that on crowdfunding Web sites as well.

02:32.720 --> 02:39.800
So you want to be able to show people a very intuitive visual way of seeing what they might want to

02:39.800 --> 02:40.290
pledge.

02:40.310 --> 02:46.160
So for the coolest cool they had this really nice infographics almost which shows people what they're

02:46.160 --> 02:51.210
going to get for $5 or for fifty five dollars or for $185.

02:51.260 --> 02:56.000
And it's just a really easy at a glance guide where people don't have to read through pages and pages

02:56.270 --> 03:01.850
of each of your reward tiers to understand what they want to pledge for when there's many many options

03:01.940 --> 03:03.830
and things aren't getting confusing.

03:03.830 --> 03:09.800
And your target market are probably engineers then it might make sense just to make a little chart where

03:09.800 --> 03:14.130
you can see what you're going to get with each tear.

03:14.300 --> 03:20.230
And if you've seen cooking for engineers this is an approach that can work for a particular type of

03:20.240 --> 03:21.080
demographic.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.470
Now it's also a format that might scare you know your mother.

03:24.500 --> 03:30.710
And so it depends entirely on who your target market is how you're going to create this infographics.

03:30.770 --> 03:37.070
Now a really great tool for producing all of these images and graphics is a Web site called Kanva.

03:37.160 --> 03:42.620
So Canada is free to use and it has a whole bunch of design templates that you can just drag and drop

03:42.620 --> 03:47.520
things and rearrange things you don't need to have really any design skills really because everything's

03:47.540 --> 03:49.080
laid out on screen for you.

03:49.190 --> 03:51.560
So we have no affiliation with it is just a tool.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.740
I really like using.

03:52.850 --> 03:53.710
So you can check it out.

03:53.720 --> 03:58.580
Camera dot com and you start playing around and creating your own infographics.

03:58.580 --> 04:01.760
Now I'm going to quickly show you and I'm going to quickly show you how it works.

04:01.790 --> 04:06.490
Now when you go to come dot com and you click on create a design these common dimension.

04:06.560 --> 04:13.770
So you've got things like Facebook post or social media which means Instagram square format or a poster

04:14.090 --> 04:15.880
or Twitter posts a whole bunch of things.

04:15.890 --> 04:17.320
I'll leave you to explore.

04:17.540 --> 04:23.240
But in terms of creating your packages for your Kickstarter projects one of the best things I've found

04:23.240 --> 04:25.160
is actually there infa graphic template.

04:25.160 --> 04:30.740
So it's just down here the blogging and e-books and if you click on it it'll create this blank design

04:30.740 --> 04:35.930
for you and you can see that there's a whole bunch of infa graphic templates that they've got on here

04:35.930 --> 04:40.280
that you can just simply drag and drop onto your canvas.

04:40.280 --> 04:45.890
Now there's five reasons to give charity infographics that really really nice template for creating

04:45.920 --> 04:47.950
your different packages.

04:48.140 --> 04:53.040
And if I just zoom in on here you can see that it's already got all the funds embedded.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.810
And you can change these just simply by editing them.

04:56.810 --> 05:02.300
And the great thing is that they've already formatted and find everything so that it looks pretty stunning

05:02.600 --> 05:07.750
and all you have to do is just go in and change the text and do a little bit of dragging and dropping.

05:08.060 --> 05:14.580
So that's just a really really easy way of creating your very own package graphics using kantha.

05:14.600 --> 05:20.780
Now the next thing to think about is that if an image is worth a thousand words then a GIF or an animated

05:20.780 --> 05:23.090
image is worth maybe 2000 words.

05:23.090 --> 05:29.990
This is a gif from the Lumiere campaign and it shows so beautifully how their product works without

05:30.020 --> 05:31.990
having to explain anything at all.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.050
It's like a book and when you unfold it it's a lamp.

05:35.060 --> 05:36.820
So it's incredibly beautiful.

05:36.860 --> 05:41.900
And I would highly recommend that you consider trying to create gifts for your product as well.

05:41.900 --> 05:49.100
So in our campaign we actually created an animated gif of some of the ways that we use to explain certain

05:49.100 --> 05:50.390
programming concepts.

05:50.390 --> 05:55.520
So the idea is that we wanted to show people that programming isn't intimidating at all and pretty much

05:55.550 --> 05:59.110
anybody can learn to code or to create their own apps.

05:59.120 --> 06:05.900
So we borrowed one of our animations from our course in order to show people how arrays work.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.690
And it's just a really really simple animation.

06:08.690 --> 06:10.380
I'm going to show you how you can create your own.

06:10.550 --> 06:16.400
So there's a Mac app called Cliffie which allows you to basically record your screen and if there's

06:16.400 --> 06:21.260
a video playing in the background you can capture a few seconds of that action and allows you to save

06:21.260 --> 06:26.210
it while upload it onto that Web site is really really easy to use and it's completely free.
