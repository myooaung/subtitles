Now at this point you might have decided that Crowdfunding is definitely for me.

00:06.120 --> 00:09.710
And this is the path I'm definitely going to go down.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.650
But you might also be undecided.

00:11.700 --> 00:17.040
You might be wondering why should I crowdfund Why don't I just raise funding through angel investors

00:17.070 --> 00:21.390
or venture capitalists or use my savings or go through other traditional routes.

00:21.390 --> 00:24.030
What are the benefits of crowdfunding.

00:24.510 --> 00:29.730
So let's say that you have an idea you're looking at your cool and you thinking oh man cool is a pretty

00:29.730 --> 00:34.300
blonde and they haven't really changed in design for decades either.

00:34.350 --> 00:36.830
I want my cooler I'd have a blender.

00:36.840 --> 00:39.250
I want my cooler to have a speaker.

00:39.330 --> 00:42.220
I want my cooler to have a charging dock.

00:42.330 --> 00:43.820
So then what do you need to do.

00:43.860 --> 00:45.870
Well you're going to have to design it up.

00:45.900 --> 00:51.420
You know maybe in CAD then you going to have to prototype it maybe with 3-D printing or maybe with traditional

00:51.420 --> 00:55.240
prototyping tools and then you're going to have to manufacture it.

00:55.350 --> 01:00.510
So that's a lot of upfront costs with no demonstrable demand for your actual product.

01:00.510 --> 01:03.720
What if people hate the idea of a smart cooler.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.730
What if people really don't need that in their lives.

01:05.730 --> 01:10.370
Now I admire the entrepreneurs who sell their house and bet on their idea and win big.

01:10.440 --> 01:15.530
But a large part of being a successful entrepreneur is actually minimizing your risks.

01:15.660 --> 01:22.860
So if you think back to the story of Richard Branson who started the virgin who started Virgin Atlantic

01:22.950 --> 01:28.870
an airline from scratch essentially he borrowed his first airplane and it was a short term lease.

01:28.920 --> 01:34.020
So if it didn't work out he could just return the plane without having to foot a huge bill.

01:34.110 --> 01:36.480
And this is exactly what Crowdfunding is really good for.

01:36.660 --> 01:39.320
Getting funding while demonstrating demand.

01:39.390 --> 01:42.600
So now you might ask what if my product isn't a physical product.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.980
What if it's a mobile app or what if it's a book.

01:46.020 --> 01:50.500
Or what if it's you know an online platform like the one that we created.

01:50.670 --> 01:55.960
Well you still need funding to get all those things up or front off the ground.

01:55.980 --> 01:56.390
Right.

01:56.400 --> 02:01.080
You don't need to hire developers all you going to have to pay your living costs while you develop that

02:01.110 --> 02:02.370
app or website.

02:02.370 --> 02:07.710
So one of the biggest reasons for Crowdfunding is of course getting funding and you might think well

02:07.710 --> 02:11.370
you know what if my idea is really stupid and nobody wants to fund it.

02:11.430 --> 02:17.460
Well let's look back at some other crowdfunding projects that I would have thought was crazy but they

02:17.460 --> 02:18.650
still did really well.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.470
So hey I want to make potato salad.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.360
That's what this guy Zach named Brown thought to himself.

02:24.480 --> 02:29.910
But you know what I want to make a lot of potato salad and I want people to help fund my potato salad

02:29.910 --> 02:30.540
making.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.530
So he launched a crowdfunding campaign.

02:33.660 --> 02:42.150
And if I zoom in there you can see that six thousand nine hundred and eleven people pledged $55000 to

02:42.150 --> 02:45.050
help him make potato salad.

02:45.060 --> 02:46.890
So you think that your idea is crazy.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.680
Well what about this one.

02:49.260 --> 02:54.140
Chris Cote is a Foa-Foa grizzly bear jacket wear it proudly.

02:54.150 --> 02:59.380
And remember it's not a costume it's a lifestyle.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.740
OK.

03:00.820 --> 03:07.110
But yeah they raised twenty nine thousand dollars for a grizzly coat costume.

03:07.150 --> 03:08.130
Oh sorry.

03:08.130 --> 03:10.890
Lifestyle is crazy.

03:10.900 --> 03:16.300
So it just shows it doesn't matter if you think your idea is crazy it doesn't matter if your friends

03:16.300 --> 03:17.860
think your idea is crazy.

03:17.860 --> 03:23.820
Go out there megaproject and see if there are people in the world who want it and test your idea.
