00:00.180 --> 00:06.390
So up till now we've spoken a lot about why you should do crowdfunding and why it's really useful and

00:06.390 --> 00:07.760
what the benefits are.

00:07.920 --> 00:13.190
But it's really important to be aware of the pitfalls while you're in the research phase as well.

00:13.410 --> 00:18.210
So let's talk about some of those common pitfalls that you might not have thought of when you embarked

00:18.210 --> 00:20.910
on your crowdfunding journey.

00:20.940 --> 00:26.310
So one of the first thing you have to realize is that by putting your product under Kickstarter or to

00:26.310 --> 00:32.160
Indiegogo or any of these public websites it becomes in the public domain so everybody will be able

00:32.160 --> 00:35.420
to see your idea before it's ready.

00:35.430 --> 00:40.500
Of course ideally by the time that you're listing your product onto Kickstarter you should be at the

00:40.500 --> 00:46.920
point where you're about to start manufacturing or at least you're ready to start making the product

00:47.160 --> 00:52.500
and you should not be in your R&amp;D phase where you're you know testing to see if it's possible.

00:52.680 --> 00:58.560
And the reason why I say this is because there are a lot of professionals who are usually based in China

00:58.920 --> 01:04.560
who cross these Web sites like Kickstarter and you go looking for ideas that they can clone.

01:04.560 --> 01:10.050
So if you've never been on the Web site Alibaba or Ali express dot.com then have a look at it because

01:10.050 --> 01:15.870
you will find a lot of clones of what you've seen on these crowdfunding sites.

01:15.870 --> 01:21.450
So what people tend to do is that they cross these Web site looking for ideas they have behind them

01:21.540 --> 01:29.030
a huge factory or contacts at factories who can produce these products like this lightning fast.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.490
And we mentioned earlier about fidget cube.

01:31.530 --> 01:34.230
So a cube is a really really simple concept.

01:34.230 --> 01:42.120
It's a six sided die that has buttons or switches or things that you can twirl and the IP behind it

01:42.120 --> 01:46.450
is really really simple which anybody can clone and they do.

01:46.560 --> 01:52.920
So if you have a look and compare how much it was sold on Kickstarter to backers versus Uganda alley

01:53.010 --> 02:01.710
Express you can see that these cubes are being sold for one dollar fifty three per unit including shipping

02:01.710 --> 02:03.010
to the U.S. or UK.

02:03.210 --> 02:10.890
That is absolutely nuts and I still can't wrap my head around just how low a margin that people are

02:10.890 --> 02:19.920
willing to work with because I mean even the plastic even the shipping is going to eat its way through

02:19.920 --> 02:21.660
that one dollar fifty three right.

02:21.660 --> 02:27.390
I mean the people who are producing this and selling this are making a really really thin margin and

02:27.630 --> 02:33.230
hoping that by selling it in bulk with large volume they're still going to make a profit.

02:33.240 --> 02:37.440
So if you've ever been on Ali express it is mind blowing.

02:37.440 --> 02:42.390
Varians where you can find things like wireless Bluetooth headset for like two dollars.

02:42.390 --> 02:44.450
It's completely mental.

02:44.460 --> 02:50.550
This clone came out before that Kickstarter had even finished.

02:50.610 --> 02:56.520
So while that Kickstarter was running and backers would be waiting months and months before they could

02:56.520 --> 02:58.320
actually get their hands on product.

02:58.320 --> 03:03.710
There were already vendors in China that was selling a clone that you could get right now and you can't

03:03.720 --> 03:11.030
underestimate how much our generation needs things right now or as fast as possible.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.430
It's all about instant gratification.

03:13.470 --> 03:15.150
So why am I telling you all of this.

03:15.180 --> 03:24.120
Well it's important to know that even if you have IP even if you have patented your designs or your

03:24.540 --> 03:31.710
or your functionality in the US or the UK basically in the West you have to be aware that going after

03:31.710 --> 03:35.820
these people who are based in China is virtually impossible.

03:35.820 --> 03:41.630
The international laws just don't make it that easy and the legal costs are just not worth it.

03:41.630 --> 03:42.590
At the end of the day.

03:42.810 --> 03:46.310
So how do most people get screwed in these situations.

03:46.320 --> 03:51.600
Usually what happens is that somebody with an idea will create a kickstarter.

03:51.630 --> 03:58.350
And of course before launching their product as we suggested they will scout out all the factories and

03:58.470 --> 04:00.790
find a manufacturing partner.

04:01.050 --> 04:08.250
Now Usually that happens in China because the manufacturing costs are low but what usually happens in

04:08.250 --> 04:14.070
these factories is that they will produce maybe two times or three times your ordered amount and shift

04:14.130 --> 04:15.960
that stuck behind your bag.

04:16.080 --> 04:20.680
So this is just something to remember when you're looking for manufacturers to partner with.

04:20.880 --> 04:27.120
And sometimes it can be a lot easier just looking for a company that's based in maybe the U.S. or the

04:27.120 --> 04:27.790
U.K..

04:27.990 --> 04:34.940
So this is a company called maker's row and they are essentially a flexible factory that can help you

04:34.950 --> 04:39.800
create your products but they're based in the U.S. and they follow all conventional rules.

04:39.840 --> 04:44.400
So you don't have to worry about all of these things that I've just said to you so they're not going

04:44.400 --> 04:47.980
to be ripping your designs off and selling it secretly.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.780
So look for a company that's reputable to build your product.

04:51.780 --> 04:54.600
Be it physical or be it digital.

04:54.600 --> 05:01.600
Make sure that you do a fair amount of due diligence on these companies and ask for some references

05:01.610 --> 05:06.030
of people who they've worked with before who are based in the U.S. or the U.K. that we can feel that

05:06.050 --> 05:07.720
more comfortable working with them.

05:07.730 --> 05:12.450
Now this of course doesn't stop people from cloning your product because once it's on Kickstarter.

05:12.450 --> 05:14.550
Anybody can try and reverse engineer it.

05:14.570 --> 05:20.180
And even if you don't provide all the designs all the specs it doesn't mean that people can't you know

05:20.180 --> 05:22.450
try and figure it out and make it themselves.

05:22.460 --> 05:28.640
But now if you look back to the fidget cube they raised over six million dollars.

05:28.640 --> 05:35.090
All the Clones combined together all the people who've been working on ripping these guys off have gone

05:35.180 --> 05:36.900
nowhere near that figure.

05:37.070 --> 05:41.040
So sometimes it makes sense to be cautious.

05:41.210 --> 05:45.430
But it also makes sense just get your product out there and drive marketing towards it.

05:45.440 --> 05:51.620
You usually do pretty well but it's just good ideas keep these kinds of things in mind when you're creating

05:51.620 --> 05:52.610
your project.

05:52.610 --> 05:55.200
And don't fall into the trap of getting your designs stolen.
