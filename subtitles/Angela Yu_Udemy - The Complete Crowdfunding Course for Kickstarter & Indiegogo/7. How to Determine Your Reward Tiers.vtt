WEBVTT

00:00.510 --> 00:08.130
Now in order to create a histogram or reward is you need to have all of the tears in each project and

00:08.130 --> 00:10.380
the number of backers for each tear.

00:10.410 --> 00:15.390
This way you can see which one was the most popular and which one raised them the most amount of money

00:15.420 --> 00:16.410
as well.

00:16.410 --> 00:21.660
So in order to get this it's a bit tedious because even if we're using the scraper tool we would have

00:21.660 --> 00:28.500
to go and find this line scrape similar add it to the scraper tool and then find this line and add it

00:28.500 --> 00:29.540
to the script tool.

00:29.640 --> 00:33.140
I'm going to show you a slightly more advance method of using this great tool.

00:33.150 --> 00:37.320
But for this you might need to bear with me because I'm going to have to show you something that is

00:37.380 --> 00:39.510
a little bit related to programming.

00:39.510 --> 00:42.060
Now there's no actual programming happening.

00:42.060 --> 00:46.440
It's just a way of reverse engineering how the Web site is displayed so that you can grab the bits of

00:46.440 --> 00:49.730
data that you need relatively easily.

00:49.790 --> 00:50.120
OK.

00:50.130 --> 00:57.810
So the goal is that we want to pull in all of these tears so $10 $25 $95.

00:57.810 --> 01:00.650
Now of course you can just also read this and type it in.

01:00.660 --> 01:01.870
But that's really tedious.

01:01.890 --> 01:07.110
As a programmer myself I can't really be convinced of doing anything that a machine can do much quicker

01:07.140 --> 01:08.270
and much more easily.

01:08.310 --> 01:13.650
So I'm going to show you how you can use some really basic concepts to actually pull in this data.

01:13.680 --> 01:17.540
Now don't worry you don't have to understand any programming to be able to do this.

01:17.620 --> 01:22.510
And I'm not going to go into details about how SML work how X paths work.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.660
All I'm going to show you is the technique.

01:24.690 --> 01:30.570
So here the thing that we want to pull in is the $10 and we can see that it's a repeating element.

01:30.570 --> 01:33.570
Each of these boxes are laid out exactly the same.

01:33.570 --> 01:37.000
So we know that the code behind it is going to be repeated.

01:37.020 --> 01:43.980
So I'm going to do is I'm going to select this $10 and I'm going to say inspect and this pulls up the

01:43.980 --> 01:45.210
chrome developer tools.

01:45.210 --> 01:48.070
Now you have to be inside Chrome for this to work.

01:48.210 --> 01:52.490
There's developer tools other browsers as well but this is just by far the easiest to use.

01:52.620 --> 01:58.980
So you can see that it's highlighting to you the line of code that is creating this word $10 on screen.

01:58.980 --> 02:02.570
So what we're going to do is we're going to right click on the highlighted line and we're going to say

02:02.580 --> 02:03.480
Copy.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.190
We're going to copy the X path.

02:05.190 --> 02:12.780
Now once you've got that X path copied you're going to paste it inside a blank text edit file.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.380
So don't worry about naming it don't worry about saving it.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.510
I just want to show you how it looks.

02:18.540 --> 02:26.340
So this is essentially a way of navigating down to that $10 through the code because each element after

02:26.430 --> 02:29.890
a fourth Losh is nested inside the previous element.

02:30.060 --> 02:32.040
And this is how we arrive at this file.

02:32.050 --> 02:33.520
$10 a month.

02:33.750 --> 02:39.540
So now we've done that for the $10 Let's go and have a look at the $25 to compare.

02:39.570 --> 02:45.690
I'm going to highlight the $25 I'm going to Right-Click and hit inspect and the developer tool is going

02:45.690 --> 02:50.400
to highlight to me the line of code that's creating that $25 on screen.

02:50.580 --> 02:54.620
So I'm going to do the same thing right click on that line and copy the X path.

02:54.840 --> 03:01.820
Now I'm going to go back over to my text file and I'm going to paste it on a new line.

03:02.040 --> 03:08.550
So now here's a little bit of Spot the difference these two lines are identical other than one number.

03:08.550 --> 03:10.680
Can you spot where that is.

03:10.740 --> 03:12.120
All right so that wasn't too hard.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.240
It's right here.

03:13.410 --> 03:18.410
So this is the part where they diverged paths and before then is what we're interested in.

03:18.420 --> 03:24.630
So copy everything that is before the square brackets so all the way up to the airline.

03:24.630 --> 03:28.590
Now it'll help if you are actually doing this along with me because you'll actually get to learn the

03:28.590 --> 03:33.690
tools instead of watching it and forgetting and having to come back to it once you learn it it's pretty

03:33.690 --> 03:34.310
easy.

03:34.470 --> 03:41.280
OK so now once you've highlighted everything up to the square brackets where they divert pass you're

03:41.280 --> 03:49.030
going to copy that X path and you're going to paste it and you're going to create a new scrape.

03:49.020 --> 03:53.610
And here don't worry about what is generated automatically what you're going to do is you're going to

03:53.610 --> 04:01.410
put what you just copied up at the top here and make a rule that says X path instead of something else.

04:01.410 --> 04:05.670
And then the DOT basically refers to a iterative number.

04:05.670 --> 04:09.990
So it's going to go through one two three four five six until it ends.

04:09.990 --> 04:15.670
So it's going to essentially loop through all of these blocks and generate all the content that's inside

04:15.670 --> 04:16.170
it.

04:16.170 --> 04:21.540
So if we scrape now you can see that this is actually pulling in everything that's inside each of these

04:21.930 --> 04:23.190
little squares.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.180
And that's too much information we don't need all of that.

04:26.340 --> 04:30.390
All we want is just that $10 a $25 pop.

04:30.570 --> 04:37.670
And if we head back over to text that we can see how that part was generated after the the one or the

04:37.690 --> 04:41.680
two there's a forward slash and then there's a little bit more code.

04:41.790 --> 04:47.430
So we're going to copy that because at the same time on for the first example in the second example

04:47.730 --> 04:49.800
and then we're going to paste that in him.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.410
So we're going to write dot.

04:51.450 --> 04:56.170
So it's going to be dot and the fourth slash and then the rest of the code.

04:56.340 --> 04:59.670
So if we just compare over here you can see after the.

04:59.690 --> 05:06.110
So what you're doing is you're placing the square brackets with the two with a dot and you putting in

05:06.110 --> 05:08.420
everything that comes afterwards.

05:08.660 --> 05:14.340
So it's basically dot slash div square brackets to slash a whole bunch of code right.

05:14.540 --> 05:18.440
And let's just name this tier so that we know what it is.

05:18.580 --> 05:25.040
And now if I hit scrape you can see that it scrapes all of those structured bits of data and we've got

05:25.100 --> 05:29.400
all of our priced his nice pretty easy right.

05:29.780 --> 05:34.670
So the next part of the data that we want is of course the number of backers that we're going to do

05:34.670 --> 05:35.490
the same thing.

05:35.510 --> 05:37.720
So I'm going to look at the $10 Telephus.

05:37.720 --> 05:44.750
I'm going to highlight that number 15 and I'm going to hit inspect and you can see it's highlighting

05:44.750 --> 05:47.610
the span class where it says 15.

05:47.660 --> 05:56.470
So I'm going to reichlich copy the X path and I'm going to paste this into our text file.

05:56.540 --> 06:02.100
Now I'm going to compare this against the next one so I have to find it here where it says 5.

06:02.160 --> 06:09.690
I'm going to highlight the five and again hit inspect and I'm going to copy and.

06:09.860 --> 06:13.030
And again the chrome develop a tool highlight this line of code.

06:13.070 --> 06:18.570
I'm going to right click on it and again copy the X path and then we're going to switch back to text

06:18.640 --> 06:22.200
edit and I'm just going to paste it under the previous line of code.

06:22.250 --> 06:28.900
Again we're going to undergo the spot the difference task and you can see actually that up to this part.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.110
This is identical to this line.

06:33.110 --> 06:38.870
So everything up to here is all of the data inside each of the squares.

06:39.180 --> 06:46.190
And thereafter it diverges and it corresponds to different parts of that square.

06:46.190 --> 06:56.150
So this part points to this 25 dollar amount whereas this part points to the number of Bakker's section

06:56.150 --> 06:56.610
here.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.850
So this is what we're interested in.

06:58.850 --> 07:07.610
So copy that code right up to that square brackets so including the forward slash and we're going to

07:07.610 --> 07:13.270
hit command C to copy and we're going to go back into that scrape session that we had previously I'm

07:13.310 --> 07:13.770
going to hit.

07:13.790 --> 07:19.450
Plus to add another column and we're going to paste in the X path here.

07:19.610 --> 07:27.170
So it's going to be this part all the way up to that square brackets one colluding that forward slash

07:27.170 --> 07:27.710
there.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.160
So that's really important.

07:29.180 --> 07:35.030
And when you paste it in here make sure you first type a dot and then you paste in the rest of the code.

07:35.450 --> 07:40.970
And and you can see here I've actually accidentally copied in the end of that square brackets so that

07:40.970 --> 07:41.940
can't work.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.460
So it has to be dot slash.

07:43.460 --> 07:45.680
Something something something right.

07:45.680 --> 07:52.430
And we're going to call this the number of backers OK and I'm going to hit scrape.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.670
Now it's a slight problem here.

07:53.670 --> 07:59.620
You can see that we're basically pulling in whatever is on this line right.

07:59.620 --> 08:03.100
So if there's only the words 15 backers and that's what we're getting.

08:03.130 --> 08:09.200
But if there's the words limited and the number backas then we're actually getting the first element.

08:09.460 --> 08:11.380
So we need to get the second one as well.

08:11.380 --> 08:18.040
So to do that let's just highlight it and then click inspect and right click copy x path

08:21.950 --> 08:26.270
and you're going to paste it in here so you can see this one is at index 1.

08:26.270 --> 08:28.580
This one's an index to pretty much.

08:28.580 --> 08:38.930
So if we go and add this part into our scraper tool so we're going to add a new column and I'm going

08:38.930 --> 08:43.780
to write dot and then I'm going to paste in the rest of it make sure that it's dot slashed.

08:43.790 --> 08:44.410
Begin with.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.280
And this is also going to be number of brackets.

08:48.650 --> 08:55.300
OK so now if I hit scrape you can see that between these two columns we've got all the number of backers.

08:55.310 --> 08:57.740
So if it isn't here then it's going to be here.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.670
So that's all we need essentially.

08:59.690 --> 09:04.800
And we can copy the clipboard and paste it in here.

09:05.210 --> 09:11.120
So there's a little bit more of data processing that you have to do because if I pasted in here you

09:11.120 --> 09:13.340
can see that we've got two columns right.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.360
So the ones where.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.620
So we're going to delete the first one.

09:19.410 --> 09:22.460
Which is only the titles of each columns.

09:22.500 --> 09:28.710
And the next thing that we need to do is that where it says limited or no longer available.

09:28.770 --> 09:32.540
We're going to shift these numbers over here.

09:34.020 --> 09:39.170
So essentially all that we want in this row is the number of backers and all that we want here are the

09:39.180 --> 09:40.980
waters.

09:41.100 --> 09:46.320
So once you've done that you're going to have to remove the number of backers because we can't graph

09:46.350 --> 09:48.340
text that is there any make any sense.

09:48.510 --> 09:55.050
So again using the previous trick where we say we're going to look for something so it's space Bakker's

09:56.740 --> 10:01.780
and we're going to hit the Three-Star three dots and we're going to make sure that we match case.

10:01.810 --> 10:05.800
So we don't get rid of that title and we're going to replace all.

10:05.890 --> 10:11.530
And we have to make sure that you spell it right of course the place all and now everything is in numbers

10:11.950 --> 10:14.910
and that gets added into our graph.

10:14.910 --> 10:18.400
And so now that data gets added to contribute to that chart.

10:18.400 --> 10:23.860
So essentially by the end of this as you go through some of the most popular or the highest pledged

10:23.950 --> 10:32.230
amount of projects you should have a list of reward tears i.e. the amount brackets and how many people

10:32.230 --> 10:33.280
actually pledged for them.

10:33.280 --> 10:39.730
So for example if you look at this beluga project you can see that the most popular tier is around this

10:39.970 --> 10:41.220
$100 mark.

10:41.230 --> 10:41.670
Right.

10:41.860 --> 10:46.890
So you definitely want to make sure that you make your hundred dollar MMOG your product.

10:46.930 --> 10:49.250
And the one that's most appealing as well.

10:49.420 --> 10:56.290
So this is just a really good data driven way of looking at what reward tears have worked in the past

10:56.350 --> 11:01.140
for other similar projects to yours and which ones that you need to focus on.

11:01.270 --> 11:07.810
So another thing that you might want to do is to actually work out how much each of these tears actually

11:07.810 --> 11:08.550
made.

11:08.560 --> 11:17.350
So I'm just going to start a new item here called amount pledged right and it's just going to be equal

11:17.350 --> 11:23.860
to the reward here multiplied by the number of backers.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.910
And then if we just pull that down all the way here.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.740
Now you can see that in this case the tier that generated the largest number of was also the tier that

11:32.740 --> 11:35.440
generated them the most amount of money.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.170
And this is usually true but not always.

11:38.170 --> 11:44.690
So when a project has underpriced itself you usually don't see this kind of normal distribution.

11:44.710 --> 11:50.260
Sometimes you see a different pattern and that can guide you as to whether if that particular project

11:50.530 --> 11:55.750
has underpriced over priced their products and that will help you in your research as well.

11:55.750 --> 11:56.080
All right.

11:56.080 --> 12:02.530
So I've shown you some ways of using the scraper tool and gathering data to essentially stand on the

12:02.530 --> 12:03.600
shoulders of giants right.

12:03.610 --> 12:09.670
You want to leverage the data that's been generated from the previous projects and try to do better

12:09.940 --> 12:14.460
than all of them by seeing what they've done and seeing what worked and what didn't.

12:14.590 --> 12:18.780
And pricing is a really really important factor to consider.

12:18.940 --> 12:23.050
So it's well worth going through and scraping some of the most popular projects.

12:23.080 --> 12:28.300
You don't have to go nuts and do all 100 but maybe you know have 20 projects or 30 projects and you'll

12:28.300 --> 12:31.860
have a decent amount of data that can tell you quite a lot.

12:31.870 --> 12:37.720
So let's head back to our presentation and talk a little bit more about how we can make this process

12:37.750 --> 12:38.390
easier.
