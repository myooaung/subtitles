00:01.000 --> 00:05.020
Now the next thing I talk about is the different types of crowdfunding.

00:05.020 --> 00:13.030
Now people tend to use the word crowdfunding as an all encompassing term and it actually refers to different

00:13.570 --> 00:17.030
models of raising money from the crowd.

00:17.110 --> 00:22.700
And there's four main models and we're going to go through them one by one.

00:22.750 --> 00:26.200
So the first type is the donation based crowdfunding site.

00:26.230 --> 00:32.230
So this is something like Go Fund Me or just giving where essentially the people who are pledging don't

00:32.230 --> 00:37.900
really get anything in return just feelgood factor and you can sponsor different projects depending

00:37.900 --> 00:43.690
on you know what your day depending on your personal preferences or maybe what you have an interest

00:43.750 --> 00:44.380
in.

00:44.380 --> 00:50.920
So by listening your project on just giving your essentially a social enterprise or charity and it's

00:50.920 --> 00:53.080
not meant to be profit driven.

00:53.080 --> 00:58.870
So there's a lot of really really cool projects on there and you can make a huge difference.

00:59.020 --> 01:04.180
And you know a lot of the things that we're going talk about and of course apply to pretty much all

01:04.180 --> 01:10.090
types of crowdfunding because at the end of the day you know how you get your message across in your

01:10.090 --> 01:17.050
video or how you can better drive traffic really contributes the success to whatever type of campaign.

01:17.230 --> 01:22.030
But it's just for you to be aware of what different types of crowdfunding there are and to decide on

01:22.030 --> 01:24.510
which one is best suited to your project.

01:24.520 --> 01:30.610
So if you're a social enterprise if you're a charity and you have a specific project in mind a discrete

01:31.090 --> 01:39.250
project like maybe you know build a nursery in a particular village or you know bring books to you know

01:39.250 --> 01:43.460
some part of the world then this is a really good platform for doing that.

01:43.480 --> 01:49.900
It helps you spread the word it helps you organize your entire approach and it can also get you some

01:49.900 --> 01:51.670
free press.

01:51.670 --> 01:55.580
Now the next type which is what we're going to be talking about pre-done Donley in this course.

01:55.810 --> 02:02.590
And most of the examples are going to come from is the reward based crowdfunding also called pre-selling

02:02.590 --> 02:03.840
type of crowdfunding.

02:03.850 --> 02:08.970
So this is of course your Kickstarter your Indiegogo and some smaller sites as well.

02:08.980 --> 02:15.100
Now I'm going to talk about smaller sites so much because I don't think it's worth using because I think

02:15.100 --> 02:17.710
the platform effect can be quite huge.

02:17.710 --> 02:24.760
So by listing your project on Indiegogo or Kickstarter the site itself has a lot of traffic and it can

02:24.760 --> 02:31.450
bring you backers and pledges without you having any direct relationship with that traffic.

02:31.690 --> 02:37.660
So I think for a smaller site which doesn't get much traffic it's not actually worth putting in all

02:37.660 --> 02:40.120
of this effort to optimize for it.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.900
So we're going to be focusing on Kickstarter and indigo again.

02:43.030 --> 02:52.000
So the reward based crowdfunding platform function by having creators set out a range of perks so things

02:52.000 --> 02:54.760
that people will get for their pledge.

02:54.790 --> 03:01.240
Now these perks can be as small as a thank you note and they can be as large as maybe you know meeting

03:01.240 --> 03:08.320
the creators in person but essentially for these rewards people pledge various amounts and usually people

03:08.320 --> 03:10.460
are expecting to get a good deal.

03:10.480 --> 03:16.720
They're expecting to be the first person who gets to use this product so that they can show off to their

03:16.720 --> 03:21.610
friends and family about how they were first to use that particular product.

03:21.610 --> 03:27.690
We all know somebody who bought an iPhone when it was second generation and they go on about it.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.820
So there are those types of people.

03:30.070 --> 03:34.380
But also you know there are people who are looking for a good deal right.

03:34.390 --> 03:40.900
Because when you're launching on Kickstarter people are taking a risk by backing you because your project

03:40.900 --> 03:47.650
might fail you might run away with the money or of many many things can happen that will lead them to

03:47.740 --> 03:52.440
essentially having invested in something where they're not going to get anything back.

03:52.450 --> 03:57.910
Now that should really never occur because by the time that you're launching your campaign you should

03:57.910 --> 04:01.390
already have thought about how you're going to manufacture.

04:01.540 --> 04:03.300
How much is it going to cost.

04:03.370 --> 04:09.100
What are the unit cost and you should have all of this already researched and make sure that everything

04:09.100 --> 04:14.310
is feasible before you go on here it shouldn't be a sort of pie in the sky kind of idea.

04:14.320 --> 04:19.350
Are you saying oh you know I'm going to make a rocket ship that is going to take you to Mars.

04:20.230 --> 04:25.330
Surprisingly people still pledge for those kinds of projects but most likely you'll get pulled by the

04:25.330 --> 04:27.920
platform because it's completely unfeasible.

04:27.940 --> 04:32.550
So make sure that you've got all your organization done and you're going to these platforms.

04:32.710 --> 04:38.320
Pre-selling the thing that you're going to make so that by having a lot of backers you get volume discounts

04:38.320 --> 04:42.780
from the manufacturers and you have demonstrable interest in your product.

04:43.390 --> 04:47.770
So if you're making a hardware product this is definitely the way to go.

04:47.920 --> 04:53.020
But even if you're making a software product or something that is virtual this can be a really really

04:53.020 --> 04:55.770
good way of raising funding to make it possible.

04:55.870 --> 05:00.970
Because as we all know you know there are significant development costs associated with you know even

05:00.970 --> 05:04.770
making a new web app or making a new mobile app.

05:04.990 --> 05:10.000
And as long as you make it convincing enough for your backers then this can be a really good way of

05:10.000 --> 05:11.840
raising funding to make it happen.

05:12.250 --> 05:15.400
Now the next type is a lending based Crowdfunding.

05:15.400 --> 05:22.950
This is actually where backers are lending you money in hopes of getting a decent investment return.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.590
So Lynn invest is a really good example where people come together.

05:26.590 --> 05:32.190
They pull their money and they invest it into certain types of assets like property.

05:32.380 --> 05:40.000
And when that property gets sold and you gain a profit that profit is then divided between all of the

05:40.000 --> 05:42.900
backers did of getting a product as a reward.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.410
You actually get a financial reward but allows these lenders to invest in large projects without having

05:50.410 --> 05:56.760
to put up a lot of capital for a lot of risk and a twist on this kind of lending type of crowdfunding

05:56.800 --> 06:00.810
platform are one where you're essentially investing in debt.

06:00.820 --> 06:10.300
So for example you know if a startup needs money to grow and you are buying up that debt then if they

06:10.300 --> 06:16.060
do raise the next round and they gain more and they get more funding or if they get sold and they pay

06:16.060 --> 06:20.890
off their debt and then you're getting an interest way over and beyond what you would get from you know

06:20.890 --> 06:24.490
just having your money stored in a bank.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.800
So Funding Circle and lend invest.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.760
I would say two such examples of the lending type of crowdfunding.

06:30.790 --> 06:36.660
This is very similar in vain to the final type which is the equity based on which the two biggest that

06:36.670 --> 06:41.740
you should know about is crowd cube and Cedar's and the way that it works is that you're pledging money

06:42.040 --> 06:45.100
to get a fraction of equity in the company.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.010
Now these usually non-voting shares.

06:47.080 --> 06:53.640
Now the way that the equity is split and the share structure is beyond the scope of this talk.

06:53.740 --> 06:58.150
But essentially what you're saying is that I'm betting on this company growing and doing better in the

06:58.150 --> 06:59.050
future.

06:59.050 --> 07:06.310
So I want to be one of the early investors or a seed investor in this company so that when they do grow

07:07.030 --> 07:16.360
and they earn a profit or they get more funding or they get sold then my equity in that company is worth

07:16.360 --> 07:18.920
a lot more than what I'm putting in at this stage.

07:18.970 --> 07:23.370
So we're not gonna talk too much about the Financial Times because they have limited appeal.

07:23.380 --> 07:28.240
They usually have sort of higher participation costs and as a company who wants to raise funding they

07:28.240 --> 07:29.420
don't see it as a crowd cube.

07:29.590 --> 07:34.930
You actually have to jump through quite a few hoops because you're looking to raise a lot more funding

07:34.990 --> 07:36.740
and you're looking to give away equity.

07:37.020 --> 07:42.580
Now there's many cases where people have actually raised more money through pre-selling their product

07:42.580 --> 07:46.960
on Kickstarter than actually putting it on CDs and giving away equity.

07:47.140 --> 07:53.770
So giving away equity is not always the first thing that you should think about when you're looking

07:53.770 --> 07:55.420
to get funding basically.

07:55.540 --> 07:57.610
Now the central tenant still holds true.

07:57.610 --> 08:03.580
You know if you own 100 percent of nothing i.e. if your startup is worth nothing and you are 100 percent

08:03.580 --> 08:06.280
of it that still 100 percent of nothing.

08:06.280 --> 08:11.530
So in certain cases it does make sense to give away the equity in order to grow in order to make your

08:11.530 --> 08:15.760
company into something that has a lot more value.

08:15.790 --> 08:23.740
But I would always recommend to explore trying to pre-sell your product and get future customers first

08:23.740 --> 08:26.110
before you go down the equity based route.

08:26.110 --> 08:30.050
Now of course that depends on your start up depends on your idea depends on your project.

08:30.190 --> 08:34.900
But just have a think about which type of crowdfunding platform might be suitable for you.

08:35.020 --> 08:40.120
Or maybe crowdfunding isn't right for you at all and you want to go down the traditional funding routes

08:40.210 --> 08:46.480
and it really makes sense for you to evaluate and have a look at all four types of crowdfunding that

08:46.480 --> 08:53.290
I've mentioned and figure out which type is most suited for your particular project and that's going

08:53.290 --> 08:54.660
to involve a bit of research.

08:54.700 --> 08:58.650
Look at all these platforms I've mentioned look at the projects that have been listed.

08:58.660 --> 09:05.230
Look at the success rates look at the successful case studies and see which of these platforms is best

09:05.230 --> 09:08.970
suited or best matched towards what you want to raise funding for.
