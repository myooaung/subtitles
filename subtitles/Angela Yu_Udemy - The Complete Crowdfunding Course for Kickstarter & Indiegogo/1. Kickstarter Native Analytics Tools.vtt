Now these days we all know that data is everything and in order to have crowdfunding success to some

00:06.300 --> 00:09.270
extent your marketing efforts needs to be data driven.

00:09.270 --> 00:14.850
So in this Munjal going to talk about analytics all the ways in which you can tap into the data of how

00:14.850 --> 00:18.910
people coming to your crowdfunding side what are the methods that work for getting traffic.

00:18.930 --> 00:21.840
What are the highs converting roods and much much more.

00:21.840 --> 00:26.700
The first thing to realize is that Kickstarter really comes pre-built with a whole bunch of analytics

00:26.730 --> 00:29.580
tools that will help you in your campaign.

00:29.580 --> 00:34.710
So if youve ever run a Kickstarter or if you are going to you're going to become very very friendly

00:34.920 --> 00:36.540
with this blue chart.

00:36.930 --> 00:42.900
It's going to chart the progress of all of your pledges and your funding throughout time cumulatively.

00:43.080 --> 00:48.360
So you'll be able to see the steepness of that curve as a reflection of how much money you're getting

00:48.360 --> 00:50.080
in per day.

00:50.220 --> 00:54.720
The other thing that Kickstarter gives you is a breakdown of the pledges in terms of what percentage

00:54.720 --> 00:59.960
came from Kickstarter itself and what percentage came from outside referrers.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.250
And then it breaks down those referrals to direct traffic where somebody just entered the realm of your

01:05.250 --> 01:05.760
campaign.

01:05.770 --> 01:10.590
So that's usually being shared from email or you know direct messages.

01:10.620 --> 01:19.050
Facebook shares Twitter shares medium blog posts and it also shows you which pages on Kickstarter itself

01:19.320 --> 01:22.490
is referring to that green slice of the pie.

01:22.680 --> 01:28.440
So for us one of the biggest refroze was the Discover page of the technology category and that actually

01:28.440 --> 01:30.540
brought us quite a lot of pledges.

01:30.540 --> 01:33.760
So it's a good place to figure out which parts of the strategy are working.

01:33.840 --> 01:39.030
Which parts or not how much of your referral if traffic is actually producing conversions and what was

01:39.030 --> 01:41.550
the percentage conversion of each route.

01:41.580 --> 01:46.170
So the next thing that you'll see on your stats page is your video plays essentially the view count

01:46.170 --> 01:51.060
of your videos how many times was it watched and you can also see if it was watched on Kickstarter or

01:51.060 --> 01:52.650
if it was embedded somewhere else.

01:52.650 --> 01:57.150
Now depending on how you're promoting a campaign it might be that you're trying to embed your video

01:57.150 --> 02:02.490
on a number of places or it might be that you're just sharing the links to your campaign so that people

02:02.490 --> 02:06.580
go and watch it at the place where they can pledge which makes a little bit more sense.

02:06.630 --> 02:12.050
But there you go and you can also see what percentage of your video was actually completed and the U.S.

02:12.090 --> 02:17.440
is actually usually very low and 30 percent is actually not a bad number.

02:17.910 --> 02:22.830
So even though you cut down your video to three minutes people still don't have the attention spans

02:22.830 --> 02:24.910
to complete an entire video.

02:24.990 --> 02:31.050
And that confirms the usual case where people tend to only watch one minute of video on any platform.

02:31.050 --> 02:35.330
And the last thing that the kickstarted stats show is you'll reward tape popularity.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.370
So which tears are the most popular.

02:37.560 --> 02:43.110
Now you can and do very much about that because once you've set out a reward tier and you've got people

02:43.110 --> 02:49.010
pledging in it even if it's just one person who pledged for it you can't change that tier at all anymore.

02:49.020 --> 02:50.040
So you have to roll with it.

02:50.220 --> 02:55.410
But it might be the case that you're seeing that people are more inclined towards you know the more

02:55.410 --> 02:57.010
expensive side of the royalties.

02:57.150 --> 03:04.770
So for example for us the Initially most popular here was actually the 69 pound tear and that led us

03:04.770 --> 03:11.040
to realize that maybe we actually needed a slightly higher tier as well to address that market demand.

03:11.040 --> 03:15.540
Now in terms of tracking the traffic that brings people into Kickstarter.

03:15.690 --> 03:20.460
One of the things that you can do is you can actually create custom referral tags inside Kickstarter

03:20.460 --> 03:26.790
so you can say something like Twitter and it generates a tag and generates a custom link that you can

03:26.790 --> 03:32.570
use to to see in your stats page on Kickstarter where that traffic came from.

03:32.640 --> 03:38.520
So for example if you hit up an influenza and you get them to refer traffic to your campaign it might

03:38.520 --> 03:44.190
be worth creating a custom tag for that influencer just so you can track to see you know whether if

03:44.520 --> 03:47.080
youre actually getting the results that youre paying for.

03:47.280 --> 03:53.970
So theres a lot of influences in on Instagram or on Twitter who actually have fake follower accounts.

03:54.090 --> 03:59.550
So they actually pay for followers and they pay for likes which generates this false belief that they

03:59.550 --> 04:01.340
actually have a lot of real engagement.

04:01.470 --> 04:06.660
But actually those numbers are fake and so you might want to track how much traffic you are actually

04:06.660 --> 04:08.470
getting from these influences.

04:08.490 --> 04:10.050
If you decide to go down that route.
