00:00.910 --> 00:04.800
Hi guys and welcome to the complete crowdfunding course.

00:04.840 --> 00:07.250
My name is Angela and I'm in Iowa.

00:07.330 --> 00:11.760
And watching us develop them as well as the founder of the London brewery.

00:11.920 --> 00:16.110
Now at the law Nappi Amata is the fastest way to learn to code.

00:16.120 --> 00:21.190
We teach web and mobile application development as well as a whole bunch of other things like design

00:21.220 --> 00:22.720
and digital marketing.

00:22.720 --> 00:28.180
Now I've been lucky enough to have been named as one of the rising stars in the most influential women

00:28.180 --> 00:34.840
in UK I.T. and I have a huge interest in enabling people from non-technical backgrounds to get into

00:34.840 --> 00:36.890
tech and learn digital skills.

00:36.910 --> 00:38.360
So what do we do at the lender.

00:38.500 --> 00:44.860
Well most of the time we teach programming but we also work with a number of companies and organizations

00:45.100 --> 00:51.940
like the NHS and universities like London School of Economics as well as large companies like Amazon

00:51.970 --> 00:58.340
or Twitter or Oracle to bring the best education in tech available to everybody.

00:58.360 --> 01:05.620
Now in June 2016 we embarked on a kickstarter to crowdfund our online platform.

01:05.740 --> 01:12.400
So you might already be on that online platform right now and it's only possible because of our hugely

01:12.400 --> 01:13.900
successful Kickstarter.

01:13.900 --> 01:18.200
So there was a lot of coffee that was consumed during that very short time period.

01:18.340 --> 01:26.590
But we were able to raise almost forty thousand pounds in under 28 days acquiring 714 backers and getting

01:26.590 --> 01:29.880
almost a thousand people to look at the Kickstarter every day.

01:29.890 --> 01:35.440
So I want to share with you what it's like to run a Kickstarter including the most exciting part when

01:35.440 --> 01:39.770
you can watch the amount that you've raised go up live.

01:39.790 --> 01:46.570
You know it's just literally sitting there looking at the screen and seeing the numbers go up like every

01:46.570 --> 01:47.210
second.

01:47.230 --> 01:48.480
Especially towards the end.

01:48.490 --> 01:50.290
It was absolutely insane.

01:50.290 --> 01:55.840
And I want to show you a step by step approach from all of our research and all of our experience in

01:55.840 --> 02:01.290
running a successful Kickstarter so that you too can raise funding for your idea through Crowdfunding.

02:01.480 --> 02:07.180
So the various aspects that we're going to cover are research i.e. what you need to do before you start

02:07.180 --> 02:08.140
your Crowdfunding.

02:08.140 --> 02:12.010
And a lot of the reason behind successful Kickstarter is is adequate planning.

02:12.010 --> 02:15.850
So we're going to talk about what are the things you need to look at and what are some of the number

02:15.850 --> 02:20.260
crunching exercises you need to do before you even start your Kickstarter.

02:20.260 --> 02:25.780
Next we're going to talk about the algorithm and I'm going to target most specifically Kickstarter because

02:25.780 --> 02:31.690
that's one of the largest platforms where people crowdfund and I'm going to talk about how you can get

02:31.690 --> 02:35.050
your project to rank in the popular section of Kickstarter.

02:35.260 --> 02:41.350
Now a lot of the rules are going to talk about is going to apply to indigo Cedar's or crowd cube or

02:41.410 --> 02:43.720
any of the big crowdfunding sites.

02:43.720 --> 02:49.780
So as long as you've got the algorithm down and you know what contributes to your project ranking then

02:49.780 --> 02:54.670
you'll be able to get your project in front of the eyeballs of many many more people and therefore raise

02:54.670 --> 03:00.310
more funding then we're going to talk about the actual campaigns so we're going to dive deep into how

03:00.310 --> 03:06.970
you can go about producing your video how you should go about optimizing your listing your title or

03:06.970 --> 03:14.590
your description for CEO as well as for buyer psychology so that we can make your campaign the best

03:14.680 --> 03:16.580
that it possibly can be.

03:16.600 --> 03:21.970
We're going to look into some examples where this was done well and what was done badly so that we can

03:21.970 --> 03:25.320
show you using case studies exactly what you should do.

03:26.020 --> 03:31.480
Next we're going to dig into analytics how you can track your campaign and how you can track your campaign

03:31.480 --> 03:32.620
progress.

03:32.620 --> 03:34.230
Then we're going to talk about traffic.

03:34.270 --> 03:40.390
And this is going to be a huge topic because essentially at the end of the day all crowdfunding success

03:40.390 --> 03:43.160
boils down to one thing and that traffic.

03:43.250 --> 03:46.040
If he got it then you have nothing to worry about.

03:46.060 --> 03:49.660
And if you don't then you're not going to see the amount raised go up.

03:49.660 --> 03:55.570
So we're going to talk about how you can bring traffic through social media through hitting up known

03:55.570 --> 04:00.160
Kickstarter backers and creating a big email list by having a landing page.

04:00.220 --> 04:04.180
And how you can go about creating all those things and the last thing that we're going to talk about

04:04.270 --> 04:06.220
is post-campaign IP.

04:06.250 --> 04:12.120
What do you have to do after the campaign is finished and how can you make it as pain free as possible.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.100
Not at this stage.

04:13.120 --> 04:18.610
All the exciting parts the fund raising excitement has all finished but it doesn't mean that you can

04:18.610 --> 04:24.030
be like there's a lot of things that you need to be aware of including tax including platform fees and

04:24.120 --> 04:25.930
a whole bunch of other things that we're going to talk about.

04:26.070 --> 04:31.270
And throughout this course we're going to be telling you what you should be doing before the Kickstarter

04:31.270 --> 04:36.580
starts what you should be doing during it and what you might need to do afterwards.

04:36.700 --> 04:42.970
So there's a clear timeline of what tasks need to be done when so that you can plan and use your time

04:43.030 --> 04:43.960
most effectively.

04:43.960 --> 04:49.030
And also I'm going to be telling you about a lot of the tools that I've used and I came across that

04:49.030 --> 04:53.200
were really really useful so that you don't have to go digging around or creating your own tools for

04:53.280 --> 04:53.770
certain things.

04:53.770 --> 04:54.630
I'm going to teach you.

04:54.760 --> 04:59.890
And the idea really is that the Course is meant to be a step by step approach so that we can show you

05:00.360 --> 05:05.940
you need to do at each and every stage of your crowdfunding journey so that you have the best chance

05:06.240 --> 05:10.560
of making your project a huge success and raising capital to make it happen.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.670
I'm really excited.

05:11.670 --> 05:12.860
I hope you are too.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.700
And I'll see you on my next lesson.

05:14.700 --> 05:15.630
When we get started.
