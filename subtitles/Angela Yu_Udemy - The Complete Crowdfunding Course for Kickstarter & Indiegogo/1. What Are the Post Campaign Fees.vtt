00:00.870 --> 00:01.230
All right.

00:01.230 --> 00:05.390
So we've spoken about all the various aspects of crowdfunding.

00:05.430 --> 00:12.120
We've taken you from the research phase through to the analytics through to getting traffic and creating

00:12.120 --> 00:13.270
your campaign.

00:13.290 --> 00:20.190
Now it's finally time to talk about post-campaign what you need to do after your campaign has ended

00:20.790 --> 00:26.070
and one of the first thing I want to talk to you about is fees and some of the fees that you might not

00:26.070 --> 00:29.580
have thought about when you embarked on your crowdfunding him pain.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.170
And this is not here to scare you.

00:31.170 --> 00:37.710
It's just for you to plan ahead of time and make sure that you price accordingly so that you don't end

00:37.710 --> 00:41.020
up losing out after your successful campaign.

00:41.280 --> 00:50.550
So this is a breakdown of all of the costs that the Creator incurred from this particular project is

00:50.580 --> 00:54.790
called the filmography of aircraft and it was created by Kathryn Lavery.

00:54.990 --> 00:59.790
She had 340 backers who pledged $25000.

00:59.790 --> 01:04.470
And here is where all of that $25 went after the campaign.

01:04.800 --> 01:10.420
So she start out with 25000 $161.

01:10.500 --> 01:16.530
Now you have to remember that both kickstart and indigo go charge 5 percent fees in order to have your

01:16.530 --> 01:19.250
project listed on their website.

01:19.500 --> 01:27.720
So $25000 minus about $1000 gets you now down to twenty three thousand nine hundred two dollars.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.680
So we've really taken a significant haircut.

01:30.780 --> 01:36.390
Now the next part is you have to realize that some of the fees are not collected because Kickstarter

01:36.390 --> 01:42.690
takes down credit card details and people can cancel their credit card payments or they can change their

01:42.690 --> 01:43.700
credit cards.

01:43.740 --> 01:49.980
Some of the pledges that people have actually made even after your campaign has ended may get withdrawn

01:50.160 --> 01:51.980
by the credit card company.

01:51.990 --> 01:56.780
So in this case she actually saw a decrease of only about $90.

01:56.790 --> 02:02.940
So we're still on twenty three thousand eight hundred thirteen dollars after accounting for the last

02:03.000 --> 02:04.930
pledges due to credit cards.

02:06.160 --> 02:11.680
Now the other thing you have to remember that during your campaign people can cancel their pledges at

02:11.680 --> 02:12.630
any time.

02:12.760 --> 02:18.190
So you might see money coming in but then you might see money going back out again because people cancel

02:18.250 --> 02:19.270
their pledges.

02:19.270 --> 02:26.140
Now a great tip to prevent this from happening to you is once people put in their pledge is to send

02:26.140 --> 02:32.500
them a personal message through Kickstarter or through IndieGoGo thanking them for their pledge and

02:32.500 --> 02:35.770
thanking them for believing in your cause and this way.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.430
You know you really give that personal touch.

02:38.440 --> 02:43.390
You help people realize that their pledge is going towards an actual person and not some sort of you

02:43.390 --> 02:45.310
know gray uniform company.

02:45.310 --> 02:45.940
Right.

02:46.210 --> 02:48.050
So that is a really really good tip.

02:48.070 --> 02:51.850
And that's something that we did that a lot of people really appreciated.

02:51.970 --> 02:58.420
We genuinely thanked people for their pledges after every single pledge came in and we had a lot of

02:58.570 --> 03:03.880
messages back from people saying you know I've been planning on Kickstarter for five years now I pledged

03:04.150 --> 03:09.440
for over 100 projects and nobody has personally thanked me for my pledge.

03:09.550 --> 03:14.410
So that's just a little tip in there to prevent you from having more cancel pledges.

03:14.530 --> 03:18.020
Now the next thing to account for is the payment processing fees.

03:18.070 --> 03:22.440
So Kickstarter used to use Amazon but now I think they use stripe.

03:22.540 --> 03:28.960
So the payment processing fees are something like around 3 percent of whatever it is that you make.

03:28.960 --> 03:34.570
So in this case they actually ended up being about one thousand one hundred eighty five dollars from

03:34.570 --> 03:37.390
that $23000 that she collected.

03:37.420 --> 03:40.360
So we're now down to about $22000.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.990
Bear with me there's more to come.

03:42.040 --> 03:49.750
So in her project she promised people these books and framed images and accounting for all of the printing

03:49.750 --> 03:51.040
impacting costs.

03:51.040 --> 03:56.760
It costs about 13000 in order to produce all of the rewards that she promised her backers.

03:56.830 --> 04:01.890
And now this brings us down to just under $10000.

04:01.930 --> 04:07.780
So the point here is that if you aren't going to print and package any sort of physical good make sure

04:07.780 --> 04:13.240
that you work out these costs ahead of time and make sure that you give yourself enough of a buffer

04:13.510 --> 04:16.500
so that you don't end up being out of pocket.

04:16.510 --> 04:21.760
Then we have fullfilment So people who actually packaged the products together and then send them on

04:21.760 --> 04:22.370
their way.

04:22.510 --> 04:24.880
And that cost her about $400.

04:24.880 --> 04:28.330
So we're now down to nine thousand two hundred seventy one.

04:28.360 --> 04:33.770
Then there's postage which is another about $5000 went out down to four thousand four hundred fifty.

04:34.030 --> 04:41.140
So now all of that four thousand four hundred fifty that remains is the income right and the money that

04:41.140 --> 04:45.950
you raise and Kickstarter counts as income at least within the U.S. and the UK.

04:46.180 --> 04:51.330
So that means you have to pay income tax on whatever it is that you make at the end.

04:51.400 --> 04:58.840
So you want to make sure that if your project ends towards the end of the year to pay for all the things

04:58.840 --> 04:59.650
that you're going to pay for.

04:59.650 --> 05:04.400
So the printing the packaging etc. before you transfer it to your bank account.

05:04.450 --> 05:09.910
So that way you only end up paying for your profit instead of all the expenses as well.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.020
And that reduces your tax burden.

05:12.280 --> 05:19.570
But on this 4400 50 she paid around almost two thousand in taxes away in the U.S. this was.

05:19.750 --> 05:27.220
So she's left with two thousand five hundred forty three plus nine cents of total net profit from that

05:27.220 --> 05:30.910
$20000 Kickstarter campaign.

05:30.910 --> 05:35.950
So when you run a Kickstarter an indigo campaign you know a lot of your friends and family will see

05:35.950 --> 05:40.200
that number and see your goal and see the amount of UV rays pass.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.510
Your goal as your profit.

05:41.530 --> 05:42.640
You know.

05:43.060 --> 05:47.210
So for example if you raise a million dollars and your goal is only 10000.

05:47.230 --> 05:53.440
They think that you're probably sitting on some yacht you know using that 990 thousand dollars of your

05:53.440 --> 05:54.220
extra money.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.990
But as we all know that's not how it works.

05:57.190 --> 06:03.160
And the important thing to realize is that you must work out all of this math that's going to come up

06:03.160 --> 06:09.940
later on so that you actually end up being profitable and being able to deliver people what you promised

06:09.940 --> 06:10.340
them.
