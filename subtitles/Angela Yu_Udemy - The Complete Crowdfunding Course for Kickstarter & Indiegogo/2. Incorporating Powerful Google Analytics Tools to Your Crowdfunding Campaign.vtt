Now turning to a slightly more powerful analytics tool is of course Google Analytics.

00:07.230 --> 00:13.020
So if you've never used this just go to analytics Google dot com and you'll be able to sign in with

00:13.020 --> 00:18.020
your normal Google account and it's completely free to use and it offers some really really useful tools.

00:18.030 --> 00:23.460
So if you hit that down arrow and seinen and then go to analytics you'll be confronted with a dashboard

00:23.460 --> 00:25.170
that looks a bit like this.

00:25.170 --> 00:30.870
And in order to set up a new property to track all you have to do is just click on the settings icon

00:30.950 --> 00:38.450
and the left menu bar and then click the down arrow under the property and then hit create a new property.

00:38.460 --> 00:43.570
Now it's going to take you to a set up page where you give it a name give it the you Arel which is the

00:43.620 --> 00:48.630
Jarrell of your campaign page and then you hit the get tracking ID button and it's going to give you

00:48.630 --> 00:56.250
an I.D. which you're going to paste into the dashboard of your Kickstarter campaign under the section

00:56.250 --> 00:58.570
where it says Google Analytics tracking ID.

00:58.680 --> 01:04.350
Now once you hit update tracking I.D. It can take anywhere between 24 to 48 hours before data starts

01:04.350 --> 01:09.980
coming in from Kickstarter through to Google Analytics so be patient and just wait about a day.

01:09.990 --> 01:16.050
Now once you've done that the next thing to do is again go back to that settings page and having your

01:16.050 --> 01:17.280
property selected.

01:17.280 --> 01:21.390
So in this case we call it Kickstarter on the right side hand menu.

01:21.430 --> 01:23.560
Want to go into that e-commerce settings.

01:23.700 --> 01:29.970
And here I go able to enable e-commerce which means that you're going to track the conversion rate of

01:29.970 --> 01:32.200
people who come through various traffic.

01:32.250 --> 01:38.850
You want to enable e-commerce make it on and then enhanced e-commerce settings leave it off and then

01:38.850 --> 01:40.370
just hit submit.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.420
Now that also takes a little while to set up.

01:42.420 --> 01:48.780
But once that's all set up and you're getting data and you're able to see your conversion rate inside

01:48.780 --> 01:53.570
the conversions menu and you can also see depending on various traffic.

01:53.580 --> 01:59.370
So you can go into acquisition and sources slash medium and you can see which blog post generated the

01:59.370 --> 02:04.520
most conversions for example or which traffic sources bring the most people to your campaign.

02:04.570 --> 02:09.650
And it's a whole bunch of really really interesting data that allows you to almost with laser accuracy

02:09.680 --> 02:12.380
focus on your highest converting traffic sources.
