00:00.600 --> 00:06.690
So through out this complete crowdfunding course we've spoken about the research that you need to do

00:06.720 --> 00:10.130
before you embark on your crowdfunding journey.

00:10.200 --> 00:16.920
We've looked into the algorithm that helps you figure out how to make your project rank higher whether

00:17.010 --> 00:19.910
it's on Kickstarter or whether it's on Indiegogo.

00:20.250 --> 00:26.310
We've also spoken about the actual campaign how are going to go about creating the videos the description

00:26.340 --> 00:33.360
the images the animations the goal the stretch goals and all of those aspects of your campaign and putting

00:33.360 --> 00:34.430
it together.

00:34.800 --> 00:41.220
We've also looked into analytics how you can analyze your data and see how to bring in more backers

00:41.220 --> 00:44.450
and more traffic and more conversions.

00:44.460 --> 00:45.930
We then look at traffic.

00:45.930 --> 00:52.280
So how you can bring the eyeballs to your campaign and get people looking at it and seeing what it's

00:52.290 --> 00:54.660
about and starting to pledge.

00:54.720 --> 01:00.960
And finally we looked at all the things that you need to do after your campaign has ended.

01:00.990 --> 01:06.930
I hope you've enjoyed taking this course and I hope you all the success in the world for your crowdfunding

01:06.930 --> 01:07.850

01:07.980 --> 01:12.690
And if you do launch a campaign do let us know about it in the private messages so we can have a look

01:12.690 --> 01:14.560
at it and try and congratulate you.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.870
