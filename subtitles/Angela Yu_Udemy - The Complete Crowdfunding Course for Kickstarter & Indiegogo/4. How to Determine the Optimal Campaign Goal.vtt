00:00.540 --> 00:04.010
Now the next thing that you'll need to think about is your goal amount.

00:04.020 --> 00:07.190
So that's what you're going to aim for for your project.

00:07.200 --> 00:13.410
Now we already spoke earlier in the algorithm section about creating a goal that's reasonable and feasible

00:14.160 --> 00:17.380
to be achieved maybe within the first 48 hours.

00:17.430 --> 00:22.070
But let's drill down a little bit deeper in how you can figure out the exact number to go for.

00:22.080 --> 00:27.290
So the rough calculation that you need to make is how much it's going to cost to create a single unit

00:27.660 --> 00:33.000
plus your buffer to guard against any unknown unknowns.

00:33.030 --> 00:33.300
Right.

00:33.300 --> 00:38.760
Things that might happen that you haven't predicted that will cost you and then you multiply that by

00:38.760 --> 00:39.510
your reach.

00:39.570 --> 00:41.610
As in how many email contacts have you got.

00:41.610 --> 00:46.500
How big is your social following etc. and that gives you a rough estimate of how much you should make

00:46.500 --> 00:47.310
your goal.

00:47.310 --> 00:54.690
So the first thing you have to do is make a list of all the costs that are involved in creating manufacturing

00:54.720 --> 00:57.510
packaging and delivering your product.

00:57.510 --> 01:03.420
Now be really careful about offering international shipments as we found out there are some countries

01:03.420 --> 01:05.740
where it's almost impossible to ship to.

01:05.880 --> 01:10.540
And we were really grateful that we had bankers from all over the world.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.820
But we had to ship something to a country where there was no postcode.

01:13.830 --> 01:15.300
It was a real headache.

01:15.330 --> 01:22.170
So in Kickstarter and in indigo you can limit where you are willing to ship to by country.

01:22.200 --> 01:27.060
You can limit it to one country or a couple or handful however many you like.

01:27.060 --> 01:33.510
So do some research about the delivery for each of these countries and try to limit that country number

01:33.510 --> 01:34.010
down.

01:34.140 --> 01:36.770
So it makes your distribution a lot easier.

01:36.930 --> 01:43.230
Well the other thing is create a list of all your expenses so there's no expense that's too small if

01:43.230 --> 01:49.440
your campaign becomes a huge hit and you have maybe a thousand people or ten thousand people who are

01:49.440 --> 01:56.820
backing you then even the expenses are really small like packaging tape become really big so don't neglect

01:56.910 --> 02:04.650
any part of creating the product work how the unit costs and include even all the small costs as well.

02:04.650 --> 02:07.860
Now the other thing that's really important is to add a cushion.

02:07.860 --> 02:13.290
Now this is something that will protect you against the unknown unknowns that will definitely happen

02:13.530 --> 02:15.590
at some point during your campaign.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.790
So there are costs that you can't predict and it's always a good idea to just add a small financial

02:20.790 --> 02:21.200
buffer.

02:21.210 --> 02:25.530
You don't end up out of pocket and unable to deliver to your backers.

02:25.530 --> 02:28.850
Now the other thing you need to work out is the size of your megaphone.

02:28.860 --> 02:29.870
What I mean by that.

02:30.030 --> 02:32.440
How many people are you able to reach.

02:32.460 --> 02:35.610
Now remember that e-mail open rates are not 100 percent.

02:35.610 --> 02:39.000
In fact you'd be lucky to get maybe 40 percent open rates.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.400
So think about how many people you have on your list how many people's emboss you can reach and how

02:44.400 --> 02:49.590
many people are likely to open it when it's something that is promotional in nature and you can work

02:49.590 --> 02:52.970
out the size of your megaphone and how far you can reach.

02:53.100 --> 02:59.310
So this is really good tool from Indigo that helps you work out what your goal amount should be based

02:59.310 --> 03:00.660
on your email list size.

03:00.810 --> 03:05.780
So you simply enter in your email list and then you enter your average contributions.

03:05.820 --> 03:10.470
So this single product price and it helps you work out what your goal might be.

03:10.470 --> 03:11.850
Now it's a very rough estimate.

03:11.880 --> 03:16.890
It's basically saying that you're going to convert about 5 percent of your email list which is quite

03:16.890 --> 03:17.850
generous.

03:17.850 --> 03:22.680
And then it multiplies it by the cost of your product to give you that number.

03:23.010 --> 03:24.770
So you can actually just do it on a calculator.

03:24.780 --> 03:26.570
You don't actually need the spreadsheet.

03:26.760 --> 03:30.620
But it's just a nice thing to keep in your Kickstarter planner spreadsheet.

03:30.720 --> 03:36.000
Now there are some harrowing tales from the past and one of them is hey her razor company.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.670
Believe it or not.

03:36.690 --> 03:41.310
It's called Zafira and they've launched two campaigns on Kickstarter.

03:41.520 --> 03:46.010
Both campaigns raising about five hundred thousand dollars.

03:46.050 --> 03:47.590
Now that's not a small amount.

03:47.760 --> 03:53.740
But in both times they actually didn't get a single cent because their funding is all or nothing.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.060
Now their goal was really really ambitious.

03:56.070 --> 04:01.720
It was a million dollars and that is a big goal even if you run it for 60 days.

04:01.740 --> 04:07.440
Even if you got all the press in the world which they did it doesn't mean that you can reach that high

04:07.830 --> 04:15.690
and it might be that for them creating a sapphire blade razor only works when they have you know a million

04:15.690 --> 04:16.930
dollars in cash.

04:17.070 --> 04:21.150
Maybe you know they need to buy the sapphire mine or whatever their reason may be.

04:21.180 --> 04:25.530
But you have to be really careful about trying to aim for such a large goal.

04:25.590 --> 04:32.130
In most cases you should aim for a goal that you can comfortably reach and then you're usually going

04:32.130 --> 04:34.330
to get better results than aiming too high.
