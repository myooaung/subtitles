00:00.840 --> 00:05.740
So we tend to say that Crowdfunding is about raising funding but it's actually not just that it's also

00:05.740 --> 00:07.840
a pre-selling your product.

00:08.010 --> 00:08.340
Right.

00:08.340 --> 00:13.150
So if your campaign is successful you already have customers.

00:13.230 --> 00:13.810
Think about it.

00:13.830 --> 00:20.070
It's not just D.C. or an investor giving you money giving your go letting you try it out and see if

00:20.070 --> 00:21.440
you can grow your company.

00:21.540 --> 00:28.080
You actually have real customers who are supporting your endeavors and these tend to be people who are

00:28.080 --> 00:34.740
closer to the 1000 true fans that can Kelly talks about you know people who have really back to you

00:35.220 --> 00:40.770
based on trust that you will create a great product so so that being in the Bay area a couple of years

00:40.770 --> 00:47.770
back and I was taken on a tour of the Tesla the new Tesla factory by J.B. Strobl who is one of the co-founders.

00:48.150 --> 00:54.840
And he said something that was really interesting about Tesla which is around 50 percent of their initial

00:54.840 --> 01:01.680
funding actually came from customers customers who said I will put down this money even though we're

01:01.680 --> 01:04.160
not sure what the end product might look like.

01:04.170 --> 01:12.900
I have enough faith in your company to give you my money and allow you to acquire the tools or the people

01:12.900 --> 01:15.240
or the factory to actually build this thing.

01:15.390 --> 01:21.720
And many times during the lifetime of Tesla they actually had a lot of financial troubles.

01:21.750 --> 01:26.970
You know I think Elon Musk can only pump in as much money as he had at the time.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.070
But as you know he's vested in quite a few ventures.

01:30.330 --> 01:36.840
And so there were times where they actually had to go to these presold customers and say hey you know

01:36.870 --> 01:44.270
I know that we said that this car was going to cost you know 200000 or whatever it was but we actually

01:44.280 --> 01:46.010
is actually not going to work.

01:46.050 --> 01:52.530
We can either refund you or if you like you can actually increase your pledge and we can actually make

01:52.530 --> 01:53.430
this happen.

01:53.520 --> 02:01.000
And their backers really really came through and made Tesla what it is today.

02:01.020 --> 02:07.740
So think about your campaign not just as raising money for your company but getting your true fans getting

02:07.740 --> 02:11.390
your first customers and presenting your product.

02:11.730 --> 02:13.370
So let's look at some examples.

02:13.380 --> 02:18.790
Exploding kittens was a card game that was created by the makers of the oatmeal.

02:18.990 --> 02:21.640
So the Army already has a huge following.

02:21.740 --> 02:25.200
It's a hugely successful web comic series.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.480
I was actually one of my favorites.

02:26.490 --> 02:32.430
And so a little while back they decided to create a card game that was based on drawings that would

02:32.430 --> 02:35.110
be drawn up by the artist himself.

02:35.250 --> 02:43.350
And they managed to pre sell this product to over 200000 people and raised over eight million dollars

02:43.680 --> 02:45.180
for a card game.

02:45.180 --> 02:46.310
So think about it.

02:46.500 --> 02:51.540
You know it's something that he could have put up on his website and sold to everybody.

02:51.630 --> 02:56.540
But by creating a crowdfunding project he was able to expose it to a lot more people.

02:56.550 --> 03:02.610
So people who weren't normally readers of his web comic he was able to get a huge amount of press which

03:02.610 --> 03:05.790
he wouldn't have otherwise by just launching it on his site.

03:05.790 --> 03:12.060
And also it's a great way of gathering together your community you know getting your fans to share your

03:12.060 --> 03:15.730
product and gain more customers and gain more fans.

03:15.730 --> 03:18.760
And another really topical example is the fidget cube.

03:18.870 --> 03:21.260
So currently it is June 2017.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.120
And these fidget cubes are sold absolutely everywhere.

03:25.330 --> 03:30.270
Yesterday I went to a wine shop in London and they were selling fidget cubes and fidget spinners.

03:30.270 --> 03:32.220
I've no idea why they're so popular.

03:32.280 --> 03:36.240
But it all started here on Kickstarter.

03:36.300 --> 03:41.610
They created a video where they demonstrated what this thing could be useful and it captured everybody's

03:41.610 --> 03:42.760
imaginations.

03:42.840 --> 03:50.570
They raised over six million dollars for a small cube allows you to fidget during class.

03:50.610 --> 03:52.210
Get that right.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.840
And now it's been cloned and copied by almost everybody.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.450
It's available everywhere.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.010
It's become a huge sensation.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.320
And this is where it started.
