The real thing you should think about is that there's a lot of journalists and tech bloggers who monitor

00:06.180 --> 00:12.720
Kickstarter for new and innovative products that might become tomorrow's cuple tomorrow's Tesla and

00:12.720 --> 00:17.430
you get a huge amount of free press by just having a successful Kickstarter project.

00:17.610 --> 00:19.150
So this is one example.

00:19.170 --> 00:24.170
The World's Best Travel jacket by Bow backs and think about it.

00:24.180 --> 00:30.650
It's a travel jacket and essentially it's a travel jacket with a couple of features that maybe other

00:30.690 --> 00:31.930
jackets don't have.

00:32.030 --> 00:37.400
Like you know a pocket for your smartphone or a detachable hood.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.220
I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's not groundbreaking.

00:40.230 --> 00:44.040
It's not like it's a rocket to Mars or like a mind reading headset.

00:44.040 --> 00:44.310
Right.

00:44.310 --> 00:49.850
It's just a product that is incrementally better than what you have already.

00:49.860 --> 00:53.220
Not only did it raise over nine million dollars.

00:53.220 --> 01:00.380
So they pre-sold this product to about 40000 people and raised a huge amount of money.

01:00.630 --> 01:08.220
But also they got featured in so many places that you would just never ever be able to get in as a travel

01:08.220 --> 01:08.830
jacket.

01:08.970 --> 01:09.440
Right.

01:09.660 --> 01:17.370
If you think about it why would entrepreneurship or the guardian or CNN Money write about a travel jacket

01:17.460 --> 01:19.730
under any normal circumstance.

01:19.740 --> 01:25.950
It's only because it was a Kickstarter and it was a hugely successful Kickstarter that they got all

01:25.950 --> 01:31.590
of this free press that in turn provided this positive reinforcement loop which cost them more backers

01:31.950 --> 01:36.880
more money and more press and going back to fish on wheels.

01:37.080 --> 01:41.890
Even they were featured all over the place mostly as a tongue in cheek.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.790
But still there was huge amount of exposure for the creators behind it who went on to do other things.

01:47.850 --> 01:55.680
Under any normal condition you wouldn't expect a fish aquarium that's attached to wheels to appear on

01:55.740 --> 01:58.830
national geographic or the BBC blog.

01:58.950 --> 01:59.370
Right.

01:59.460 --> 02:00.450
And here it is.

02:00.450 --> 02:05.880
So what I'm trying to say is that this is the power of crowdfunding especially the big platforms like

02:05.880 --> 02:07.480
Kickstarter and Indiegogo.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.130
If you get a lot of traction on there and there's a lot of people who want to talk about you there's

02:11.130 --> 02:13.370
a lot of people who want to write about you.

02:13.500 --> 02:17.070
And it's a great opportunity of getting some free coverage.

02:17.070 --> 02:23.250
So I hope that's gone some way towards getting you thinking about using crowdfunding as a means of raising

02:23.250 --> 02:28.920
funding and pre-selling your product as well as getting a whole lot of exposure for your company.

02:28.980 --> 02:32.790
And the one thing that I haven't really spoken about which I'm going to talk about a lot more later

02:33.690 --> 02:40.200
is the fact that if you put your project onto Kickstarter Indiegogo remember that there's a lot of people

02:40.290 --> 02:45.870
who habitually crawl the size to see what are some new and interesting things that they can buy or they

02:45.870 --> 02:52.650
can get into so that they can be the first person who has a pebble watch or the first person who ever

02:52.650 --> 02:53.710
owned a fidget cube.

02:53.880 --> 03:00.480
So a big part of why crowdfunding on these big platforms work is because they also bring the people

03:00.600 --> 03:05.040
and we're going to talk a lot more about this in the algorithms section where we talk about how you

03:05.040 --> 03:12.800
can maximize your potential for getting customers from Kickstarter or Indiegogo itself.

03:12.810 --> 03:18.140
So for us almost 40 percent of our Kickstarter backers had nothing to do with us.

03:18.150 --> 03:19.460
They were not referred by us.

03:19.470 --> 03:20.790
They didn't go onto our Web site.

03:20.790 --> 03:22.540
They didn't see us through social media.

03:22.560 --> 03:28.410
They discovered us solely through Kickstarter and pledged based on the video and project description.

03:28.440 --> 03:34.110
So not only does crowdfunding carry all of those benefits that we talked about in this module but its

03:34.170 --> 03:40.440
also a great place to get traffic and get eyeballs and most importantly people opening their wallets

03:40.710 --> 03:42.450
to fund your project.

03:42.450 --> 03:48.000
So I hope that's been informative on the reasons why you would go down the crowdfunding route as opposed

03:48.000 --> 03:53.220
to other ones in the next Moto we're going to talk about the research that you need to do to prepare

03:53.220 --> 03:54.230
for your Kickstarter.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.350
So I'll see you there.
