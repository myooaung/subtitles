This or this is another big part of crowdfunding it's about testing your ideas using a minimal viable

00:06.330 --> 00:07.080
product.

00:07.080 --> 00:13.950
So if you've read any of The Lean Startup books this is something that is really core to all of those

00:13.950 --> 00:14.920
methodologies.

00:14.970 --> 00:20.730
The idea of distilling your idea into something fundamental that can be tested and presented to the

00:20.730 --> 00:21.670
end user.

00:21.780 --> 00:27.870
See if they'll buy it see if they'll want extra features and build that product using demand and not

00:27.870 --> 00:30.730
based on your own intuition.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.330
So how can you test drive it.

00:32.340 --> 00:35.970
So of course not all of these crazy ideas do well.

00:35.970 --> 00:41.040
In fact there's some pretty crazy ideas that you know I'm really glad that they they didn't dedicate

00:41.100 --> 00:45.110
all of their own money and in fact it tested on a crowdfunding platform.

00:45.330 --> 00:49.010
So for example a little eats the treat you both can eat.

00:49.030 --> 00:51.970
It's a cookie that you and your dog can share.

00:52.110 --> 00:55.370
So yes basically dog food for humans.

00:55.620 --> 00:59.830
And as expected not many people were interested.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.320
They only had 12 backers which usually means friends and family.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.840
And they only raised about two hundred fifty one dollars.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.260
So it's not always a bad thing when your crowdfunding fails.

01:10.260 --> 01:17.190
It can have it can be it can be a tremendous boon because it might have saved you a year of your life

01:17.190 --> 01:21.990
developing this thing that nobody wants or might have saved you from putting in your life investment

01:22.290 --> 01:26.430
into this idea that you thought was great but nobody else confirmed it.

01:26.430 --> 01:27.750
Now let's look at something else.

01:27.750 --> 01:28.880
Fish on wheels.

01:28.890 --> 01:33.200
Now here's another idea which when it came out I actually thought was pretty neat.

01:33.270 --> 01:34.680
It's called Fish on wheels.

01:34.860 --> 01:39.420
And essentially it's a fish tank where your pet goldfish can swim.

01:39.570 --> 01:46.230
And if they swim to the front of the fish tank the fish tank is also attached to wheels which will move

01:46.230 --> 01:47.550
the fish forwards.

01:47.640 --> 01:53.730
So the idea is that while you're gone your fish Sally might be able to navigate around the house and

01:53.730 --> 01:57.860
go wherever she likes by swimming in that direction.

01:57.870 --> 01:59.520
So I thought it was actually a neat idea.

01:59.520 --> 02:06.240
I'm not sure that anybody would ever need it but it was actually featured on Tech Crunch wired and a

02:06.240 --> 02:09.640
whole bunch of other big tech blogs.

02:09.690 --> 02:15.840
So you know it definitely had the traffic hitting it but unfortunately it just wasn't a good enough

02:15.840 --> 02:16.500
idea.

02:16.500 --> 02:21.390
It's one of those things that could have been really big like potato salad or grizzly coat but it just

02:21.390 --> 02:23.370
didn't capture people's imagination.

02:23.370 --> 02:27.060
So use this platform as an experiment.

02:27.060 --> 02:32.430
Use it as a testing base where you can see if your ideas get any traction.

02:32.550 --> 02:37.440
And essentially Crowdfunding is a condensed entrepreneurial activity.

02:37.560 --> 02:41.960
You end up using so many of the skills that you need to succeed in startups.

02:42.030 --> 02:45.390
For example I'm writing good copy.

02:45.390 --> 02:51.240
So what does that mean writing a good sales page in your description for your project or recording a

02:51.240 --> 02:52.250
great video.

02:52.290 --> 02:59.190
Being able to sell your product successfully and also of course actually raising funding which can be

02:59.190 --> 03:02.230
a huge part of any startups life journey.
