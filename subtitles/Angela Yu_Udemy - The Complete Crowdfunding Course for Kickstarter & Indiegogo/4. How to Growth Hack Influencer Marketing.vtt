00:02.340 --> 00:06.000
All it's the next thing we're going to talk about our influences.

00:06.090 --> 00:15.560
So people who have a large social reach whose opinions are listened to and matter to a lot of people.

00:15.600 --> 00:21.270
Now if you manage to get an influencer who believes in your project or believes in your cause to post

00:21.270 --> 00:26.340
or tweet or share your project then you going to be a to reach a much larger group of people than you

00:26.340 --> 00:28.770
would have been able to by yourself.

00:28.770 --> 00:33.120
So where do you find these influences of really really useful tool.

00:33.150 --> 00:40.200
It's called audience and with audience you're able to put in a search say for example if your project

00:40.500 --> 00:42.740
was targeted that seamstresses.

00:42.730 --> 00:43.240
Right.

00:43.350 --> 00:49.710
You are able to put in the word seamstress and it will look for all of the Twitter profiles whose profile

00:49.710 --> 00:57.090
descriptions contain the word seamstress and you could even narrow people down by their location so

00:57.180 --> 01:01.880
you can find all of the seamstresses who are based in London for example.

01:01.980 --> 01:08.480
And then you can use this tool to filter all of the people with the largest number of followers.

01:08.520 --> 01:14.960
So who are the influences or who are the people whose posts get retweeted and get liked.

01:14.970 --> 01:21.280
A lot of times and you'll be able to get the attention of your target market and by barring that influence.

01:21.300 --> 01:26.820
Now once you've caught those influences lined up the next thing you want to do is to set up what's called

01:26.880 --> 01:28.340
a thunderclap.

01:28.380 --> 01:35.250
So you go to thunderclap dot I.A. and it's a really really useful tool that allows you to amplify your

01:35.250 --> 01:38.440
message across all of social media accounts.

01:38.640 --> 01:43.680
So the way that it works is that you create a thunderclap.

01:43.830 --> 01:51.720
So this has a campaign title you put into a category and you have a particular message and then you

01:51.720 --> 01:57.470
get your influencers or as well as your friends and family and followers.

01:57.510 --> 02:02.830
Anybody who can be convinced to share your message to their social media accounts.

02:02.870 --> 02:07.300
It should be something that contains a link to your Kickstarter campaign.

02:07.620 --> 02:12.620
And a brief message about what it is and why they should go and check it out.

02:13.050 --> 02:18.140
And you can set a particular date where this thunderclap will go out.

02:18.150 --> 02:24.060
So usually the way that you would do it is to set the thunderclap to go out on the day of your Kickstarter

02:24.060 --> 02:25.010
launch.

02:25.110 --> 02:31.770
So that means that anybody who sign up to your thunderclaps so any influences or friends they will donate

02:31.860 --> 02:37.720
a single post in their Facebook or Twitter or both that carries your message.

02:37.770 --> 02:46.320
And what this means is that simultaneously maybe 100 or maybe 200 tweets or Facebook posts will go out

02:46.320 --> 02:51.920
there in the world and this will help you trend any of your hashtags as well as trend.

02:51.960 --> 02:57.960
Your actual link because to the social media accounts such as Facebook or Twitter it will appear as

02:57.960 --> 03:00.490
if something significant has happened right.

03:00.540 --> 03:07.800
Something is causing all of these people to simultaneously post a single hashtag or single link about

03:07.800 --> 03:13.620
a particular thing and that shows those Web sites that something is really viral something is happening

03:13.830 --> 03:17.610
and give all of those posts a viral sort of boost.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.030
And you'll see a much greater amount of reach than people separately posting about your project.

03:24.030 --> 03:29.130
So this is a really really great tool and something that we used to great effect.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.500
Now another tool that I want to talk to you about is crowd stream.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.790
So crowds has something called a backup directory.

03:35.820 --> 03:40.080
So this is a directory of all the super backas on Kickstarter.

03:40.110 --> 03:40.960
Indigo.

03:41.130 --> 03:45.440
So people who have pledged for more than five projects in total.

03:45.540 --> 03:49.090
Now what you can do on here is you can search by category.

03:49.140 --> 03:55.530
For example if you're putting out a Kickstarter campaign in the food category save the Fierro cheese

03:55.540 --> 03:56.540
strainer right.

03:56.670 --> 04:02.250
Then you can look at all the people who have pledged previously in the food category so maybe they are

04:02.250 --> 04:07.860
foodies themselves and you can even search by their locations and maybe you're only looking for backers

04:07.860 --> 04:12.570
within the U.K. or the U.S. or anywhere that you're planning on shipping to.

04:12.690 --> 04:17.250
And you can see all the backers who have pledged maybe all the people who have pledged for more than

04:17.250 --> 04:20.800
50 projects or people who've pledged more than 100 projects.

04:20.800 --> 04:26.070
The real super back is the people who are really really passionate or excited about that particular

04:26.070 --> 04:26.900
category.

04:27.150 --> 04:31.550
And you can reach them through their Facebook or through their Twitter through their Web sites.

04:31.740 --> 04:37.710
And this way gives you a targeted way of getting the attention of super backers now within crowds.

04:37.770 --> 04:43.880
There's also a really cool tool that helps you with getting press so you can search by particular category

04:43.880 --> 04:47.310
such as design or comics.

04:47.490 --> 04:54.270
And then you can narrow it down to specific subcategories and you can generate and download these Excel

04:54.270 --> 05:00.720
spreadsheets that give you the details of who the journalists are where who they work for what their

05:00.720 --> 05:06.560
contact details are and you can start approaching the people who might be right for your particular

05:06.560 --> 05:07.260
category.

05:07.400 --> 05:13.730
Now it would be a myth if I'm Taurima influences and I don't mention the biggest influence network which

05:13.730 --> 05:15.020
is product hunt.

05:15.020 --> 05:18.500
So if you've never been on product hunt go to it's day and check it out.

05:18.500 --> 05:22.060
It is a really really cool Web site and it's one of my favorite.

05:22.130 --> 05:28.390
It's a great way of discovering new things are happening and new tools and new apps.

05:28.490 --> 05:34.070
Everything that you see on product hunt that is trending will probably get written about in Tech Crunch

05:34.100 --> 05:35.620
two or three days later.

05:35.810 --> 05:36.620
It really is.

05:36.620 --> 05:39.480
The initial uses haven.

05:39.530 --> 05:47.090
So the way that product hunt works is that when you hunt a project or a product it will show up on the

05:47.090 --> 05:49.890
home page for 24 hours.

05:50.060 --> 05:55.550
And within those 24 hours the more people that upload a particular product because they think it's cool

05:55.730 --> 06:00.170
or they think it's awesome means that it will float up higher on the page.

06:00.170 --> 06:02.740
And this way you can discover what are the most relevant.

06:02.750 --> 06:05.270
What are the coolest projects every single day.

06:05.450 --> 06:09.200
And you can do this with your Kickstarter campaign as well.

06:09.200 --> 06:14.630
And the thing about product one is that in order to show up on that popular tab instead of going into

06:14.630 --> 06:21.200
the newest tab which is more hidden which is not showing up by default is to get a product influencer

06:21.500 --> 06:29.100
to hunt your product and you can find the influencers sorted essentially by their influence on a Web

06:29.100 --> 06:32.960
site called Product Hunt leaderboard.

06:32.960 --> 06:38.300
So it shows you the hunter's name it shows you what it is that they do.

06:38.480 --> 06:44.570
And it's that easy way of figuring out how to reach them usually by Twitter because Product Hunt accounts

06:44.570 --> 06:45.690
are linked to Twitter.

06:45.770 --> 06:52.400
Once you've found a super hunter who has hunted stuff in your category who might be interested in that

06:52.400 --> 06:57.980
particular field then it might be worth reaching out to them through DMD's on Twitter or through just

06:58.160 --> 07:04.970
tweeting at them and asking if they might be interested in looking at your campaign and hunting it on

07:04.970 --> 07:05.530
Product Hunt.

07:05.540 --> 07:11.020
Another part of influence the network that I want to mention is something called back a club.

07:11.120 --> 07:16.940
So if you launch any Kickstarter or Indiegogo you'll probably hear about these people.

07:17.090 --> 07:19.920
And this is more of a word of warning.

07:19.920 --> 07:25.150
So this is something that we tried out and we learnt a lot of lessons from.

07:25.310 --> 07:30.860
So I want to show you all of the things that they've kept hidden from their main information page and

07:30.860 --> 07:35.720
they don't actually tell people about it just so that you avoid the mistakes that we made with regards

07:35.720 --> 07:40.060
to Bakhit club and similar types of services.

07:40.190 --> 07:43.510
So the way that they work is that before you pay them any money.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.890
This is what they tell you.

07:45.080 --> 07:51.590
They say that they don't charge an upfront fee for their service and essentially their service is promoting

07:51.590 --> 07:56.310
your product to that list of super backers within their club.

07:56.630 --> 08:03.890
And in return you offer their super backers a better discount or a better rate than what you already

08:03.890 --> 08:09.170
have for your normal Kickstarter back as you discover it on the main page.

08:09.200 --> 08:16.610
So say will be something like 20 percent off each tier or something like a special package just for

08:16.910 --> 08:18.590
the Bacchic club people.

08:19.190 --> 08:25.100
And then they say that they'll only invoice you after they've proven their value to your campaign and

08:25.100 --> 08:32.810
that means that you've raised more than 379 in new pledges who are coming from back at clubs themselves.

08:32.810 --> 08:39.290
So people who belong into back a club people who they've sent you once they've raised more than the

08:39.290 --> 08:41.530
amount of money that you're paying back the club.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.840
That's when they say that they'll invoice you.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.060
Now here's the problem.

08:45.110 --> 08:51.560
After you've submitted your project to them and they've approved you this is an email that they sent

08:51.620 --> 08:52.410
us.

08:52.490 --> 08:59.270
So remember before it says they do not charge an upfront fee Well they do they charge a $79 upfront

08:59.270 --> 09:04.250
fee and then they say that we're going to send an email blast to our community about your project.

09:04.400 --> 09:13.520
And if you meet your funding goal and get at least $379 or more into pledges from the Baghdad club community

09:13.790 --> 09:20.150
then they're going to invoice you and get you to pay the the $300 difference so that in total you pay

09:20.150 --> 09:24.350
them three hundred seventy nine dollars for their service right.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.180
So here's what they say.

09:26.490 --> 09:31.960
Now this is the breakdown so it's $79 upfront fee and it's $300.

09:31.970 --> 09:40.160
Once your goal is reached not once your campaign ends and the total amount that you pay them is $379.

09:40.310 --> 09:48.290
But they're saying that because you will get $379 or more from that community then essentially you know

09:48.290 --> 09:49.710
you're not really losing out.

09:49.910 --> 09:55.760
But actually there's actually quite a few catches because a lot of the people from back of club actually

09:55.760 --> 10:03.250
end up canceling that pledge once you've paid back club that $379 and this is indeed what we found.

10:03.460 --> 10:09.460
So it's a complete fallacy where they say we help you reach your goal and we help you raise more than

10:09.460 --> 10:11.030
the amount that you pay us.

10:11.050 --> 10:12.570
Seemed like a win win situation.

10:12.580 --> 10:13.930
But it's actually not.

10:13.930 --> 10:19.510
The other thing that they say is that the services that they promise are tweet about your project feature

10:19.510 --> 10:22.670
in their e-mail newsletter and get listed on their Web site.

10:22.870 --> 10:26.640
So once you pay the money to them here's what you'll find out.

10:26.980 --> 10:32.890
In order to actually get that tweet you first have to promote them so you have to put the back a club

10:33.430 --> 10:40.240
banner onto your Kickstarter project so that other campaigns can discover about them and it sort of

10:40.240 --> 10:42.670
refers people to them.

10:42.670 --> 10:48.070
The other thing that you could do is do a project update where you say we got featured on back at club

10:48.380 --> 10:48.890
again.

10:48.910 --> 10:49.710
Promoting them.

10:49.720 --> 10:56.320
So you actually have to do work to promote them in order to get them to tweet about you after you've

10:56.320 --> 10:59.190
paid them an amount for their service.

10:59.200 --> 11:05.380
Now the other thing that they tell you is that in order to get featured on their e-mail newsletter after

11:05.380 --> 11:12.190
you've paid your you know almost 400 dollars in order to show up in the first five slots you have to

11:12.190 --> 11:13.610
pay them extra.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.640
And this is nowhere to be found.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.080
Before you commit into this service by the way.

11:18.340 --> 11:23.990
So by default they say that you'll show up basically at the end of their newsletter where nobody reads.

11:24.190 --> 11:29.020
But if you pay them extra then you will get a higher spot on that newsletter.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.300
So I hope you realize how incredibly dodgy it is.

11:31.300 --> 11:36.250
Up till now and you know the thing to realize is that all of this is through private e-mail communications

11:36.700 --> 11:43.350
after you've paid and it's no where to be found on any sort of information page on their main web site.

11:43.570 --> 11:50.140
So do your research consider what we've told you and make an informed decision about whether or not

11:50.140 --> 11:52.750
you want to go for these types of services.

11:52.750 --> 11:55.250
My advice is to completely ignore them.

11:55.270 --> 12:00.730
They don't help you all that much and their service is borderline a scam.

12:00.910 --> 12:05.850
And we learn our lesson we paid our $400 of learning fee.

12:05.920 --> 12:10.100
So I hope we can help you avoid the same mistakes that we did.
