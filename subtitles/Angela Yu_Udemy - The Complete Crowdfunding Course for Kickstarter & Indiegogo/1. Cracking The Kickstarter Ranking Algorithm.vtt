00:00.900 --> 00:04.500
All right so now let's move on to the ranking algorithm.

00:04.500 --> 00:10.020
Now I'm going to talk specifically about Kickstarter but these kinds of concepts apply to most of these

00:10.020 --> 00:11.760
crowdfunding platforms.

00:11.760 --> 00:16.710
After all they all need to figure out some way of putting something first or putting something below

00:16.710 --> 00:17.180
that.

00:17.340 --> 00:24.300
So the algorithm is really important because if you look at a chart or pledges you can see that about

00:24.300 --> 00:32.100
twenty one thousand pounds was pledged by backas who we brought to the Kickstarter platform but about

00:32.220 --> 00:38.850
18000 So almost half of all the pledges were pledged through the Kickstarter platform so they were from

00:38.850 --> 00:45.530
people who organically came across our campaign while they were browsing on the Kickstarter platform.

00:45.600 --> 00:52.050
So it's really important to try and optimize various things try and get as big a slice of that green

00:52.050 --> 00:53.350
pie as possible.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.650
And I'm going to show you some of the ways that you can do that.

00:55.710 --> 01:04.620
So essentially the goal is to appear here in the what's popular section and also in the popular sections

01:04.620 --> 01:09.060
for different categories so people tend to browse within certain categories that they're interested

01:09.060 --> 01:09.610
in.

01:09.720 --> 01:12.670
Usually the most popular ones are technology and design.

01:12.670 --> 01:19.380
So in the popular sections overall on Kickstarter as well as the ones for technology or for design this

01:19.380 --> 01:22.350
is where people are going to come across your campaign.

01:22.440 --> 01:28.650
And if your main image captures them and if your description is interesting enough then people will

01:28.650 --> 01:31.480
click on it and discover your campaign video.

01:31.710 --> 01:38.850
So showing up here is the first step towards getting backers from Kickstarter itself.

01:38.850 --> 01:43.590
And this is one of the reasons why you really want to go with the biggest platform which currently is

01:43.590 --> 01:49.920
Kickstarter because it means that you're going to get the most eyeballs on your project that is going

01:49.920 --> 01:54.630
to be organically from the platform and not from traffic that you're driving yourself.

01:54.630 --> 01:59.250
So a lot of this time especially in the next few modules we're going to be exploring how you can drive

01:59.250 --> 02:04.230
traffic toward your campaign but you also want to go with a platform that has a large enough platform

02:04.230 --> 02:08.270
effect that will bring you more traffic just by being on them.

02:08.370 --> 02:11.360
And for us that meant we had to list on Kickstarter.

02:11.370 --> 02:16.830
So one of the things that we did was we did a lot of data mining and we looked at the Kickstarter platform

02:16.830 --> 02:24.510
for about 60 days sequentially covering about 1400 projects that were active during that period and

02:24.570 --> 02:26.490
encompassing about 15 categories.

02:26.640 --> 02:33.870
And we collected and looked at all of that data did a bunch of math on it and we found out some of the

02:33.870 --> 02:38.360
factors that were contributing towards the ranking algorithm.

02:38.370 --> 02:40.680
So I'm going to share those with you now.
