00:01.190 --> 00:06.590
Now you might also want to get data from some other places for example click track.

00:06.620 --> 00:11.480
So he put in the Kickstarter project you are well you can paste it into click track and we'll show you

00:11.480 --> 00:13.330
some extra pieces of data.

00:13.520 --> 00:19.790
So for example you can see that this particular project exceeded their goal by 7 186 percent and that

00:19.790 --> 00:21.180
number is actually quite important.

00:21.170 --> 00:22.680
We're going to come back to it later on.

00:22.700 --> 00:29.120
But basically the higher the percentage of your goal you achieve the more likely it is that you're going

00:29.120 --> 00:34.970
to show up on the popular page of Kickstarter where you'll get discovered by more people increasing

00:34.970 --> 00:36.710
your pledge amount.

00:36.710 --> 00:44.000
Another thing that they show is the average pledge per Bakare which is which shows you which shows you

00:44.000 --> 00:48.220
where maybe the most popular tier should be for that particular product.

00:48.230 --> 00:54.890
So if you're making a similar product for example another raiser then you might want to have a bracket

00:54.950 --> 00:59.060
or a reward tier that targets that average pledge.

00:59.240 --> 01:05.990
And the final piece of information that you might want to scrape or at least look at is how long the

01:05.990 --> 01:10.390
campaign lasted for and what were the dates that they ran it for.

01:10.520 --> 01:16.460
So in this case the Rockville razor Model T ran for 46 days which is actually quite long it's a lot

01:16.460 --> 01:18.830
longer than the average project.

01:18.950 --> 01:21.880
And they ran it between March and May.

01:21.950 --> 01:25.610
So when you're looking at these Project think about seasonality as well.

01:25.700 --> 01:30.980
So for example during the Christmas period Kickstarter and indigo are both pretty quiet because people

01:30.980 --> 01:36.350
are either on holiday or you know they're no longer looking for a Christmas present.

01:36.350 --> 01:38.750
Overall there's just less traffic.

01:38.750 --> 01:46.760
So what people tend to do is if you think that you can get your product delivered by Christmas and you

01:46.760 --> 01:55.910
can put into your reward is that you expected delivery date is by Christmas a lot you'll get a lot more

01:55.910 --> 02:00.830
interest because people will buy it as a gift and that means that usually have to run your campaign

02:00.830 --> 02:02.110
around June July.

02:02.120 --> 02:07.880
Kind of period depending on how long you think it might take to produce and ship your product.

02:07.880 --> 02:12.100
Now the other thing that Qik track is really good at is providing charts.

02:12.110 --> 02:18.350
So for example for the Rockwell Razor you can see how much funding they gained on a day to day basis.

02:18.380 --> 02:22.580
And you can see at which point did they gain the most traction.

02:22.580 --> 02:28.380
So that means at which point on that graph on that top graph is the gradient the steepest.

02:28.490 --> 02:34.630
So in their case in on the first day or the first 24 hours they had the steepest gradient.

02:34.640 --> 02:39.010
And that's exactly what you want you want to kick off with a strong start.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.650
That gives kickstart a lot of good metrics.

02:41.660 --> 02:47.040
It might make you discovered by this team and become a staff pick which boosts you even more.

02:47.150 --> 02:53.460
Or it might also rank you organically higher on their popular pages or their pages ranked by the Kickstarter

02:53.460 --> 02:54.320
magic.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.680
So that's really really important.

02:56.750 --> 03:03.030
And if you look at enough of these graphs you'll notice that most of the successfully funded projects

03:03.080 --> 03:04.400
initially they're very steep.

03:04.400 --> 03:09.980
And then towards the end they're also very steep and that usually means that they got quite a lot of

03:09.980 --> 03:12.980
traffic from the Kickstarter platform itself.

03:13.040 --> 03:20.300
When you see projects that are more of a plateau then that's usually an indication that they drove a

03:20.300 --> 03:26.600
lot of the traffic themselves so try and look at the funded projects curve and try to figure out what

03:26.600 --> 03:32.750
did they do to get more backers from Kickstarter and other really useful graph that's on kik.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.910
Track is pledged per day.

03:35.060 --> 03:40.470
So this is not cumulative and it breaks down exactly which day did they get the most funding from.

03:40.490 --> 03:44.780
Now this doesn't really give you much more information than the graph on top but it's just a better

03:44.780 --> 03:49.430
way of visualizing it and you can see how much funding they average per day.

03:49.430 --> 03:56.440
So when you're running your campaign you compare how you're doing against your competitors as well.

03:56.440 --> 04:00.110
Now the final thing I want to show you on kik track is something that's quite useful.

04:00.110 --> 04:05.860
It is their expected projection graph and this is useful.

04:05.900 --> 04:14.450
While your project is ongoing or researching an ongoing campaign because what they do is that they will

04:14.450 --> 04:23.240
chart the cumulative pledge progress up to today and they have two lines that show you the lowest amount

04:23.240 --> 04:24.400
that is expected.

04:24.440 --> 04:30.020
The Project X is expected to raise by the end and what is the highest amount of the project could raise

04:30.360 --> 04:33.130
when by the end of the campaign.

04:33.170 --> 04:37.550
Now personally I found it to be quite conservative.

04:37.760 --> 04:44.940
So we actually overshot most of their top range expected projections.

04:45.530 --> 04:47.110
Throughout our campaign.

04:47.210 --> 04:53.330
But it's just a nice guy to see that window the amount of blood you're going to end up with at the end

04:53.420 --> 04:58.760
of the campaign and it's going to be renewed day by day depending on how much more Honeywill backers

04:58.760 --> 05:02.490
you're able to attract or how much more pledged you're able to get in.

05:02.750 --> 05:09.480
And it's a nice way of seeing how your efforts are going to be reflected at the end of the day.

05:10.780 --> 05:16.480
So once you've compiled all of this data together in your spreadsheet you should have rows upon rows

05:16.480 --> 05:23.230
of similar projects and you can start doing some data crunching and you want to color the project to

05:23.230 --> 05:27.690
differentiate the ones that were successful versus the ones that were not.

05:27.790 --> 05:33.760
And you can start digging into the data and looking at what were the reasons maybe they were successful

05:33.760 --> 05:34.310
or not.

05:34.450 --> 05:38.610
And what were the reasons behind the project that raised the largest amount.

05:38.620 --> 05:44.800
So another really useful thing to do is to scrape kickstarted data for the reward tiers and the number

05:44.800 --> 05:46.720
of backers for those reward.

05:46.750 --> 05:53.470
Tears from your competitor projects and what you can do with this data is you can create a histogram

05:53.470 --> 06:00.430
that looks at the reward here's that gained the largest amount of backers and see which tears are the

06:00.430 --> 06:03.280
most popular for your chosen niche.

06:03.280 --> 06:09.100
Now the thing you have to remember is that if you have 10 backers who each paid for the $25 reward here

06:09.490 --> 06:14.660
that's the same as one backer who paid for the $250 here.

06:14.740 --> 06:17.810
So when you're looking at this histogram keep that in mind.

06:17.890 --> 06:22.860
And I think one of the biggest piece of advice is that a lot of Kickstarter is.

06:23.110 --> 06:28.840
What it is that they're selling and that makes it risky for you when you're creating the product and

06:28.870 --> 06:32.120
also means that you have less take home at the end of the day.

06:32.210 --> 06:37.030
So I'm going to show you quickly how you can use the scraper tool to get this data and how you can chart

06:37.030 --> 06:38.290
it using Google sheets.
