Now the final thing I want to talk about in terms analytics is bitterly.

00:03.630 --> 00:11.570
So Kickstarter actually bought into at least enterprise model where they have their own short domain.

00:11.640 --> 00:15.360
So I think it's like Casey K. kick or something.

00:15.420 --> 00:22.200
And then Ill be forward slash a whole bunch of mumbojumbo that will link directly to your project and

00:22.190 --> 00:28.140
I'm going to show you how you can use this to check how many times those links were shared and you can

00:28.140 --> 00:30.970
also use the same method to check competitor links.

00:31.230 --> 00:36.890
So I'm currently on the Kickstarter home page and I'm just going to search for the coolest cool project

00:37.020 --> 00:41.550
since we're using this as a case study and we can do here is that if you scroll down on the project

00:41.730 --> 00:46.300
below the fold you will see this button pop up where it says share this project.

00:46.350 --> 00:51.210
If you click on it there's various ways of sharing and you're going to go to the embed option.

00:51.270 --> 00:57.300
Now once you hit the embed option you'll see that there's actually a project short link for your Kickstarter

00:57.300 --> 01:02.020
project that's created using bit least Enterprise edition as we mentioned before.

01:02.220 --> 01:10.140
Now if you copy that and paste it into your browser and then add a plus sign at the end of that Yarnall

01:10.410 --> 01:11.280
and hit enter.

01:11.280 --> 01:18.570
Ill actually take you in two bit Lees analytics panel for that particular you are RL So you can see

01:19.050 --> 01:25.500
for maybe your competitors project or your own campaigns how many clicks they got through this short

01:25.500 --> 01:28.020
link and who were the first.

01:28.140 --> 01:33.210
So you can see that most of that traffic actually came from Facebook and you can see that the most popular

01:33.210 --> 01:38.400
location was actually the U.S. so you can use this little plus symbol to track both your own short links

01:38.730 --> 01:42.720
as well as competitors and see where they're getting their traffic from.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.730
And it might help you guide your traffic strategy.
