00:00.510 --> 00:02.880
Now the next thing I want to talk about is social media.

00:02.880 --> 00:09.570
So using social media to drive traffic towards your campaign and social media is one of those things

00:09.570 --> 00:17.070
where you could pretty much spend your entire lifetime dedicated to polishing up your Twitter or optimizing

00:17.070 --> 00:18.120
your instagram.

00:18.270 --> 00:23.350
But I want to show you a more targeted way of going about your social media strategy.

00:23.910 --> 00:29.800
So the first and the most important thing that you have to figure out for social media is audience i.e.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.140
where are your customers at.

00:32.190 --> 00:35.090
And here's a really simple strategy of doing this.

00:35.220 --> 00:38.870
Let's take an active crowdfunding campaign as an example.

00:38.910 --> 00:44.850
For example the Fierro cheesemaker which is basically a cheese strainer allows you to pour yogurt into

00:44.850 --> 00:51.150
the strainer and overnight you create cheese but let's not tell the backers that because they've already

00:51.150 --> 00:52.930
raised $100000.

00:53.100 --> 00:57.060
But let's say that we were tasked with with marketing this particular product.

00:57.060 --> 01:00.740
How would you go about using social media to market this.

01:00.930 --> 01:06.030
Well you have to start thinking to yourself Who do I know who would buy this.

01:06.060 --> 01:08.910
Who do I know who would be into this kind of product.

01:09.030 --> 01:16.140
And you think oh I know Jane Jane loves these kinds of food tech things she always has these funky tools

01:16.140 --> 01:20.880
in a kitchen all these like random little toys that seem to improve her cooking.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.890
She's always making something new.

01:22.890 --> 01:24.810
I know she is the perfect customer.

01:24.810 --> 01:27.330
She would totally buy this and she would love it.

01:27.660 --> 01:30.990
So where does Jane hang out on the interweb.

01:31.140 --> 01:35.100
You have to figure out what is the social media channel that she use the most.

01:35.250 --> 01:39.990
And you realize that you know she posts occasionally to Instagram but you know where I see the most

01:39.990 --> 01:42.780
activity from her it's Pinterest.

01:42.780 --> 01:49.410
So Pinterest of those you guys who don't know is kind of this pinboard where you can put down your dreams

01:49.410 --> 01:52.730
your wishes your ideas your future plans.

01:52.800 --> 01:59.490
People use it to plan places that they weren't traveled to or weddings that they're going to have even

01:59.490 --> 02:01.680
without a husband.

02:01.710 --> 02:09.750
And all of these plans are collected together in image format so that you can browse through it at your

02:09.750 --> 02:10.780
leisure.

02:11.070 --> 02:19.380
Now a lot of people use Pinterest to post ideas for food or recipes and this is the perfect place to

02:19.380 --> 02:20.250
put a..

02:20.250 --> 02:26.250
Fierro recipes or maybe something that was made using the cheese that came out of the kaffiyeh cheese

02:26.280 --> 02:33.870
Drona or maybe just a short video or short demo of how it works how easy and effortless and clean it

02:33.870 --> 02:38.680
is to use the cafeteria to create cheese from milk or yogurt.

02:38.760 --> 02:39.140
Right.

02:39.360 --> 02:45.750
And you are able to reach all of the Janes out there who are essentially your target market for your

02:45.750 --> 02:47.010
product.

02:47.070 --> 02:49.530
So how do you reach people on Pinterest.

02:49.530 --> 02:54.430
The best way and the highest converting way is to go through group boards.

02:54.600 --> 03:01.940
So group boards are collections of pinners who come together all posting content of the same board and

03:01.940 --> 03:06.390
the value of it is that it usually has a lot of followers.

03:06.390 --> 03:11.880
So for example I came across this cheeseboard which would be really perfect for our marketing for the

03:11.880 --> 03:12.620
cafeteria.

03:12.720 --> 03:20.040
You can see that it has 87000 followers which means that your pens go out to thousands of cheese lovers

03:20.280 --> 03:24.190
all of these Janes who are potentially your buyers.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.940
Now how do you find these group boards.

03:26.940 --> 03:32.240
It can be a little bit tricky because there's no easy way of figuring it out on the Pinterest site itself.

03:32.370 --> 03:33.930
So here's a little secret.

03:33.930 --> 03:37.620
You can search in Google for a site called Pin groupy.

03:37.920 --> 03:45.000
And what you can do on here is you can search by category or you can put in keywords to search in the

03:45.000 --> 03:46.710
title of that group.

03:46.710 --> 03:52.170
So for example say if we wanted find a group that posts recipes or if we found we wanted to find groups

03:52.170 --> 03:59.280
that post about cheese then we can simply put that into the title search and then it'll give us all

03:59.280 --> 04:04.800
the group boards that have that in the title or we can search in the description and the most powerful

04:04.800 --> 04:11.010
thing about this Web site is that you can sort all of these group boards by who are the largest boards

04:11.310 --> 04:14.110
and who are the most worthwhile to start targeting.

04:14.280 --> 04:19.980
So once you go into those group boards and you start posting recipes from the cafeteria or how easy

04:19.980 --> 04:27.210
it is to create cheese using like fear then you start reaching all of the people who are your potential

04:27.210 --> 04:32.430
buyers and this is how you use social media to market selectively.

04:32.430 --> 04:35.540
Now what if we weren't marketing for a cheese maker.

04:35.550 --> 04:44.700
What if we were marketing the heritage food this authentic leather made in US hiking boots that is really

04:44.700 --> 04:49.320
really hipster and it looks nice it's super comfortable really great hiking.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.480
Now where would we put that in terms of social media.

04:52.920 --> 04:58.620
So let's think about you know back to this question Who do we know who would buy this or who would love

04:58.620 --> 05:03.580
this I know Dave Dave is the ultimate hipster.

05:03.630 --> 05:08.140
He will buy anything that looks like it's made of leather.

05:08.200 --> 05:14.090
He will promote all of the local shops and he will hate you if you call him a hipster.

05:14.160 --> 05:20.070
He's always hiking all over the place posting pictures of him next to mountains him next to streams

05:20.400 --> 05:24.470
so him and all the other Daves are who we want to target.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.370
So where does Dave hang out.

05:26.370 --> 05:29.750
Dave is a big Instagram user.

05:29.760 --> 05:36.160
He uses Instagram to post all of his pictures from his hikes all using some sort of funky filter where

05:36.240 --> 05:45.630
you see him hiking a mountain or hiking a valley and he tags all these images with hashtags like mountains

05:45.630 --> 05:49.970
or hashtag authentic or hashtag hiker.

05:50.010 --> 05:52.820
We all have one of those kinds of friends right.

05:52.860 --> 06:00.750
So your strategy in order to market to all of the days is to go into Instagram and look at the hashtags

06:00.960 --> 06:02.500
that your Dave uses.

06:02.550 --> 06:02.950
Right.

06:03.090 --> 06:04.190
What do they actually use.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.680
Maybe they use some of these hashtags Maybe they use something different.

06:07.740 --> 06:14.200
Now once you discovered those hashtags you can trace who else posts using these hashtags.

06:14.460 --> 06:17.520
And you can go and look into those user accounts.

06:17.610 --> 06:25.050
Now this is the formula for getting Instagram attention to your account and also getting followers to

06:25.050 --> 06:26.580
your Instagram account.

06:26.580 --> 06:30.730
So the recipe is to have a look inside those hashtags.

06:30.810 --> 06:37.770
Find the first user who posted an image using the hashtag and follow their account then go into their

06:37.770 --> 06:43.920
recent pictures and like the first and the second most recent image.

06:43.920 --> 06:51.030
So if you have a good curated Instagram account with images that fit all of those hashtags the ones

06:51.030 --> 06:58.450
that seem like you belong in that community you know you're posting images of handicrafts or of workshops.

06:58.530 --> 07:07.050
Basically you know you fit that authentic that U.S. made that leather feel kind of aesthetic.

07:07.140 --> 07:13.020
Then all of these other Daves will see that somebody you know who belongs in their community in their

07:13.020 --> 07:18.670
circle has seen their account and has appreciated their content.

07:18.690 --> 07:23.880
So you're more likely to get a follow back based on all of these factors.

07:24.120 --> 07:31.530
So it can be extremely tedious doing this manually going through Instagram accounts following liking

07:32.130 --> 07:35.930
and it can take days and days before you get any real results.

07:35.940 --> 07:44.850
So here's a really useful tool that is quite well-known within the sort of growth hacking circles and

07:44.880 --> 07:46.450
it's called the follow like him.

07:46.470 --> 07:53.940
It's basically a bot that goes around and can carry out all of those tests automatically.

07:53.940 --> 08:00.480
So it can go into certain hashtags and follow and like like all of those people who post using those

08:00.480 --> 08:07.680
hashtags and it can start generating you genuine follow bags from real users.

08:07.680 --> 08:12.270
Now another thing that you can do with a follower like is that you can go into competitor accounts.

08:12.270 --> 08:18.810
So let's say that you are Nike right you can go into the added US social media accounts and see who

08:18.810 --> 08:21.690
are the people who are actually following the added US account.

08:21.810 --> 08:27.720
And you can start performing this sort of follow like like or something similar to grab the attention

08:27.870 --> 08:31.260
of your competitors followers.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.880
Now a word of warning.

08:33.060 --> 08:42.000
Once you start using follow like on a large scale your own home feed might not be as curated or as fun

08:42.060 --> 08:43.540
as it used to be.

08:43.560 --> 08:46.530
It really depends on what your end goal is.

08:46.530 --> 08:52.530
If you want genuine engagement then it's still better to do everything manually because then you can

08:52.530 --> 08:57.300
filter out all of the business accounts and all of the relevant accounts whereas the board can't really

08:57.300 --> 08:59.250
differentiate very easily.

08:59.280 --> 09:06.150
So try it out consider it carefully and use it as a tool to help you reach more people.
