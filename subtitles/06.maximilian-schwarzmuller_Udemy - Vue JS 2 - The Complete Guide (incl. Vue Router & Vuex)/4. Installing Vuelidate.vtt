WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:04.150
So I'm back in the project

00:04.150 --> 00:12.070
I also used in the axios and authentication module, it's this page here where we can sign up, sign in

00:12.370 --> 00:14.890
and then also fetch some data from the server.

00:14.980 --> 00:17.520
Now in this video I want to focus on this

00:17.530 --> 00:24.010
sign up form because it deliberately contains a lot of different inputs and I want to show you how

00:24.010 --> 00:31.000
we can validate this form. This includes things like checking if for example we have a valid email

00:31.000 --> 00:33.550
address, if the passwords match

00:33.670 --> 00:38.040
and also things like if the e-mail address is already taken,

00:38.140 --> 00:39.680
so let's dive into that.

00:39.700 --> 00:47.080
As I mentioned, we're going to use a third party package for this because the vue framework itself doesn't

00:47.080 --> 00:51.510
have input validation built into it like Angular has for example

00:51.790 --> 00:57.640
but there are great alternatives out there which you can pick and the alternative I want to present

00:58.000 --> 01:06.070
is vuelidate. Vuelidate is a third party package developed by monterail and you can check out its github

01:06.070 --> 01:11.350
page or this documentation page on monterail.github.io/vuelidate where you can

01:11.350 --> 01:12.490
learn more about it

01:12.580 --> 01:18.280
and I strongly recommend diving into this page if you want to unlock all the functionalities of the

01:18.280 --> 01:21.520
package and really want to use all its features,

01:21.520 --> 01:25.950
I'm going to walk you through the majority of them in this module though.

01:26.140 --> 01:32.320
So this is the package I want to use and we already see that we can install it via npm, so that is what

01:32.320 --> 01:37.250
I'll do in this lecture before then in the next lectures, we start using it.

01:37.540 --> 01:43.630
So let's head back to our project and let's quit the npm run dev process and let's now simply run

01:43.720 --> 01:46.640
npm install --save

01:46.780 --> 01:48.280
and then it's vuelidate,

01:48.310 --> 01:54.460
one word. Once you type this, you can hit enter to install it in this project and once it is finished,

01:54.610 --> 01:57.610
we're ready to go to take advantage of the features

01:57.610 --> 02:02.130
this package exposes. Let's dive into them in the next lecture.
