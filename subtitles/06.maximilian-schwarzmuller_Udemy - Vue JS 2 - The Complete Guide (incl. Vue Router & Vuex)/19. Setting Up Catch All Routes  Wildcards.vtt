00:01.660 --> 00:07.600
So we want to be able to handle any route the user may enter which doesn't exist in our application.

00:07.900 --> 00:12.670
We can easily do this by adding a new route as the last route here which should catch everything which

00:12.670 --> 00:15.830
is not handled by any of our other routes

00:15.910 --> 00:20.980
and here, I'll set up the path to be star, like this.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.090
What this will do is that

00:22.090 --> 00:31.120
now if I redirect in such a case to just slash, I can enter whatever I want here and I'm redirected to

00:31.120 --> 00:34.500
the home page because star catches it all.

00:34.630 --> 00:38.670
If I enter something, slash something that also works,

00:38.710 --> 00:46.470
so star is now the wildcard character which catches all other routes which are not handled first here,

00:46.510 --> 00:53.040
so user still works and so on but everything which is not handled in my other routes is now catched

00:53.050 --> 00:57.490
by the star route which in this case leads to a redirect to my home page.

00:57.520 --> 01:03.730
So this is how you can set up a generic catch all route with this star wildcard character.
