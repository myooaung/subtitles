00:01.670 --> 00:06.890
So after learning about forms in the last module, let's go back to something which we actually have

00:06.890 --> 00:12.260
used to a lot throughout the course but haven't really put focus on, directives.

00:12.280 --> 00:19.250
Directives are these tiny commands starting with a v and then a dash you put on dom elements, like v-bind

00:19.250 --> 00:21.960
or v-on, that are some buit-in directives.

00:22.130 --> 00:27.620
In this module, we'll have a look at some of the built-in directives, though we already know them all pretty

00:27.620 --> 00:33.050
much but then we mostly will have a look at how we could build our own directive if you need such a

00:33.050 --> 00:35.900
low level access to certain dom elements,

00:35.900 --> 00:40.840
normally you would use a component if you want to build parts of the application and make it reactive,

00:40.880 --> 00:46.700
implement your own code but from time to time, you only want to place a tiny command on some html element

00:46.880 --> 00:48.390
to control its behavior.

00:48.410 --> 00:50.900
And that is what we're going to have a look at in this module too.
