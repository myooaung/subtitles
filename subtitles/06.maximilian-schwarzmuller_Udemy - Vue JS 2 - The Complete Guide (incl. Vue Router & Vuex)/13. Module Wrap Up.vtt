WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:09.190
In this module we had a detailed look at conditionals, v-if, v-show and lists with v-for.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.080
You learned how all of that works,

00:11.110 --> 00:12.860
what to watch out for,

00:12.880 --> 00:19.370
what additional features you may use and how that really is used in a real application.

00:19.390 --> 00:27.870
With that, we made another important step because now the base template syntax of vuejs is set.

00:27.910 --> 00:35.350
So now in the next module, I want to take a more theoretical approach and have a deeper look at the vue

00:35.350 --> 00:41.000
instance, at this thing we're working with all the time, how that works behind the scenes,

00:41.050 --> 00:48.730
what's so special about it, how it is created by vuejs and how we may take advantage of it even

00:48.730 --> 00:49.490
more.
