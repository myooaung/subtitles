00:02.010 --> 00:05.820
Thus far, I showed all these animations using v-if here.

00:05.820 --> 00:12.090
Now it's important to understand you can also use v-show here and that will work just the same as

00:12.090 --> 00:13.930
you will see if I reload,

00:13.980 --> 00:18.770
this also works, though keep in mind of course, v-show still works as you know it will work.

00:18.780 --> 00:24.120
It doesn't remove or attach elements, it only triggers the display property.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.990
So you can also use animations with v-show,

00:27.000 --> 00:29.880
the alternative is v-if, whatever you prefer,

00:29.880 --> 00:30.990
both is animatable.
