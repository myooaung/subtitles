In the last lecture I set up this wonderful quote,

00:04.190 --> 00:12.050
now I want to pass some content with props. So I could setup a quote prop here and simply send a string

00:12.290 --> 00:17.600
with single quotation marks inside there since I have the dynamic binding or without single quotation

00:17.600 --> 00:23.070
marks and then without the column then too, a wonderful quote like this.

00:23.960 --> 00:29.590
I'm sending this with the quote attribute I'm setting on my component

00:29.720 --> 00:35.680
and then here, I can add quotes to the object which I therefore first of all need to add,

00:35.840 --> 00:42.290
so props and here I would have my quote property and then I could of course here use string interpolation

00:42.290 --> 00:44.840
to output that quote, like that.

00:44.840 --> 00:50.510
Now if I save this, we still see a wonderful quote like before and that's perfectly fine, I can now

00:50.540 --> 00:57.120
set it from outside. But maybe I not only want to set it like this,

00:57.140 --> 01:00.980
maybe I wanted to pass some html code with that

01:00.980 --> 01:02.760
and this does not really work,

01:02.810 --> 01:07.730
I can't pass it like this or yeah I can pass html code,

01:07.730 --> 01:13.850
we also learned how to output html code here but that is really not how I want to use that because

01:13.850 --> 01:20.970
if I got a more complex html code, let's say my quote should have a heading, the quote and thereafter

01:21.060 --> 01:24.090
a paragraph which says a wonderful quote.

01:24.230 --> 01:27.220
well then I somehow would need to create a string out of that

01:27.250 --> 01:29.060
and no, I don't want to do that,

01:29.060 --> 01:30.860
that's the short version of that story.

01:30.920 --> 01:38.430
So here I will remove this property binding and will remove the props property here too and will not output

01:38.440 --> 01:39.860
it like this,

01:39.860 --> 01:49.310
instead it would be nice if I could simply pass this block of html code by simply enclosing it in my

01:49.310 --> 01:51.380
quote here, like this

01:52.070 --> 01:57.560
and then I could simply output it here, that would be nice and I would have it in my template.

01:57.560 --> 02:00.730
However if I do it like this, we see that's not working,

02:00.740 --> 02:04.480
it's an empty box so that is not how that behaves.

02:04.490 --> 02:06.340
How could we change this?

02:06.830 --> 02:10.640
Well we can change this with a concept called slots,

02:10.880 --> 02:16.640
vuejs offers us slots we can reserve for content being passed from outside.
