Back I am in the JSFiddle editor, in a very basic vuejs application again. Get this button and this counter

00:08.800 --> 00:11.510
data property which I'm outputting down there.

00:11.740 --> 00:18.640
I want to hook up this button that when I click on it, it increases this counter. Well we already saw how

00:18.640 --> 00:23.410
to hook this button up but now we understand a bit better what happened back then.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.280
I'm using another directive, v-on

00:26.470 --> 00:34.210
and if v-bind allows us to bind something in our template, to pass data to it, then v-on is kind

00:34.210 --> 00:40.990
of the opposite, we bind to something or better said we listen to something to receive something from

00:40.990 --> 00:41.830
our template.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.610
And what do I want to receive here?

00:43.690 --> 00:45.250
Well, an event.

00:45.250 --> 00:51.130
So v-on also takes an argument and the argument is the name of the event we want to consume or

00:51.130 --> 00:52.550
we want to listen to.

00:52.810 --> 00:56.700
So let's say the event here is click and you're not limited to click,

00:56.710 --> 01:00.370
you can use any dom event existing for the button,

01:00.370 --> 01:07.580
this would include mouse enter, mouse leave, whatever default dom events are on a button and here, you

01:07.580 --> 01:13.870
then pass as an argument or on the other side of the equal sign between the quotation marks, the function or the

01:13.870 --> 01:17.980
code you want to execute when clicking on this button.

01:17.980 --> 01:24.490
Now let's hook it up to a function, I'll name it increase and I'll add it down here where I'll add my

01:24.510 --> 01:36.190
methods block and then the increase function where I obviously want to access the counter and increase

01:36.190 --> 01:40.730
the value by 1. If I now hit control and click this button,

01:40.810 --> 01:42.320
you see it increase there,

01:42.340 --> 01:44.740
so that was pretty easy I guess.

01:44.740 --> 01:48.070
Now let's dive deeper into events and learn more about them.
