WEBVTT

00:02.380 --> 00:06.320
In order to work with axios, we need an application

00:06.370 --> 00:12.970
and I actually created a very simple new application which you can find attached to this project, simply

00:12.970 --> 00:14.930
download and extract it, run

00:14.940 --> 00:19.750
npm install in the extracted folder and then run npm run dev,

00:19.750 --> 00:26.330
I used the vue cli and the webpack-simple template to create this application.

00:26.340 --> 00:30.030
Now once you open the application, it should look like this,

00:30.030 --> 00:34.360
it's a webpage where you have a sign up, a sign in and a dashboard page,

00:34.380 --> 00:36.090
all of these links work by default,

00:36.090 --> 00:38.150
you can also go back to the welcome page.

00:38.430 --> 00:45.190
Now one important note here, this page of course looks like you can actually sign up and sign in,

00:45.240 --> 00:49.170
right now though, you can't, that's something important.

00:49.170 --> 00:54.640
We will however in a later module also add authentication logic to this,

00:54.660 --> 00:57.170
that's another part of the course update.

00:57.230 --> 01:03.100
Additionally we'll also make sure that we validate the user input in this form here,

01:03.330 --> 01:07.550
for now however, I will focus on the axios,

01:07.560 --> 01:11.100
so on the send data via http part,

01:11.100 --> 01:14.290
so that is what we'll cover in this module.

01:14.370 --> 01:19.190
That's the application we got, it's finished from a ui perspective

01:19.200 --> 01:22.230
but of course, it doesn't have a lot of logic in there.

01:22.230 --> 01:29.100
Now what I want to do in this module is I want to add some code here in my signup.vue file where

01:29.100 --> 01:38.330
we fetch a lot of user data and add code to actually send that data to the backend, to some server essentially

01:38.320 --> 01:42.560
and I want to do this with axios. Now as a backend,

01:42.660 --> 01:49.080
I want to use firebase, you can of course use any backend, any restful API but firebase is an easy

01:49.080 --> 01:51.480
to use rest API essentially.

01:51.510 --> 01:57.180
So what you can do is you can simply go to the console there and either use an existing project or add

01:57.210 --> 01:58.260
a new one

01:58.850 --> 02:05.780
and once you did create this new project, make sure to go to database on your firebase backend, there

02:05.780 --> 02:10.160
pick the real time database, they nowadays have an option here but let's stick to that,

02:10.160 --> 02:15.610
click on get started and there's one important configuration you need to set. Under rules,

02:15.650 --> 02:19.660
make sure to set both read and write access to true,

02:19.850 --> 02:22.630
that basically grants everyone read and write axios,

02:22.640 --> 02:27.070
you probably don't want this for your production application but we want this now,

02:27.200 --> 02:33.730
we will in one of the next modules though change this to only grant access to authenticated users.

02:33.740 --> 02:39.860
So with that, let's go back to our application and let's start working on our vue application

02:39.860 --> 02:43.190
over the next lectures, let's use axios there.
