WEBVTT

00:02.190 --> 00:06.000
Now let me come back to these builds and what we got there.

00:06.060 --> 00:11.020
The vue cli has another cool feature which is named instant prototyping,

00:11.370 --> 00:16.210
I mentioned that these commands here which you execute in the package.json file with the

00:16.240 --> 00:22.800
scripts, that these commands aren't available globally because the vue cli service is a local package

00:22.800 --> 00:24.860
installed into that project.

00:25.290 --> 00:28.540
Well you can install a global vue cli service,

00:28.740 --> 00:36.450
you install it with npm install -g to install it globally and then it's @vue/cli

00:36.500 --> 00:43.670
-service-global and on Mac and Linux, you might need to add sudo at the beginning again.

00:43.750 --> 00:50.000
This will now install that, it will install that cli service which you also used locally in the project

00:50.020 --> 00:51.360
here globally,

00:51.360 --> 00:58.150
so then you will be able to run vue build on a global level which is nice but there is one feature

00:58.160 --> 01:02.090
which is a lot nicer actually which I want to show you.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.200
So let's wait for it to finish,

01:04.200 --> 01:08.760
so for me it did finish and I could run vue build here too, I would have to target a file though,

01:08.850 --> 01:10.780
I'll come back to that in a second

01:10.920 --> 01:14.600
but another cool feature I want to show you first is called instant prototyping.

01:14.700 --> 01:21.200
Let's say you have such a project or you have a totally empty folder with one vue component only,

01:22.180 --> 01:23.410
hello.vue,

01:23.430 --> 01:25.950
this is now not embedded into my project,

01:25.960 --> 01:32.470
it's not even in the source folder and in there, I'll just add my template where I add a h1 tag where

01:32.470 --> 01:33.530
I say hello

01:33.700 --> 01:35.620
and this is a very simple vue component

01:35.620 --> 01:39.420
and of course you could use script there, add styles, things like that.

01:39.700 --> 01:44.180
If you just want to serve as such a component and have a look at it,

01:44.350 --> 01:50.320
you can now run vue serve and for that you need that global cli service and then the name of the

01:50.410 --> 01:52.340
vue component you want to serve.

01:52.750 --> 01:56.940
And this now starts a development server and loads this vue component into it,

01:57.010 --> 01:59.640
so you can inspect a single vue component,

01:59.710 --> 02:05.740
of course if that component depends on things like routing and so on, it'll get hard because that information

02:05.800 --> 02:07.510
will then probably be missing

02:07.600 --> 02:10.460
but if you just want to look at a standalone component,

02:10.600 --> 02:16.540
now I can reload my dev server and I just see hello and this is this one component getting loaded here. And

02:16.540 --> 02:22.180
this is pretty awesome in my opinion because this gives you a way of quickly creating new components

02:22.240 --> 02:25.030
and looking into them and working on single components

02:25.090 --> 02:31.150
IF you just need that functionality, if you don't want to work on the entire app all the time. And kind

02:31.150 --> 02:36.850
of related to this is one advanced feature or one cool feature related to building which I also want

02:36.850 --> 02:37.450
to show you.
