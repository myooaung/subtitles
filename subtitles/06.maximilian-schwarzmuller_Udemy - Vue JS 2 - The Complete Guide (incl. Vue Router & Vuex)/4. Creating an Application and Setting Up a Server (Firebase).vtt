WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:07.530
So we installed vue resource, we set it up to be usable though we don't use it yet.

00:07.560 --> 00:13.560
Now in order to be able to use it, we also need some server where we can send our data to right because

00:13.560 --> 00:18.660
we want to reach out to the web, so we probably need some server on the web where we can store our data

00:18.660 --> 00:20.830
or we can fetch data.

00:20.880 --> 00:27.270
Now the bad thing is setting up such a server on our own is a little bit too much work for this course,

00:27.270 --> 00:33.190
the great thing is there are services we can easily leverage and I'll use firebase for this.

00:33.330 --> 00:40.050
So you may simply google for firebase again and then it's firebase.google.com and this is a service by Google

00:40.050 --> 00:46.480
which you may test freely, check out their official pages to learn more, how long it is free and what

00:46.480 --> 00:48.360
it will cost you something in the end

00:48.360 --> 00:56.370
but the things we're going to do here are free and then you basically need to well sign up or get to

00:56.370 --> 01:02.700
your console if you already are signed up and I will quickly do this and then meet you in this firebase console

01:02.760 --> 01:05.370
where you are able to create new projects.

01:05.370 --> 01:10.370
So I'm now in the firebase console and here, you can create new firebase projects,

01:10.370 --> 01:12.810
now what is firebase to begin with?

01:12.900 --> 01:20.640
Firebase is something or a service you can use as the backend for your native app, for your web app,

01:20.640 --> 01:22.330
it has database functionalities,

01:22.350 --> 01:25.120
it has authentication functionalities and much more.

01:25.140 --> 01:31.120
Definitely check out the official docs to learn how it works, what it has, what it costs and so on,

01:31.140 --> 01:32.730
this is no firebase tutorial,

01:32.760 --> 01:37.810
I'm only using it as it is a simple backend for our http tests here.

01:38.100 --> 01:45.060
So to create such a backend, I'll click on Create project and then I'll give it any name of well my or your

01:45.060 --> 01:46.050
choice,

01:46.050 --> 01:48.620
pick your country and create the project.

01:48.660 --> 01:55.440
This will once it is created take you to your project dashboard and on this dashboard, you got a lot

01:55.440 --> 02:00.250
of different things like you can set up storage for files and other things.

02:00.300 --> 02:07.620
Now for showing how http works, I will only use the database because I only want to store data in

02:07.620 --> 02:08.790
the database here.

02:08.930 --> 02:14.100
Now the first important thing you got to do for the testing here, only for the testing is that on the

02:14.100 --> 02:19.320
rules in the database section, you should set read and write both to true so that everyone is able

02:19.320 --> 02:23.850
to read and write so that we don't have to authenticate ourselves, publish this and then you should

02:23.850 --> 02:25.830
be able to access this without problems.

02:25.830 --> 02:29.420
Now keep in mind, these are not the settings you want to have in a production app

02:29.430 --> 02:34.380
and again, you definitely need to dive into the documentation if you want to use firebase for a production

02:34.380 --> 02:34.690
app,

02:34.700 --> 02:36.210
this is only for testing.

02:36.570 --> 02:43.660
Now this will allow us to write to this database which already looks like a bit like Mongo database

02:43.680 --> 02:49.480
so like Mongo DB for example, where we have key value pairs, though right now it is empty.

02:49.620 --> 02:52.690
This here is going to be the URL we need to access it though

02:52.890 --> 02:58.290
and in order to be able to access it, I will go back to my app.vue file and the first thing I want

02:58.290 --> 03:01.360
to do is I want to be able to store some data there,

03:01.380 --> 03:07.770
so we're going to set this up now and in the next video, then we'll actually send this request. So to store

03:07.770 --> 03:13.410
it, I'll quickly set up a div with a class, form group, so this bootstrap class, there I will have a label

03:13.880 --> 03:21.270
where i say user name and then thereafter my input with class form control which is of type

03:21.270 --> 03:26.080
text where I want to enter my user name and then I'm simply going to copy these

03:26.080 --> 03:35.790
ones here to also set up something for let's say, your email address, type text as well and then a

03:35.790 --> 03:44.760
button type, button button primary where I say submit and then I'll go down to my vue object here or

03:44.790 --> 03:47.090
to my vue instance, set up my data

03:47.090 --> 03:50.740
I want to use and in is data here,

03:50.840 --> 03:58.020
I want to have the same two fields, I want to have a username and email though I will group it together

03:58.020 --> 03:59.640
in a user object,

03:59.640 --> 04:06.270
so here I will have user name, empty at the beginning and email, empty at the beginning and then we learned

04:06.270 --> 04:13.080
how to bind this with v-model where I will now bind the user.username and on my email, I will

04:13.080 --> 04:16.140
bind the user.email of course.

04:16.140 --> 04:24.480
Now with that, I'm able to submit some data and to well send it, well almost though, I of course also need

04:24.480 --> 04:30.510
to set up my methods where I will say submit and here for now, I'll simply log it to the console,

04:30.510 --> 04:36.840
log my user here and then add a click listener on the button here and execute submit.

04:36.840 --> 04:42.360
Now let's see this in the running application just to see if everything works before then in the next

04:42.360 --> 04:43.080
module,

04:43.110 --> 04:52.590
I will actually use this to send some data. And yeah, this does not work because there should be this user

04:52.740 --> 04:59.610
and then if I head over to the application and I enter some data here, test@test.com and open

04:59.610 --> 05:06.450
up the console, we see now that the user here gets printed with email and user name fields. The getter and setter

05:06.450 --> 05:10.410
here is just added by vuejs to be able to listen to changes to that

05:10.440 --> 05:13.960
but here we see the fields we set up with the values we entered.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.110
So this looks good, with that

05:16.110 --> 05:17.520
we set up our application

05:17.520 --> 05:18.600
we set up firebase,

05:18.600 --> 05:22.110
let's now use all the things we set up here to actually send a request.
