00:01.800 --> 00:04.610
So right now in the application, we didn't have this case,

00:04.650 --> 00:08.060
we only had the communication between a parent and a child

00:08.310 --> 00:13.650
and we use props to get data from the parent to the child and a custom event to do the other way

00:13.650 --> 00:14.410
around.

00:14.700 --> 00:21.480
The thing about the callback I mentioned on the slides is another option we have though, here

00:21.600 --> 00:24.200
I could also set resetName,

00:24.210 --> 00:25.940
now I'm on the parent component

00:25.980 --> 00:31.260
so add a new method here where I set this name equal to Max again,

00:31.350 --> 00:34.740
so it's the same resetName method as in the child component

00:34.740 --> 00:45.570
but now in the parent. I could now also pass another prop to my component and I'll do this here,

00:47.410 --> 00:57.790
so I could pass a prop let's say reset function which is a pointer to the resetName function I just

00:57.790 --> 01:00.170
created, this one here,

01:00.370 --> 01:01.900
so now I'm passing this,

01:01.900 --> 01:12.570
I therefore have to set up a new prop in my user detail and here, I would have the reset function which

01:12.570 --> 01:14.920
is a function of type function here

01:16.370 --> 01:20.240
and then I could simply duplicate the resetName button here

01:20.360 --> 01:25.090
but in the second one, I'm not executing my own resetName function,

01:25.250 --> 01:29.790
I'm instead executing the reset function which was passed down as a prop.

01:29.810 --> 01:34.780
So that's just another setup to avoid working with a custom event which you don't have to, there's

01:34.790 --> 01:36.400
nothing wrong with a custom event,

01:36.470 --> 01:39.690
it's just an alternative using such a callback.

01:40.070 --> 01:44.080
If I reload now, you will see this now will also reset it

01:44.210 --> 01:46.460
but without using a custom event.

01:46.610 --> 01:52.060
So that's one addition on how to communicate between parent and child,

01:52.070 --> 02:00.290
you can do it with props and custom event or with props and passing a callback as a prop which actually

02:00.290 --> 02:02.040
executes a method in the parent

02:02.150 --> 02:06.980
but now by passing it as a prop makes it executable from the child.

02:06.980 --> 02:13.490
This is an important thing to understand, how to work with that and how to well pass data from parent to

02:13.490 --> 02:14.290
child.

02:14.390 --> 02:19.770
But we haven't touched on the case if we want to get some data from one child to another child,

02:19.820 --> 02:21.320
we'll have a look at this next.
