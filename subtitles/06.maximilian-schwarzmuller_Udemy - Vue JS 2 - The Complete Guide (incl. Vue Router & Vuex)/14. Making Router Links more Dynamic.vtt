00:01.750 --> 00:07.000
So we're able to choose a user here and load this in its own component,

00:07.000 --> 00:13.960
now let's fine tune that and add an edit button here on the user detail so that we load the user edit component

00:13.960 --> 00:15.210
in such a case.

00:15.370 --> 00:25.120
So here, I simply want to set up a router link which shall use a button as the tag, the html tag and it

00:25.120 --> 00:27.880
should navigate to, to what?

00:27.880 --> 00:29.310
Let's have a look at our routes,

00:29.320 --> 00:30.820
I want to go to this route

00:30.820 --> 00:36.250
so I need /user slash the currently loaded ID slash edit.

00:36.430 --> 00:38.350
Well that's shouldn't be too hard,

00:38.560 --> 00:47.850
I can simply say user and then here, I somehow need to pass the id. To do so, I will bind to dynamically

00:47.850 --> 00:51.720
by adding a colon or v-bind for the long form

00:51.720 --> 00:55.560
and this allows me now to pass other things than just a simple string.

00:55.770 --> 01:00.360
So here I will actually pass a string plus

01:00.510 --> 01:11.040
and now $route.params.id plus /edit and I will show you an alternative to constructing your path like

01:11.130 --> 01:13.850
this manually in one of the next videos

01:13.860 --> 01:23.190
but for now, let's keep it like this and let say added link edit user here and go to my user and I click

01:23.220 --> 01:23.990
edit user, 

01:24.000 --> 01:28.570
we now see I'm loading user one added and I'm on the edit user page here.

01:30.110 --> 01:39.830
Now I can also add my classes here to this, so let's add class shall be button, button primary to give this a

01:39.830 --> 01:45.380
nice styling, that of course should work just fine, like this.

01:45.470 --> 01:54.680
And now again this is how I load my user or how I can pass a parameter dynamically here with colon too

01:54.740 --> 01:57.270
and then constructing the path manually.

01:57.380 --> 02:01.990
But now in the next video, I will show you a more elegant way of doing this.
