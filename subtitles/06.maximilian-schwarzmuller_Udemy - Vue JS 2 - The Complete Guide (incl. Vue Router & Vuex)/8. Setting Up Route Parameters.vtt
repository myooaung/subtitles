00:02.480 --> 00:08.030
So far we learned a lot about routing but all our routes were fairly static,

00:08.120 --> 00:12.150
we didn't have any dynamic pieces in these routes.

00:12.170 --> 00:18.630
If we have a look at this especially for the user, it would make sense that we want to pass an ID in

00:18.630 --> 00:21.330
the URL, in our path here,

00:21.440 --> 00:22.390
so that we visit

00:22.450 --> 00:28.160
let's say user/10 and then we load this or we are able to use this ID on the component which

00:28.160 --> 00:29.200
gets loaded,

00:29.480 --> 00:37.220
well let's have a look at passing such IDs in this module or in this video. To pass any dynamic piece

00:37.250 --> 00:39.680
or segment in your path,

00:39.680 --> 00:40.840
you simply add it

00:40.850 --> 00:46.220
but then with a colon in front of it and then a name of your choice, for example ID, it will be this name

00:46.220 --> 00:49.040
by which you able to later retrieve it.

00:49.040 --> 00:55.070
This will now tell the router that the user component should be loaded whenever you visit user/

00:55.190 --> 01:00.060
something where something will be interpreted as the ID.

01:00.080 --> 01:06.150
You can also make this more complex and I'll come back to this by adding for example /details thereafter,

01:06.170 --> 01:10.470
it's simply a flexible element you embed in your URL.

01:10.490 --> 01:18.320
Now with that added, I'll go to my header and right now, user doesn't really pass this ID here, so

01:18.470 --> 01:20.520
I'll simulate it by hardcoding

01:20.510 --> 01:29.810
10 in here, we'll change this in the future. If I do it like this and I now reload the page and click

01:29.810 --> 01:32.510
on user, you see the URL now is user 10

01:32.540 --> 01:36.430
and we still load the user page because it does match this path.

01:36.650 --> 01:41.810
If I remove 10 here, it doesn't work because that doesn't work anymore, that doesn't exist anymore,

01:41.810 --> 01:44.860
our path leading to user component is user

01:44.900 --> 01:52.400
and then something dynamic, like the 10 here. Now with that we're passing this, now since it is dynamic, it would

01:52.490 --> 01:55.700
also make sense that we're able to retrieve it dynamically,

01:55.700 --> 01:57.250
so let's have a look at this now.
