Well so over the last lectures, we learned a lot about outputting data, listening to events, transforming

00:10.180 --> 00:17.410
data, dynamically recalculating properties with computed properties, watching our properties and much

00:17.410 --> 00:19.470
more. All the time

00:19.470 --> 00:25.750
we used syntax like this, v-on for events and v-bind for binding to attributes of our elements here,

00:25.910 --> 00:28.210
like the ref element.

00:28.240 --> 00:34.300
Now if you use that and you're going to use this a lot, there is a shortcut, a short a way of writing

00:34.300 --> 00:37.370
this. For events,

00:37.420 --> 00:46.450
you can replace v-on and the colon with an @ sign, vuejs will recognize this and behind the scenes, rendered

00:46.450 --> 00:48.880
it or treat it as v-on colon

00:49.030 --> 00:53.540
but with @ click, we're basically saying at the click event, do the following,

00:53.590 --> 00:57.940
so it's the same as v-on and then colon, just a shorter way of writing it.

00:58.150 --> 01:04.840
And for v-bind, we get a similar shortcut, we can remove v-bind and just use colon

01:04.840 --> 01:10.810
ref, so the code now is exactly the same as before but a bit shorter

01:10.810 --> 01:15.600
and for the rest of course, I will use the shorter code as there is nothing wrong with it

01:15.650 --> 01:18.610
and why not save some characters especially since

01:18.640 --> 01:22.120
I believe this syntax is very readable as well.

01:22.120 --> 01:24.410
So that's just something to be aware of.
