Now let's make the dropdown work,

00:04.220 --> 00:09.250
I don't know if you already solved this but it's part of the header component,

00:09.320 --> 00:13.330
so here is the place where we can simply put some code to make it work.

00:13.370 --> 00:20.150
You could outsource the dropdown in it's own component but I'll leave it in this component and therefore,

00:20.150 --> 00:24.530
I will add some data. In my data property here,

00:24.740 --> 00:31.280
I want to store the isDropdownOpen property, of course you might choose another name

00:31.490 --> 00:35.020
and initially it's false because it shouldn't be open initially.

00:35.030 --> 00:37.850
Now how is a bootstrapped dropdown opened,

00:37.880 --> 00:43.940
that's important to understand, to know how to proceed here with the code. Well we get this list item

00:43.940 --> 00:45.290
class, dropdown

00:45.290 --> 00:49.620
and if we add the open class here, you see it's now open,

00:49.640 --> 00:56.600
so the goal is to dynamically add this. We can add it dynamically by binding to class here and then in the

00:56.600 --> 01:05.840
object, I want to bind the open class to my isDropdownOpen data field which is true or false, so it's false

01:05.870 --> 01:07.780
initially therefore it's not open,

01:07.790 --> 01:09.770
the open class is not attached.

01:09.830 --> 01:13.810
So the goal now is to listen to a click and change this,

01:13.820 --> 01:20.870
so whenever we click on it, I want to change this or toggle this isDropdownOpen state here.

01:21.080 --> 01:26.790
All I need to do is on this list item where I need to add this class,

01:27.080 --> 01:35.810
I'll also add a click listener and I will simply set isDropdownOpen to what it currently

01:35.810 --> 01:36.350
is not,

01:36.380 --> 01:40.210
so the opposite, isDropdownOpen, this toggles it.

01:40.210 --> 01:42.970
And with this in place, you

01:42.970 --> 01:48.080
now see I got a working dropdown where I can toggle between opening and closing it by conditionally

01:48.180 --> 01:50.240
appending or not appending

01:50.240 --> 01:54.290
this is open class here, excuse me, this class here

01:54.530 --> 01:55.940
and this is how this works.

01:55.940 --> 02:03.710
Now the next step is to make the save and load data buttons work and to actually send http requests.

02:03.710 --> 02:05.530
Again, a challenge for you,

02:05.660 --> 02:09.170
I will use vue resource as we learned it in the http module,

02:09.170 --> 02:11.360
you of course may choose a different approach.

02:11.430 --> 02:15.110
See you in the next video when we go through my solution together.
