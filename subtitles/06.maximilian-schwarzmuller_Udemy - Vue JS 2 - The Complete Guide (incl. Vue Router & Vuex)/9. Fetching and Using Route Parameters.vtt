00:01.840 --> 00:09.610
To retrieve such a dynamic parameter here, I can simply go to my user component and here let's say I

00:09.610 --> 00:11.280
went to output the loaded

00:11.290 --> 00:21.710
ID, so here loaded ID, I'll move it above the button here and I'll add my data method to store the

00:21.740 --> 00:26.350
property or or this ID I'm getting in a property, ID

00:26.720 --> 00:39.000
and this shall now be this.$route.params.id, this is how you access your data. You visit the or you access the 

00:39.120 --> 00:45.290
route object, $route again provided by vuejs, so router is the router itself where we

00:45.290 --> 00:49.000
could navigate and so on and $route is the active route,

00:49.010 --> 00:53.990
so the route which was loaded and this route happens to have a params object.

00:54.050 --> 01:00.440
Again, you can visit the vue router documentation to learn more about all available objects or properties

01:00.440 --> 01:03.360
in general on the route object.

01:03.410 --> 01:10.940
Now params again is an object which holds key value pairs all of the parameters we're passing in the

01:10.940 --> 01:11.670
route.

01:11.690 --> 01:17.960
Now we only have one key set up, ID here which is why we can access it like this

01:17.960 --> 01:23.050
in here, ID, now and that allows me to dynamically output it here,

01:23.090 --> 01:29.160
so by simply outputting ID between curly braces and now you already see loaded ID is 10

01:29.180 --> 01:33.110
and if I manually change this here, you'll see now it's 5.

01:33.140 --> 01:36.490
This is how you can access the parameter you're passing,

01:36.560 --> 01:42.740
how you can pass it dynamically in the first place and then output it like this in your template.

01:42.800 --> 01:48.650
You don't have a problem with accessing it on your route because this component will only be created

01:48.650 --> 01:50.460
once your route has been loaded,

01:50.570 --> 01:56.960
so this ID parameter will always be available when you access it here but there is a case where you

01:56.960 --> 02:00.990
will encounter a problem and we'll have a look at this case in the next video.
