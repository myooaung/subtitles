Similarly to the v-if directive, 

00:05.700 --> 00:12.270
what if you not wanted to output a list item here but you wanted to output a heading where you output

00:12.310 --> 00:21.290
the ingredient name, let's say followed by a paragraph where you output the index. Well you could loop

00:21.770 --> 00:24.810
by using a template for that, just as before

00:24.830 --> 00:32.360
the template tag won't get rendered but if we place v-for on that template, just like that, just like

00:32.360 --> 00:39.310
before v-if, then it will render everything inside of this template just like it renders it up here

00:39.370 --> 00:42.230
where we place it directly on the li item.

00:42.230 --> 00:46.690
So here I could basically copy this loop here,

00:50.130 --> 00:57.810
rename this to index though since I used index down here. And if I now hit control enter, you see meat

00:57.830 --> 01:00.210
0, fruit 1, cookies 2.

01:00.510 --> 01:07.650
So this is another way of using v-for with a template to use multiple non-nested elements with

01:07.650 --> 01:08.420
this loop.
