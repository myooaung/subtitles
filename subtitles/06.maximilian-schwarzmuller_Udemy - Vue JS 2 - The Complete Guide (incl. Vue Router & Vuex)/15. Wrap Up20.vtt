00:02.310 --> 00:09.240
In this module we created a complete application with vuejs, this monster slayer application here,

00:09.990 --> 00:18.570
I hope you saw how easy it was to use vuejs here. Through vuejs, we could really focus on our core

00:18.570 --> 00:27.220
game logic, writing the javascript code to handle different attacks, handle our health but not to fetch

00:27.230 --> 00:33.180
the right element in the dom, to check the current value, to check if it needs to be updated, to keep

00:33.240 --> 00:34.910
everything in sync manually,

00:34.920 --> 00:38.850
how we would have to do it with vanilla javascript or jQuery.

00:38.910 --> 00:46.020
Instead we set up some easy connections, like here with the for loop or like here with the health.

00:46.260 --> 00:54.270
We stored some data in our data property and recognize, we only have four properties in there and then

00:54.270 --> 01:01.230
we get a couple of functions where we manipulate these properties and hence vuejs takes care about

01:01.230 --> 01:06.320
the rest, automatically updates everything, automatically keeps everything in sync,

01:06.450 --> 01:12.430
and with that, we built our first vuejs application with the tools we learned thus far.

01:12.480 --> 01:18.330
And I can tell you there's much more to come but I hope you already see that we achieved a lot here

01:18.330 --> 01:24.440
already and which great application we were able to build with the things we've learned thus far.

01:24.630 --> 01:26.370
Let's continue to the next module.
