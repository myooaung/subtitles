Well what are directives then? If they allow us to do something like that, how could we describe

00:07.940 --> 00:15.310
them, what is a directive? A directive is basically an instruction you place in your code, vuejs ships

00:15.320 --> 00:20.990
with a few build in directives, it aren't that many because the view it has really cover pretty much

00:21.080 --> 00:23.410
all the use cases you might want to cover

00:23.600 --> 00:28.850
and as a side note, you will learn later on how to write your own directives. Back to what it is,

00:28.850 --> 00:31.250
it is an instruction and this instruction,

00:31.250 --> 00:36.400
v-bind here tells vuejs bind something to my data,

00:36.440 --> 00:43.480
so bind something to the data and that includes also my functions which are stored in the vuejs instance.

00:43.490 --> 00:49.250
So basically what we do here with the double curly braces for cases where we can't use double curly

00:49.250 --> 00:49.720
braces if

00:49.740 --> 00:51.820
you want to put it like that.

00:51.920 --> 00:58.640
V-bind then takes an argument and generally, you pass arguments to directives by using a colon and then

00:58.700 --> 01:03.910
the argument you want to pass and the argument it does expect is the attribute you want to bind,

01:03.950 --> 01:06.910
so the reference of this link here.

01:07.160 --> 01:12.980
Well and then between the quotation marks, you just passed the property function, whatever you want to

01:12.980 --> 01:17.070
bind from your vuejs instance, the link in this case.

01:17.090 --> 01:24.230
This allows you to bind or to pass dynamic data to html attributes, something you would otherwise not

01:24.230 --> 01:25.280
be able to do.
