We want to hook up the other buttons to also print the player damage

00:06.370 --> 00:10.060
and then I want to improve the styling so that we can easier see if it was

00:10.080 --> 00:13.960
the monster or the player attacking here. To do so,

00:13.990 --> 00:19.930
I'll go to the app.js file here and I'll copy the this.turns.unshift code

00:19.930 --> 00:22.650
and yes again, this could also be refactored

00:22.750 --> 00:30.400
but since it isn't that much code, I'll keep it like this and also add it here, hits monster hard for

00:30.520 --> 00:31.870
the damage let's say.

00:31.960 --> 00:40.040
Of course we for this have to store damage in a separate variable again, like that and then deduct this

00:40.060 --> 00:41.950
variable from the monster health.

00:42.190 --> 00:48.970
We don't need to change monster attacks, we already got our log addition there and for healing,

00:49.000 --> 00:57.630
we of course also want to, whoops, not that, we also want to copy that code here, put it in here and say player

00:57.660 --> 01:06.980
heals for and we know it's always 10, so we can say for 10, simply write it in a string like this.

01:07.140 --> 01:09.280
These are the actions I have,

01:09.600 --> 01:16.440
now one thing I also want to do is up on giving up or let's say up on starting a new game, I want to

01:16.440 --> 01:23.570
set this.turns back to an empty string, an empty array excuse me so that I reset the log

01:23.570 --> 01:31.260
with that. With this, I added log actions to all items, we can see this if I reload and now I attack here,

01:31.260 --> 01:38.110
we see that we get the log for that and also for healing and that if I hit it give up and start a new

01:38.110 --> 01:38.580
game,

01:38.620 --> 01:40.450
the log is cleared.

01:40.450 --> 01:41.600
Missing piece is

01:41.600 --> 01:48.310
it would be nice to have some coloring to quickly see which action stems from the player and which attack

01:48.310 --> 01:50.010
was launched by the monster.

01:50.260 --> 01:55.100
So let's do this by conditionally attaching some styles or classes there.
