00:01.710 --> 00:08.550
In the last modules, we learned so much about components. Time to bring it all together and build something

00:08.550 --> 00:09.430
great with it,

00:09.450 --> 00:11.250
a nice little application.

00:11.460 --> 00:14.220
This is what we're going to build, a quotes application,

00:14.250 --> 00:18.110
you see I really like quotes. Now in this application,

00:18.150 --> 00:23.850
we start with a quote and then we can add a new quote like that,

00:23.850 --> 00:27.770
so once we add it, you see we get 2 of 10 and the quote is added.

00:27.810 --> 00:38.190
Now if I add a couple of other quotes here until we reach 10 quotes there, you will quickly see that once

00:38.190 --> 00:44.220
I try to add the 11th one, I get an error that I should first delete some quotes so that we're not getting

00:44.220 --> 00:45.560
too crowded here.

00:45.840 --> 00:51.780
Well I can delete quotes by simply clicking on them and then you see it updates up there and I can

00:51.780 --> 00:53.870
start adding new ones again.

00:54.180 --> 00:58.930
So whilst we only have one page here, we're already using a lot of features here

00:58.980 --> 01:05.670
with that tracking of our state, the possibility to add and delete quotes and dynamically adding them

01:05.670 --> 01:07.310
to our dom here.

01:07.650 --> 01:13.270
Well with that, I'd say let's dive in and build this project together.

01:13.290 --> 01:19.970
Of course if you want, feel free to try out to achieve the same without watching me give you the solution

01:19.970 --> 01:20.680
first,

01:20.880 --> 01:25.330
you learned all the things you need here but of course also feel free to join me on the solution

01:25.470 --> 01:27.840
and then stop at some point, continue on your own,

01:27.870 --> 01:33.330
whatever works for you. You'll find the set up for this project attached to this lecture.
