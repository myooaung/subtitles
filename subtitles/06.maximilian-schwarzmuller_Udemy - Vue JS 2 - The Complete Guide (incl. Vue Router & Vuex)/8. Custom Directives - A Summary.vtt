Now this first directive we built here

00:03.520 --> 00:04.280
is very nice,

00:04.270 --> 00:08.160
it shows us how to use arguments, modifiers and a value.

00:08.410 --> 00:12.700
It shows us how to use all that together to build our own global directive.

00:12.940 --> 00:18.370
In the next videos, I want to show you how to create a local directive which is only usable in one instance,

00:18.370 --> 00:25.000
in one component and also how to create a even more powerful or feature rich directive.

00:25.030 --> 00:26.600
So let's work on that next.
