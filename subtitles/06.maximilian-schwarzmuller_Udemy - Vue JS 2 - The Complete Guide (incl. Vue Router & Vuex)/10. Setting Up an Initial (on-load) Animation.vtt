00:01.720 --> 00:06.310
So we learned the basics about animating our elements here.

00:06.310 --> 00:12.960
Now let me dive a bit deeper into what else we can configure to really fine tune this to our needs.

00:13.060 --> 00:17.350
I'm going to copy this transition up here and copy it

00:17.350 --> 00:22.280
in here, I'll use v-if again because that's the more often use case

00:22.600 --> 00:26.130
and now let's say I generally set show to true.

00:26.260 --> 00:32.920
Now if I do this of course and I reload this, we see all three elements. Now maybe we want to

00:32.950 --> 00:39.910
animate this element when the page is loaded first because all the elements could also transition in smoothly

00:39.910 --> 00:41.550
in such a case right,

00:41.560 --> 00:47.410
if you visit this page, you probably want to animate some element to really give the user the impression

00:47.410 --> 00:49.540
of hey I landed on this page.

00:49.870 --> 00:53.130
Well I'll demonstrate this with this third element here,

00:54.460 --> 01:00.240
to tell vuejs to also animate the initial attaching to the dom,

01:00.250 --> 01:05.670
you can add the appear attribute to the transition component here, to this wrapper.

01:05.860 --> 01:12.670
By doing so, if I reload this, you see again this smoothly animates in down there

01:12.760 --> 01:15.040
and that is exactly the behavior we want here.

01:15.070 --> 01:20.320
We want it to animate in because we want to also animate this initial attachment to the dom and

01:20.320 --> 01:26.470
not only the one if I trigger this button here and hence you get the well behaviour we already know but

01:26.560 --> 01:28.140
also the initial loading.
