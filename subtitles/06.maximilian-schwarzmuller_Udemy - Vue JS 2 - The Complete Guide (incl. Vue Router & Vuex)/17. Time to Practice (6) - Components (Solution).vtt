Were you successful? Here's my solution.

00:05.460 --> 00:11.730
As you can see, my app.vue file got a lot leaner and I got four new files, footers, header, serverdetails

00:11.760 --> 00:13.590
and servers.vue. 

00:13.650 --> 00:19.860
I'm importing all these files here in my app.vue file and then all I'm doing here is I'm exporting a default object

00:19.880 --> 00:21.320
where I set up my components,

00:21.360 --> 00:23.090
so I'm registering it locally,

00:23.090 --> 00:29.570
again it would have been perfectly fine if you were to use vue component and register them globally

00:29.790 --> 00:35.320
but I just choose the local registration as I'm only using them in the app.vue file here anyways.

00:35.640 --> 00:40.510
I set up my selectors here as keys in this property or in this object

00:40.650 --> 00:44.970
and then I assign the imported objects as values.

00:44.990 --> 00:49.100
This is my set up her,, now in my components here,

00:49.110 --> 00:56.280
I basically only exported these rows and columns and then the content from the well main file we used

00:56.280 --> 00:59.080
before, I did this for header and footer.

00:59.130 --> 01:06.640
Now for the servers, I only imported the column because I wanted to keep the row here in my app.vue file,

01:06.660 --> 01:10.020
since I group servers and server detail together in one row,

01:10.020 --> 01:15.290
so I wanted to keep the row in this main component, in this main file here.

01:15.550 --> 01:21.490
Therefore servers and server details only have the column in their template

01:21.540 --> 01:27.930
and regarding the servers, it would have theoretically made sense to also make the individual server

01:27.930 --> 01:29.420
its own component,

01:29.430 --> 01:33.100
so the list item here to have a separate component for that

01:33.420 --> 01:39.270
but we would have a problem with passing the current index down to this individual component.

01:39.480 --> 01:46.080
We could loop through all the servers, we did that before but then it's kind of hard to adjust the number

01:46.080 --> 01:49.380
of the server in this server itself.

01:49.380 --> 01:54.910
So we will learn how to pass data from a parent to a child component in the next module,

01:54.930 --> 02:02.070
until then, I'll stick to this solution and this really is it. Now in the next videos, I want to go into

02:02.070 --> 02:09.030
some possible improvements regarding the file structure and how you pick the right names for your selectors

02:09.330 --> 02:10.440
as we do here.
