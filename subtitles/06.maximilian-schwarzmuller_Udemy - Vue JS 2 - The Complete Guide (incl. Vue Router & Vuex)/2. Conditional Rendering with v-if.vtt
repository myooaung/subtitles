00:01.640 --> 00:08.840
I'm back in a brand new JSFiddle project, very simple as can see, just my vue instance which has this show

00:08.840 --> 00:14.210
property in a data field and then two paragraphs in my div here.

00:14.210 --> 00:16.740
So if we run this, we see you can see me

00:16.760 --> 00:23.750
and do you also see me? Now as these texts already imply, we're now going to work with conditionally

00:23.750 --> 00:28.390
showing and hiding or attaching and detaching elements to the dom,

00:28.610 --> 00:32.970
that's a task you'll probably see in all the applications you've built,

00:32.990 --> 00:36.740
you don't want to show everything on your template all the time.

00:36.890 --> 00:39.930
Sometimes you only want to show an error message,

00:39.950 --> 00:44.690
let's say in case of a wrong input, in a form input or something like that,

00:44.690 --> 00:50.350
so you want to conditionally shows certain messages or elements on your page.

00:50.510 --> 00:55.970
Now vuejs of course include some methods to allow you to easily do that,

00:55.970 --> 00:58.100
so let's dive into them and have a look at them

00:58.130 --> 01:06.740
and I'm going to start with v-if. That's a directive we can add to a paragraph or to any element,

01:06.740 --> 01:08.520
v-if, just like that

01:08.840 --> 01:16.940
and it allows us to bind it to a condition or to a property, whatever which resolves to true or false,

01:16.970 --> 01:19.030
in the end this is the important thing.

01:19.190 --> 01:22.070
So I could bind it to show here to

01:22.080 --> 01:29.930
well show this since this is set to true. If I now add a button where I say switch or whatever you

01:29.930 --> 01:34.650
like and then add a click listener where I set show to

01:34.670 --> 01:36.140
well the opposite of show,

01:36.140 --> 01:38.050
so I basically switch it.

01:38.390 --> 01:46.400
If I now save this, you can see that once I hit this button, you see the you can see me text disappear and

01:46.400 --> 01:48.230
now it's back there.

01:48.230 --> 01:51.400
Important thing, if we inspect this,

01:51.480 --> 01:53.710
this is the paragraph element,

01:53.870 --> 01:58.000
if I now hit switch, you see it disappeared entirely,

01:58.010 --> 02:04.550
we only get this comment left which kind of shows us that something was there but it is gone.

02:04.580 --> 02:06.720
It's not hidden, it's not transparent,

02:06.770 --> 02:14.940
it's gone and this is important to understand, v-if really attaches or detaches elements to the dom.

02:14.990 --> 02:21.950
It not just hides them, it completely removes them if you well have a false condition here or if the

02:21.950 --> 02:23.330
condition returns false

02:23.330 --> 02:26.710
here. V-if can also be extended,

02:26.990 --> 02:29.150
I'll add a new paragraph,

02:29.150 --> 02:37.850
now you see me and I'll add v-else, v-else will automatically refer to the latest v-if in front

02:37.850 --> 02:38.300
of it,

02:38.300 --> 02:46.370
so this one here and if we compile these, you see that we switch now between now you see me and you can

02:46.370 --> 02:46.940
see me,

02:46.970 --> 02:53.240
so I show the else condition whenever the v-if condition is false, which makes sense like a normal if

02:53.240 --> 02:54.500
else statement.

02:54.610 --> 02:57.770
Notice you don't have v-elseif and so on,

02:57.830 --> 03:03.110
you would simply need to create a new v-if statement if you want to check multiple conditions.

03:03.230 --> 03:04.520
This is just a shortcut

03:04.550 --> 03:10.010
if you know you got an either or decision, then v-if and v-else allows you to quickly get started and

03:10.010 --> 03:11.210
set this up.

03:11.210 --> 03:16.340
Also notice, v-if shows the entire element and all nested elements,

03:16.340 --> 03:21.640
so if I nest an element inside this paragraph, for example this span, well

03:21.680 --> 03:23.520
this is also affected by it.

03:23.570 --> 03:29.600
So it really removes the complete element and all nested elements, not just the element leaving behind

03:29.600 --> 03:30.400
the nested ones,

03:30.410 --> 03:31.880
no, that's not how it works.

03:31.880 --> 03:35.630
Everything gets removed or attached, whatever the condition says.
