00:01.820 --> 00:07.920
In the last video, we put our central store into place, that's great, it already improves our application.

00:07.920 --> 00:12.660
Now let me show you where this solution starts getting some flaws,

00:13.080 --> 00:15.660
we output the store here in the counter,

00:15.660 --> 00:20.260
now let's add a second file. I'll name it AnotherCounter.vue,

00:20.380 --> 00:28.380
so a second component and generally excuse me, it should be named AnotherResult.vue

00:28.800 --> 00:34.550
and generally, I want to copy the code from result but counter here

00:34.710 --> 00:37.930
shall be this store counter times two,

00:37.980 --> 00:46.290
so I simply multiply it with two. And I want to do the same thing in my other result, multiply it with

00:46.290 --> 00:47.690
two here too,

00:48.180 --> 00:49.910
so I do have a calculation here

00:49.920 --> 00:52.650
now in two different components.

00:52.650 --> 01:05.760
Now if I simply import this new result here too, so the AnotherResult and also add it here, app another

01:05.760 --> 01:07.340
result as a component,

01:09.970 --> 01:12.160
then you will quickly see what the issue is,

01:12.160 --> 01:21.510
so app another result, like this. If I save this, you now see it correctly updates,

01:21.500 --> 01:22.800
that's not the issue.

01:23.150 --> 01:28.440
But we already have the problem that we duplicate our code here,

01:28.640 --> 01:36.800
so in result and another result, we do have the same method here for retrieving our counter,

01:37.160 --> 01:40.970
the additional problem is here we have a very simple calculation,

01:40.970 --> 01:47.120
now what if that became a longer and longer and then we were to use that in multiple components? We would

01:47.120 --> 01:53.850
quickly face the problem that we have duplicated code all over the place and that never is a good sign,

01:54.050 --> 02:01.220
so whilst it works fine here, it does reach its limits in bigger application where we do more with the

02:01.220 --> 02:06.370
state or with the stored state we get here then just output it.

02:06.680 --> 02:14.060
As soon as we start doing some calculations on it, changing it and then do that in multiple components,

02:14.060 --> 02:21.500
this really reaches its limits because then we repeat ourselves too often and it's hard to manage this

02:21.500 --> 02:27.170
because if we do have an error in our calculation, hard to do here but in a more complex calculation,

02:27.170 --> 02:28.610
that is certainly possible.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.320
Well if we do have such an error,

02:30.410 --> 02:34.760
we would have to change it in like 3, 10, 100 files,

02:34.790 --> 02:35.910
not really much fun.

02:36.050 --> 02:39.170
So let's have a look which better solution we may use.
