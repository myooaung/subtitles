Getting started with Vue.js and creating your first application is actually very simple.

1
00:07.000 --> 00:12.310
We start on vuejs.org, it's official home page, and there you see this nice GET STARTED

2
00:12.310 --> 00:17.560
button. Let's click on it. It takes you to the official documentation, which is always worth having a look

3
00:17.560 --> 00:18.130
anyways,

4
00:18.190 --> 00:20.910
But there we want to go to installation.

5
00:21.010 --> 00:25.660
Now here you've got a couple of different options depending on which kind of setup you want to use. Later

6
00:25.660 --> 00:29.960
in this course we'll use a more complex setup using Webpack to bundle all our files,

7
00:29.980 --> 00:31.750
but let's start with a simple one.

8
00:32.020 --> 00:34.050
You could either simply download Vue.js

9
00:34.070 --> 00:37.590
(I will show this in the later video) or, as I want to do now,

10
00:37.690 --> 00:39.440
simply grab it from a CDN

11
00:39.490 --> 00:41.650
(so imported from another server).

12
00:42.160 --> 00:46.100
Here I'll take the first one and then simply copy this whole link.

13
00:46.210 --> 00:52.350
Now with that we can import this link to get access to Vue.js. Well I want to do this here on JSFiddle;

14
00:52.420 --> 00:59.050
which is kind of a Web editor, you could say, for a very simple JavaScript,  HTML and CSS-only projects.

15
00:59.410 --> 01:03.780
Here we got our HTML section in which we should add a script import.

16
01:03.910 --> 01:10.110
So lets add script and then by hitting tab it will automatically expand it to script tags. In there

17
01:10.120 --> 01:14.680
I want to add my src attribute and now insert the link you just copied.

18
01:14.680 --> 01:20.340
Now you can leave the link like this, or you can remove this version number to always automatically fetch

19
01:20.340 --> 01:21.560
the latest version.

20
01:21.880 --> 01:27.180
With that we imported Vue.js and we can now already use it and all its features.

21
01:27.250 --> 01:31.220
So let's use it and build our first little application. For that,

22
01:31.240 --> 01:35.390
I want to add a paragraph in which I want to say Hello World!

23
01:35.410 --> 01:38.200
Now saying it like this clearly is not very interesting.

24
01:38.200 --> 01:40.930
There is no JavaScript involved at any place.

25
01:40.930 --> 01:46.280
Instead I want to output this through Vue.js. Now in order to do so,

26
01:46.510 --> 01:53.970
I will simply go to the JavaScript section here and use the import up there to now use one of the major objects,

27
01:54.030 --> 01:54.350
this

28
01:54.400 --> 01:58.680
import, this Vue.js framework gives me; the Vue object.

29
01:58.900 --> 02:04.050
Let's create a new instance based on that with the new keyword and then Vue.

30
02:04.090 --> 02:13.000
This gives us a new Vue instance and Vue instances created like this are the core of each Vue application,

31
02:13.000 --> 02:14.510
of each piece of code

32
02:14.530 --> 02:22.750
you want to use Vue.js in. You create such instances and then these instances have one major job; control

33
02:22.750 --> 02:27.610
their own template of code, of HTML code, which they render to the screen.

34
02:27.650 --> 02:34.920
Now in order to let this Vue instance do this, we have to pass an argument to this constructor function.

35
02:34.930 --> 02:39.910
The argument is a JavaScript object and then we have one very important property Vue.js will

36
02:39.910 --> 02:42.820
recognize; the el property.

37
02:42.850 --> 02:44.940
This is kind of a reserved property obviously.

38
02:44.950 --> 02:49.080
Vue.js will recognize it and el takes a string as a value.

39
02:49.210 --> 02:51.610
And with this string we set up

40
02:51.610 --> 02:57.930
which part of our HTML code here should be under control of this Vue instance.

41
02:58.000 --> 02:58.920
And with under control,

42
02:58.930 --> 03:03.910
I mean we can then change it through this Vue instance. You will see this in a few seconds.

43
03:04.210 --> 03:10.060
So here I want to control this part, but I want to wrap it in a div let's say, a div which encloses

44
03:10.060 --> 03:17.380
my template for this Vue instance. So here I'll add a div#app and then tab automatically gives

45
03:17.380 --> 03:19.060
me a div with id="app".

46
03:19.330 --> 03:25.100
Now insert my paragraph inside of this div and then I can select this div with id="app"

47
03:25.240 --> 03:28.760
by using this string like a CSS selector.

48
03:28.780 --> 03:34.720
So with '#app' I select the element with the id="app". With '.app' I would select the first element

49
03:34.720 --> 03:36.460
with class="app".

50
03:36.460 --> 03:39.660
Now here I therefore have now control of this div.

51
03:39.670 --> 03:42.210
It is now the template of this Vue instance.

52
03:42.470 --> 03:45.250
And now in order to output something we need some data.

53
03:45.430 --> 03:48.220
Well Vue.js has got a special property for this,

54
03:48.220 --> 03:54.580
the data property (another reserved property) and now this isn't a string, it's an object instead. And

55
03:54.580 --> 03:57.020
in there we store all the data we want to use

56
03:57.040 --> 03:58.550
in this Vue instance.

57
03:58.750 --> 04:02.090
So let's say we want to have a title, and this name is totally up to you,

58
04:02.170 --> 04:04.480
where I say Hello World!

59
04:04.480 --> 04:09.760
Now is the title I want to output in my template and before I hardcoded it in here,

60
04:09.790 --> 04:15.840
now with this template being under control of Vue.js, it's as simple as using this special syntax Vue.js

61
04:15.850 --> 04:21.880
will recognize, with double curly braces (opening and closing) and in between I can simply write

62
04:21.910 --> 04:25.950
title and Vue.js will automatically look into this data object

63
04:25.960 --> 04:28.050
(as I said this is a reserved word),

64
04:28.090 --> 04:32.000
look into this object, find the title property and output it here.

65
04:32.170 --> 04:38.350
If we now hit Ctrl-Enter in JSFiddle to see the result we see Hello World! on the right because now

66
04:38.380 --> 04:42.880
we're outputting this title through Vue.js which now controls this template.
