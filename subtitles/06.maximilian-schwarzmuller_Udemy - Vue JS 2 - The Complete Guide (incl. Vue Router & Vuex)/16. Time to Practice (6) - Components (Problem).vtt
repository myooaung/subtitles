Time to practice what you learned thus far. I'm in a new application here and I imported bootstrap

00:07.080 --> 00:14.280
for this application, I simply grabbed this link here from the bootstrap webpage, this CDN link and inserted

00:14.280 --> 00:16.700
in the index.html file.

00:16.740 --> 00:22.500
Now in this application, I basically have the same set up as before but without my home and server status

00:22.500 --> 00:27.020
components, I'm not registering any components globally or locally,

00:27.060 --> 00:29.420
instead I only have my main app here,

00:29.450 --> 00:34.900
this object I'm exporting here or not even exporting here but I could export here

00:35.040 --> 00:36.400
and I have my template.

00:36.430 --> 00:42.410
This is all just html code with one little vuejs addition here,

00:42.600 --> 00:47.310
I do have my loop here where I loop through a couple of servers,

00:47.310 --> 00:53.140
couple of list items which I then see here on the left and then I add the details on the right. Side note,

00:53.190 --> 00:55.720
it's not possible to click a server to update

00:55.710 --> 01:02.160
this, we'll work on this in the next course module when we dive deeper into components but it looks like

01:02.160 --> 01:04.150
a dashboard, kind of. I also

01:04.150 --> 01:10.950
got this footer here and this header, the task for you now is take this application, take this code which

01:10.950 --> 01:18.120
you find attached to this lecture and restructure it such that you use components, so that in your app.vue

01:18.210 --> 01:23.500
file, you only use components for the header, the footer and so on.

01:23.550 --> 01:29.800
Try to be very granular to really split it up as far as it makes sense

01:29.880 --> 01:33.210
and then in the next video, we can compare the solutions.

01:33.480 --> 01:39.300
It is up to you if you register your components globally or locally, pick whatever you like and I'll

01:39.300 --> 01:42.560
be back in the next video where I will show you what I ended up with.
