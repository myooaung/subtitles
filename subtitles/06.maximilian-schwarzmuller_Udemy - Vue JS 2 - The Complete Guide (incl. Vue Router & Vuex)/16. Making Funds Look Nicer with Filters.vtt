I'm not 100% happy with how our funds look like. I want to add a filter to change the appearance,

00:08.230 --> 00:12.790
so therefore I'll go to the main.js file because I will create a global filter because I'll use

00:12.790 --> 00:14.960
it in two different places, the header

00:15.000 --> 00:21.610
and the home component and we can create a new filter with vue filter, as we learned. I'll name it currency,

00:21.610 --> 00:23.660
the name is of course totally up to you

00:23.890 --> 00:26.570
and this is a function where we get a value

00:26.950 --> 00:32.860
and then in the body of this function, I want to return the transformed value. The transformed value should

00:32.860 --> 00:36.750
have a dollar sign at the beginning and then it should have value

00:36.910 --> 00:41.950
and then the cool thing is we get this two local string method in javascript which will perform

00:41.950 --> 00:45.020
it to a nice looking digit

00:45.040 --> 00:52.450
basically, depending on which local we're using. Now with this in place, I can already go to my header and

00:52.540 --> 00:59.470
after funds, add this pipe symbol and then currency, the name of the filter we just created and do the same

00:59.470 --> 01:01.000
on the home page,

01:01.000 --> 01:03.860
so currency here, that's all.

01:03.880 --> 01:07.010
If we now have a look, it looks much nicer here

01:07.600 --> 01:12.830
and not really here, why's that? Because I need it to reload.

01:12.870 --> 01:14.390
So it looks nicer here,

01:14.610 --> 01:20.620
if we buy something it of course updates and if we sell this, well of course it works too.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.280
So now we get nicer funds

01:23.280 --> 01:30.090
but one major feature of the app is still missing or at least two features actually, we can't save and

01:30.090 --> 01:30.820
load it

01:30.860 --> 01:35.200
I'll come to this at the very end but the end day button also doesn't work,

01:35.250 --> 01:39.410
we don't randomize our stocks. So that is what I want to do next,

01:39.410 --> 01:45.400
I want to make this end day button work so that we can actually recalculate all stock prices.
