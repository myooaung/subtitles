We already did state management in this course, for example like this, we wanted to access a child with

00:08.580 --> 00:10.830
this child's one child

00:11.070 --> 00:13.440
and this direct access is not possible.

00:13.620 --> 00:19.080
So we could pass for example a callback from the parent, from the root component to child one which

00:19.080 --> 00:21.910
passes the callback to its child

00:22.050 --> 00:27.360
and then this child uses the callback to pass the data to the parent, to the root parent I should say

00:27.540 --> 00:30.870
and then this root component passes the data to the child where

00:30.870 --> 00:33.380
we finally went to get our data.

00:33.690 --> 00:40.390
Well if we only have these few components, that might work though it already doesn't make that much fun

00:40.590 --> 00:47.200
but it might work but it does become harder if we add more layers of components to our application.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.060
An alternative would be to use an event bus,

00:50.070 --> 00:56.160
that means we still can't access it directly but we use a central component, a central vue instance

00:56.160 --> 01:00.960
which we use as an event bus which we use to call emit on this bus

01:01.140 --> 01:05.660
and then on the target component, we listen on changes in this bus.

01:05.790 --> 01:06.720
It's better,

01:06.750 --> 01:09.510
It's shorter but it still has its issues,

01:09.510 --> 01:16.320
for example one bus alone will quickly get pretty crowded in bigger applications with a lot of different

01:16.340 --> 01:17.480
emits and so on,

01:17.480 --> 01:23.910
so there probably is a lot of code in this instance and in the end which arguably is maybe not the best

01:23.910 --> 01:25.700
solution to this.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.770
It also gives us another problem,

01:27.780 --> 01:30.440
the changes we make are hard to track,

01:30.630 --> 01:35.370
yes we do have the central bus but we access it from all over our application,

01:35.370 --> 01:42.710
hence it's really hard for us to see in hindsight when we made which change in which place.

01:42.750 --> 01:47.190
So yeah it's better, it might be all you need for medium sized applications,

01:47.190 --> 01:49.850
there's nothing wrong, it's a perfectly valid tool

01:49.950 --> 01:56.220
but for large applications, it might not be the best tool. For large applications really might

01:56.220 --> 02:02.440
want a different set up where we have a unique or a central place where we store everything

02:02.520 --> 02:09.240
but then also some specific places where we define our ways to change data, to get the data, so really that

02:09.240 --> 02:15.750
we have a clear separation of concerns here and can therefore easily track when we made which change

02:15.840 --> 02:19.830
and so on. Vuex, what this module is about

02:19.950 --> 02:21.550
will offer us such a pattern,

02:21.570 --> 02:22.900
so let's have a look at it.
