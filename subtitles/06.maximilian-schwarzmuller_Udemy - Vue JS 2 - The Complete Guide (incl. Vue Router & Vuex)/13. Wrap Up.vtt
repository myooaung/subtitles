With that, we learned a lot about forms in this module. We learned how to use all the default html controls,

00:06.770 --> 00:13.170
how to use v-model to set their data and to extract the data, how to use modifiers to really

00:13.170 --> 00:15.050
fine tune it to our needs.

00:15.060 --> 00:20.340
We also had a look at how to create our own control with our own component and how such a component has

00:20.340 --> 00:26.390
to look like to be used as a form control by vuejs's v-model.

00:26.390 --> 00:32.190
With that, we had a look at all the key things you need to work with that form. You can then go from the

00:32.190 --> 00:37.000
submitted method to evaluate the input and use it in your application.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.100
With that let's move on to some other features vuejs offers us.
