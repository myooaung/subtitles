Thus far we only had a look at how to animate single items.

00:05.190 --> 00:11.250
Yes we had transition between multiple items but in the end, we only saw one element. Now in lists which

00:11.250 --> 00:13.260
aren't that uncommon to be animated,

00:13.380 --> 00:18.660
you have multiple items at once or you might have different collections on your page where you want

00:18.660 --> 00:23.860
to have multiple animations at once or multiple items which can be animated at once at least.

00:24.240 --> 00:30.240
So we might have such a list and we want to animate the removal of an item as well as the addition

00:30.240 --> 00:31.500
of a new item

00:31.680 --> 00:38.280
and we can do this with transition group which is another component or such a wrapper vuejs ships

00:38.280 --> 00:39.800
with. Just like transition

00:39.810 --> 00:41.480
but now for multiple items.
