So now that we learned a lot about filters and mixins, it's time to practice it.

00:07.350 --> 00:10.580
I got four little exercises for you, in the first exercise,

00:10.870 --> 00:18.550
I want you to build your local filter, your own local filter which reverses any text it filters. In the

00:18.550 --> 00:19.620
second exercise,

00:19.630 --> 00:25.360
I want you to build a global filter which then counts the length of a word and then appends it to

00:25.360 --> 00:28.900
the end of it, like this, you have a paragraph where you output test,

00:28.900 --> 00:31.030
let's say then I want to filter it,

00:31.030 --> 00:37.950
so tests gets transformed to test whitespace and in parentheses the length of this word. In exercise number

00:37.960 --> 00:41.060
three, I want you to repeat exercises 1 and 2

00:41.070 --> 00:47.080
but now with computed properties so that you see how you can also solve that without filters. In exercise

00:47.080 --> 00:52.350
number four, I want you to share the computed property you build for exercise two,

00:52.660 --> 01:00.070
so the global filter which now is a computed property due to exercise three, to share it via mixin.

01:00.640 --> 01:01.600
Well with that,

01:01.720 --> 01:03.100
I wish you good luck with that.

01:03.100 --> 01:06.170
See you in the next video where I will show you my solution.
