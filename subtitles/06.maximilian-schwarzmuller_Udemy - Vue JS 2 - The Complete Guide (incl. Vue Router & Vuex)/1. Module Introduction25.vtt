00:01.490 --> 00:07.490
In the last modules, we learned a lot about the basics of components and about using state or data in components,

00:07.790 --> 00:11.350
how to transfer data from one component to another component

00:11.480 --> 00:16.790
be that in a parent, child or in a sibling relation. In this module,

00:16.820 --> 00:23.320
I want to dive deeper into some advanced topics regarding components or some additional features

00:23.330 --> 00:29.210
we basically have when using components, so that after this module, we're in a position to conveniently

00:29.210 --> 00:34.620
use them and really use their full power, all the features they offer us.

00:34.670 --> 00:35.610
So let's dive in.
