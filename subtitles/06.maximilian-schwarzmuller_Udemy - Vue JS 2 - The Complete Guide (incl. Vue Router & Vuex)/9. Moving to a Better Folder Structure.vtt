00:02.010 --> 00:09.330
So in the exercise of which you see the solution here, I set up some selectors here registered locally

00:09.330 --> 00:14.610
in my app.vue file and I get all these files in the source folder.

00:14.610 --> 00:19.530
Now these are two things I want to talk about now and restructure that and show you which options you

00:19.530 --> 00:20.850
have regarding that,

00:21.000 --> 00:25.920
let's start with the structure. Having all these component files in your source folder

00:26.100 --> 00:30.180
will make it quickly very crowded and hard to manage,

00:30.180 --> 00:36.300
therefore you want to create a sub-directory and you could name it components to store your components

00:36.300 --> 00:36.890
there.

00:37.050 --> 00:43.650
So now we can grab all these sub-components, copy them over there and of course you need to adjust your

00:43.650 --> 00:48.330
imports in the app.vue file then and link to components

00:48.330 --> 00:49.500
and then this file,

00:49.530 --> 00:56.070
so throw in this extra components folder. That is one possible set up which is great for small to medium

00:56.070 --> 00:59.300
sized applications, for bigger applications,

00:59.310 --> 01:03.300
you probably want to structure your folders by feature.

01:03.600 --> 01:09.990
So then you wouldn't have a components folder, instead you would have let's say a shared folder for

01:09.990 --> 01:15.780
header and footer which are shared across multiple features maybe and then a servers folder for your

01:15.780 --> 01:17.900
server related components.

01:17.910 --> 01:23.400
I'm not doing that here but you will see me do that in later stages of this course when we build bigger

01:23.400 --> 01:24.740
applications

01:24.900 --> 01:30.720
because again, this is a good practice and this will make it easier to find the file you are looking

01:30.720 --> 01:33.810
for because with only using a components folder,

01:33.840 --> 01:37.050
well that folder can get crowded pretty much soon too,

01:37.050 --> 01:43.530
so therefore it then makes sense to have feature folders. Until we reach such bigger applications which

01:43.530 --> 01:45.750
use other things than just components,

01:45.870 --> 01:50.600
it's of course a fine solution to create sub-folders in the components folder,

01:50.700 --> 01:59.040
so maybe like a server folder and then let's say a shared folder to now copy footer and header to shared

01:59.040 --> 02:02.680
in there and then the other two in the server folder.

02:02.700 --> 02:07.890
Again that's also a nice solution for very big applications where you not only have components but

02:07.890 --> 02:13.500
some other things we will learn about, you might remove the components folder and just work with shared

02:13.500 --> 02:19.430
folders where you then have several sub-folders for different pieces like components and other things.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.670
So with these adjustments in place,

02:21.690 --> 02:29.640
I of course need to add this new folder, so shared for the header and footer and then server for

02:29.640 --> 02:33.670
the server and the server details here.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.630
So let me quickly do that here

02:35.760 --> 02:40.680
and with that, we restructured this to make it more flexible for bigger projects.
