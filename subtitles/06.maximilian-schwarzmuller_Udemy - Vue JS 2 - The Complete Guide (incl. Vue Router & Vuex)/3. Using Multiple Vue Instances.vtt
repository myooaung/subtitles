Let's first focus on using multiple instances. Here we get this div with the ID app,

00:08.310 --> 00:17.360
now the simplest thing is to simply copy this div and create a new one named app2 and let's rename the first

00:17.360 --> 00:25.050
one to app1, I'll rename the selector here the element tagged, the element property therefore here to app1

00:25.070 --> 00:32.660
or change it to app1 and then I can simply scroll down and create a new vue instance below the

00:32.660 --> 00:33.510
first one,

00:33.590 --> 00:36.110
so this is in normal javascript code

00:36.350 --> 00:41.250
and here I set up this el selector selecting app2 with the hash tag

00:41.690 --> 00:47.290
and now on app2, I'll delete everything but the title to just show that it works,

00:47.330 --> 00:55.190
I'll set up a new data property on my new instance and there, I will save this title, the second instance.

00:55.460 --> 00:57.470
If I now hit control enter,

00:57.590 --> 01:00.300
we see the second instance on the right too

01:00.350 --> 01:07.060
so it's perfectly fine to control multiple pieces on your page with multiple instances.

01:07.070 --> 01:13.790
Be aware though that of course inside of an instance, you can only access the properties of that specific

01:13.790 --> 01:15.710
instance with the this keyword,

01:15.920 --> 01:22.850
so in the first instance here, if I access this title here, this of course will always refer to the title

01:22.850 --> 01:28.590
in the data property of this instance here and not to the title in the second instance.

01:28.790 --> 01:31.360
There is no connection between the two instances,

01:31.370 --> 01:38.040
these are two separate kind of vuejs apps if you want to call them or basically just different

01:38.140 --> 01:42.590
vuejs instances controlling different parts of your dom.

01:42.590 --> 01:49.250
It's perfectly fine to use this set up and actually, you will see this in real applications where you

01:49.250 --> 01:55.070
don't want to create a complex single page application using vuejs but only want to throw in some

01:55.080 --> 02:00.620
widgets let's say. Let's say you want to create your own calendar widget, then you could place your

02:00.620 --> 02:06.860
calendar named div ID equals calendar and control it with vuejs. And then you might on the same page

02:07.070 --> 02:08.780
have another widget where

02:08.780 --> 02:13.970
for example you have some tabs to click through and display different content and you could create a

02:13.970 --> 02:15.640
new vue instance for this,

02:15.770 --> 02:17.290
so that is perfectly fine.

02:17.300 --> 02:23.960
You may have multiple vue instances for different tasks as long and this is the key, as long as there is no

02:23.960 --> 02:31.100
connection between them. If you need to call the function from one instance, from another instance, while

02:31.100 --> 02:37.790
we will soon see that there technically will be a possiblility to do so, I recommend putting it all

02:37.790 --> 02:43.600
into one instance because well it seems to belong together from a business logic perspective anyways,

02:43.620 --> 02:44.240
right?

02:44.450 --> 02:49.700
But if that's not the case, you're perfectly fine to use multiple instances just like that.
