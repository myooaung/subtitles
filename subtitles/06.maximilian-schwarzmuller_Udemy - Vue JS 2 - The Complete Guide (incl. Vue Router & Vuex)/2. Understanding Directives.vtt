00:01.680 --> 00:05.130
Well I'm back in my editor and this is a brand new project,

00:05.130 --> 00:10.560
the only thing I did again is I imported bootstrap here to get some basic styling and I set up some columns

00:10.560 --> 00:10.790
here 

00:10.800 --> 00:12.980
but besides that, that's all it did

00:13.190 --> 00:21.300
and there, I first want to look at some built-in directives vuejs ships with. Now we already know a lot

00:21.300 --> 00:29.570
of them like v-if, v-for, v-bind. Directives are generally always identified like this,

00:29.580 --> 00:34.160
you have to v at the beginning and the minus and then the name of the directive,

00:34.170 --> 00:37.230
so the v- part is not part of the directive name,

00:37.290 --> 00:43.100
that just tells vuejs that this is not a normal attribute, a normal html attribute it should ignore

00:43.230 --> 00:46.010
but instead that this is a directive it should handle.

00:46.170 --> 00:51.540
So the name follows after v- and then we could have some, for example the text directive,

00:51.540 --> 00:57.480
that's a built-in one. Text directive takes a string therefore, the single quotation marks between

00:57.480 --> 01:02.130
the outer quotation marks which only mark the javascript expression I now entered there

01:02.250 --> 01:04.320
and here I could output some text.

01:04.320 --> 01:09.040
So now after saving this, we should see some text here

01:09.080 --> 01:13.910
even though I didn't enter anything between the opening and closing paragraph tag just by using

01:13.910 --> 01:22.360
v-text. I can also duplicate this to use v-html to output some html code,

01:22.390 --> 01:24.600
so that's also a string

01:24.730 --> 01:32.130
but now we could use these strong tag and close it of course and there, we could output some strong text.

01:32.130 --> 01:35.200
Now if I save this and go to my app, you see it's bold.

01:35.200 --> 01:40.570
Be careful when using this directive, you should sanitize your output to make sure you're not getting

01:40.570 --> 01:46.420
a victim of cross-site scripting attacks because you can output html code there

01:46.420 --> 01:49.200
and that of course could also be malicious script tags,

01:49.210 --> 01:51.360
so that's something to watch out for.

01:51.370 --> 01:52.700
These are built-in directives,

01:52.720 --> 01:53.650
important thing,

01:53.710 --> 01:59.290
you identify them by having the v- at the beginning, not just built-in ones, directives in general,

01:59.410 --> 02:01.510
now let's build our own directives.

02:01.840 --> 02:05.470
So here I will simply add a horizontal line and then copy this whole row

02:05.500 --> 02:10.800
because now here, I want to set up some custom directives I'll use.

02:10.900 --> 02:15.640
Now I'll be able to build a simple custom directive which shows us how to generally use them and which

02:15.640 --> 02:21.460
feature such a directive has, let's say I have a paragraph with some text where I say color this

02:21.490 --> 02:28.750
and my goal is to add a directive which gives this some coloring, so some background color for example.

02:29.180 --> 02:33.910
Of course I could use a simple style for this like background color and then set the color

02:34.090 --> 02:39.310
but here I want to show how a directive works and coloring it, highlighting it, is actually a great use

02:39.310 --> 02:44.620
case because it shows many of the features a directive offers us or we can implement in a custom directive,

02:44.620 --> 02:45.480
I should say.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.900
So how do we create such a directive?

02:48.100 --> 02:50.250
Well we get two options of doing so,

02:50.320 --> 02:57.730
the first one is to register it globally just like with components, we can use vue and then the directive

02:57.730 --> 03:03.990
like this, here the first argument is the selector, the name of the directive

03:04.880 --> 03:07.170
and that is without the v- thing,

03:07.370 --> 03:14.600
so here we could have highlight. This will create a global directive called highlight which we then

03:14.600 --> 03:18.600
use by adding v-highlight to an element.

03:18.620 --> 03:22.410
So v- is always needed to inform vuejs that this is a directive,

03:22.520 --> 03:28.790
the name then is just the part without the v-. And then the second argument is the object configuring

03:28.790 --> 03:29.920
the directive,

03:29.930 --> 03:32.180
now how do we configure such a directive?
