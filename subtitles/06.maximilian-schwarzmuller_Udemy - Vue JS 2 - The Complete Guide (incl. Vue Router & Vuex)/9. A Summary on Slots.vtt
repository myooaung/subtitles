That was a lot about slots. Slots help you to distribute your content in other components.

00:07.910 --> 00:15.120
It's especially useful if you want to build reusable widgets, let's say like a slideshow where you have

00:15.130 --> 00:21.470
the frame for each slide and then you want to switch between slides and each slide might have its individual

00:21.480 --> 00:28.640
html code layout but you want to use the same frame. Well for that, you could use slots to make sure the

00:28.640 --> 00:34.760
content you want to pass into that frame, your html layout is distributed exactly the way

00:34.820 --> 00:38.720
you want to distribute inside of your slideshow frame component.

00:38.870 --> 00:40.780
So that would be an example use case

00:40.910 --> 00:43.040
and here you learned how to use slots.
