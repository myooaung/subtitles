00:01.690 --> 00:08.320
Almost done, we learned a lot about vuejs throughout this course. A lot about its basics,

00:08.330 --> 00:13.570
its syntax, its usage and the different pieces or the different features

00:13.570 --> 00:21.250
it offers us. Now in the last module when we had a look at routing, we really made a major step towards

00:21.250 --> 00:27.280
building large applications with vuejs or single page applications to begin with but that also

00:27.280 --> 00:29.640
tend to be rather big applications.

00:29.860 --> 00:37.300
Now if we talk about bigger applications, there's one additional thing we haven't discussed yet, that

00:37.300 --> 00:39.730
is a better way of state management.

00:39.730 --> 00:46.300
We touched on state management in other modules when we used custom events to pass data from a child

00:46.300 --> 00:52.680
to a parent component or props to do it the other way or when we used the event bus. In this module,

00:52.690 --> 00:58.600
we'll learn about yet another possibility of managing our state, one which is especially suited for

00:58.660 --> 01:04.410
bigger applications where all the other ways will give you some problems sooner or later.

01:04.480 --> 01:10.150
So let's have a look at this pattern or this state management system which is called vuex.
