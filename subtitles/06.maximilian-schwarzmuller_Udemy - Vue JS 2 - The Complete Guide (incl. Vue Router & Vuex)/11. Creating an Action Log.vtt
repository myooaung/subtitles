To manage some log here or create this log, I'll add a new property to this data object,

00:09.050 --> 00:16.630
I'll name it turns because I want to store the separate turns of the game there and then log them to

00:16.630 --> 00:20.070
this page, to this area I set up for this.

00:20.510 --> 00:23.800
So how should turns get updated?

00:23.900 --> 00:27.900
How do we want to manage our turns?

00:28.190 --> 00:34.870
Now if we attack for example, then I want to push a new turn on this turns array.

00:35.150 --> 00:44.720
So here after attacks, I want to add a new turn so I can say this.turns and I don't want to push it

00:44.720 --> 00:47.160
actually, I don't want to add it at the end,

00:47.180 --> 00:49.940
let's say I want to add it at the beginning.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.360
The opposite of pushed is unshift

00:52.370 --> 00:58.780
so this adds this turn as the first item in the array and shifts all other items one element to the right,

00:58.790 --> 01:05.960
so to say. So I want to unshift a new item on this turn array, this should be an

01:06.170 --> 01:11.330
object where I determine if it is the player who did this turn,

01:11.330 --> 01:15.380
I'll set this to true here and then some text.

01:15.380 --> 01:22.710
Now the text should be what we did and how much damage we dealt or for how much we healed,

01:22.910 --> 01:32.660
so here we could say player hits monster for and then here the value should be the damage,

01:32.660 --> 01:37.040
now for that I need to store the damage in a separate variable,

01:37.040 --> 01:44.320
I can't use it like this anymore, so let's simply use a separate variable here to have the damage I dealt

01:44.360 --> 01:48.160
here and this should store this in this

01:48.180 --> 01:50.240
turns array.

01:50.280 --> 01:56.330
Now let's see if this works and we'll have to fine tune this little bit later

01:56.340 --> 02:02.990
but for now let's also add it for the monster, in the monster attacks array here.

02:03.000 --> 02:12.870
Here we want to say monster hits player for and also store the damage here in a separate variable so that

02:12.900 --> 02:16.190
we log the correct damage here,

02:16.320 --> 02:20.600
we clearly can't call this.calculateDamage down there again,

02:20.610 --> 02:24.630
we would get a new random number, and of course this is not the player

02:24.630 --> 02:26.920
so let's set it to false.

02:27.060 --> 02:31.440
With this set up, we are adding items to our array,

02:31.440 --> 02:36.740
now we also want to print this array in the index.html file so that we can see it.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.980
So let's do this in the next video.
