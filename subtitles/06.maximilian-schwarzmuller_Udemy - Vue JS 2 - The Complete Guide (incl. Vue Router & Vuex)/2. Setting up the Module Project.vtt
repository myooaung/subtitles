I am in an empty project again, using bootstraps so again using this CDN here in the index.html file

00:08.570 --> 00:17.470
and here I want to mainly introduce two new features components have. Imagine the following case,

00:17.630 --> 00:23.830
let's create a new component in this folder, in this project so I'll create a new components folder first

00:23.840 --> 00:28.440
of all and then the component I want to create will be called quote

00:28.760 --> 00:31.850
and that is just an example, pick any name you want.

00:31.850 --> 00:36.210
Now in this quote component, I want to use that inside of this column here

00:36.410 --> 00:43.660
so all I want to have here is of course such a typical single template file here,

00:44.000 --> 00:50.870
so with my template and my script and some styles because I'll use some styles and in the template, I

00:50.870 --> 00:56.370
want to have a wrapping div and inside of the div, I want to have a quote.

00:56.630 --> 01:03.990
So let's have a wonderful quote here and maybe wrap that in a paragraph, that's even better.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.600
So this is a basic setup,

01:06.600 --> 01:13.470
now I want to give this some styling so I want to scope the styles to the template here so that it only

01:13.470 --> 01:14.490
applies here

01:14.670 --> 01:23.660
and then this div shall get a border of one pixel solid and then some light gray border,

01:23.700 --> 01:32.130
this one here and I want to give it some box-shadow where I basically give it a box shadow of one

01:32.130 --> 01:34.270
pixel, one pixel,

01:34.320 --> 01:42.750
let's say two pixels and black, let's see how that looks and a padding of thirty pixels

01:43.670 --> 01:49.150
and finally, I also want to set the margin to auto to center this.

01:49.260 --> 01:56.160
Now with this styling scoped to this quote here, I can now of course use it, so I'll again register it locally

01:56.160 --> 01:56.640
here,

01:56.640 --> 02:00.370
I could register it globally but I don't want to, I'll name it app

02:00.410 --> 02:02.990
quote and add my quote here.

02:03.120 --> 02:09.680
Now for that to work, of course I need to import quote first so import quote from components and then the

02:09.700 --> 02:15.420
quote.vue file and with this, I can here use app quote like that.

02:15.420 --> 02:20.720
Now if I save this, this is how it is how it looks like, almost how I want it to have,

02:20.940 --> 02:27.450
let's also add a top and bottom margin of thrity pixels to that and only have the left and right

02:27.570 --> 02:34.380
set to auto to center it and I want to set the text alignment to center,

02:34.380 --> 02:35.260
I forgot that.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.950
So with that, I got a wonderful quote,

02:37.980 --> 02:40.900
well while not super wonderful but it's okay.

02:41.400 --> 02:46.560
Now the thing is I want to dynamically set this content from outside,

02:46.560 --> 02:49.220
so from the parent component. I could do this with

02:49.230 --> 02:54.310
props, I could pass props to that quote and therefore pass the text

02:54.320 --> 02:55.500
this quote would have.

02:55.710 --> 02:58.270
So let's simulate these with props first.
