00:01.810 --> 00:03.460
Well we really achieved a lot, 

00:03.460 --> 00:06.080
it was quite a long module, quite a big project.

00:06.100 --> 00:09.580
Some errors were made but I think that's not too bad,

00:09.580 --> 00:15.790
I left them in intentionally because that is where you can also learn a lot because you see some of the tiny

00:15.790 --> 00:22.590
little mistakes you make here and there which really can take some time but which are having a big impact

00:22.600 --> 00:24.760
even though they might look tiny in one place.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.380
Anyways it's a great project we built here,

00:27.400 --> 00:30.370
it uses many of the things we learn throughout this course,

00:30.370 --> 00:36.680
animation, routing, vuex, if statements, lists, conditionals and much more,

00:36.700 --> 00:39.490
so really, a lot of the vuejs features.

00:39.490 --> 00:42.400
Of course it doesn't use every single feature,

00:42.400 --> 00:48.190
of course there are no nested routes for example because it's pretty impossible to create such a big

00:48.190 --> 00:53.610
project and then still make it work in a course, this project is already pretty long.

00:53.650 --> 00:55.480
It's a challenge for you though,

00:55.570 --> 00:58.060
Set your own project, set your own goals,

00:58.060 --> 01:04.530
look at some popular web apps and try rebuilding them with vuejs, with the tools you learned here,

01:04.720 --> 01:08.860
that's something no one can teach you but how you will learn the most.

01:09.010 --> 01:12.770
And with that, I really can say I hope you enjoyed it

01:13.030 --> 01:14.800
and we're not done yet,

01:14.830 --> 01:19.670
we still have to have a look at how we can deploy this project in the next course.
