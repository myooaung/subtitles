00:01.870 --> 00:05.090
So we've played around with routing quite a bit here, now

00:05.110 --> 00:07.400
one case we haven't covered is the following,

00:07.540 --> 00:13.090
what if the user enters anything here which is not covered by the app?

00:13.180 --> 00:16.510
Well we don't see an error here but we also don't see a fitting page,

00:16.570 --> 00:23.140
so we want to redirect in some cases especially in cases like this where any route not covered by our

00:23.140 --> 00:24.570
router is entered.

00:24.930 --> 00:31.790
Well the two things work together well here but you can of course also redirect on any specific path,

00:31.990 --> 00:35.450
so let me first show this, I'll add a new route here

00:35.500 --> 00:39.060
at the end so that my more specific paths come first

00:39.070 --> 00:44.090
and here, I'll set up a path of redirect me, like this

00:44.350 --> 00:48.490
and I want to set up a redirection. So I'm not going to load a component here,

00:48.700 --> 00:52.290
instead what I will do here is I'll add the redirect key,

00:52.300 --> 00:56.780
this allows me to specify a path to which I should redirect the user.

00:56.980 --> 01:02.800
So here let's say we want to redirect to just user, so I specify the path as a string here

01:02.800 --> 01:09.010
and with that, we should have an application where if I visit it /redirect-me, I should add a slash

01:09.010 --> 01:09.930
therefore here,

01:10.030 --> 01:15.930
if I visit /redirect-me, we're redirected to /user. And so let's try this out,

01:15.940 --> 01:20.340
let's go to /redirect-me and we're back to /user,

01:20.400 --> 01:22.120
this is how we can redirect.

01:22.300 --> 01:30.850
You can also specify an object here to again use a named route for example to go to user edit for

01:30.850 --> 01:36.500
example and then pass some parameters or you go to home for example, like this.

01:36.580 --> 01:39.270
So you can specify the normal object

01:39.310 --> 01:47.380
you also used in your router link or here for pushing when navigating in code. This is the normal object

01:47.380 --> 01:52.540
for setting up a route you want to navigate to and you can use that for redirecting too.

01:52.840 --> 01:59.290
So this is how we can redirect the user and make sure we're navigating him where we want him to be

01:59.290 --> 02:04.940
navigated but we're not covering the case that I enter anything in here.

02:05.020 --> 02:10.680
Now in order to be able to handle such routes, we'll have at a different set up in the next video.
