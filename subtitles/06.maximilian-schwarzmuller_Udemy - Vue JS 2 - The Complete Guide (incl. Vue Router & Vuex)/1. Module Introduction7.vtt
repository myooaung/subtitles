00:01.860 --> 00:07.650
We're already a good chunk through the course, you learned a lot about vuejs, about its different features,

00:07.830 --> 00:12.030
how to enhance with animations, how to use components and much more.

00:12.030 --> 00:13.950
Now we're nearing the end though,

00:14.190 --> 00:21.420
whilst that is true time wise, there are big important chunks of features vuejs offers years

00:21.750 --> 00:22.430
to come.

00:22.440 --> 00:27.210
For example http, until now we were contained in our application,

00:27.210 --> 00:32.130
we weren't able to reach out to a server, though typically in a lot of applications,

00:32.130 --> 00:34.730
you from time to time need to reach out to a server,

00:34.740 --> 00:40.410
you need to fetch some resources, you need to fetch some data or store some data there, especially when

00:40.410 --> 00:46.200
building single page applications, something we'll really dive into in the next modules, in the last

00:46.200 --> 00:52.050
modules of this course especially when doing that but not limited to this use case, you oftentimes need to

00:52.050 --> 00:53.560
make such requests.

00:53.640 --> 00:58.590
Now a lot of the requests you do make, all requests in single page applications as a side note but a

00:58.590 --> 01:03.500
lot of requests in the normal server side application may want to be done

01:03.510 --> 01:09.390
via ajax, which means in the background, behind the scenes, you don't necessarily want to send the

01:09.390 --> 01:16.230
request and get back a new page, you want to stay on the current page and only reload parts of it or reload

01:16.230 --> 01:21.720
some data or store some data whilst keeping the user on the page and not reloading it in the browser

01:21.870 --> 01:23.760
or navigating to another one.

01:23.760 --> 01:28.530
This is especially true for a single page applications where the whole purpose is to stay on one single

01:28.530 --> 01:28.970
page

01:29.220 --> 01:31.470
but it's true for other applications too.

01:31.500 --> 01:38.960
Therefore in this module, we will dive into how we can use http or how we can access the web from

01:39.190 --> 01:39.780
vuejs.
