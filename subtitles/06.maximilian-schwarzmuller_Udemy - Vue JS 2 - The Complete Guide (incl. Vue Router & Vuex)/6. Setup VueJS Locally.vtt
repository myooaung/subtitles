00:02.230 --> 00:07.030
In the first course section here, I will use JSFiddle because it allows me to really focus on the

00:07.030 --> 00:12.010
core things I want to bring to you and that allows you to easily follow along.

00:12.280 --> 00:18.020
Now maybe you don't want to use it or you want to use a local setup right from the beginning.

00:18.280 --> 00:21.950
Well we will have a look at the real workflow later in the course.

00:22.060 --> 00:27.460
But if you want to start locally, that is of course possible too. Simply head to the installation page

00:27.460 --> 00:28.720
of Vue.js.

00:28.930 --> 00:32.410
And there you can also download Vue.js to use it locally.

00:32.530 --> 00:37.450
Now for a production-ready app you would of course choose the production version but for development you

00:37.450 --> 00:40.940
should use the development version which gives you some extra warnings and errors.

00:41.110 --> 00:47.130
While you can simply download this and store it in some folder, I prepared one here, this vue.js file. And

00:47.130 --> 00:50.080
with that you've got your files stored here.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.530
Then you want to open up your favorite editor. This could be Sublime; could be Atom.

00:53.550 --> 00:58.990
You will find a list of some example editors in the last lecture of this module. And there you probably

00:58.990 --> 01:00.920
want to set up your favorite

01:00.940 --> 01:05.530
(or not your favorite but default) HTML5 skeleton like this.

01:05.980 --> 01:11.890
And then of course we have to go to JSFiddle, copy all the HTML code and paste it in the body

01:11.890 --> 01:13.040
section, though

01:13.090 --> 01:14.870
we can remove the script import.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.590
We will use our local file for that,

01:16.600 --> 01:19.370
so let's add a script import in the head section;

01:19.380 --> 01:22.760
I need a src of course pointing to the vue.js file.

01:23.020 --> 01:30.030
And we also need our script down here so let's copy that too and then add a script tag below our div,

01:30.040 --> 01:35.210
remove the src="" here, add this and with that if you now save this,

01:35.320 --> 01:40.300
let's say as index.html in the same folder where the vue.js file lives,

01:40.540 --> 01:44.330
you can simply double-click on it to the view it in the browser here.

01:44.410 --> 01:48.700
And of course here if you type something it should work as in JSFiddle and this is how you could

01:48.700 --> 01:50.220
follow along locally.

01:50.230 --> 01:56.260
Again a more complex workflow will be set up later, but with that, you can get started and I'd say let's

01:56.260 --> 02:00.850
now start diving deeper into Vue.js in the next course module.
