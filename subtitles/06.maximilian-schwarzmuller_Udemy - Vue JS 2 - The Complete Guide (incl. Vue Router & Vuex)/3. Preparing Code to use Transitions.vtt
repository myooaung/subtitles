I'm in a new project which looks like this is the browser at the beginning and then the project itself

00:06.540 --> 00:11.760
is basically app.vue file which is pretty empty, just get the bootstrap container row and column

00:11.760 --> 00:15.830
set up here and an empty object which doesn't return any data yet.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.800
And well all the other files are pretty empty as well,

00:18.810 --> 00:22.640
just import it bootstrap here in the index.html file.

00:22.830 --> 00:24.300
So this is what I'll start with

00:24.390 --> 00:31.380
and the goal now is to show this simple case of adding an element to the dom, we learned that before and

00:31.380 --> 00:32.420
then animating it,

00:32.430 --> 00:39.270
so let's add an element first. I'll add a new let's say horizontal line here first and thereafter, I

00:39.270 --> 00:44.270
want to have a button with classes button and button primary to give it some styling where we can say

00:44.760 --> 00:46.400
show alert

00:46.400 --> 00:51.660
and I want to show such a bootstrap alert, so using this css class the bootstrap framework offers

00:51.750 --> 00:53.170
me which is alert

00:53.190 --> 00:57.740
and then let's say it's an info alert, like this, this is some info.

00:57.750 --> 01:02.670
Now if we have a look at this in the application, this is what it will look like if it's always attached,

01:03.150 --> 01:05.430
something a bit too close to the button for my tastes,

01:05.430 --> 01:07.210
let me add some other line breaks here.

01:07.410 --> 01:08.630
So that is what it should look like,

01:08.640 --> 01:14.440
now I want to show this alert conditionally and we learned how to do that. In order to show it conditionally,

01:14.490 --> 01:19.760
I will add a new property named show and I'll set it to false initially to not show it

01:20.160 --> 01:25.830
and then on this alert div, I will simply add v-if, I could also use v-show, that is also animateable

01:25.890 --> 01:28.890
as you will learn. So I will use v-if here

01:29.010 --> 01:30.050
and then I will check

01:30.050 --> 01:36.570
show and on this button therefore, I will set a click listener or add a click listener where I simply

01:36.570 --> 01:38.780
set show to what it currently is not,

01:38.820 --> 01:43.250
so to toggle it, if it's true it will be set to false and the other way around.

01:43.260 --> 01:49.440
Now if we save this and have a look at this application, we can now show the alert like this,

01:49.440 --> 01:50.040
this is nice,

01:50.040 --> 01:53.060
this is what we learned before and this is also not animated,

01:53.220 --> 01:54.790
so we should change this.

01:54.930 --> 02:02.250
And as I showed you on the slides before, we can change this by simply wrapping this div in this transition

02:02.250 --> 02:04.830
component here vuejs offers us,

02:04.990 --> 02:13.290
this is a special component which we can use to animate anything which is between the opening and closing

02:13.290 --> 02:13.820
tag.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.190
Important here,

02:15.540 --> 02:18.840
you can only animate one element with transition,

02:18.840 --> 02:24.370
now you can have multiple elements inside of this transition component, like this

02:24.510 --> 02:28.560
but then the conditions of these elements have to alternate.

02:28.620 --> 02:31.940
You cannot animate a list in there let's say, you cannot

02:31.940 --> 02:38.370
animate the addition or deletion of list items, you can have multiple elements in here to transition

02:38.370 --> 02:41.500
between them but you can only show one at a time.

02:41.520 --> 02:46.460
So doing this here will instantly give me an error in the console

02:48.080 --> 02:54.170
as you can see because we only may use it for a single element and should use another element, we

02:54.170 --> 02:55.060
will learn about later,

02:55.070 --> 02:56.640
you see it here later.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.340
So let me remove this,

02:58.520 --> 03:05.750
now as you could see, if I put it or if I use one element this is shown but it's still not animated yet.

03:05.780 --> 03:08.920
So how do we animate it with this transition element?
