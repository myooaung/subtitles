00:02.060 --> 00:06.490
So we're adding actions, turns to this turns array,

00:06.620 --> 00:08.400
we want to output this on our page

00:08.400 --> 00:12.200
now because having it in the code alone doesn't do that much.

00:12.290 --> 00:20.840
So in the index.html page, I'll go to this logs area where I have list item and now the way to output

00:20.930 --> 00:27.950
data which is an array or which is a list is of course to use the v-for directive vuejs offers us.

00:28.330 --> 00:35.360
With that directive, we can loop through all items in an array for example by running turn in turns,

00:35.600 --> 00:36.110
here

00:36.110 --> 00:43.050
turns of course refers to my turns data field or property here in this data object

00:43.340 --> 00:49.210
and turn is a name of my choice, so I can name this whatever I like.

00:49.220 --> 00:54.890
Now that I loop through that, I can output it here with string interpolation by saying turn and then

00:54.890 --> 01:01.410
accessing text which I know will be available since we pass some text here

01:01.460 --> 01:07.780
for example, when we create a new entry in the log. With this, let's save it and reload

01:07.970 --> 01:11.740
and if I now start a game and attack, we see that this works.

01:11.780 --> 01:17.630
It could use some improved styling and also for other attacks, it only works regarding the monster

01:17.630 --> 01:24.170
damage because we're not logging the user damage yet but we can see that outputting it in a list here clearly

01:24.170 --> 01:30.870
works. Though if we restart we see that we get this empty box here even though the log is empty,

01:31.070 --> 01:37.850
so it would be nice in the index.html code to only show this section if we actually do have entries in

01:37.850 --> 01:39.980
the log. To do that,

01:39.980 --> 01:46.850
I'll add the v-if directive here to only conditionally attached this html section and all its children

01:47.150 --> 01:52.070
to the dom and the condition I want to check is if turns.length,

01:52.070 --> 01:59.370
so if this array has a length greater than zero. If not then it is empty, then I don't want to attach

01:59.390 --> 02:01.960
this section because I don't want to show the log

02:01.970 --> 02:07.580
then. With this, let's save and reload, you see the box is gone

02:07.700 --> 02:11.160
but as soon as I attack, it's back and we're seeing the log.

02:11.420 --> 02:17.560
Well next let's finish it by hooking up the other buttons and improving the styling here a little bit.
