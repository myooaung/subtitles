00:01.850 --> 00:06.350
Time for another exercise, this time about styles and classes.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.970
We learned about them in the last lectures,

00:08.970 --> 00:15.070
now it's time to really work on them yourselves so that you get comfortable using them.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.840
Here's the setup I'm using,

00:17.040 --> 00:19.830
I prepared some styles on the right here,

00:19.830 --> 00:25.230
this affected div which is this div here which basically is a div or a block with a black border

00:25.530 --> 00:27.700
and then a highlight and a shrink class.

00:27.800 --> 00:33.540
We'll need these classes for the very first exercise where I want to start the effect by clicking the

00:33.540 --> 00:36.900
start effect button and what should the effect be?

00:36.900 --> 00:44.410
I want to alternate between highlight and shrink classes on this div and we can alternate by using

00:44.410 --> 00:45.780
the set interval function,

00:45.780 --> 00:52.020
it works kind of as set timeout but whereas set timeout finishes after three seconds, set interval

00:52.020 --> 00:55.940
fires every two seconds, one second, whatever we set up.

00:55.950 --> 01:02.070
So this allows us to then kind of, we can come up with an idea how we could switch these classes and there

01:02.070 --> 01:03.940
might also be more than one way to do that

01:03.940 --> 01:05.820
to be honest.

01:05.820 --> 01:08.640
So this is the first exercise we'll do,

01:08.670 --> 01:15.870
the second exercise then wants you to create a couple of css classes on your own, so be creative,

01:15.900 --> 01:20.400
create whatever you want and attach them to this div here then

01:20.550 --> 01:23.180
via the array syntax, that's important,

01:23.220 --> 01:27.730
so use this array syntax you learned about to attach your css classes here.

01:28.140 --> 01:35.550
Also feel free to mix the different styles of using a property which refers to a class name and maybe

01:35.550 --> 01:41.190
a property which refers to an object where we have the key as a class name and the value which is true

01:41.190 --> 01:45.580
or false which well decides whether this class should be attached.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.200
The third exercise lets the user enter a class,

01:50.200 --> 01:53.690
so you should also create them still so that they are available

01:53.750 --> 02:00.740
but then we want to use this input to, well attach this class. So come up with an idea of how you might

02:00.740 --> 02:07.760
do that, to listen to the user input and then attach the respective class to this div. In the fourth

02:07.760 --> 02:11.390
example, we will still let the user enter class

02:11.420 --> 02:13.670
and I also want to let the user enter

02:13.670 --> 02:16.800
true or false for another class

02:16.820 --> 02:23.930
so that we maybe use this array syntax or the first element might be the class the user enters

02:24.080 --> 02:27.770
and the second one might be a class set up by you

02:27.770 --> 02:31.160
where the user is then only able to switch between true or false,

02:31.180 --> 02:35.930
so that is the next exercise. Here at

02:35.990 --> 02:44.060
number five, I want to repeat the exercise from number three but now with the values for styles instead

02:44.060 --> 02:44.980
of class names,

02:45.020 --> 02:50.810
so the user is still able to enter something here but the something is no longer a class name of a class

02:50.810 --> 02:51.660
you created

02:51.860 --> 02:58.670
but the value of a style you predefined, for example you could just add background color to this div

02:58.970 --> 03:02.240
and let the user set this background color style,

03:02.240 --> 03:08.200
also feel free with playing around with different ways of adding this style to this div

03:08.990 --> 03:11.380
And on exercise number 6,

03:11.420 --> 03:17.510
I want to create a simple progress bar with set interval which fires let's say every half a second

03:17.900 --> 03:22.440
and then the style bindings to increase the width of our progress bar.

03:22.520 --> 03:25.230
We don't have to make that too complicated

03:25.310 --> 03:29.600
but yeah, let's let's try to implement a basic bar here.

03:30.020 --> 03:33.500
These are the exercises, in the next video, I'm going through 

03:33.500 --> 03:40.040
possible solutions so that you can compare your solutions to mine and see if you got stuck anywhere

03:40.130 --> 03:45.550
or if you get up with another idea which obviously can work just fine too.

03:45.560 --> 03:46.560
So I'll see you there.
