00:01.790 --> 00:06.680
We're starting off with this simple form here where we can file a complaint for example, where we

00:06.680 --> 00:12.080
get a couple of input fields and at the bottom, we want to output the data the user entered. At the beginning,

00:12.130 --> 00:15.550
I'll output the data right away so that we can always see what we entered

00:15.710 --> 00:22.040
and thereafter, I will change this such that this data field is only displayed once we hit submit here, this button.

00:22.280 --> 00:28.220
So we'll start hooking up this form step by step, walking our way through all these input fields and

00:28.220 --> 00:30.460
learning about the different options

00:30.830 --> 00:32.850
vuejs forms offer us.

00:33.140 --> 00:37.190
Let's start with the top, with normal text input field,

00:37.190 --> 00:44.630
this email input field. I want to hook this up to a property in my code so that I can see what the user

00:44.630 --> 00:49.370
entered there and use that in my code to validate or whatever I want to do with that,

00:49.370 --> 00:55.850
so I'll start with that. The html representation of this mail input field is this here, it's normal input

00:55.850 --> 00:57.310
field with some bootstrap classes,

00:57.310 --> 01:02.750
overall I do have some bootstrap classes here and you can find this html code attached to this

01:02.750 --> 01:05.060
lecture so that you can start with the same code

01:05.060 --> 01:06.270
I do have here.

01:06.650 --> 01:11.440
Well this input, that is the one I want to hook up to a property in my vue instance,

01:11.630 --> 01:14.990
well right now, my vue instance is an empty object down there.

01:14.990 --> 01:19.890
Notice I'm in the app.vue file but that is a normal setup where I rendered this file, so no components,

01:19.910 --> 01:21.790
just this root instance.

01:22.160 --> 01:27.410
Well in here, I now want to create some, well some properties,

01:27.410 --> 01:32.840
first of all I want to set up the data and I'll use this syntax here where I write it as an ES6

01:32.840 --> 01:38.270
function as it is just a function in the end, we wrote it like this before where we can also well take

01:38.270 --> 01:41.750
the shorter route here and just write that as an ES6 function.

01:41.840 --> 01:42.770
It doesn't change that,

01:42.770 --> 01:45.930
here we return an object which then represents our data.

01:46.160 --> 01:53.420
Now in this object here, I want to have an email property let's say and by default, that shall be empty,

01:53.420 --> 02:00.740
now how do I hook up my html input field here with that property down there in my data field?

02:00.830 --> 02:02.980
We use v-model for that,

02:03.170 --> 02:10.570
so the way to do that is to add v-model, two-way data binding therefore and then simply say email here

02:10.610 --> 02:14.700
since that is the property name it shows down there.

02:14.750 --> 02:21.620
Now you might correctly ask well if it's two-way binding, how do I ensure that I bind the correct direction

02:21.680 --> 02:23.200
so that the user type something

02:23.210 --> 02:28.160
and I update the property and that if I update the property in some other place, let's say I click a button

02:28.160 --> 02:33.800
that should pre-populate this input field, that it does this in this direction and not override

02:33.800 --> 02:37.370
it because the input field already has a value. 

02:37.370 --> 02:41.900
The short answer is vuejs will figure this out automatically,

02:41.900 --> 02:47.980
that might sound kind of magical but basically vuejs simply checks what's the source of the editing.

02:47.990 --> 02:51.470
If we type in the input field, the property, the code will be overwritten,

02:51.590 --> 02:57.480
if we change this property from some other place, let's say by clicking a button, the input in the or the value

02:57.560 --> 02:59.060
in the input will be overwritten,

02:59.060 --> 03:00.490
this is how that works.

03:00.620 --> 03:06.950
Now with the input field being bound, I can now go to my user data at the bottom there and simply output

03:07.020 --> 03:07.460
e-mail

03:07.460 --> 03:09.080
here with string interpolation,

03:09.080 --> 03:15.890
so with these double curly braces. Now after saving this, we'll see that if I head over there, we don't

03:15.890 --> 03:21.500
see a value there but as soon as I enter a test email address, we do see it down there in our data field

03:21.500 --> 03:21.960
too,

03:21.970 --> 03:26.690
this is how easy you can hook up as a normal input field to our property.

03:26.690 --> 03:27.830
We've seen this before,

03:27.830 --> 03:31.880
it's normal two way data binding but that is how you handle forms.

03:31.960 --> 03:38.900
Now of course throughout this model here, I'll dive into other types of form controls as well and also show you which

03:38.900 --> 03:44.080
additional features vuejs offers us when it comes to listening to such inputs.
