00:02.290 --> 00:04.140
We get our finished application,

00:04.140 --> 00:06.940
now we probably also want to deploy it.

00:07.230 --> 00:10.850
So this is the application running in development mode,

00:11.280 --> 00:16.140
now if we have a look at our application here in the editor, this is the terminal where I run this,

00:16.440 --> 00:22.770
we don't only have access to this npm run dev command. If you have a look at the package.json file where all

00:22.770 --> 00:25.750
our scripts we can run through npm are stored

00:25.750 --> 00:31.860
at, we see we're having the dev command which we used all the time but we also have the build command

00:32.190 --> 00:34.650
which runs the production workflow.

00:34.650 --> 00:38.810
So with npm run build, we're not starting a development server,

00:38.940 --> 00:42.850
instead we're preparing the whole project for deployment.

00:43.020 --> 00:48.630
Therefore this process will not keep running, it finishes because no server was started but this will

00:48.630 --> 00:49.880
give us a new folder,

00:49.920 --> 00:57.000
the dist folder which holds our build.js file, the file we will need to deploy together with our

00:57.000 --> 01:01.840
index.html file to make our application work on a server.

01:02.250 --> 01:08.430
Now in this module, I will show you how to prepare your application for deployment

01:08.460 --> 01:10.250
and then finally deploy it.
