00:02.480 --> 00:07.080
In the last lecture we updated our header to only show relevant links,

00:07.080 --> 00:14.580
now I want to add one new link or option to the header, a new list item where we can actually logout.

00:15.420 --> 00:15.810
Here

00:15.810 --> 00:19.700
for that, I'll add a button where I say logout,

00:19.740 --> 00:21.150
we save this,

00:21.150 --> 00:22.910
here we get the logout button.

00:23.040 --> 00:32.760
Now let's quickly give this some styling at least, so I'll add a class, logout here and in my css code

00:32.790 --> 00:42.810
down there for the logout class, I'll set the background color to transparent, set the border

00:44.210 --> 00:55.980
to none, set the font to inherit the default font and the color to white and the cursor to pointer, with

00:56.070 --> 00:57.870
these tiny changes in place,

00:57.870 --> 01:03.860
it now looks like the other links, it doesn't get the hover effect, you could add this but I'll simply move on.

01:04.170 --> 01:07.660
And now if I click logout, I do want to logout of course,

01:07.680 --> 01:14.730
so first of all let's register a click listener with add click and I will execute the on logout method

01:14.730 --> 01:22.510
here. For that, I'll add the methods property to my vue instance and add on logout here,

01:22.530 --> 01:29.400
now here I want to dispatch an action which essentially clears my token and user ID.

01:29.400 --> 01:37.100
So for that, I will add a mutation which I name clear auth data maybe, the name is up to you where I receive

01:37.100 --> 01:47.590
the state and where I simply set state ID token equal to null and where I set state user ID equal to

01:47.600 --> 01:56.650
null. And now with that, the other thing I want to do of course is commit this mutation from some action,

01:57.100 --> 02:04.570
so I'll add a new action maybe right below login but the position doesn't matter where I get commit

02:04.690 --> 02:15.890
extracted from this context object and where I simply commit my new mutation, clear auth data,

02:16.060 --> 02:22.330
so that is what I pass as a string to commit in the logout action and that's all.

02:22.330 --> 02:27.550
Now the only thing I have to do in the header component is on my on logout method,

02:27.730 --> 02:36.100
I will reach out to my store to dispatch and dispatch logout and now we should be able to go back and

02:36.100 --> 02:37.380
if I now reload,

02:39.990 --> 02:43.020
sign in and then click logout,

02:43.020 --> 02:45.510
it actually switches the header UI,

02:45.600 --> 02:49.020
we can also inspect the state in our vue

02:49.530 --> 02:52.890
dev tools and we see that the state was reset.

02:53.140 --> 02:59.580
Now the last thing I'll do is I only want to show the logout button if we are authenticated, so I will

02:59.580 --> 03:00.820
add the same check

03:00.840 --> 03:07.620
as for the dashboard only if we are authenticated, this list items should be rendered. So with that, if we

03:07.620 --> 03:10.000
go back to the app, by default we don't see it,

03:10.230 --> 03:15.930
as soon as I do login though, we do see that dashboard and logout.

03:15.930 --> 03:20.130
If I click logout here though, we stay on the dashboard,

03:20.280 --> 03:24.220
so one additional improvement is to make sure we navigate away.

03:24.780 --> 03:29.220
Well we can also do this in the store in the logout action, for this

03:29.220 --> 03:36.230
all I need is access to the router and the router can be imported from this router file, just as the store

03:36.240 --> 03:37.850
could be imported in the router,

03:37.890 --> 03:45.960
we can import the router into the store. So import router from ./router and then we can use that

03:45.960 --> 03:54.670
router here in the logout action to not only commit but also call router push to navigate away

03:54.750 --> 04:02.490
or maybe better than push, replace to /signin, this will actually replace the current router with

04:02.490 --> 04:04.980
that so that we can't go back.

04:04.980 --> 04:13.240
Now with that, if I try this one more time and sign in and I click on dashboard and then logout,

04:13.350 --> 04:20.860
we are back on sign in. And with that, we get a working logout functionality in the application too,

04:21.060 --> 04:27.460
now one big flaw this app still has is that we can always logout if we reload

04:27.480 --> 04:35.760
the app and that might not be the desired result because it means that the user loses his session so to

04:35.760 --> 04:41.180
say whenever he leaves our app and comes back shortly after.

04:41.460 --> 04:48.940
Additionally, our token which we get back from firebase is actually only valid for one hour,

04:48.960 --> 04:54.100
we got no logic to automatically log the user out after one hour right now though.

04:54.180 --> 04:58.790
So these are the next and last two things I want to add to this demo application.
