00:01.540 --> 00:08.650
In order to make sure our components get not destroyed, our dynamic components here, I can wrap this

00:08.830 --> 00:12.630
component in keep-alive. So this is a new reserved

00:12.650 --> 00:19.480
keyword, a new reserved component kind of into which I can wrap component and as the name implies,

00:19.480 --> 00:20.520
keep-alive

00:20.620 --> 00:24.030
now make sure that this component is kept alive.

00:24.280 --> 00:29.460
So if I save this, it reloads, I go to new, increase the counter, I navigate away,

00:29.470 --> 00:32.410
we don't see destroyed because it wasn't,

00:32.440 --> 00:33.940
the counter is still there

00:33.940 --> 00:36.580
and with that, we preserve the state.

00:36.730 --> 00:39.550
This is how we can use keep alive to do that

00:39.790 --> 00:46.900
but now you would correctly say well maybe I want to react to the fact that I navigate away before we

00:46.900 --> 00:49.590
could use the destroyed lifecycle

00:49.810 --> 00:51.830
but now that's no longer called.

00:51.860 --> 00:54.690
Do we have our lifecycle hooks we can use?

00:54.790 --> 00:56.120
Let's have a look at the next video.
