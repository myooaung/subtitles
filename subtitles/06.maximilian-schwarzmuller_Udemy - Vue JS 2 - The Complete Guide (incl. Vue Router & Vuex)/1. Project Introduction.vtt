00:02.000 --> 00:02.760
We did it,

00:02.840 --> 00:05.410
we went through the whole course.

00:05.570 --> 00:11.090
You really learned a lot about vuejs throughout the course, you learned a lot about its different features, how to use

00:11.090 --> 00:15.010
these features, how to use them together and when to use them,

00:15.050 --> 00:16.360
I won't repeat them all,

00:16.370 --> 00:22.550
it's been pretty much. We learned about components, the general syntax, about how to interact with the

00:22.580 --> 00:30.500
dom, about animations, state management, routing and now you're really prepared to build both smaller to

00:30.500 --> 00:35.640
medium size to really large enterprise level sized applications.

00:35.690 --> 00:39.230
In this module, we'll build our final course project,

00:39.290 --> 00:43.000
now it's impossible to fit all the things we learned into one project

00:43.070 --> 00:45.100
but this project here covers a lot,

00:45.200 --> 00:46.570
here's what we're going to build.

00:46.730 --> 00:52.320
We're going to build this stock trader app and as you can see, we have this nice starting page

00:52.340 --> 00:57.650
and then of course we can go to the stocks page here and choose one of the four stocks we got.

00:57.740 --> 00:59.960
Now on the top right, you see how many funds we got,

00:59.960 --> 01:03.370
so why don't we buy 10 BMW stocks?

01:03.650 --> 01:09.050
Well after buying that, our funds of course get updated and we now see them in our portfolio here, in this

01:09.050 --> 01:10.670
portfolio we could now sell them

01:10.670 --> 01:13.570
but since it's the same price, it doesn't make much sense

01:13.580 --> 01:16.730
so let's end the day and see where the stock went.

01:16.730 --> 01:21.880
It looks like BMW had a pretty bad day, price plummeted to $75,

01:21.890 --> 01:24.440
of course not only in our portfolio but also here

01:24.620 --> 01:26.050
but plummeting price is

01:26.090 --> 01:27.720
always a good time to re-buy

01:27.720 --> 01:29.260
so let's buy more of it and

01:29.630 --> 01:31.460
let's hope for a recovery.

01:31.470 --> 01:33.310
Well 79 is at least,

01:33.320 --> 01:34.990
should we go for one more day,

01:35.270 --> 01:37.790
well that looks better here.

01:37.790 --> 01:45.650
So now I can sell these stocks and well overall, still a loss because of my first buy but at least not

01:45.650 --> 01:47.290
that bad, anyways

01:47.340 --> 01:48.750
it's not all we can do.

01:48.800 --> 01:54.040
Let me buy some stocks again here, add them to the portfolio therefore and then we cannot only

01:54.040 --> 02:00.230
end the day, we can also save our data and that will save it on a server in the database or in the web, excuse

02:00.230 --> 02:00.680
me.

02:00.890 --> 02:07.160
So that means that now if everything goes very horribly, we can always go back and load the data and

02:07.160 --> 02:14.120
you'll see we're back to 81 which was the time when I saved this. This is this application, has our stocks,

02:14.120 --> 02:20.210
has the possibility to save all the stocks here as well as our portfolio to the Internet, has

02:20.240 --> 02:25.910
this end day feature, has some nice animations between our routes here as you can tell and a lot of other nice

02:25.910 --> 02:28.430
things we learned throughout the course.

02:28.430 --> 02:31.970
Now here's your challenge, try to build this on your own,

02:32.030 --> 02:35.470
I know it's a lot of features but it's nothing you haven't learned.

02:35.480 --> 02:41.000
We got some dropdown here where you should listen to a click and then show this conditionally,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.310
we get animations when switching routes,

02:43.310 --> 02:46.950
we've got routing to begin with, we're somehow managing the state,

02:46.970 --> 02:51.020
I can tell you I'm using vuex for this and so on.

02:51.020 --> 02:54.940
So yes it's a lot of stuff but you can do it

02:55.160 --> 02:58.050
and if you want to follow along instead,

02:58.190 --> 03:02.330
this is what I'll start with in the next video, we'll build this step by step and then you'll still get

03:02.330 --> 03:06.140
the chance to hop off at some point and build the rest on your own.

03:06.140 --> 03:08.580
So with that, I'd say let's get started.
