00:01.560 --> 00:04.080
So here's my solution for this,

00:04.110 --> 00:07.080
of course it's up to you which content you want to pass.

00:07.200 --> 00:13.220
But I chose to pass the following paragraph, so a very simple content,

00:13.410 --> 00:16.610
this is the content because it's not really about the content

00:16.650 --> 00:23.880
as you probably recognized. I'll do the same for the green and for the red component as the first part

00:23.940 --> 00:25.270
of this exercise

00:25.270 --> 00:28.580
and of course we need a slot to now display this.

00:28.590 --> 00:34.920
We could use named slots if we would pass more complicated content which you want to distribute in several

00:34.920 --> 00:39.950
different pieces in this target template and that will be a great challenge for you, I'll

00:40.020 --> 00:43.220
keep it simple and I will use one slot here,

00:43.260 --> 00:51.310
the default slot. I'll do the same in all three templates here in all three components

00:51.420 --> 00:57.300
and when I save this, we see this is the content in all three of them.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.570
This is very nice

00:58.590 --> 01:05.220
and this is already the first part of the exercise, using slots to display the content we're passing

01:05.220 --> 01:06.370
in from outside

01:06.380 --> 01:14.900
between the opening and closing selector. The other challenge was to now dynamically switch these components,

01:15.120 --> 01:21.660
so I'm going to comment this out so that we have it for reference but now, I want to store the currently

01:21.720 --> 01:26.310
active component in a data property here in the data field.

01:26.310 --> 01:30.470
So I'll add data and return an object in my function here

01:30.750 --> 01:34.500
and in this object I'm returning here,

01:35.760 --> 01:41.400
I'll again have let's say my selected component key, this name is totally up to you,

01:41.400 --> 01:43.840
you don't have to use selected component

01:43.980 --> 01:47.030
and by default, I want to use app blue.

01:47.150 --> 01:51.640
Now up here, I want to change this with click listeners of course,

01:51.690 --> 01:58.060
so here I want to set selected component equal to blue

01:58.080 --> 02:00.220
because this is the blue button

02:00.420 --> 02:07.710
but on the other two buttons here, I want to change this to green, though of course that should be app blue

02:08.010 --> 02:11.630
and app green and here, it should be app red.

02:11.640 --> 02:18.120
So with this set up, it's time to add the dynamic component with the component keyword here or with this

02:18.120 --> 02:20.350
built in component component

02:20.610 --> 02:28.930
and there, we want to bind with colon is to the selected component property.

02:28.930 --> 02:33.220
Now once I save that, we only see the blue one,

02:33.330 --> 02:39.640
now let's still pass in this content here so that we see that too

02:39.980 --> 02:47.300
and now I can switch between green and red and back to blue and that already is all I wanted to do in

02:47.300 --> 02:48.310
this exercise.

02:48.320 --> 02:55.070
With that, we practiced using dynamic components and slots and even the combination of both in the last

02:55.160 --> 02:55.730
well part

02:55.730 --> 02:57.410
we added here. With that,

02:57.440 --> 02:58.470
let's continue.
