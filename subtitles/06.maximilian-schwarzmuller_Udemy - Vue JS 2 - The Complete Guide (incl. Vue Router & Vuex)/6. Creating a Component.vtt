WEBVTT

00:01.850 --> 00:08.450
Now let's create a new component. For that I will create a new file in the source folder and I will image

00:08.570 --> 00:13.180
home.vue. Now in there, we need a template,

00:13.980 --> 00:17.940
we need a script and we might need styles,

00:17.940 --> 00:22.320
now let's stick to template and script. Now in the template,

00:22.320 --> 00:30.350
I want to output my Server Status as before and I want to set it to status using this property binding,

00:30.390 --> 00:32.380
excuse me, this string interpolation,

00:32.790 --> 00:39.850
in here, I want to export an object, export as default since it is the only export in this file

00:39.900 --> 00:46.110
and here I want to have my data field which again is a function where I return an object where status

00:46.110 --> 00:56.020
is set to critical as before it and I want to have my methods where I now also have an object defining

00:56.020 --> 00:56.930
my methods

00:57.010 --> 01:01.470
and now we can use ES6 since in this project,

01:01.600 --> 01:05.470
it is getting compiled to ES6 or to ES5,

01:05.470 --> 01:07.770
we can use ES6 to get it compiled to

01:07.800 --> 01:08.970
ES5.

01:09.160 --> 01:15.180
Now in ES6 I can also write a method in an object, not like by writing

01:15.400 --> 01:24.280
let's say changeStatus:function but instead by simply writing change status parentheses like

01:24.280 --> 01:27.790
this, like a method call kind of. This creates the same,

01:27.790 --> 01:30.400
this gives us a method we can execute

01:30.580 --> 01:33.060
and in here I want to set this status,

01:33.070 --> 01:38.170
remember we can access the status even though it's an object returned by a function,

01:38.320 --> 01:39.520
vuejs takes care that

01:39.520 --> 01:44.820
we still can access it and I can set this status to normal here.

01:44.950 --> 01:47.630
Now with that, I got a function I can execute,

01:47.770 --> 01:51.310
so in here I'll add a horizontal line and then add a button

01:51.310 --> 01:59.820
and here I want to say change status and use @click and execute change status down there.

01:59.830 --> 02:02.010
Now with this set up, I created my component,

02:02.020 --> 02:03.640
now I want to use it,

02:03.640 --> 02:05.260
how can I use it?

02:05.290 --> 02:14.620
We can either register it globally in the main.js file here by saying vue component, giving it

02:14.620 --> 02:24.370
a selector, let's say app-server-status to have a unique selector and then the object, let's name it home.

02:24.760 --> 02:25.400
For that,

02:25.420 --> 02:27.540
we will need to add an import,

02:27.770 --> 02:28.880
I'll name it home,

02:28.910 --> 02:33.780
this name is up to use since we export only one object here, export default,

02:33.790 --> 02:36.370
we don't have a name here

02:36.400 --> 02:41.830
so you may choose any name when importing it and we have to import it from the same folder,

02:41.860 --> 02:47.700
therefore ./ for webpack to find it, home.vue.

02:47.860 --> 02:54.040
Now with this set up, I can use app-server-status as a selector in my whole application,

02:54.040 --> 02:56.490
therefore also in my root file here.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.890
So I'll add app-server-status here,

02:58.930 --> 03:05.000
remove the data object, remove the whole export script here maybe even and we're getting an error.

03:05.140 --> 03:10.800
The error we got here is a key thing we have to keep in mind,

03:10.930 --> 03:16.530
it says component template should contain exactly one root element and that's pretty clear.

03:16.690 --> 03:17.950
This is not allowed,

03:17.950 --> 03:22.870
we may not have three or two or any amount of sibling elements.

03:23.050 --> 03:26.330
Instead we only have to use one,

03:26.530 --> 03:33.220
so this can be a div and then we have to wrap everything else inside of this element, the template element

03:33.220 --> 03:36.220
doesn't count because that will be removed in the end.

03:36.220 --> 03:39.180
This is one restriction we face,

03:39.250 --> 03:40.500
it's not too bad though

03:40.510 --> 03:46.690
but it's important to keep in mind, wrap all your template code inside one root element,

03:46.690 --> 03:47.530
this is key

03:47.580 --> 03:50.300
otherwise this will not work. Now

03:50.310 --> 03:58.560
and with that if you save it, it recompiles and you see server status critical in the browser now

03:58.670 --> 04:01.520
and if we change it, it gets changed to normal.

04:01.540 --> 04:03.490
So that works as intended,

04:03.490 --> 04:10.960
the key thing to keep in mind is it has to be one root element and then we're able to register our application

04:10.960 --> 04:14.760
or our component as a global component, like this

04:14.830 --> 04:20.170
but this one root element restriction also applies for local components.

04:20.170 --> 04:22.280
It applies for every component.
