00:01.860 --> 00:04.830
In this module, we had a detailed look at animations.

00:04.890 --> 00:11.970
We learned how to animate the change of one single element, the transition between multiple elements or

00:11.970 --> 00:17.760
how to animate a whole list of elements where we for example add and delete items or move items within

00:17.760 --> 00:18.980
the list.

00:19.050 --> 00:26.280
You also learned how to do that or how to add this in a real application and which different options

00:26.310 --> 00:31.490
you have for animating, for example using css classes, custom class names,

00:31.710 --> 00:35.730
pure javascript, to which events you may listen and so on.

00:35.910 --> 00:42.150
With that, you should have a basic toolset to play around with it and add animations to your application,

00:42.150 --> 00:49.200
try out some things and see what you can animate, how that works, which css set up you need to make

00:49.200 --> 00:52.380
it work in the way you want to make it work and so on.

00:52.560 --> 00:57.740
With that, let's move on and keep animations in mind for the rest of this course,

00:57.780 --> 01:01.000
I will use them again in later sections too.
