00:02.020 --> 00:05.150
Let's practice using our template syntax to output some data.

00:05.260 --> 00:06.990
Here are some exercises I prepared,

00:07.000 --> 00:11.710
I'll quickly walk you through them and then in the next video, we will find a solution for that.

00:11.740 --> 00:18.210
The first task should be rather simple but it's important to get these core mechanics right, here

00:18.250 --> 00:21.340
I want you to output your name and your age,

00:21.340 --> 00:25.150
both should be stored in properties in the data property down here.

00:25.180 --> 00:27.040
I already created a name field,

00:27.160 --> 00:29.400
well you should probably add an age field

00:29.410 --> 00:33.210
and of course replace your name and your age with your real name and age

00:33.220 --> 00:40.180
if you want to. Then output them up here in this paragraph, maybe using string interpolation, you will figure

00:40.180 --> 00:43.920
it out. In the second exercise,

00:43.960 --> 00:49.370
we want to have a little javascript expression in the interpolation syntax so betweeen these curly

00:49.370 --> 00:54.380
braces, try to output your age multiplied by three here.

00:54.430 --> 00:58.920
The third exercise then also stays in this corner

00:58.920 --> 01:04.090
but here, I want to call to function somehow and output the result of this function here,

01:04.120 --> 01:10.180
this function should give you a random number between 0 and 1. Bonus exercise which has nothing to

01:10.180 --> 01:14.980
do with vuejs though, change this to output a random number between 1 and 100

01:14.980 --> 01:22.480
if you want to practice some math and general javascript skills. Four, search any image in Google and then

01:22.480 --> 01:30.640
make this image tag here display that image, of course not by simply adding the link here in the

01:30.640 --> 01:37.060
source attribute but instead by storing the link in a property in your data which you then somehow

01:37.060 --> 01:40.070
bind to the source attribute here.

01:40.210 --> 01:44.830
The last exercise is to pre-populate this input field with your name,

01:44.830 --> 01:51.160
we already do have this property down there and therefore make this input field show your name by default.

01:51.160 --> 01:56.600
These are the tasks, I wish you good luck with that and I'll see you in the next video to solve these

01:56.620 --> 01:57.240
together.
