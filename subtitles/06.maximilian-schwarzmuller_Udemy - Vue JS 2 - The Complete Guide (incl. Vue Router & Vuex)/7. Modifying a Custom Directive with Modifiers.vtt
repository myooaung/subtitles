Now after adding our own value here between the quotation marks and our own argument after the colon,

00:09.340 --> 00:11.740
I also want to add a modifier.

00:11.740 --> 00:13.160
Now how do you do that?

00:14.020 --> 00:17.030
Let's first think about what this modifier could do here,

00:17.380 --> 00:21.320
let's say we want to change the style delayed,

00:21.400 --> 00:25.450
so we want to wait let's say three seconds before changing the style.

00:25.450 --> 00:28.940
We only want to do this though if I add the delayed modifier,

00:28.960 --> 00:31.500
so .delayed, of course it doesn't exist yet

00:31.510 --> 00:34.950
but now we can create such a modifier to handle this case.

00:35.200 --> 00:41.500
So in the main.js file, I therefore want to check if we get this modifier set up,

00:41.560 --> 00:46.660
I will therefore set a variable of delay which is zero by default,

00:46.690 --> 00:53.100
so to have no delay and then I want to check if our binding has modifiers.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.550
Now modifiers is an array and there I want to check

00:56.560 --> 00:57.570
or an object

00:57.580 --> 01:02.550
I should say, excuse me, and then I want to check if we have the delayed key here.

01:02.640 --> 01:07.700
So I'm checking if this key exists in the modifiers array, if that is something we do have

01:07.990 --> 01:14.950
and if we do have delayed added, then I want to set a delay to 3000 here, to have 3 seconds.

01:15.070 --> 01:22.060
That allows me to now add a set timeout function where I will wait for the delay duration which is 0

01:22.060 --> 01:25.550
initially but can be 3000 if we add the modifier

01:25.960 --> 01:32.800
and in the callback function here, well there I simply want to execute this code I had outside of the

01:32.800 --> 01:35.390
callback or outside of the timeout function before.

01:35.740 --> 01:41.200
Now with that we see if I reload this, it takes a couple of seconds before the styling is applied

01:41.200 --> 01:44.200
because we do have the delayed modifier added.

01:44.230 --> 01:51.080
Now of course, if I remove the delayed modifier here and save this again, you now see it instantly

01:51.080 --> 01:59.050
is red because now again, we don't have a delay, only if I add delayed here do we get this. And important,

01:59.760 --> 02:00.730
modifiers

02:00.730 --> 02:05.980
here is an object because of course we can add multiple modifiers by chaining multiple modifiers,

02:05.980 --> 02:06.650
like this,

02:06.700 --> 02:09.430
so another modifier by .another.

02:09.700 --> 02:16.000
But here we only have one and I can use it by simply accessing it here as a property which will only

02:16.000 --> 02:22.320
give me true if it is set and that is how I can use my own modifier here on my own directive.
