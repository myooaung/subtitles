WEBVTT

00:02.250 --> 00:04.060
So let's install that new cli,

00:04.480 --> 00:12.790
now for that you run npm install -g to install it globally @vue/cli, and that's important,

00:12.790 --> 00:16.430
the old cli could and can still be found at the vue cli

00:16.510 --> 00:17.380
written like this

00:17.380 --> 00:20.880
vue-cli, the new cli is found at

00:20.940 --> 00:23.380
@vue/cli.

00:23.410 --> 00:24.860
So these are two different packages

00:24.910 --> 00:26.300
and you can use either of the two,

00:26.300 --> 00:27.600
you don't have to upgrade

00:27.700 --> 00:31.360
and by default, with vue-cli, you still get the old one,

00:31.390 --> 00:35.890
this is the new one. You can of course also use yarn to install that, if you are using that,

00:35.890 --> 00:40.900
it's an alternative package manager and on Mac and Linux, you probably need to add a sudo in front

00:40.900 --> 00:46.600
of that to get the right permissions to install that, on Windows it should work without sudo. Then

00:46.600 --> 00:47.830
you can hit enter,

00:47.860 --> 00:53.250
you might be prompted for your password and then this the cli gets installed and now it's important,

00:53.260 --> 00:58.390
this will replace the vue binary which you used to run vue init,

00:58.420 --> 01:05.590
so from now on you can't run vue init anymore, at least not without the little change or a little edition

01:05.590 --> 01:06.930
which I will show you later.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.220
So let's wait for this installation to finish

01:09.220 --> 01:10.170
now,

01:10.180 --> 01:13.960
now with the cli installed, you can run vue create to create a new project

01:13.990 --> 01:21.520
and there's one thing you need to specify here and that is the project name, so I'll name it vue-cli-new,

01:21.540 --> 01:23.800
you can of course choose any name you want.

01:24.090 --> 01:29.930
Now you can hit enter then and once you do that, you can choose a preset here,

01:30.120 --> 01:33.360
now I already created one dummy preset and I save that,

01:33.360 --> 01:35.040
that is why I can choose it,

01:35.040 --> 01:39.780
you can also go with the default preset which you, well you see which features it gives you, it gives

01:39.780 --> 01:45.270
you babel so that you can use next gen javascript features and linting or very interesting,

01:45.270 --> 01:46.840
manually select features.

01:46.980 --> 01:51.960
If we hit enter there, we can check these features by navigating with the arrow keys and hitting space

01:52.140 --> 01:53.990
on any feature we want to mark,

01:54.180 --> 01:57.840
so there we can add things like babel, progressive web app support,

01:57.840 --> 02:04.040
we can decide if we want to use the vue router in the project or vuex, if we want to add css preprocessing,

02:04.050 --> 02:09.510
so if we want to use SASS for example, linting, unit testing, all these things. Once you're done, you can

02:09.510 --> 02:10.710
simply hit enter

02:11.040 --> 02:14.890
and now, some of the plugins might need additional configuration,

02:14.910 --> 02:20.310
for example the linting plugin here is asking us for which linting rules to use and I'll go

02:20.310 --> 02:23.270
with the standard config here.

02:23.340 --> 02:28.250
I also have to choose if I want to lint on save and that's also coming from that linting plugin

02:28.260 --> 02:33.240
and I will confirm the default here and then you can define where you want to manage your options, in

02:33.240 --> 02:36.870
dedicated config files which will be added to your project folder

02:36.960 --> 02:40.750
or do you want to manage all the configuration in the package.json file

02:41.040 --> 02:47.540
and I will go with the dedicated config files. You're then prompted whether you want to save that preset

02:47.580 --> 02:54.520
for future projects and if you hit yes, you can give it a name, standard-custom, whatever you want

02:54.630 --> 02:59.110
and now if you run vue create again, you'll have this as an option.

02:59.130 --> 03:00.780
Now let's wait for this to finish

03:00.780 --> 03:06.590
and whilst it finishes, let me show you something interesting. In your user folder on your operating system,

03:06.600 --> 03:11.610
you'll find that vuerc file, it's a hidden file so you might need to turn on the option to view

03:11.790 --> 03:12.680
hidden files

03:12.960 --> 03:19.110
and if you inspect that let's say with the normal text edit app, then this actually is the global configuration

03:19.110 --> 03:20.620
for the new vue cli

03:20.670 --> 03:24.510
and there, you also see all the presets you created,

03:24.620 --> 03:29.490
so let me increase that. Here you see that presets node, that's my dummy preset and that's the one I

03:29.490 --> 03:30.460
just configured

03:30.600 --> 03:36.990
and there you see which plugins you added for this preset and for each plugin, if it requires additional

03:37.050 --> 03:40.200
configuration, which configuration options you chose.

03:40.200 --> 03:44.800
So this is where this gets stored and this of course also is a place where you can edit this,

03:44.820 --> 03:50.400
for example if I wanted to get rid of my test one preset, well then I could of course simply delete it

03:50.400 --> 03:52.240
from here, like this.

03:53.350 --> 03:58.130
In the meantime my installation finished and we're now ready to use our new project,

03:58.150 --> 04:02.830
we see some commands with which we can get started here so I can simply navigate into my newly created

04:02.830 --> 04:10.390
folder and run npm run serve which is an npm script automatically generated to use the locally, so in that project

04:10.570 --> 04:15.530
installed vue cli to bring up the development server and build the development bundle.

04:15.610 --> 04:21.250
So if I hit enter here, this will bring up that dev server, build the project for the first time and once

04:21.250 --> 04:28.240
done, it'll allow you to visit this URL here to visit your running page which is life reloading upon

04:28.240 --> 04:32.440
changes has hot module reloading, all that fun stuff you would expect.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.130
Here it is,

04:33.160 --> 04:35.560
that's the starting page it generated for you,

04:35.560 --> 04:39.250
now let's have a look at that project it gave us in an IDE.
