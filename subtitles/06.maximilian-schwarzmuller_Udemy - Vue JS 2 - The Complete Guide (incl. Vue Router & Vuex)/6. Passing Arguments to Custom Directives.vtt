Ler's enhance this a bit further, let's say we not only want to set the background color, we want to let the

00:06.420 --> 00:11.870
user decide if you want to set the background or the default, the text color.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.040
So the user has to explicitly state that we want to change the background color otherwise only the

00:17.040 --> 00:19.800
text color will be changed. To do this,

00:19.830 --> 00:21.480
we need to pass an argument,

00:21.660 --> 00:23.980
so I'm thinking about the following syntax,

00:24.150 --> 00:28.050
we get a value of red but an argument passed with a colon,

00:28.050 --> 00:30.650
that is how all vue directives work,

00:30.660 --> 00:32.170
v-bind would be one example,

00:32.170 --> 00:36.600
there we have to shorten with just colon, that won't work here because we need to specify our name of

00:36.600 --> 00:37.570
course but

00:37.710 --> 00:42.900
with colon, we pass an argument and the argument could be background like that.

00:42.900 --> 00:47.390
Now that's no string, that's a normal text in our template here,

00:47.550 --> 00:52.160
this is something which will be treated as an argument then in our directive.

00:52.530 --> 00:59.880
So in our main.js file in this directive, I will comment out this code again because now I want to

00:59.880 --> 01:05.440
check if my argument on the binding, I can access this with arg,

01:05.640 --> 01:11.760
if this is now background, now here it has to be treated as a string because that is to what this will

01:11.760 --> 01:13.650
be converted behind the scenes.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.960
So arg is another thing we can access on our binding,

01:16.980 --> 01:20.430
we already saw value to get the part between the quotation marks,

01:20.430 --> 01:24.030
now with arg, we can get the info after this colon,

01:24.060 --> 01:26.370
so this background in this case.

01:26.370 --> 01:31.400
And here I want to check well if the binding argument is background, then I want to set the element

01:31.400 --> 01:41.370
style background color to the binding value and otherwise, I want to set the elements style color, so

01:41.370 --> 01:44.580
the text color to binding.value.

01:44.580 --> 01:51.890
Now if I save this, we still see the red background because indeed, I do pass the background color here,

01:51.910 --> 01:53.070
the background arg,

01:53.370 --> 02:02.500
but if I were to remove this arg, this argument, we see that now the text color is red.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.290
So this is how we can switch between that,

02:04.330 --> 02:13.780
no argument means we're ending up in this else block, with an argument background will end up in the background

02:13.790 --> 02:18.400
color case, you need to refresh this because the hot reloading is not handling this correctly but it

02:18.400 --> 02:19.640
does work as it should 

02:19.690 --> 02:21.910
here in our running code.

02:21.910 --> 02:25.260
This is how we can use arguments and values,

02:25.480 --> 02:28.870
now let's also have a look at how we can add our own modifiers,

02:28.900 --> 02:31.500
the third too when we have been working with directives.

02:31.540 --> 02:35.180
Remember that, we got arguments, the value and modifiers,

02:35.200 --> 02:37.800
so let's have a look at the last two in the next video.
