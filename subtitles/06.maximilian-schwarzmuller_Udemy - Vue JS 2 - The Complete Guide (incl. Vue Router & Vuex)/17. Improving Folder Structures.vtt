WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:04.780
So we get the basics about using vuex,

00:04.790 --> 00:10.540
let's now have a look at how we could structure all our vuex  related code namely the code in the store.js

00:10.550 --> 00:13.170
file with different files,

00:13.220 --> 00:18.350
something we want to do for bigger applications because if have all the state getters, mutations and

00:18.350 --> 00:19.750
actions in one file,

00:19.850 --> 00:26.170
this file will quickly grow pretty big and that's something we not necessarily want.

00:26.720 --> 00:33.190
Important, in the end of this module, you'll find a lecture or an article where I will link to further

00:33.190 --> 00:36.860
resources and also discuss an alternative set up

00:36.860 --> 00:38.850
to which, to the one I show you here,

00:38.870 --> 00:44.190
the one I show you here is the one you will see in almost all official examples and so on,

00:44.190 --> 00:46.200
so that is why I chose this one.

00:46.610 --> 00:54.740
So for this example, we first want to use something called modules. I'll create a modules folder and in the

00:54.740 --> 00:58.930
next video, I will explain what modules actually are.
