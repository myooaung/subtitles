Time to use the things we learned in this module and put it into practice with a few little exercises

00:08.310 --> 00:14.070
about forms, specifically here's what I want you to try before I then in the next video show you which

00:14.070 --> 00:16.330
solution I came up with.

00:16.350 --> 00:21.630
So the first exercise is that we should create a sign up form where you create the following information,

00:21.630 --> 00:28.470
full name which is a first and last name field, mail, password and then a radio button if we want to store

00:28.470 --> 00:34.440
the data yes or no. At the bottom of this template, you can find this template attached to this lecture

00:34.440 --> 00:34.920
here,

00:35.100 --> 00:41.240
you find a simple output datasheet as we saw it before where we can then print this information.

00:41.620 --> 00:44.200
In the second exercise here,

00:44.340 --> 00:51.000
I want you to enhance that by making sure that the form which you have to create up here of course is

00:51.000 --> 00:57.780
only visible as long as we haven't hit the submit button which you have to create as well whereas the

00:57.870 --> 01:02.220
datasheet here is only visible after you hit the submit button,

01:02.220 --> 01:03.640
so that's a little addition.

01:03.900 --> 01:10.650
And the third exercise, I want you to take your full name which is a first and last name input field

01:10.980 --> 01:16.740
and create your own component which kind of combines both inputs into one single control you can then

01:16.740 --> 01:21.390
dump into your project here to get a full name out of the box.

01:21.480 --> 01:27.280
Well with that, I wish you good luck or good experience with that and I'll see you in a solution video.
