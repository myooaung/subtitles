WEBVTT

00:02.250 --> 00:04.160
So we covered a lot of ground already,

00:04.170 --> 00:07.740
we learned a lot about environment variables, the plugins and so on.

00:07.740 --> 00:15.180
Now I was talking about building the app before and about these different modes, building simply means that

00:15.180 --> 00:21.960
we compile our code to a bundle and the serve command here does this automatically, it does that in

00:21.960 --> 00:27.750
memory and spins up that development server which then serves that development bundle with debugging

00:27.750 --> 00:34.770
tools enabled and all of that, the build command does that for a production ready bundle.

00:34.770 --> 00:40.140
And as you can see, we got some command set up in the package.json file and they all use vue

00:40.140 --> 00:41.640
cli service.

00:41.670 --> 00:44.020
Now that's a package we didn't install, 

00:44.040 --> 00:46.970
it's a package which was installed automatically,

00:46.980 --> 00:51.470
here it is, which was installed automatically when we created this project.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.460
It only exists in this project,

00:53.460 --> 00:55.340
it's not installed globally

00:55.500 --> 01:03.440
so if you would run vue build here, this would fail because the vue cli service which is doing this

01:03.620 --> 01:06.740
only exists locally and not globally on your machine

01:06.740 --> 01:13.220
and the vue cli itself does not have that functionality added to it because of that plugin driven

01:13.340 --> 01:20.030
architecture, the build commands itself are part of a plugin too, of that cli service plugin here

01:20.030 --> 01:21.160
basically.

01:21.170 --> 01:29.630
So you can of course add your own scripts though, like build development and then you could define that

01:29.630 --> 01:34.440
there you want to use that local vue cli service

01:34.580 --> 01:40.860
and now the interesting thing is I can run build there and by default, this would build it for production,

01:40.860 --> 01:48.120
now I can set my mode here and remember, I talked about mode when I talked about environment variables

01:48.420 --> 01:49.960
with --mode,

01:49.980 --> 01:54.560
I can set my mode here to development,

01:54.600 --> 01:56.890
this is one of the free built in modes.

01:57.300 --> 02:03.710
If I now save this and I run npm run build:development, so I'm using that script I just created,

02:03.710 --> 02:10.740
it will use that local cli service to create that build and it will now not just build it for memory

02:10.740 --> 02:17.460
as it does with serve but it will give me a build folder, that dist folder which contains my build application

02:17.790 --> 02:23.130
but and that's important in development mode, which is why it's not minified and anything like that

02:23.910 --> 02:30.060
and it is in development mode because I use set this mode to development.

02:30.120 --> 02:33.000
So this is how you can build that and how you can work with modes

02:33.060 --> 02:36.350
and one additional note, you can also create your own modes.

02:36.450 --> 02:38.880
I can build for staging for example,

02:38.880 --> 02:41.480
it's not one of the free built in modes

02:41.640 --> 02:48.640
and then I could use a .env.staging file here to set variables for my custom mode here.

02:49.080 --> 02:55.560
And with that if I now run this again, it will still work because it accepts this custom mode too, it

02:55.560 --> 03:01.620
will then not of course use some of the optimisations it sets on its own, for production for example because

03:01.650 --> 03:03.210
it is in production mode

03:03.210 --> 03:08.360
but if you tweak the webpack config and set your own custom variables here,

03:08.370 --> 03:12.200
you can run your custom mode, you just have to do more work then.

03:12.510 --> 03:18.780
Because as I just explained, the build for example will not be optimized because it's not building for

03:18.900 --> 03:23.780
production, so it doesn't detect that this should be comparable to production for example

03:23.820 --> 03:29.610
but if you need all that finetuning, you can dig into the official webpack configuration and you can

03:29.610 --> 03:32.370
set your own mode and that is really a cool thing.

03:32.370 --> 03:34.440
A lot of it works out of the box,

03:34.440 --> 03:38.300
then you can add plugins and if you need full control, you can have that too,

03:38.310 --> 03:40.470
you can customize everything essentially.
