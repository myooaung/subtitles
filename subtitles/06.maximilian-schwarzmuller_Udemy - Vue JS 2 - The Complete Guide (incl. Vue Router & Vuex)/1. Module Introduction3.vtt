Welcome to another course module, we learned a lot about components thus far and a lot about other things

00:08.030 --> 00:14.510
too, how to output data, how to react to user events. Now I want to bring all these pieces together and

00:14.510 --> 00:17.930
touch on a topic, kind of a special thing on web pages

00:17.930 --> 00:20.040
you'll often use, forms.

00:20.240 --> 00:26.480
We already used a tiny form in the last project where we already had a text area where the user could

00:26.480 --> 00:32.330
enter a quote. Now handling forms is actually made very easy with vuejs as you will learn throughout this module

00:32.330 --> 00:37.670
but in this module, I want to show you how to basically fetch values from input fields, how to work with

00:37.670 --> 00:44.000
them, how to use different form controls like radio buttons and checkboxes and also how to build your

00:44.090 --> 00:48.610
own form control with your own component working as a form control.

00:48.770 --> 00:51.660
Well let's dive into that and start with the very basics.
