We get the header in place, now how you proceed depends on how you work on such projects.

00:09.240 --> 00:16.980
Generally I also do make a plan before starting but here, I think it's a great chance or a great thing

00:17.250 --> 00:23.040
to finish the things we see, so the portfolio and the stocks component here,

00:23.040 --> 00:30.240
so the stock part, these parts of the application so that we can see which features will these components

00:30.240 --> 00:32.980
have in the end, so that we're able to derive

00:33.000 --> 00:36.390
how it should be managed, the state for that and so on.

00:36.390 --> 00:43.590
Therefore what I want to work on next is the stocks component which includes not only the grid of stocks

00:43.590 --> 00:46.730
but of course also the individual stock items.

00:46.740 --> 00:50.250
So that's your next challenge, start working on that,

00:50.250 --> 00:57.150
keep in mind that the stocks component is only a grid for the individual stock and the individual

00:57.150 --> 01:03.570
stock has features like the name of the stock, it has the price and you also want to take into account

01:03.840 --> 01:06.050
that you get an input field and a buy button

01:06.060 --> 01:11.400
and of course you only want to let the user buy if the input field is not empty and if a valid number

01:11.400 --> 01:14.310
was entered and if the number is greater than zero.

01:14.310 --> 01:16.860
So these are kinds of things to keep in mind, with that

01:16.860 --> 01:17.550
good luck,

01:17.550 --> 01:19.900
I'll start working on this in the next video.
