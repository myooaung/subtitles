00:02.080 --> 00:08.140
I'm back in the project we created before, it's actually in the same state as before, I replaced my template

00:08.140 --> 00:12.260
to only display Hello World and i export an empty object.

00:12.260 --> 00:18.820
Remember, this will get compiled to a javascript template plus the vuejs code where we don't

00:18.820 --> 00:24.220
have any here since the object is empty but there could be some code and then we're rendering this here

00:24.310 --> 00:31.180
with the render method which basically is a vuejs method allowing us to override the template we

00:31.180 --> 00:35.870
select here with the el selector and then place our compiled template there.

00:35.920 --> 00:43.300
So just an alternative to template to mention this again but a better alternative because here, we

00:43.300 --> 00:45.610
render the compiled Javascript code

00:45.710 --> 00:53.050
therefore we don't face the limitations template has like it having to be a string and other limitations

00:53.530 --> 00:55.420
given by the dom for example,

00:55.420 --> 01:01.720
so this is the best way to write your templates as you get the maximum flexibility and I'll come back

01:01.720 --> 01:06.040
to one specific piece of flexibility in the next videos.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.770
Note that right now I'm not using a component,

01:08.830 --> 01:11.940
this is a normal object and I'm rendering it here,

01:12.070 --> 01:14.220
so I'm not doing anything here,

01:14.230 --> 01:16.480
I'm not having a component here.

01:16.930 --> 01:22.630
I now even remove this exported object and it still works because I still have the object here, the

01:22.630 --> 01:23.120
template

01:23.130 --> 01:29.210
I mean but I want to reintroduce the exported object. Now in this object,

01:29.260 --> 01:32.730
I want to set up my data and this shall be a function,

01:32.740 --> 01:35.210
let me show you what happens if it is not a function.

01:35.350 --> 01:39.830
By the way, this is not a component but it's a separate object which we're exporting here,

01:39.850 --> 01:40.170
right,

01:40.180 --> 01:41.650
it's a separate object

01:41.650 --> 01:43.390
and we're rendering this object here.

01:43.390 --> 01:48.610
So it has the same limitations as a component has because we kind of use it as a component even though

01:48.610 --> 01:51.620
we don't have selector for that component

01:51.730 --> 01:56.770
but we're using it to replace our normal template here in another vue instance.

01:56.770 --> 02:05.560
So if I set up data like this as a normal object and I set status to critical and then I print server

02:05.830 --> 02:06.690
status

02:09.330 --> 02:13.040
status here like that, if I now save this,

02:13.170 --> 02:19.050
you see we don't see it here but if I open up the console, you see that the data option should be a function,

02:19.380 --> 02:21.870
so that doesn't really work.

02:21.870 --> 02:26.110
Instead we shall set it up as a function as we learned it

02:26.270 --> 02:33.360
and then in here, return an object enclosing our status, if I do this, you now see the server status critical

02:33.360 --> 02:33.910
here.

02:34.140 --> 02:36.510
So this is generally how we work with that,

02:36.510 --> 02:42.410
so far that's not totally new, we learned about this single file components before.

02:42.510 --> 02:47.270
Now let's also use them to create components now,

02:47.280 --> 02:51.650
so I'm already exporting an object here and that is fine,

02:51.650 --> 02:58.590
this is kind of now my root vue instance which gets rendered here, it's like a component which I don't

02:58.590 --> 03:06.710
place with a selector but instead, simply like a replacement for the instance object in here because

03:06.770 --> 03:09.660
here, I use the render function to replace everything,

03:09.660 --> 03:17.040
so I kind of need an alternative, a different place where I set up my root instance data methods and so

03:17.040 --> 03:17.370
on

03:17.430 --> 03:18.660
and this is in the app.vue

03:18.710 --> 03:19.600
file.
