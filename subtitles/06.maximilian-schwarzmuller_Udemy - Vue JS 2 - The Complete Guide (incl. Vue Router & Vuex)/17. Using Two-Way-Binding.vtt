Before diving deeper into how we can make our properties work closer together, let's have a look at working

00:10.660 --> 00:11.860
with the template again.

00:11.950 --> 00:13.520
We saw how we could output data,

00:13.540 --> 00:18.820
for example here with string interpolation where I output the name, we saw how we could listen to events

00:18.820 --> 00:25.740
like with key up for example, what if I wanted to do both at the same time? Two way data binding that

00:25.760 --> 00:32.530
would be, for example here I get this input field and I want to populate this input field with the name

00:32.530 --> 00:33.340
of the user,

00:33.340 --> 00:39.040
so with my name in this case here, on the same time whenever I change it in the input field, I want to

00:39.100 --> 00:44.130
update the data property and update it everywhere I outputted in my code

00:44.140 --> 00:49.750
for example in this paragraph. Turns out it's really easy to set this up with vuejs,

00:49.870 --> 00:56.810
all we need to do is add the the v-model directive to this input element. The v-model directive tells vuejs

00:56.810 --> 01:03.790
set up two way data binding for this input here and then between the quotation marks, the property

01:03.790 --> 01:07.570
which we want to bind in both directions, the name in this case.

01:07.990 --> 01:11.450
So what this will do is it will on one hand,

01:11.600 --> 01:14.880
easy as you can see here output the name in the input field

01:15.040 --> 01:21.490
but then whenever I change it here it will listen to these changes and update the name property in my

01:21.490 --> 01:27.970
vue instance thus reflecting this change in all the places where I also use the name instance like in

01:27.970 --> 01:29.140
this paragraph.

01:29.470 --> 01:34.960
Well, this is the missing piece when we are talking about data binding, where we were able to use the

01:34.960 --> 01:42.460
interpolation, the v-bind syntax to bind two attributes, the v-on syntax to listen to events.

01:42.460 --> 01:47.010
Well now we can also use two way binding to do both at the same time.
