Did you ever wonder why vue resource was called vue resource and not vue http or something like that?

00:08.800 --> 00:15.310
Because it has a nice extra feature which allows us to set up our own resources which are kind of nice

00:15.310 --> 00:22.200
mappings of common tasks to http requests. For example, you want to store something in the database,

00:22.270 --> 00:29.530
typically it would be, it would make sense if you would call save, a save method on your data and then

00:29.530 --> 00:33.930
that would automatically execute a post request or send a post request to the right

00:33.940 --> 00:36.200
URL with the data attached to it,

00:36.220 --> 00:42.340
now vue resource or the resources you can set up with vue resource allow you to do that.

00:42.460 --> 00:48.630
I'll go to the app.vue file and I want to show you this concept of vue resources.

00:48.640 --> 00:54.130
The first thing you've got to do is you have to create such resources if you want to use them, for that I'll

00:54.340 --> 00:58.810
store a new or have a new key here in my data

00:58.810 --> 01:05.350
in my vue instance and I'll name it resource and this is just an empty object. Then I will set up the created

01:05.410 --> 01:08.780
lifecycle hook because that is a good place to initialize the resources

01:08.780 --> 01:10.560
I want to use in this app.vue

01:10.560 --> 01:19.240
file here and then I simply can set it up by using my resource property I just created and then

01:19.240 --> 01:25.270
accessing this.$resource, again dollar sign indicates it's not coming from us, it's coming

01:25.270 --> 01:27.990
from the root or from vuejs

01:28.020 --> 01:34.660
in general or in this case, from vue resource in general and vue resource actually is a method.

01:35.340 --> 01:36.760
Now to this method,

01:36.760 --> 01:40.410
we have to pass certain data fields.

01:40.570 --> 01:43.650
The first field is the resource,

01:43.650 --> 01:44.890
now that could be data.json,

01:44.980 --> 01:47.560
this will again use our root

01:47.560 --> 01:49.130
URL we set up here

01:49.450 --> 01:52.210
and well we already have data.json there,

01:52.270 --> 01:58.460
so to make this work, I will remove it here so that we just have it like this

01:58.870 --> 02:04.600
and then in my app.vue file, use data.json and also using all my other requests as the first

02:04.600 --> 02:05.080
argument

02:05.080 --> 02:09.990
now, so that we append data.json at the end of this standard URL. You will see in the next videos

02:10.010 --> 02:11.260
why I do that,

02:11.260 --> 02:13.630
for now I will leave it static like this,

02:13.630 --> 02:18.520
so for that I wouldn't have needed to do that but you will see why I did it in the next videos again.

02:18.520 --> 02:23.800
So here this is the path, URL we want to visit with this resource,

02:24.130 --> 02:27.340
I'm going to leave this like it is right for now,

02:27.340 --> 02:29.640
we will change this in the next lectures,

02:29.650 --> 02:34.040
then it will make sense that I extracted this data.json file from the root URL.

02:34.210 --> 02:39.820
And with that, we already set up some resources because vue resource ships with some default actions

02:39.820 --> 02:43.320
we can perform on our resources, on our data.

02:43.540 --> 02:48.400
You can check out these default actions in the vue resource documentation

02:48.400 --> 02:54.170
of course, if you go to creating resources you will see some default actions here.

02:54.490 --> 02:57.280
So let's use that resource we just created,

02:57.280 --> 02:58.810
how does this work?

02:59.320 --> 03:04.360
I will comment out my submit code in here,

03:04.360 --> 03:12.070
so this old code and instead, I now want to submit this differently. I want to use this resource using

03:12.070 --> 03:19.480
my own resource property here which I configure down there and then, save because save is one of the

03:19.480 --> 03:22.500
default actions provided by vue resource

03:22.500 --> 03:28.870
as you can see here. This will as you can also see send a post request to the URL which is saved

03:28.870 --> 03:33.740
for this resource, this is this URL appended to the root URL of course

03:34.060 --> 03:42.970
and then we can simply pass the data as an argument here. Specifically, we can pass two things, the first

03:42.970 --> 03:43.290
one

03:43.300 --> 03:49.710
are any parameters we want to pass to that URL, we won't do that for now, I will come back to this later,

03:49.720 --> 03:56.790
the second argument is the data I actually want to pass, the data I do want to pass is this user as before

03:56.920 --> 04:04.290
with my other post request. Well with this, let me save this and send this request again

04:04.730 --> 04:06.210
and let's see if this works

04:07.250 --> 04:10.240
and by going to the firebase console, looks good.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.600
Now let me try this again,

04:12.760 --> 04:17.320
looks good, it is overridden because yes we send a post request but we still have our intercepter in

04:17.320 --> 04:18.010
place

04:18.190 --> 04:23.030
but now we're using this resource here. As you can see, the syntax is now

04:23.050 --> 04:28.140
shorter, though of course also because I removed the then functions which I could still use.

04:28.240 --> 04:34.360
But with that, we can now set up some flexible pieces of functions we can then reuse in our application

04:34.750 --> 04:40.000
and I will come back to this and now customize this a bit more in the next video.
