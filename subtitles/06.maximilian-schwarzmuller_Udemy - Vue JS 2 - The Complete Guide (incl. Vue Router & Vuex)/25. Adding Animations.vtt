00:01.740 --> 00:05.050
So the application is working but it's not really pretty,

00:05.100 --> 00:08.480
this instance snapping here, nah, we can animate this,

00:08.670 --> 00:10.290
so let's do that.

00:10.290 --> 00:13.820
I actually will use a simple transition as we learned it,

00:13.980 --> 00:15.580
so here I will add

00:15.580 --> 00:18.560
transition, like this

00:18.900 --> 00:26.490
and then for this transition, I want to set up a name and the name is flip because I want to flip this,

00:26.490 --> 00:31.980
now I could also dynamically bind this to some property if I wanted to switch the transition and that

00:31.980 --> 00:34.120
could be a nice challenge for you to do

00:34.200 --> 00:40.110
but here I will hardcode it and I will set the mode to out in, so that the old component is first removed

00:40.110 --> 00:42.610
before the new one is animated in.

00:42.750 --> 00:46.030
Now of course since I add flip here, I need to add a couple of

00:46.110 --> 00:53.940
css classes down there, specifically I need to have flip-enter but as a side note of course you

00:53.940 --> 00:58.170
don't need to have it if you don't enter any code in there, I just want to show which classes we could

00:58.170 --> 00:58.920
use,

00:58.920 --> 01:00.530
flip-enter-active

01:00.750 --> 01:04.750
and then of course we also have flip-leave, whoops, like that

01:07.880 --> 01:14.110
and of course also flip-leave-active, like this.

01:14.130 --> 01:20.370
These are the classes and since I want to flip it, I will need some keyframes to use a css animation

01:20.370 --> 01:21.220
to do that,

01:21.450 --> 01:29.640
so here I will have flip out from and then to let's say, of course you could be more granular by specifying

01:29.640 --> 01:30.690
in-between steps

01:30.690 --> 01:38.160
for example and I will also have keyframes flip-in like this

01:38.280 --> 01:44.950
and here I also want to have simply from and to, now which animations do I want to set up here?

01:45.210 --> 01:53.640
Well for flip-out, I want to transform and I want to rotateY, so rotate around the y axis which is

01:53.640 --> 01:58.580
this animation so not x, y, rotateY

01:58.920 --> 02:06.150
and initially, I want to rotate by 0 degrees because I will start at having it well, not rotate it

02:06.150 --> 02:07.100
at all

02:07.210 --> 02:15.360
instead having it really like this, not like this, not like this, really at zero degrees but I want to transform

02:15.360 --> 02:24.950
to rotateY 90 degrees, so that it now is from this switch to this.

02:24.980 --> 02:29.800
Now of course we want to do a full flip and the other half will be done in flip-in because that should

02:29.800 --> 02:31.150
already be the new card,

02:31.180 --> 02:37.510
the new component, if I would animate the old card to do a full flip, well and we would just see an empty

02:37.510 --> 02:41.460
background, a white or a gray background and not the new card as a background,

02:41.470 --> 02:45.700
therefore the second half of the flip has to be done on the new component.

02:45.700 --> 02:49.750
Therefore here for flip in which will add new one,

02:49.750 --> 02:53.660
we have to start at this point where the first one stops,

02:53.680 --> 03:02.530
so at 90 degrees and we want to transform all the way down to 0 degrees again, so that the new

03:03.220 --> 03:08.130
component which gets added in is now rotated fully towards you.

03:08.140 --> 03:09.250
I hope that makes sense,

03:09.280 --> 03:15.370
rotate the old one out until it is exactly at 90 degrees so almost invisible so to say

03:15.610 --> 03:20.450
and then if we would leave it to continue to 180%, we would see the back side of it which

03:20.470 --> 03:22.560
is just some default gray color,

03:22.720 --> 03:24.870
therefore the back side should be the new component

03:24.910 --> 03:31.430
which is why this takes over at 90 degrees. Well with that animation set up here,

03:31.570 --> 03:33.780
let's see, what do we need to set here?

03:34.090 --> 03:40.320
Well flip-enter, this should be transform

03:42.760 --> 03:43.570
rotateY

03:43.570 --> 03:44.470
at 

03:44.470 --> 03:50.410
zero degrees, though we shouldn't need that because that is the starting state here in from, therefore we

03:50.410 --> 03:55.030
could remove the whole flip-enter class, I'm just leaving it here so that again, you see all the classes

03:55.030 --> 03:59.000
you could use. Flip-enter-active here, this is

03:59.070 --> 04:07.510
whilst the flip-in animation plays, well this shall use the flip-in animation over let's say half

04:07.510 --> 04:12.210
a second, of course choose any time frame of your choice or of your preference,

04:12.250 --> 04:18.430
I want to use the ease-out, ease-in function and forwards to stay in the final place and not snap back

04:18.430 --> 04:20.850
to the initial from state.

04:20.950 --> 04:25.740
Now for flip-leave, we also want to transform rotateY

04:25.750 --> 04:30.690
0 degrees, shouldn't be needed too though

04:30.720 --> 04:37.110
so let's comment this out too and flip-leave-active, well here I want to have my animation where I want

04:37.110 --> 04:40.360
to play flip-out over half a second,

04:40.650 --> 04:45.730
ease-out and forwards as well, just like for flip-enter-active, of course you could group them together

04:45.750 --> 04:47.290
but I want to be explicit here.

04:47.700 --> 04:52.200
Now with that set up, let's see this in the running application if I reload,

04:52.410 --> 04:58.640
that should be -2, it almost works but we don't see the flip-out,

04:58.650 --> 05:00.570
we only see it in flip-in

05:00.700 --> 05:06.410
but what's happening to the other part of the animation? Well what's happening is that this should

05:06.410 --> 05:07.780
be called flip-out here,

05:07.820 --> 05:11.930
so let's reload it again and try this again,

05:12.170 --> 05:14.270
now it looks how it should look like

05:14.430 --> 05:19.950
and if I give the wrong answer like this one, I get a warning and the right one flips it.

05:20.060 --> 05:23.580
So now with that, it's a small practice about animations,

05:23.630 --> 05:29.560
now you could continue practicing by adding more animations here or for example, go back to the monster

05:29.570 --> 05:31.120
slayer application

05:31.310 --> 05:39.070
and on that, try to animate the list of the log we use there to log the player actions and so on,

05:39.110 --> 05:41.060
that could be animated with transition group,

05:41.060 --> 05:44.280
that would be a nice practice. In the next lecture,

05:44.390 --> 05:51.890
you will see my updated monster slayer code where I added these animations to that application for the

05:51.890 --> 05:53.200
group specifically

05:53.330 --> 05:57.090
and then you can compare this because this really is what I want to encourage you to do.

05:57.230 --> 06:04.180
Challenge my code and challenge yourself and use the things you learn here especially about animations

06:04.190 --> 06:08.490
for example and practice it in existing applications, try to

06:08.490 --> 06:12.460
animate certain things and play around with it. With that,

06:12.470 --> 06:13.340
we achieved a lot,

06:13.340 --> 06:16.630
we learned a lot of the basics in this animations

06:16.640 --> 06:17.690
word or in the

06:17.690 --> 06:19.310
vuejs world already,

06:19.370 --> 06:23.640
now I want to move on to how we can leave the vuejs

06:23.640 --> 06:29.390
app for a moment and reach out to some server if we need to fetch or store some data, something we

06:29.390 --> 06:31.340
haven't had a look at yet.

06:31.460 --> 06:35.960
So there, we will have a look at how we can use http in our vuejs application.
