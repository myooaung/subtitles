00:01.990 --> 00:08.920
Let's start with working on the quote grid component. Here I of course will also have my template and

00:08.920 --> 00:12.150
then some script,

00:12.200 --> 00:14.750
I also want to have a style here,

00:14.780 --> 00:16.550
so let me add that too

00:16.910 --> 00:23.210
and what I want to do is in the template, remember here in the app file, we do have a container where we will

00:23.210 --> 00:26.680
nest everything in the end, so a bootstrap class container here.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.010
So in there, 

00:28.020 --> 00:32.680
I therefore want to create a row, div with a class row,

00:32.720 --> 00:38.300
this shall then hold my quotes. Now in here,

00:38.390 --> 00:42.350
I will have my quote component and I will of course use v-for,

00:42.350 --> 00:46.580
so a for loop to replicate it as often as needed

00:46.580 --> 00:48.890
inside of that row.

00:49.010 --> 00:54.980
Now what that also means is that I need to be able to get this array of quotes from outside,

00:55.240 --> 01:04.600
so in the script tag here, I will export a default object and this default object here shall have some

01:04.600 --> 01:11.050
props namely the quotes which are passed from outside so that I have access to them. With the quotes

01:11.050 --> 01:17.350
available, I can then loop through them as soon as I have my quote component and that is then what I'll work

01:17.350 --> 01:18.400
on next.

01:18.520 --> 01:27.400
So I'll copy this set up here and here in my single quote component, I want to set up the panel body

01:27.490 --> 01:28.820
script here, style

01:28.830 --> 01:33.980
here, excuse me because I will use this class here, it's a bootstrap class and I want to modify it a

01:33.980 --> 01:34.590
bit.

01:34.600 --> 01:40.740
Specifically I'll change the font family to use the one I imported in the index.html file,

01:40.780 --> 01:49.130
that's Arizona and I can do this by setting up Arizona, like this and as a fallback style, I'll

01:49.160 --> 01:51.210
simply have cursive.

01:51.830 --> 01:55.660
I also want to set the font size to 24 pixels

01:55.880 --> 01:58.790
and I picked a color code which I found

01:59.030 --> 01:59.760
okay

01:59.810 --> 02:02.440
and of course style this to your needs.

02:02.480 --> 02:07.590
Now that is my single quote style for the panel body,

02:07.610 --> 02:18.540
I also will add a quote class here where I simply want to set the cursor to be a pointer and when hovering

02:18.630 --> 02:26.460
over this, I want to change the background color to this reddish look so that we can see, we can delete it

02:26.580 --> 02:27.550
with this.

02:27.810 --> 02:29.970
Well that's just the styling,

02:30.210 --> 02:32.640
let's work on the actual quote.

02:33.210 --> 02:41.650
Well here, I actually you won't need an object, all I want to have in here is not even the row,

02:42.180 --> 02:53.310
it's really just a class, a div of a class, col and now let's say sm-6, col-md-4 and col-lg-3

02:53.400 --> 02:59.310
for some well different stylings and different viewports.

02:59.340 --> 03:06.160
And then in there, I'll use the bootstrap classes panel and panel default to get this panel look basically,

03:06.270 --> 03:09.450
so that gives it this round, these round corners and so on

03:09.630 --> 03:17.280
and in there, I will have a div with my panel body and also my quote class.

03:17.280 --> 03:23.850
Now in that div, I simply want to have a slot because the quote content should come from outside so

03:23.850 --> 03:30.310
that the thing passing in the content is the thing deciding how it should look like, here

03:30.330 --> 03:36.690
I'm only getting, creating the place where it will be rendered in the end but it should be the holder

03:36.690 --> 03:39.790
of that content who decides how that should look like.

03:39.830 --> 03:44.960
Now the holder of the content of course is the quote grid here, there

03:44.970 --> 03:51.820
I already have my quotes and with the single quote component now being created, I can next loop through all

03:51.870 --> 03:57.630
quotes to render that single quote for each loop and pass the content to it.

03:57.630 --> 03:59.820
Now try implementing that on your own,

03:59.820 --> 04:01.560
I'll be back with that in the next video.
