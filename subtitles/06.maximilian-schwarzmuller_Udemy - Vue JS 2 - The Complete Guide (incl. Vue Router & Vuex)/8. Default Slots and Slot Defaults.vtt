00:01.700 --> 00:09.230
As a side note what you can also do is you could remove the contents slot here and also remove the name

00:09.230 --> 00:15.590
for the second slot and then you would have a setup where you have one named slot, the title and one unnamed

00:15.590 --> 00:19.120
slot. Vuejs will treat the unnamed slot

00:19.130 --> 00:20.860
as the default slot,

00:20.990 --> 00:28.270
so everything we're passing in which doesn't have a name slot assigned, like title which has one, so the

00:28.280 --> 00:32.480
paragraph for example which doesn't have a name slot assigned to it,

00:32.600 --> 00:36.320
such content will automatically be rendered in the default slot.

00:36.410 --> 00:43.310
So saving this will yield us the same result as before simply by taking advantage of vuejs default

00:43.310 --> 00:47.580
behavior which renders unassigned content in the default slot here.

00:48.500 --> 00:55.220
Speaking of defaults, we learned how to render content in a default slot but we also can setup some

00:55.220 --> 00:57.620
default content to be displayed.

00:57.980 --> 01:02.460
Let's say we're not sure if we receive a third element,

01:02.690 --> 01:09.380
let's say we have a span here and in this span, we want to have some such subtitle slot,

01:09.440 --> 01:15.230
so here this name is subtitle and we don't know if we get some data passed in or not

01:15.230 --> 01:17.900
and actually it turns out we're not getting it here right,

01:17.900 --> 01:21.500
we only assign something to title and then to the default slot,

01:21.530 --> 01:26.110
we're not assigning something to the subtitle slot. For such a case,

01:26.150 --> 01:28.220
we could setup the subtitle here,

01:28.370 --> 01:33.940
so let's give it some styling so that we can really see the difference and make it a bit greyer.

01:34.140 --> 01:40.040
If I now save this, we see the subtitle here and this is the default content which we simply introduce

01:40.370 --> 01:44.050
by writing it between the opening and closing slot tag.

01:44.160 --> 01:50.090
Whenever we do insert content, this default content here in the middle will get replaced

01:50.180 --> 01:55.850
but it is displayed in a case where we don't have data being passed out from its outside,

01:55.850 --> 01:58.640
so in cases where it this slot is unoccupied.
