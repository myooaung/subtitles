Until now, we're loading the different users here in our header by having two different links where

00:08.300 --> 00:11.830
I hardcode the user ID, that's not very realistic,

00:11.900 --> 00:16.990
it would be more realistic to have like a list of users we can choose from and click them.

00:17.210 --> 00:20.570
And I also get these extra components we haven't used yet,

00:20.600 --> 00:22.670
turns out in the UserStart component,

00:22.700 --> 00:24.410
I do have such a list,

00:24.530 --> 00:28.530
so now time to change this and use this list instead.

00:28.760 --> 00:36.130
So I will remove the second link in my header here and go back to just /user here,

00:36.290 --> 00:43.040
if I click on user here and for that, I'll also adjust my user route to just be /user here or just use that

00:43.070 --> 00:51.590
as a path again so that my usual component now gets loaded. I also will remove all that content except

00:51.590 --> 00:53.370
for the navigate to home button

00:53.420 --> 00:56.730
but no worries, we'll soon start working with parameters again,

00:56.750 --> 01:00.910
I just want this to work fine again, like this.

01:01.070 --> 01:07.730
And now I want to implement some child routes, some nested routes because all the other user components

01:07.790 --> 01:12.380
start, edit and detail should be nested inside the user component,

01:12.380 --> 01:15.020
they all belong to the user feature,

01:15.320 --> 01:19.820
so they certainly should not be nested inside the home component or anything like that,

01:19.820 --> 01:25.520
instead I now want to have sub-routes in my user component so that we can load different components

01:25.580 --> 01:33.350
inside there. Well to do this, I need to configure my sub-routes here and I can do this by adding a

01:33.350 --> 01:37.280
new property to the route which should have some nested routes,

01:37.280 --> 01:44.750
it's called children and this is again an array of routes which will now be nested after or inside of

01:44.750 --> 01:45.740
this root route,

01:45.740 --> 01:52.070
so inside /user. Therefore in there, we again specify a couple of javascript objects where each

01:52.070 --> 01:53.290
has a path

01:53.600 --> 01:58.840
and the important thing is, if you now have a path which starts with a slash,

01:58.980 --> 02:05.840
this will again be appended directly after your domain, so example.com/ whatever you type here.

02:06.020 --> 02:10.530
If you leave away this slash though, it will be appended to this path,

02:10.550 --> 02:14.660
so the path of your parent route, so choose whatever you want.

02:14.660 --> 02:20.090
You can technically nest them with the paths starting after your domain

02:20.090 --> 02:26.640
or you can nest them technically and logically by also having your path reflect the nesting.

02:26.720 --> 02:32.030
But you don't need to do that, maybe you have a use case where they should be nested technically in the

02:32.030 --> 02:36.820
component, in the user component but they shouldn't be reflected in the path. Here

02:36.830 --> 02:40.690
I will choose the approach where I will append them to /user,

02:40.850 --> 02:44.420
so here I want to load an empty path actually,

02:44.450 --> 02:52.210
so just /user to load my UserStart component which of course I need to import,

02:52.340 --> 03:00.010
so that will be UserStart and I can already import user detail,

03:00.230 --> 03:00.980
whoops,

03:00.980 --> 03:08.310
user detail and user edit, just like that, user edit

03:08.580 --> 03:15.240
and then here I use user start but then I will have two other routes. The first one shall load a specific

03:15.260 --> 03:22.000
ID and the second one also uses the ID but then loads the edit page,

03:22.090 --> 03:27.820
I'm not nesting this in the user detail component here because I don't want to load it on the same page

03:27.850 --> 03:29.740
as user detail.

03:29.860 --> 03:35.420
So here, I now have my three subcomponents to my user component,

03:35.710 --> 03:40.720
now of course we also need a place to load them because they won't be loaded in our router vue here

03:40.720 --> 03:44.760
in the app.vue file because that is our root router

03:44.770 --> 03:46.590
but now we got nested routes.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.400
So we have to set up a new router

03:48.450 --> 03:50.670
vue in our user.vue file.

03:50.800 --> 03:57.440
So here I will simply add a new horizontal line to differentiate that and then have router vue there

03:57.550 --> 04:05.610
and now this will allow me to load this router vue or to load the sub-routes. We can already see this,

04:05.620 --> 04:11.680
if I reload this, we see the UserStart component is selected by default because I set it up to have an

04:11.680 --> 04:18.520
empty path after /user which is where I'm at right now and if I were to enter one here, we see

04:18.520 --> 04:19.790
the user details page,

04:19.810 --> 04:27.180
of course the one is not extracted right now but we see this works. So with that, we now improve this,

04:27.180 --> 04:35.560
now I want to make these list items here clickable to actually load another nested component namely the

04:35.560 --> 04:37.250
detail component, let's say.
