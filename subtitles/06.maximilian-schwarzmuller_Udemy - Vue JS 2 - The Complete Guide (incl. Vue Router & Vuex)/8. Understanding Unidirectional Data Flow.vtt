I think this is a good place to stop and have a look at how data or information travels in a vuejs

00:08.800 --> 00:09.900
application.

00:10.060 --> 00:14.110
We got a couple of components here, a parent and three child components,

00:14.200 --> 00:22.450
now generally if we want to reach out from one child to the other, that does not work because our communication

00:22.540 --> 00:28.870
is uni-directional which means it only travels from parent to children or from children to the parent

00:28.900 --> 00:31.380
but not from a child to another child.

00:31.720 --> 00:41.710
So instead we have to take the route that our parent gives us some method we can execute, when we execute

00:41.710 --> 00:43.990
this method provided by the parent,

00:44.020 --> 00:48.790
it was provided via prop, this will run in the parent.

00:48.820 --> 00:53.480
Alternatively, we would use a custom event to which the parent listened, listens,

00:53.500 --> 00:55.580
that is also possible

00:55.960 --> 01:03.310
and then the parent can pass the updated data to the child number three. This is this uni-directional data

01:03.310 --> 01:03.770
flow

01:03.790 --> 01:05.070
I was talking about.
