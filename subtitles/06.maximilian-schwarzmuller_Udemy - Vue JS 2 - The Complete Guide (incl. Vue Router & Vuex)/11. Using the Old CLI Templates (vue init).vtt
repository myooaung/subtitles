WEBVTT

00:02.180 --> 00:05.110
So with that there's was a lot about the new cli,

00:05.150 --> 00:06.960
there's one last thing I want to cover,

00:07.160 --> 00:09.600
what if you still want to use vue init? By default,

00:09.650 --> 00:16.410
this will not work because the new cli replaced that vue command which the old cli also used.

00:16.570 --> 00:21.350
So to make vue init work again, you just need to install a global package,

00:21.350 --> 00:26.810
you can run that or install that on Mac and Linux with sudo npm install -g, on Windows, it's just

00:26.820 --> 00:33.860
npm install -g and then the name of the package you need is @vue/cli init and this will

00:33.860 --> 00:36.560
now enable that init command again.

00:36.560 --> 00:43.520
So now you can run vue init again in exactly the same way as we used it in this course, so vue init, then which

00:43.520 --> 00:46.450
template you want to use and then the name of the project.

00:46.470 --> 00:49.320
So if you prefer this approach, you can still do that, 

00:49.340 --> 00:51.170
I can now still run vue init

00:51.270 --> 00:59.060
webpack-simple vue-old-cli for example, if I hit enter it will create a new vue project

00:59.060 --> 01:01.170
based on that old cli,

01:01.430 --> 01:02.940
so I can answer this

01:03.050 --> 01:04.290
and I got this project.

01:04.310 --> 01:07.810
So this is still possible with the help of this extra package,

01:07.820 --> 01:09.940
so now you really got the best of both worlds.

01:09.980 --> 01:15.270
You can stick to the old cli if you prefer that or use the new cli with all the great features

01:15.320 --> 01:16.910
I showed you in this module.
