00:01.940 --> 00:06.610
So in the last video, we decided on our general plan for the next videos,

00:06.620 --> 00:11.020
let's start with creating our components or the components we identified thus far.

00:11.300 --> 00:16.430
For that, I'll create a components folder and of course you could also create a different folder structure

00:16.520 --> 00:19.470
where you structure by feature for example

00:19.640 --> 00:24.850
but I'll stick to this since this looks about right for the size of this application.

00:24.890 --> 00:30.530
So here in this components folder, we'll certainly want a home.vue file for this home page we're

00:30.530 --> 00:31.400
landing on,

00:31.640 --> 00:36.990
we want a header.vue file let's say and then I'll create two subfolders in there.

00:37.010 --> 00:44.000
The first one I'll name portfolio and the second folder I'll name stocks,

00:44.000 --> 00:51.470
so for these two main features we have in our app. In the portfolio folder here, I want to create my portfolio.vue

00:51.770 --> 00:58.910
file so this main page and I'll also create a stock.vue file for the individual stock on this portfolio

00:58.910 --> 01:00.050
page.

01:00.050 --> 01:07.570
Now in the stocks file folder here, I'll create a stocks.vue file and I'll create a stock.vue file

01:07.560 --> 01:08.320
here too,

01:08.480 --> 01:14.870
now the two stock files here will have some shared code so you could also create one component and then

01:14.870 --> 01:16.840
simply control what should be displayed

01:17.060 --> 01:22.040
but as it turns out, there are quite a lot of differences even though on the first look, they look very

01:22.040 --> 01:22.780
similar.

01:22.910 --> 01:28.840
So whilst you could make it work to use one single component and adjust it to the context you're loading

01:28.840 --> 01:29.460
in it,

01:29.750 --> 01:37.430
I'm going to choose the more explicit, the more well specific route here of creating two different components

01:37.430 --> 01:42.320
for that but you can of course and that might be extra challenge, use one and the same component for that.

01:42.740 --> 01:44.210
Anyways we'll come back to this,

01:44.300 --> 01:49.470
let's continue with setting up our app here. With all these components here in place,

01:49.730 --> 01:55.720
I think a good start is before working on the individual components to simply mark them,

01:56.050 --> 02:01.850
so let's give each of them a template and I'll output a h1 tag where I say the home component

02:01.880 --> 02:06.180
and so on so that when we implement routing, I can see if that works.

02:06.290 --> 02:12.670
So I'm going to copy that code from here into my header where I of course want to say the header component,

02:12.920 --> 02:16.070
then here we got the stocks component,

02:16.070 --> 02:19.900
here we got the stocks stock component

02:20.360 --> 02:23.920
and here, we got the portfolio component.

02:23.930 --> 02:30.380
Well I didn't need to fill the stock component because we won't see that for now but anyways,

02:30.470 --> 02:34.480
the portfolio stocks compnents so now all components have a template at least.

02:34.580 --> 02:39.530
And with that let's say, now with the components sketched out of the main components created even though

02:39.530 --> 02:41.190
they didn't do much right now,

02:41.280 --> 02:45.830
in the next video, let's have a look at how we could set up the routes and that of course is as always

02:45.830 --> 02:51.320
a challenge for you, try to come up with the possible routing set up on your own before we then set it

02:51.320 --> 02:53.000
up together in the next video.
