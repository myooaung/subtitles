Welcome to another course module. Now that we had a detailed look at the general dom interaction with

00:09.180 --> 00:16.020
vuejs, how to connect it to the dom, how to work with the template, how to listen to events and so on,

00:16.050 --> 00:22.920
it's now time to dive into a little bit more advanced concepts with conditionals and lists, which means

00:23.280 --> 00:29.420
what if you only wanted to show a certain part of your page under certain circumstances.

00:29.460 --> 00:35.120
Well for that, we got some tools in the pocket which make that very easy

00:35.280 --> 00:39.830
and if you want to output let's say an array of data in a list or something like that,

00:39.900 --> 00:42.200
well vuejs got a tool for that too.

00:42.210 --> 00:46.790
So let's dive into this and learn how we can work with conditionals and lists.
