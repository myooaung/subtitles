00:01.670 --> 00:02.970
In this module, you

00:02.970 --> 00:06.450
learned a lot about cross component communication

00:06.590 --> 00:14.360
and I really really digged into it because it's so key to understand how props work, how custom events work,

00:14.360 --> 00:20.630
how buses work, what the difference between primitives and reference types is, how to pass data because

00:20.630 --> 00:24.790
that's a day to day task in application using components.

00:24.800 --> 00:31.100
I hope you feel comfortable using it and with that, time to move on to the next module which actually is

00:31.100 --> 00:37.640
the last module focused on components where we will learn some advanced or other things about components.

00:37.730 --> 00:38.760
So let's move on.
