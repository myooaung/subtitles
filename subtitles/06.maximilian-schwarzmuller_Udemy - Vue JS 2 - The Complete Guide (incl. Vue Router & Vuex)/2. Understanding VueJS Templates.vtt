00:02.220 --> 00:08.340
So back in JSFiddle, in a brand new project though a very simple one as you can tell, I do have my paragraph

00:08.340 --> 00:12.330
where I output a title and the title is simply is hello world here.

00:12.600 --> 00:18.030
So pretty much the same as we had in the first module, just different text, a little bit leaner,

00:18.030 --> 00:25.410
no event as of now because what I want to start with is this connection between this vue instance and

00:25.520 --> 00:27.530
this html code.

00:27.960 --> 00:34.080
I already explained that we have this kind of connection but there is one important thing to understand

00:34.410 --> 00:36.140
which I want to highlight right now,

00:36.420 --> 00:42.210
by creating this new vuejs instance there and note that we don't store in any variable, it is

00:42.210 --> 00:50.160
still created though by instantiating this instance, we do create this connection and vuejs then

00:50.160 --> 00:51.000
takes this

00:51.030 --> 00:55.920
html code up there and creates a template based on that code.

00:56.040 --> 01:04.410
And this is important to understand, vuejs does not add runtime, use our html code and have

01:04.410 --> 01:06.670
these commands in our html code.

01:06.720 --> 01:11.470
You can actually see this if we inspect this hello world text here,

01:11.820 --> 01:13.060
then you'll see that here

01:13.080 --> 01:18.540
of course we only have hello world, we don't see any curly braces, we don't see any other code which was

01:18.540 --> 01:23.680
added by vuejs, no hidden hint that there would be some magic going on,

01:23.790 --> 01:33.270
nothing at all. Vuejs creates a template based on our hmtl code, stores that internally and then basically

01:33.270 --> 01:40.870
uses this template to create the real html code which then is rendered as the dom.

01:40.890 --> 01:47.460
This is important to understand because this allows us to use template syntax like that and like all

01:47.460 --> 01:53.040
the other things I will teach you throughout this course, in the html code we write because it's not the

01:53.040 --> 01:55.980
one running in the browser in the end,

01:55.980 --> 02:01.080
there is this layer in the middle and this layer is the vuejs instance which takes our html

02:01.080 --> 02:09.030
code, creates a template, renders this template by for example entering the title here and then outputs

02:09.030 --> 02:12.570
the final html code which gets rendered here.

02:12.600 --> 02:18.660
You might have been aware of that already but if not, this is really important to understand why we were

02:18.660 --> 02:23.560
able to write the code as we do up here on the top left corner.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.820
With that out of the way,

02:24.910 --> 02:32.700
let's dive deeper into how we can interact with the dom through this template approach by using vuejs.
