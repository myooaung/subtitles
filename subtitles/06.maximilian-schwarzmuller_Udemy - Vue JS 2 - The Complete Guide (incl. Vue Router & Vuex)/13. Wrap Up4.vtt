00:01.640 --> 00:06.580
In this module we had a look at directives, both built in ones and custom ones.

00:06.650 --> 00:12.440
We learned that it is key to have the v- at the beginning and then the name of the directive follows.

00:12.440 --> 00:18.650
You also learned how to create global and local directives, how to pass arguments and modifiers and how

00:18.650 --> 00:24.890
to pass a value, both a simple value like a string or a more complex value like an object, like we do

00:24.890 --> 00:27.620
here in the second directive, in the local one.

00:27.720 --> 00:32.510
With that, you should be well-prepared to create your own directive and play around with the different hooks

00:32.510 --> 00:37.430
and the different things you can pass there, you can do with the element it sits on and so on.

00:37.460 --> 00:42.010
And with that, let's continue to other features namely filters next.
