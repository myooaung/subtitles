WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:06.430
So over this module, you learned a lot about axios,

00:06.530 --> 00:10.230
a very popular alternative to vue resource,

00:10.250 --> 00:17.150
you can use axios in any javascript project and therefore also in vue projects. Now,

00:17.360 --> 00:23.660
you see that axios offers many great features like global configuration, interceptors, custom instances

00:23.980 --> 00:30.560
and of course that using it is as simple as calling one method and then using the then method to handle the

00:30.560 --> 00:36.190
incoming response. Axios is very popular and I recommend looking into it,

00:36.410 --> 00:43.220
if you want to dive deeper into it, of course the place to go is the official axios documentation which you

00:43.220 --> 00:46.480
can find on the github page for axios,

00:46.610 --> 00:51.880
it's a great place to dive deeper and really fine tune it to your needs.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.860
So I hope this was helpful,

00:54.050 --> 00:56.030
let's continue with the other modules then.
