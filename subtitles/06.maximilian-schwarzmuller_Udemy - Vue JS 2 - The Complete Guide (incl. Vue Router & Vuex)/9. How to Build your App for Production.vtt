Now to wrap up this part here about the vue-cli and this template we're using here throughout the

00:07.380 --> 00:08.710
rest of the course,

00:08.760 --> 00:15.140
you also got another script besides npm run dev which we use before and that is npm run build.

00:15.150 --> 00:20.940
Now this will build it for production which means it will now actually create the dist folder as you

00:20.940 --> 00:25.580
can see which holds your bundle and it will also have some optimizations in place there,

00:25.650 --> 00:29.880
so minify it as you can see, it's minified now and so on.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.830
So this is how you want to run this command

00:31.830 --> 00:38.190
if you actually want to deploy your application. Also feel free to play around with the other templates

00:38.370 --> 00:40.850
but that was the basic introduction to it,

00:40.860 --> 00:43.940
This will be the template we'll use throughout the rest of the course

00:44.010 --> 00:47.370
and with that, see you in the section about components.
