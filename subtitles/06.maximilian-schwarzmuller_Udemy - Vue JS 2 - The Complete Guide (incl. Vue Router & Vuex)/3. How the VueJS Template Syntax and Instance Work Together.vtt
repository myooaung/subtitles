WEBVTT

00:02.050 --> 00:08.800
So we saw how we can output a single property stored in the data field of our vue instance

00:08.830 --> 00:15.470
and this is important, data stored in the vue instance, in the data property for example, the title here

00:15.890 --> 00:18.820
can be output in our template just like that.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.350
We don't need to write this.title,

00:21.440 --> 00:27.800
we don't need to write data.title, we have access to all the properties in the data object just

00:27.800 --> 00:28.850
like that.

00:29.120 --> 00:34.550
And that's really important to keep in mind, of course this makes outputting it very easy as we don't

00:34.550 --> 00:41.780
have to manually access our vue instance or save it in a variable which we then would access, no, 

00:41.810 --> 00:44.480
all of that happens behind the scenes for us,

00:44.600 --> 00:48.990
we can access all properties in the data object just like that.

00:49.110 --> 00:51.400
Not only in the data object though,

00:51.710 --> 00:58.490
if we reintroduce the methods key which we already saw in the first module of this course, where we can

00:58.490 --> 01:05.900
store some methods of this vuejs instance, then I can create a new method here and I will name it

01:05.930 --> 01:07.480
sayHello.

01:07.820 --> 01:14.540
Now sayHello of course is a function and all it does is it returns hello,

01:14.900 --> 01:17.810
so it returns a string.

01:17.810 --> 01:21.870
We can take our paragraph here and execute

01:21.890 --> 01:23.640
sayHello here,

01:23.750 --> 01:25.470
don't forget the parentheses.

01:25.670 --> 01:32.970
What this will do is that whenever vuejs renders our template, it will still parse this curly brace

01:33.010 --> 01:37.520
syntax and it will then execute the function inside of this.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.200
Now what do you think we'll get?

01:39.560 --> 01:46.280
I'll hit control enter here in JSFiddle to quickly re-update the html code and we can clearly see

01:46.280 --> 01:52.700
hello, this happens because it's perfectly fine to execute a function in between the curly braces,

01:52.730 --> 01:58.310
the important thing is that it returns something which can be output here in the dom,

01:58.310 --> 02:06.680
so basically something which can be converted to a string. No complex object or no return value

02:06.680 --> 02:07.160
at all,

02:07.160 --> 02:12.890
it has to be something which can be converted to a string and then it's perfectly fine to call a function

02:12.890 --> 02:14.490
like this.

02:14.540 --> 02:22.000
Second important take away, as you can clearly see, I'm accessing sayHello in the same way I before access

02:22.010 --> 02:26.530
title, without this, without methods, without anything in front of it.

02:26.780 --> 02:33.740
So we not only have access to everything stored in the data just by typing the name here but also to

02:33.740 --> 02:39.900
anything stored in the methods property, that is also something important to keep in mind.
