Now what is a filter? A filter is basically a little syntax feature you can use in your template to transform

00:10.930 --> 00:12.950
some output in the template

00:13.000 --> 00:14.110
and that is important,

00:14.140 --> 00:17.350
a filter helps you transform output in the data,

00:17.350 --> 00:23.620
it doesn't transform the data itself, it only transforms what the user sees, a typical example and

00:23.620 --> 00:29.680
actually a filter we will build is a filter which takes an input, a string let's say and turns it all

00:29.680 --> 00:37.180
to uppercase letters. Important, vuejs doesn't ship with built-in filters and therefore all the filters

00:37.180 --> 00:39.910
we need have to be built by our own,

00:39.940 --> 00:42.930
I will show you how to build such a filter now and thereafter,

00:42.980 --> 00:49.690
I'll also show you an alternative to filters and explain why this alternative oftentimes may be the better

00:49.690 --> 00:52.870
choice but let's start with building our own filter.

00:53.300 --> 01:01.960
So I want to build a filter, so let's say here in my application here, I have some data and in this data

01:01.960 --> 01:05.650
of course, I returned my data object as always, in this object

01:05.650 --> 01:10.330
I get some text I want to output, this text could simply be

01:10.450 --> 01:11.380
hello there.

01:12.270 --> 01:15.820
Now what I want to do is I want to output this text here

01:15.900 --> 01:21.330
and of course I can use string interpolation for that with double curly braces and with my server

01:21.330 --> 01:22.390
running, we see hello

01:22.420 --> 01:26.080
there, not too spectacular, has nothing to do with filters.

01:26.110 --> 01:29.940
Now I want to turn this text to be all uppercase,

01:30.090 --> 01:36.330
important thing is I don't want to make it uppercase in this data property itself, text should stay as

01:36.330 --> 01:37.140
it is,

01:37.230 --> 01:44.130
I want to give it back an uppercase form in the template only. For that, we will create a filter and

01:44.130 --> 01:51.100
we do create such a filter by adding the filters property here to our object,

01:51.120 --> 01:56.380
this will create a new filter which we can use in this components template.

01:56.490 --> 01:57.130
Important,

01:57.150 --> 02:02.130
this will register this filter locally so it can actually only be used in this template and the template

02:02.130 --> 02:09.920
of this component of this instance, you can of course also register a filter globally with vue filter.

02:09.930 --> 02:14.990
Now if you register it globally, you have as a first argument the name of the filter,

02:15.000 --> 02:20.350
let's name it to-lowercase for example

02:20.530 --> 02:22.350
and I will work on this in a second

02:22.580 --> 02:28.520
and here in our local filter, we have the key as the name for the filter,

02:28.540 --> 02:30.680
I'll name it to-uppercase,

02:30.950 --> 02:36.060
so like this maybe to-uppercase, of course I could have also used the camel case syntax we saw before

02:36.100 --> 02:37.370
for components.

02:37.520 --> 02:44.050
And now a filter is only a function and we can use such a string key name for a function,

02:44.060 --> 02:50.200
again the alternative would be to use toUppercase, like this.

02:50.220 --> 02:57.990
Now this function here always gets a value as the input, the value will be the data we want to transform

02:58.170 --> 03:03.000
and I will show you how to pass the data there in a second but be aware that each filter will get a

03:03.000 --> 03:04.770
value because that is what a filter's

03:04.770 --> 03:11.630
there for, transform some data. That value can then be used to do any operation on it

03:11.850 --> 03:16.710
and then in the end, we have to return the transformed value or could be the same value if you don't want

03:16.710 --> 03:19.400
to do anything but then the filters are that useful.

03:19.620 --> 03:24.410
So here I want to simply say return value to uppercase,

03:24.480 --> 03:30.480
this will turn it to all being uppercase, to all characters being uppercase and will return this updated

03:30.480 --> 03:31.530
value,

03:31.530 --> 03:38.020
I can then use this filter in this template since it is a local filter by adding the pipe symbol here,

03:38.040 --> 03:43.030
this might resemble Angular 2 pipes if you know Angular 2 and it works very much the same

03:43.200 --> 03:44.650
and then the filter name,

03:44.730 --> 03:49.650
so here that would be to uppercase, like that for example.

03:49.650 --> 03:53.760
Now with this registered here, I can now hit save

03:54.180 --> 04:00.540
and we see hello there in all uppercase and now with that, we created our own filter, this is how easy

04:00.540 --> 04:05.690
it is, just the function, getting a value and returning the transformed value.

04:05.760 --> 04:11.040
It gets the value automatically because we add it here with the pipe symbol and that will vuejs

04:11.220 --> 04:18.190
to take the piece in front of the pipe and put it or pass it as a value to this function, to the uppercase

04:18.240 --> 04:19.410
function.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.310
That is why we create such a filter,

04:21.330 --> 04:27.520
let me next show you how you create a global filter, how to register it globally as we do here

04:27.720 --> 04:29.970
and then how to chain multiple filters.
