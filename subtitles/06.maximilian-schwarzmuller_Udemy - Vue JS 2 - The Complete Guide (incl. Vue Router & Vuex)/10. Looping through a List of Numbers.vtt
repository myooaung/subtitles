00:01.660 --> 00:07.150
What if you only want to output a list of numbers? Let's say you want to output the numbers 1 to 10, that

00:07.150 --> 00:09.080
is very easy to do.

00:09.100 --> 00:18.070
You can output these numbers with a span, let's say, with v-for and then n in 10, n again is up to

00:18.070 --> 00:18.650
you

00:18.790 --> 00:23.550
but 10 of course clearly does not refer to a property in my vuejs instance.

00:23.830 --> 00:31.300
Instead if you specify a number here, vuejs will simply loop through the whole range of integers starting

00:31.300 --> 00:35.020
at 1 and going all the way up to this final number here.

00:35.350 --> 00:41.830
So then I could output n here again, n is a name of your choice and you see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:41.830 --> 00:47.200
6, 7, 8, 9, 10 over there on the right as we loop through these range of numbers.

00:47.240 --> 00:52.930
So that's a very short and quick and convenient syntax if you know that all you want to do is loop through

00:52.930 --> 00:55.020
these numbers from 1 to 10.
