In the last lecture we added route protection.

00:05.420 --> 00:10.830
Now of course it would also be nice to not even show a link to that route if we can't go there.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.400
So I need to adjust what I output in the header

00:13.430 --> 00:15.530
depending on the auth state,

00:15.640 --> 00:17.480
now that's super simple.

00:17.510 --> 00:18.640
Let's go to the store

00:18.650 --> 00:24.470
first of all and let's add a new getter and there, I'll name it isAuthenticated,

00:24.530 --> 00:31.260
you can choose any name you want. isAuthenticated is a method as all getters which receives the state and

00:31.260 --> 00:45.910
I simply return the result of a very trivial check, I'll see if state ID token is equal to null, not equal

00:45.910 --> 00:46.240
to null,

00:46.240 --> 00:52.080
I mean. If it's not equal to null, we are authenticated because then we have a token,

00:52.240 --> 00:56.190
so that is what I return. isAuthenticated is a getter

00:56.200 --> 01:01.730
I can now use in my header component, there I'll add my script tags,

01:02.080 --> 01:10.750
export the default object and add a computed property to map my getter to some property I can use in

01:10.750 --> 01:13.360
the header component, here

01:13.390 --> 01:15.600
I will name it auth,

01:15.700 --> 01:17.420
you can choose any name you want,

01:17.590 --> 01:24.190
it's a method as all computed properties and I will return the result of this, reach out to the store,

01:24.490 --> 01:33.580
getters and there, reach out to this new isAuthenticated getter we just added a second ago. As all getters,

01:33.730 --> 01:35.870
don't execute it as a function,

01:35.920 --> 01:37.690
use it as a property,

01:37.930 --> 01:39.900
vuex will do the rest.

01:39.940 --> 01:46.840
So now we get this isAuthenticated information from the store, in the header we can now use this auth property

01:46.840 --> 01:52.510
which this information is mapped to to only render the links we want to render.

01:52.780 --> 01:59.290
So for sign up, we can use v-if to only render this if we're not authenticated because signing up

01:59.290 --> 02:07.270
only makes sense if we're not authenticated, the same for sign-in, v-if not auth is the right check here.

02:07.690 --> 02:09.660
For the dashboard on the other hand,

02:09.820 --> 02:12.250
I want to check if we are authenticated,

02:12.490 --> 02:16.320
so this is what I then map. With this,

02:16.560 --> 02:22.520
if I go back to my application and reload, we can already see it,

02:22.590 --> 02:29.010
we get sign up and sign in, as soon as I do sign in though, we only got the dashboard.

02:29.010 --> 02:30.390
Now that's great,

02:30.390 --> 02:32.810
now we got a working UI update

02:32.820 --> 02:40.100
depending on the auth state. Speaking on the auth state, we can always reload to logout,

02:40.200 --> 02:44.700
by the way something we'll also work on later so that we persists the state,

02:44.970 --> 02:49.490
we haven't used that local storage thing from the slides at all yet.

02:49.830 --> 02:54.790
But before we move onto that, why don't we add a logout button too,

02:54.810 --> 02:56.330
wouldn't that be nice?

02:56.340 --> 02:58.510
Let's do this in the next lecture.
