We get our blinking directive,

00:03.310 --> 00:09.100
that's nice but it would also be nice if we could control both colors, not just the main color and the

00:09.100 --> 00:11.320
interval over which it should blink,

00:11.350 --> 00:15.190
so how long each color should remain there. To do this,

00:15.220 --> 00:20.160
I simply need to pass in a more complex thing than just a string here,

00:20.380 --> 00:23.010
I can pass in an object as a value.

00:23.150 --> 00:33.160
Now here, I could set up the main color to be red and the second color to be let's say green and then

00:33.220 --> 00:39.130
another key could be the delay which shall be let's say 500 to make it blink faster.

00:39.130 --> 00:42.520
Now with that being an object, I need to adjust my code here,

00:42.860 --> 00:48.450
here I access binding color here for example where I retrieve the main color.

00:48.610 --> 00:55.330
I want to access binding and now value but then main color,

00:55.360 --> 00:58.760
I know I do have access to this because I pass it here,

00:58.900 --> 01:03.610
of course you could introduce a check to make sure that this really is passed, here I know I do always

01:03.610 --> 01:05.620
pass it so I will take the shortcut.

01:06.130 --> 01:10.390
Let's do the same here for the second color, like this,

01:11.140 --> 01:16.510
I can do this because value now simply is an object I'm passing in, vuejs doesn't care what type

01:16.510 --> 01:22.030
this argument or I shouldn't say argument, this value of the directive has, could be a string as before,

01:22.030 --> 01:26.000
it can be object like here and then we can use it like an object.

01:26.020 --> 01:32.710
Now that also means that I can set up the interval here by accessing binding value delay and of course,

01:32.710 --> 01:37.110
I also need to adjust this down here where I also use my binding value, here

01:37.120 --> 01:40.570
I want to use the binding value but then access main color, here

01:40.600 --> 01:45.760
I'm not alternating so main color is all in need. With this in place, let's see this in action,

01:46.120 --> 01:52.660
and we do see it change faster between green and red which are the two colors we set up here.

01:53.140 --> 01:59.260
And that is how we can write our own directive, register it locally and make it more powerful with multiple

01:59.260 --> 02:05.070
modifiers, with a more complex data being passed there as a value and our own argument.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.740
This is what I wanted to show you

02:08.110 --> 02:11.260
and with that, you should be well-prepared to write your own directives.
