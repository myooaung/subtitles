Great, so we learned how to use slots and how to be careful about where things gets changed,

00:08.340 --> 00:15.130
so regarding the styling which is changed by the child and all the other stuff, the vuejs related things

00:15.340 --> 00:21.180
which are changed or applied in the parent component where the template is actually set up.

00:21.340 --> 00:26.280
Now what if we wanted to kind of do this a bit differently here?

00:26.710 --> 00:31.240
Let's say I'm still passing my title and I'm passing my paragraph

00:31.510 --> 00:37.920
but then here in my template, I want to have them rendered in two different places,

00:37.990 --> 00:45.220
so let's say here in this div, I have another div and in there, I want to have my title because this

00:45.220 --> 00:49.660
has a class title let's say which will receive some special styling,

00:49.990 --> 00:57.870
let's say title would simply a font-style of italic

00:58.320 --> 01:02.390
and thereafter we would have a horizontal line and then we would have the content.

01:02.580 --> 01:09.570
So I somehow want two different slots, one for the title and then one slot for the content, 

01:09.570 --> 01:11.180
how can we achieve this?

01:11.610 --> 01:19.430
Well if I save it like that, we simply have it twice and one time italic, one time not because now

01:19.430 --> 01:23.230
with two slots, the content is simply inserted twice.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.840
It could be the behavior we want,

01:24.840 --> 01:28.590
maybe you want to render it twice but here I want to split it up,

01:28.610 --> 01:33.140
I want to render the title in the first slot and the paragraph in the second slot.

01:33.140 --> 01:42.720
So how do I acheive that? Well we can set up named slots, so I can give this slot a name of let's say

01:42.720 --> 01:47.260
title and the other slot will receive a name of content

01:47.580 --> 01:54.710
and then in the parent component where I have the content I want to pass, I can go here and add a new attribute,

01:54.720 --> 02:01.740
this would be slot equals title. So slot of course is not an official html attribute, that's an

02:01.740 --> 02:10.080
attribute implemented or introduced by vuejs and known by vuejs and vuejs will detect this slot

02:10.420 --> 02:15.710
attribute and then knows that the part between quotation marks is the name of the slot

02:15.720 --> 02:17.520
it should render this content in,

02:17.640 --> 02:20.340
so in this case, this first slot.

02:20.340 --> 02:26.430
Now let's also set this up for in a paragraph where I say slot equals content and if I now save this

02:27.750 --> 02:29.420
and let it reload,

02:29.530 --> 02:31.950
we now see it split up as I wanted it.

02:31.990 --> 02:36.040
I do have my quote up here and then I do have the content,

02:36.040 --> 02:40.940
it's not wonderful anymore to be very honest but it behaves exactly how it should,.

02:40.950 --> 02:47.020
It distributes our content in two different slots and we tell it how to distribute it by setting up

02:47.020 --> 02:47.850
names.
