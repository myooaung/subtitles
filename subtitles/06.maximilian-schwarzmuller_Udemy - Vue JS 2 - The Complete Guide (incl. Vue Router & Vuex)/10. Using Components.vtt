00:02.120 --> 00:03.130
Well now that we

00:03.130 --> 00:09.610
in the last video learned about this template option and that we can mount our instance like this,

00:09.950 --> 00:12.210
well we can continue with that thought.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.600
What if we wanted to create a reusable component

00:15.610 --> 00:21.040
to insert this template in multiple places because maybe it would be something more than hello,

00:21.050 --> 00:26.300
let's say it would be a complex template displaying something which you want to display in several places

00:26.360 --> 00:28.190
on our page.

00:28.200 --> 00:36.860
Now if you wanted to do that, well one thing we could do of course was we could simply say that we don't

00:36.860 --> 00:47.960
want to append the child to get element by ID app3 but instead I'll comment this out here for now and I'll

00:48.060 --> 01:00.520
add the el ref here, again to select let's say everything which has this selector of hello.

01:00.770 --> 01:07.970
So this element of course doesn't exist but I'm trying to replace the template of every hello element

01:08.390 --> 01:09.870
with this template.

01:10.070 --> 01:15.290
So let's insert some hello elements, here is one and then another one

01:15.290 --> 01:19.500
and of course this is no official html element but let's see if this works.

01:19.580 --> 01:24.660
If I hit control enter, it only replaces the first occurrence.

01:25.010 --> 01:28.070
What if we changed this to use the class hello?

01:28.250 --> 01:32.970
If we then say div class, hello like this

01:34.010 --> 01:35.590
and we repeat this,

01:38.790 --> 01:43.580
if I now hit enter, also only one hello

01:44.040 --> 01:48.730
and if I remove both of them as well as this unnecessary div here,

01:48.780 --> 01:50.880
well then there is no hello, of course.

01:51.120 --> 01:57.300
So this does not work with this element, it only takes the first one so I'll revert this but it would

01:57.300 --> 02:00.460
still be nice to have such a reusable component, wouldn't it?

02:00.720 --> 02:09.240
Well we can create such a component and I can create it by simply going up there and registering one

02:09.570 --> 02:11.870
with vue component,

02:12.120 --> 02:18.030
this allows me to create a new component which I can then reuse in all my other vue instances, in all

02:18.030 --> 02:20.400
the templates of these instances.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.830
Vue component takes as a first argument the selector of the component,

02:23.860 --> 02:24.470
let's name it

02:24.480 --> 02:25.280
hello

02:25.560 --> 02:31.560
and the second argument is a javascript object which is similar to the object we passed to a vue

02:31.560 --> 02:32.730
instance but not equal,

02:32.730 --> 02:34.840
for example data is used differently

02:35.100 --> 02:40.050
and I'll come back to that in the component section in this course where we will dive much deeper into

02:40.050 --> 02:44.590
components and learn how we can utilize them much better than by doing so

02:44.730 --> 02:49.930
but these are the first steps with them so I will show you how to use it like this.

02:50.290 --> 02:51.590
So let's have a template

02:51.870 --> 02:58.700
where we now again have this h1 hello element here which I want to reuse

02:59.250 --> 03:05.830
and now I can use this component I created here, I registered it globally by running vue component

03:05.830 --> 03:07.720
so I can now use it everywhere,

03:07.740 --> 03:14.090
for example here in app2 because app3 will get replaced with its own template entirely

03:14.090 --> 03:19.030
so that would not be a good example but in app2, we don't do this so let's enter hello here.

03:19.050 --> 03:26.390
This new element which clearly is the default element but the one we just created and indeed we see hello over

03:26.390 --> 03:28.600
there and if I enter another

03:28.670 --> 03:29.110
hello

03:29.150 --> 03:31.100
in this app2 div,

03:31.300 --> 03:36.430
well then we see two hellos and the third one is from the third instance down here.

03:36.770 --> 03:43.730
So with that, we now get a reusable component with its own template using the same template property as we

03:43.940 --> 03:45.240
do down here

03:45.350 --> 03:52.310
but now utilizing us or giving us the possibility to use that all over the place in our application.

03:52.940 --> 03:58.850
Now that has some limitations and I'll come to these limitations in the next video and especially

03:58.850 --> 04:04.730
in the components section where we dive deeper into that and learn how to really use components and

04:04.730 --> 04:07.750
how we can utilize them better than we're doing here.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.880
But it is important for you to take away,

04:09.920 --> 04:16.910
there is a way to create such reusable parts in your application, to give them their own templates, to

04:16.910 --> 04:22.610
give them their own selector by which you can then enter them. That again of course is no built in

04:22.680 --> 04:29.630
selector, hello doesn't exist, there is no hello element, we just told vuejs to replace every hello

04:29.630 --> 04:36.830
element with this template and how it differs to a normal vue instance where only the first occurrence

04:36.890 --> 04:43.040
is replaced and where we can't use it as a reusable selector. With vue component we can

04:43.040 --> 04:48.800
but again we'll dive deeper into this in the components section. With that I'll get rid of it here

04:49.920 --> 04:54.420
so that we revert to the no component state again and can continue with that.
