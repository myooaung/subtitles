WEBVTT

00:01.790 --> 00:10.610
The important thing to know here is that whatever we export here, this object is a vue instance or

00:10.610 --> 00:16.140
is the same object we use in a vue instance, we will later on use this as a component,

00:16.340 --> 00:22.940
we can use it like here with the render function to render that, it is used as a vue instance and therefore

00:22.940 --> 00:24.860
it has the same properties,

00:24.890 --> 00:28.500
so we can setup methods there, we can setup computed there,

00:28.720 --> 00:33.890
we also can setup data there but I'll come back to data because there's something special about using

00:33.890 --> 00:34.740
data there.

00:34.760 --> 00:40.160
So the key takeaway is this object behaves like a vue instance, as a side note,

00:40.160 --> 00:43.850
you don't have to export this, using this file like this is fine too,

00:43.880 --> 00:50.240
it will work, as you can see here we see Hello world still because the script is not required but it

00:50.270 --> 00:54.420
is required if you want to attach some business logic to this template

00:54.530 --> 00:59.890
and if you for example want to use string interpolation there, well then you would here in this object

00:59.900 --> 01:04.580
setup your data field with the data properties you want to interpolate and so on.

01:04.580 --> 01:06.560
So this is how this file works

01:06.560 --> 01:08.850
and what's so important to understand about it.
