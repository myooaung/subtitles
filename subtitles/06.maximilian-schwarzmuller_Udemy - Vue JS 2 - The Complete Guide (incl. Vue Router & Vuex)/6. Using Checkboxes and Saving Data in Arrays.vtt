00:01.800 --> 00:04.830
Great, so we had a look at the basic input fields up there,

00:04.830 --> 00:10.200
we learned about modifiers and learned how to set up a text area, so multi-line strings.

00:10.200 --> 00:16.350
Now it's time to come to more complicated inputs, though it's not that difficult to be honest but I want

00:16.350 --> 00:23.370
to have these checkboxes here hooked up so that we can see if these are checked with true or false and

00:23.370 --> 00:27.580
then thereafter, we'll have a look at radio buttons and a dropdown here.

00:27.750 --> 00:32.680
Well let's start with the checkboxes first, over in the html code,

00:32.970 --> 00:37.570
we see that here is the code responsible for the checkboxes.

00:37.590 --> 00:41.460
I do have two check boxes which are inputs here nested inside of a label,

00:41.460 --> 00:48.300
that is how we set it up in Bootstrap, in the css framework I'm using here and there, we basically then

00:48.300 --> 00:52.140
have them well to look like they look here.

00:52.140 --> 01:01.050
The important thing now is we want to bind these inputs here to a specific model, to a specific property.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.120
To be very precise,

01:03.120 --> 01:09.030
what I want to achieve here is we're in the area of selecting which kind of mails we want to receive

01:09.030 --> 01:10.070
in this example, right,

01:10.080 --> 01:16.640
we can check the mail and the normal mail and then some info mails and I want to add that both into

01:16.650 --> 01:23.180
one array because that would make sense to have one property storing an array of mails we want to receive.

01:23.250 --> 01:29.400
We could store it because while we get our values here, so we could simply store these strings in an

01:29.400 --> 01:33.020
array and then once we loop through the array, well we can easily see

01:33.070 --> 01:38.780
okay we got the send mail value and we get the send info mail value or only one of the two.

01:38.910 --> 01:42.300
So that allows us to see which mails the user wants to receive,

01:42.330 --> 01:46.760
how can we tell vuejs to do that for us, to add this to an array?

01:47.010 --> 01:50.040
Well first of all I'm going to set up the array down there,

01:50.130 --> 01:55.560
so after the message I'm adding send mail and this is an empty array by default because we haven't checked

01:55.560 --> 01:56.690
anything

01:56.850 --> 02:03.790
and then I can go up to my checkboxes and now I again add v-model and the important thing is to add

02:03.790 --> 02:04.900
it to the input,

02:04.920 --> 02:12.310
so not to the surrounding label, not to the surrounding div, to the individual input. The module I want to bind

02:12.420 --> 02:20.370
to is of course send mail, so this property I just created down there, this array and the same is

02:20.370 --> 02:21.550
true for the other input,

02:21.570 --> 02:23.530
I use the very same model here.

02:23.610 --> 02:31.800
So I'm binding two inputs to the same model and what vuejs will do for me is it will detect this,

02:31.890 --> 02:33.400
it will detect that

02:33.540 --> 02:39.990
well we got a say in the same model here, that we got two checkboxes here and will automatically merge

02:40.030 --> 02:49.530
the values of these checkboxes into this single array we set up there. So we can see this if I scroll

02:49.530 --> 02:53.040
down and here where I output send mail,

02:53.190 --> 02:55.760
I want to output all the elements in the array,

02:55.890 --> 03:02.340
I already prepared a list item here where I can simply loop through all my items in the sendMail array.

03:02.370 --> 03:10.170
So here, item in sendMail and sendMail of course refers to this array, the array again which I'm binding

03:10.170 --> 03:17.410
up here on my checkboxes and with that, I can simply loop through that and then here output the item

03:17.410 --> 03:21.660
to output all the strings saved in the array so all the checkboxes checked.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.970
Well let's see if that works as we want it to work,

03:24.970 --> 03:29.990
now we can fit it on one page and if I hit send mail, you see it's added down there to the list,

03:30.010 --> 03:35.970
if I add send info mail, that is also added and if I remove send mail, we only have send info mail.

03:36.190 --> 03:42.880
So this is how we can add the values of checkboxes to an array and we can again tell vuejs to use

03:42.880 --> 03:44.130
the same array,

03:44.170 --> 03:48.310
we'll be simply using the same model here on our checkbox input fields.

03:48.370 --> 03:53.710
If we would have different models, different properties, well we would store it in different properties of

03:53.710 --> 03:54.290
course

03:54.460 --> 03:59.050
but if you want that behavior which is not that untypical if you've got a group of checkboxes,

03:59.230 --> 04:03.080
this is how easy vuejs makes it for you to use it like that.
