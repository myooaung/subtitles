Now we already learned a lot about some built-in validators, now before we move towards this array here

00:09.240 --> 00:15.100
where we can add multiple hobbies which of course is interesting when it comes to a validation perspective,

00:15.450 --> 00:19.410
let's move to this check box and let's do two things,

00:19.410 --> 00:29.670
I want to make sure that it is required but only if let's say the country is not any country of your

00:29.670 --> 00:36.180
choice, so let's say if it's not Germany, just picking a random country because well I'm coming from there,

00:36.360 --> 00:42.150
let's say if it is Germany, then you don't have to tick that box because for some complex legal reasons

00:42.150 --> 00:48.720
which we have in Germany, we are not allowed to force you to accept the terms, something like that.

00:48.990 --> 00:58.340
So we essentially have a required if condition or to be very precise, a requiredUnless condition, you're

00:58.350 --> 01:04.930
required to check this unless you picked Germany in a totally different input.

01:04.980 --> 01:12.330
Now I think that's also an interesting case and it's surprisingly easy to implement,

01:12.450 --> 01:14.590
so how can we implement it?

01:14.610 --> 01:18.910
Let's first start with a general required rule for the checkbox,

01:18.990 --> 01:27.120
I'll name this terms, this rule and I'll simply required the required validator, the normal one.

01:27.120 --> 01:34.560
Now with that set up, I can go up to my template and there on this checkbox input, going to distribute this

01:34.560 --> 01:35.660
over multiple lines,

01:35.820 --> 01:42.290
I want to listen for the @change event which is fired whenever we click this input, this checkbox

01:42.420 --> 01:47.800
and I then want to trigger $v.terms was the name of the validation group,

01:47.810 --> 01:48.590
$touched,

01:48.810 --> 01:51.610
as before, touch not touched.

01:52.170 --> 01:58.560
So this is the method I want to execute, now to see if something changes I'll add my old class to this

01:58.650 --> 02:00.750
my class binding to this wrapping div

02:00.930 --> 02:07.260
where I'll add the invalid class if $v.terms has $error.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.510
With that let's go back and let's see if that works,

02:10.530 --> 02:17.280
right now it's not marked as invalid because we have set this up to only be marked as invalid if we

02:17.280 --> 02:21.330
have an error and an error is only fired once we had a chance to click

02:21.480 --> 02:26.400
but if I do click here and I uncheck this, it's marked as invalid.

02:26.500 --> 02:33.280
On a side note for this specific case, it might be more helpful to not check for

02:33.390 --> 02:39.120
$error but $invalid to mark it as invaled right from the start

02:39.120 --> 02:43.180
when we load this page so that it's obvious we need to check this.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.440
So this is working but this is the normal required validator,

02:46.440 --> 02:48.490
now we want to use this other one.

02:48.540 --> 02:53.450
First of all let's import it, requiredUnless is the name

02:53.790 --> 02:57.330
and this allows us to connect this with some other value.

02:57.330 --> 03:05.970
So now, I'll still name this required but I'll assign requiredUnless as a value and just as sameAs, this

03:05.970 --> 03:07.020
is a function.

03:07.050 --> 03:15.900
Now for this function as before, we receive access to the vue instance and now here, we can return true

03:15.900 --> 03:16.890
or false,

03:17.010 --> 03:24.420
if I return true here, we go back, you see that's now always treated as correct no matter what I

03:24.420 --> 03:28.350
do, if I return false, it's always treated as invalid

03:28.350 --> 03:31.100
therefore, if I go back you see it's always red.

03:31.630 --> 03:35.060
Of course, hard coding true or false doesn't make much sense

03:35.100 --> 03:41.190
but we can now check if vm and now we have to check the name of this dropdown,

03:41.220 --> 03:45.930
so that was country, we're binding to a property named country.

03:46.050 --> 03:55.530
We want a check if country is essentially not equal to Germany because that is the value we have for

03:55.590 --> 03:57.600
this option which is treated as invalid

03:57.600 --> 03:58.470
as I said.

03:58.770 --> 04:08.490
So we simply check here if vm, country is the property name, if it is equal to Germany, what this means is

04:08.490 --> 04:15.640
that if country is Germany, then it is required because here we have requiredUnless, so unless the country

04:15.640 --> 04:17.510
is Germany, it is required.

04:17.640 --> 04:23.130
So the required validator, the normal required validator will be attached if the country we selected

04:23.130 --> 04:24.280
is not Germany.

04:24.300 --> 04:30.240
So with that, if we go back and reload this page, you see it's still red at the beginning, if I

04:30.260 --> 04:34.380
check it, it's fine though because it works as a normal required validator now,

04:34.380 --> 04:40.920
if we switch the country to Germany though, you see it becomes black in all cases because now

04:40.920 --> 04:42.510
it's not required anymore.

04:42.780 --> 04:47.530
So this is required if another nice validator which also shows you

04:47.520 --> 04:50.010
another powerful feature of vuelidate.
