00:02.590 --> 00:05.810
Welcome, one important note about this module,

00:05.810 --> 00:12.490
this module is about authentication and to really follow through this module smoothly,

00:12.530 --> 00:17.980
I strongly recommend going through the axios module first because just like the

00:18.010 --> 00:25.430
axios bonus module, this module was added after the course was released to add some extra content to

00:25.430 --> 00:26.450
the course.

00:26.450 --> 00:33.620
It actually use the same project as I use in the axios module and it uses axios for reaching out

00:33.620 --> 00:34.450
to the web.

00:34.610 --> 00:39.320
So if you already know this or if you're willing to dig through the code on your own, you may skip the

00:39.320 --> 00:40.490
axios module,

00:40.540 --> 00:47.270
otherwise I recommend at least going through the axios module, skipping through it so that you know what

00:47.270 --> 00:49.820
we're actually working on in this module.
