00:01.910 --> 00:04.800
So this is how we can use a slot, with this slot

00:04.810 --> 00:11.990
keyword here, with the slot component kind of. It's important to understand where the code we're passing

00:11.990 --> 00:13.970
in here is compiled though,

00:14.420 --> 00:18.280
so let's check this for example with the style.

00:18.380 --> 00:26.240
If I set a style of styling my h1 tag here to have a red color and keep in mind we're passing an

00:26.240 --> 00:27.990
h2 tag actually,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.010
okay so let's style h2, let's see,

00:31.010 --> 00:33.110
so you think this will change the styling?

00:34.250 --> 00:35.210
It does,

00:35.390 --> 00:39.750
so the styling of that component is used here,

00:39.860 --> 00:45.690
so the child component styling is applied to the data being passed in from outside,

00:45.710 --> 00:47.610
that's the first key take away.

00:47.780 --> 00:55.790
So if I remove this here and put it in the style tags here of the parent so that I set the color to red

00:55.820 --> 01:00.600
there and set this also to scoped, do I think it will now work too?

01:00.880 --> 01:01.650
No.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.830
So that's the key takeaway as I said,

01:04.100 --> 01:06.760
the styling of the child applies,

01:06.890 --> 01:16.230
so here I would have to set my h2 style in the child to color the passed in h2 tags.

01:16.250 --> 01:21.410
So even though the h2 tag is not written in this template but in the parents template, we do pass

01:21.410 --> 01:22.280
it here in the end,

01:22.310 --> 01:25.750
so that is very the style, like this.

01:25.880 --> 01:31.650
There is a second important thing to keep in mind and that works exactly the other way around,

01:31.950 --> 01:35.280
let's say the quote here would be some dynamic content,

01:35.330 --> 01:42.950
so in the vue instance here, we would have our data function it is which returns the actual data object

01:43.250 --> 01:50.060
and in this data object, we would have our quote title which simply is a string saying the quote and then

01:50.060 --> 01:52.890
up here, we want to interpolate this,

01:52.910 --> 01:55.620
so here we output quote title.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.190
Do you think this will work?

01:57.230 --> 01:58.010
Let's have a look,

01:58.880 --> 02:01.120
actually it works.

02:01.170 --> 02:09.900
So for compiling the template which means rendering any kind of vuejs operation we're doing here,

02:09.900 --> 02:16.710
the styling is something different but for anything else, the component where you actually have the code

02:16.770 --> 02:20.390
in the template will be the one doing the changes.

02:20.520 --> 02:27.600
So here the app component or the app root instance of vuejs here is the one doing the changes

02:27.630 --> 02:34.620
because even though we pass it to the child component, it is in this components template that we use in

02:34.620 --> 02:35.630
the first place.

02:35.670 --> 02:40.630
Yes it gets passed down but still it's written in these components template,

02:40.680 --> 02:47.390
so here is where we can use any vuejs syntax we know including v-if, v-for, anything.

02:47.430 --> 02:48.420
So that's the difference,

02:48.420 --> 02:51.330
the styling is setup on the child component,

02:51.480 --> 02:58.410
everything else is handled on the parent component and this scope of compilation compared to the styling

02:58.410 --> 03:00.580
scope is important to keep in mind.
