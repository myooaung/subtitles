We saw event modifiers in the last video, we not only have event modifiers we also have key modifiers.

00:08.520 --> 00:09.870
To demonstrate them,

00:09.900 --> 00:14.010
let me add an input field here. In this input field,

00:14.100 --> 00:20.700
I want to listen to the key up event which obviously is fired whenever the user releases the key and the

00:20.700 --> 00:22.680
key goes up. Here

00:22.700 --> 00:30.540
what I want to do is I want to throw an alert, so I'll call this alert me here and then down there in the

00:30.540 --> 00:36.540
methods property, I'll add the alert me function.

00:36.540 --> 00:40.940
So this shall get executed whenever we type something into this input field

00:41.070 --> 00:45.120
and here I simply want to throw an alert which says alert.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.210
Now this will probably get very spammy,

00:48.330 --> 00:52.950
I save this and I type here and yeah I get alerts,

00:53.100 --> 00:59.130
not really the best user experience. Maybe I only want to send an alert if I submit this,

00:59.130 --> 01:04.460
so if I hit enter let's say. We can add a key modifier for this,

01:04.500 --> 01:11.940
so like before with .stop for the event modifier, a key modifier is also added by adding dot and

01:11.940 --> 01:13.030
then the name of the key,

01:13.050 --> 01:21.180
for example enter. You will find attached to this lecture a list of available modifiers or where to find out

01:21.390 --> 01:26.630
which modifiers exist, .enter exists, you would also have .tap, .esc,

01:26.650 --> 01:31.450
you can also chain them for example by typing .space.

01:31.590 --> 01:37.300
And now if I hit enter, control enter and now I type here, we don't see anything but I hit space,

01:37.320 --> 01:39.530
we saw the alert, I hit enter,

01:39.540 --> 01:41.430
we see an another alert.

01:41.430 --> 01:45.730
This is how we can add our own key modifiers here

01:45.750 --> 01:51.210
and again a link to all the modifiers can be found attached to this lecture.

01:51.210 --> 01:57.410
This enables us to only listen to specific keys but of course, these modifiers are only available for

01:57.450 --> 02:01.360
key related events like key up here, which makes sense I guess.
