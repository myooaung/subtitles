00:01.900 --> 00:07.530
Now in the last lecture, we already created our first Vue application and got started with it.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.860
Now let's enhance it a little bit more before I

00:09.880 --> 00:14.410
then of course dive much deeper into it in the next course sections.

00:14.410 --> 00:18.790
So what I want to do right now though is I want to add an input field.

00:18.790 --> 00:24.150
I can do this by typing input and hitting tab which will give me that JSFiddle and now in this

00:24.170 --> 00:29.740
input here I want to allow the user to type something there and update my title depending on what the

00:29.740 --> 00:30.880
user enters.

00:31.210 --> 00:37.810
Well, I can do this by adding a command to this input field here, an instruction Vue.js will recognize. This

00:37.810 --> 00:39.690
is called a directive.

00:39.720 --> 00:45.970
The directive I need is v-on and this is just set a special command Vue.js will recognize.

00:45.970 --> 00:49.300
Keep in mind this whole part is under control of Vue.

00:49.630 --> 00:55.170
And then the thing this v-on command tells Vue.js is,

00:55.240 --> 00:58.470
please listen to some event. Now which event?

00:58.480 --> 01:04.330
I pass this as an argument and arguments are passed to directives by adding a colon and then the name

01:04.330 --> 01:05.000
of the argument;

01:05.020 --> 01:09.790
in this case the name of the event I want to listen to. It's the input event which is fired on every

01:09.790 --> 01:10.880
keystroke.

01:11.080 --> 01:17.260
And then I assign a value to this and between the quotation marks I would now write the code which I

01:17.260 --> 01:18.550
want to execute

01:18.590 --> 01:20.770
whenever this gets updated.

01:20.950 --> 01:26.720
So here what I want to do is, I want to call a method and calling a method is very simple.

01:26.740 --> 01:29.450
I can simply call changeTitle here.

01:29.470 --> 01:31.420
Now of course this method doesn't exist yet,

01:31.540 --> 01:35.780
so let's create it. Creating methods is simple. As with data,

01:35.790 --> 01:40.990
Vue.js has also got a reserved property in the Vue instance which is called methods; and no worries,

01:41.020 --> 01:46.630
you will learn about all these reserved property names and how they work throughout the course. methods is again

01:46.630 --> 01:47.610
an object

01:47.620 --> 01:53.350
and here we simply set up all the methods we want to use either in our template or from within our

01:53.350 --> 01:54.620
Vue instance.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.810
So here I named it changeTitle up there,

01:56.830 --> 01:57.500
so let's name it

01:57.520 --> 02:01.300
changeTitle here too. This is a function therefore,

02:01.520 --> 02:05.040
and now in this function I want to change my title.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.870
And here's the first important thing,

02:07.030 --> 02:08.240
I won't say data.title

02:08.260 --> 02:09.720
or something like that;

02:09.880 --> 02:12.980
Instead I can say this.title =

02:13.180 --> 02:19.280
Now 'this' (referring to the data object) certainly looks a bit strange and it is strange.

02:19.330 --> 02:26.500
It's some magic being done in the background by Vue.js. It proxies all our data properties like title

02:26.770 --> 02:29.740
to the top Vue instance object automatically;

02:29.770 --> 02:31.820
which is why we can access it with 'this'.

02:31.870 --> 02:36.520
I will come back to this later in the course, but for now it's just important to keep in mind you got

02:36.520 --> 02:42.880
access to all the properties stored in data and also to all the methods stored in methods by accessing

02:42.880 --> 02:44.030
them with this.

02:44.080 --> 02:44.960
and then the name.

02:45.100 --> 02:51.010
So this title gives me access to the title stored here and now I want to assign you value to user entered

02:51.010 --> 02:52.150
into the input.

02:52.430 --> 02:58.870
Well thankfully, as with vanilla JavaScript, there is this event object being created automatically

02:58.870 --> 02:59.390
for me.

02:59.410 --> 03:04.230
This has nothing to do with Vue.js, this is vanilla JavaScript and how that DOM works.

03:04.270 --> 03:09.790
I get this event object which, for example, also stores the target of the event which of course will be this

03:09.790 --> 03:11.380
input field.

03:11.390 --> 03:18.340
Now this event object which is created automatically by JavaScript is passed to this method automatically

03:18.340 --> 03:19.600
by Vue.js.

03:19.600 --> 03:25.180
So I can fetch it because I know it will receive an argument and I'll name it event. This again is this default

03:25.180 --> 03:27.730
event object created by JavaScript.

03:27.730 --> 03:34.210
Now you can simply say event. I know that this default object has a target property and I know that the target

03:34.210 --> 03:39.700
will be the input field of which I know it will have a value property holding the value the user entered.

03:40.090 --> 03:45.790
Well and with this in place, that's all if we now Ctrl-Enter again we see this input and if we type

03:45.790 --> 03:48.910
something there we see that it updates our title.

03:48.940 --> 03:50.340
This is awesome I'd say.

03:50.380 --> 03:55.150
This is our first Vue.js application and we built it in like eight minutes.

03:55.150 --> 03:56.320
Really awesome!

03:56.590 --> 04:02.380
So with that, let's see how you can work your way through this course, what this course has to offer, how

04:02.380 --> 04:05.860
you could set up the same example locally on your machine,

04:05.920 --> 04:09.870
before we then dive super-deep into Vue.js and the next lectures.
