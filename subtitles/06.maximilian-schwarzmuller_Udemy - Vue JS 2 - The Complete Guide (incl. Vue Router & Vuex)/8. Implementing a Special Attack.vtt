00:01.990 --> 00:08.560
In the last lecture, we refactored our code so that we have this checkWin function checking if we are

00:08.560 --> 00:13.840
lost or won and that we also have a new function for calculating the damage.

00:13.850 --> 00:16.630
With that, the attack function is working fine,

00:16.630 --> 00:24.080
we now want to implement the special attack. I can generally copy the code from up here, as a side note

00:24.100 --> 00:27.100
always a good sign that you can refactor something,

00:27.270 --> 00:33.670
but for here I will leave it like this and I'll set up this to deal damage between 10 and 20 since it is our

00:33.670 --> 00:35.440
special attack.

00:35.740 --> 00:42.820
Now in here, I of course also want to check if we won after dealing this special attack here and there

00:42.820 --> 00:47.600
after, we again want the monster to attack and this should always deal the same damage,

00:47.740 --> 00:50.200
so I can copy the code from up there.

00:50.510 --> 00:58.970
And yeah we get some code duplication here, especially the monster attack which is always the same, deals  

00:59.010 --> 01:00.130
the same damage,

01:00.310 --> 01:02.460
that is something we might outsource,

01:02.470 --> 01:07.690
yes we could also refactored the player damage but I will leave it here so that we can quickly see what

01:07.690 --> 01:08.850
each attack does

01:09.040 --> 01:18.130
but I definitely want to refactor the monster damage. So let's do this, I'll add a new function which I'll

01:18.190 --> 01:21.670
name monsterAttacks,

01:21.700 --> 01:29.740
this is a function here and in this function here, I simply copy in the code I just copied where I reduced

01:29.740 --> 01:32.580
the player health and deal this damage.

01:32.590 --> 01:39.820
This now means that here where the monster dealt damage, I can now simply execute this monsterAttacks

01:39.820 --> 01:41.620
like that, here

01:41.630 --> 01:46.290
too, and with this in place, let's have a look at the application again.

01:46.420 --> 01:51.640
Let's start attack, special attack, dealing more damage, yeah we're clearly winning here,

01:51.850 --> 01:52.590
you won,

01:52.600 --> 01:56.410
new game. Works just as well as before,

01:56.410 --> 02:01.760
now with an extra attack and the monster damage now also refactored

02:01.780 --> 02:03.990
to have a bit more cleaner code.

02:04.030 --> 02:09.530
Next we want to implement the healing and go away from dealing damage to healing damage.
