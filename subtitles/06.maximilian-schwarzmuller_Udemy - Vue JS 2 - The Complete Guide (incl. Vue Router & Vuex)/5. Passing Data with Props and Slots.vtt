00:01.830 --> 00:07.830
So we created the single quote component, we got the quotes props being passed into quote grid

00:07.830 --> 00:09.750
from the app file,

00:09.750 --> 00:16.310
so with that here in the quote grid, I can simply use this single quote.

00:16.620 --> 00:24.600
Therefore of course I have to import it from the quote.vue file and I have to register it in the

00:24.600 --> 00:28.070
components property of this object here.

00:28.260 --> 00:36.230
Now here I simply will assign app quote as a selector quote, like this and then I'll use it, app

00:36.240 --> 00:46.230
quote. Of course I want to use v-for on this component here and on the form, I want to loop through

00:46.260 --> 00:49.290
all my quotes.

00:49.420 --> 00:59.110
Now for that, I will simply say quote in quotes and now I want to pass the content with simple string interpolation

00:59.230 --> 01:04.920
between the opening and closing tag of app quote because I want to use the slot thereafter.

01:05.140 --> 01:09.260
So here I will pass quote like that and if I save this,

01:09.590 --> 01:14.110
well we don't see anything because in my app.vue file, I'm not using this,

01:14.110 --> 01:22.810
so let's go to the app.vue file and import the quote grid there from the components folder and then

01:22.810 --> 01:25.540
QuoteGrid.vue file

01:25.660 --> 01:28.250
and let's register it there as a component too.

01:28.300 --> 01:35.600
So in the components property, we want to have our app quote grid which refers to this imported quote

01:35.630 --> 01:36.530
grid

01:36.760 --> 01:42.070
and then I can simply say app quote grid in the container.

01:42.070 --> 01:45.400
Now I need to pass the quotes to that,

01:45.430 --> 01:52.240
so here I'll add a property, quotes, this attribute to the app quote grid selector because I'm expecting

01:52.240 --> 02:00.990
quotes as props here and then quotes is bound with a colon at the beginning to the quotes array in there,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.140
so I'm passing the array to the quote grid.

02:04.270 --> 02:07.490
Now when I save this, we see that single quote,

02:07.600 --> 02:11.110
not super beautiful right now but we're getting there.
