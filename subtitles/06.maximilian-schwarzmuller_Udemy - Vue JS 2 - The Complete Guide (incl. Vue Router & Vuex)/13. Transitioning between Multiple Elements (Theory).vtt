00:02.270 --> 00:09.260
Now thus far, we only look at the case that we have an element we animated in and then we want

00:09.260 --> 00:11.990
to remove this element, like this.

00:11.990 --> 00:14.350
Now this is only one use case,

00:14.370 --> 00:21.560
oftentimes you also want to switch or switch between two elements, so that as soon as the one element

00:21.590 --> 00:25.270
is removed, you start animating in another one.

00:25.280 --> 00:30.410
This would be a typical use case and now I want to show you how to set up such a transition from one

00:30.410 --> 00:31.920
element to another one.
