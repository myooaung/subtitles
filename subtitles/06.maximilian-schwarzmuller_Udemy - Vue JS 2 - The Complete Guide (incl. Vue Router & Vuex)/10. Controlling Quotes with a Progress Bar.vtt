00:02.070 --> 00:10.550
Well to implement this progress bar, I'll add a new component, I'll name it header.vue, so the file

00:10.550 --> 00:12.700
is named header.vue and in there,

00:12.720 --> 00:20.870
I want to set up this component. I'll copy in a prepared template which you find attached to this file,

00:20.880 --> 00:23.490
it's basically the normal bootstrap progress bar,

00:23.520 --> 00:27.770
so you can also head over to getbootstrap.com and fetch it there.

00:27.820 --> 00:31.400
This is the progress bar without any content though,

00:31.770 --> 00:37.840
the state of the progress bar is controlled by controlling the width of it,

00:38.010 --> 00:40.680
you will see this in a second.

00:40.680 --> 00:47.520
Now with this progress bar set up, I can go back to my app.vue file and here, I want to import this,

00:47.550 --> 00:55.410
so here I will import my header and add a new component, app header which uses this imported header

00:55.890 --> 01:01.340
and then in the vue here, I can simply add app header, like this.

01:03.570 --> 01:12.960
Now for this to look good, I also should give this a class of row here though and also wrap this in a

01:12.960 --> 01:16.470
div spanning the full width,

01:16.540 --> 01:20.190
so let me quickly do that, add this and

01:20.210 --> 01:27.480
now, let's simply save this and we see the progress bar though it's empty of course because as I said,

01:27.810 --> 01:36.460
we have to adjust the width of this inner div here to control how far this progress bar has moved. Now

01:36.510 --> 01:41.310
we don't have any width set up right now so we don't see any change therefore,

01:41.310 --> 01:47.460
now let's change this. To set the progress,

01:47.460 --> 01:55.560
I'll add my script part to the single file where I export my default object here, this vue instance and

01:55.560 --> 01:57.100
I'll set up my props

01:57.240 --> 01:59.110
and I want to get two props,

01:59.250 --> 02:04.670
the quote count and the maximum number of quotes, max quotes.

02:05.210 --> 02:09.470
I'll take care about passing this information pieces in a second,

02:09.480 --> 02:11.250
I first want to use it.

02:11.760 --> 02:20.700
I want to output some text in the progress bar, the number of quotes, to do so, I will simply output the

02:20.790 --> 02:27.550
quote count and then also the maximum number of quotes.

02:27.580 --> 02:30.200
Now notice this slash here,

02:30.240 --> 02:31.780
it's not dividing that,

02:31.800 --> 02:34.650
that's no operation, no arithmetic operation,

02:34.650 --> 02:37.910
we do have two different pieces of string interpolation,

02:37.980 --> 02:42.360
that's just some text which will be displayed so that we see 5 of 10

02:42.360 --> 02:50.310
for example. I also need to set the width and I will do this in a new line so that we can clearly see this.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.840
I would bind to the style attribute with colon style,

02:53.860 --> 02:55.820
we learned this earlier too

02:56.170 --> 03:03.840
and here I want to dynamically set the width, so the width property of this or the width style of this div.

03:03.970 --> 03:05.590
How do I set this?

03:06.190 --> 03:12.630
Well I want to calculate the quote count divided by the maximum number of quotes,

03:12.820 --> 03:17.670
so if we have five quotes and the maximum is 10, that would be .5,

03:18.010 --> 03:25.990
so I have to multiply with 100 to have 50 and then I need to express this in percentages, or in percent,

03:26.110 --> 03:28.450
so I need to add plus percent.

03:28.470 --> 03:33.940
This will convert it to a string and attach percent, the percentage sign at the end,

03:34.030 --> 03:39.730
so that in the end this will result to a style of width and then let's say 50%

03:39.730 --> 03:43.960
in the case of 5 items. This is what will result from this finding,

03:43.960 --> 03:49.250
now I need to make sure that both quote count and maximum quotes gets passed correctly.
