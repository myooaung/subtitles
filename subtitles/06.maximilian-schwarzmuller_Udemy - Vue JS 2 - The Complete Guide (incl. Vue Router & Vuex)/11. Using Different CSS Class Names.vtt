00:01.660 --> 00:03.910
Finally consider the following use case,

00:03.910 --> 00:07.030
do you know Animate.css?

00:07.360 --> 00:11.470
This is a nice little library of animations you can use,

00:11.800 --> 00:17.650
so here you basically get some animations you can use out of the box by simply attaching some css

00:17.650 --> 00:19.190
classes to your elements

00:19.360 --> 00:25.590
and if we visit the github page, we can see a detailed well explanation on how it works.

00:25.840 --> 00:31.830
So I want to use it here, I'll grab the link from the CDN here and then go into my index.html file where I

00:31.830 --> 00:38.280
want to attach it in my head here, like this,

00:38.310 --> 00:45.240
so now I got my CDN import here attached and then if we have a look, we can see that we can use

00:45.240 --> 00:50.310
any animation from this package by adding the animated class and then the name of the animation we want to

00:50.310 --> 00:51.860
use to an element.

00:51.870 --> 00:55.050
Now I want to use such animation when adding my element,

00:55.050 --> 01:01.980
the problem we have of course is let's say I went to animate this newly added transition here which

01:02.010 --> 01:07.390
initially appears, the problem we have is whatever name we specify here

01:07.440 --> 01:12.960
vuejs will always use this name and then the enter, enter-active and so on classes.

01:13.260 --> 01:18.100
Now for this package, this will not work because we need to add the animated class

01:18.240 --> 01:21.020
and then let's say the bounce class if we wanted to use that.

01:21.150 --> 01:27.930
So how could we tell vuejs to use different classes than the ones it uses by default?

01:28.230 --> 01:32.700
Well with some extra attributes we can set up on the transition element here,

01:32.730 --> 01:38.910
I'll show you which ones. On this transition element, we already set up name and appear but we could

01:38.910 --> 01:40.680
configure it even more,

01:40.830 --> 01:43.220
we can override the default classes

01:43.250 --> 01:44.790
vuejs attaches.

01:45.060 --> 01:51.180
So if we set up name like fade here, it would add fade entrance on but we don't have to use these

01:51.180 --> 01:52.240
classes,

01:52.440 --> 01:57.910
instead I can remove name here and explicitly tell vuejs which class to attach

01:57.920 --> 01:59.510
at which point of time.

01:59.810 --> 02:01.700
So we can tell it the

02:01.710 --> 02:08.460
enter class here, by adding this attribute we could say well the default is always v-enter or if we

02:08.460 --> 02:10.730
set up a name, our name enter,

02:10.830 --> 02:13.730
we could add any class we want to attach here.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.480
Now I don't want to attach a class here because I don't need to,

02:16.590 --> 02:19.070
I'm interested in the enter-active class,

02:19.080 --> 02:20.570
so I want to override this

02:20.730 --> 02:23.580
and here, I want to attach the animated class,

02:23.670 --> 02:28.350
this is the one I always need to attach to play animation with this framework, with this library

02:28.350 --> 02:30.380
and then here, I want to use the bounce animation,

02:30.420 --> 02:36.770
so I will also add bounce here, and this should already be enough to animate in with this bounce animation.

02:36.810 --> 02:39.880
Now we can also override of course the leave class,

02:39.960 --> 02:46.500
I don't need a specific class here which is set for this one frame but I do need a specific class for

02:46.500 --> 02:51.270
the active case, so when it is playing the animation. Here I want to,

02:51.450 --> 02:55.770
well let's pick a different one maybe not bounce, let's say here we want to use shake,

02:56.040 --> 02:57.870
so I will add shake here.

02:58.120 --> 03:03.450
Now that I'm telling vuejs don't use your default, don't use v-enter, v-enter-active class,

03:03.480 --> 03:08.900
don't use my name-active, my name-enter-active class and so on,

03:09.090 --> 03:13.870
instead use these classes here at these points of time.

03:13.890 --> 03:16.880
Now for these empty classes here, we need to remove them

03:16.890 --> 03:18.190
otherwise we will get an error

03:18.210 --> 03:21.190
because vuejs would try to attach something which isn't there.

03:21.210 --> 03:26.310
I just wanted to show you that you have all these four configuration items at your hand but of course

03:26.310 --> 03:27.180
you don't need to use them

03:27.180 --> 03:30.460
and if you don't use them, don't set them up to be empty here.

03:30.690 --> 03:37.290
So with this change, let's view our application by reloading and there you see it's playing the animation

03:37.290 --> 03:41.050
we wanted it to play, jumping and bouncing around.

03:41.160 --> 03:46.740
One thing to keep in mind here though is it looks like when setting up your own classes here, appear

03:46.740 --> 03:53.780
does not work with them, so that looks like it only works when used with the default way or the default

03:53.790 --> 03:54.600
classes.

03:54.710 --> 03:59.230
Maybe something which will get fixed but didn't work at the point of time I recorded this video though.
