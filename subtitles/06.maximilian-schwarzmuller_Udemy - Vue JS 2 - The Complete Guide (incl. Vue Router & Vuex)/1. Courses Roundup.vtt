Wow you're amazing, I really really have to say that. You worked your way through this course and we

00:08.410 --> 00:11.360
all know that was a lot of content,

00:11.380 --> 00:18.900
I'm very very confident that you feel confident in vuejs now and that you feel confident about building

00:18.950 --> 00:20.780
vuejs applications now.

00:20.950 --> 00:25.690
What are the next steps? The next steps are to continue practicing,

00:25.690 --> 00:27.420
set your own challenges,

00:27.550 --> 00:32.010
think about some apps, some example apps you could build and then build them with

00:32.010 --> 00:39.490
vuejs. Dive into the official documentation in the API references to really learn about the last

00:39.490 --> 00:43.830
missing or very advanced pieces you might find there,

00:43.900 --> 00:46.630
understand how all the concepts work together

00:46.720 --> 00:54.450
and with that, you're on the great road to success and to really be a successful vuejs developer.

00:54.490 --> 00:56.190
I wish you all the best.
