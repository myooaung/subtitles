Now with the current state here, we're not executing any animation, we're not executing any code besides

00:07.000 --> 00:08.620
logging it to the console

00:08.710 --> 00:13.330
but you see that all these events get emitted and our hooks get called.

00:13.330 --> 00:17.060
Now before we start adding some javascript code, I want to highlight something.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.140
We're not using css here, right,

00:19.180 --> 00:24.490
we're doing everything through javascript which is why we need to call the done function down there.

00:24.610 --> 00:30.900
Now if we don't use css, we might also tell vuejs, we don't get an error if we don't tell it

00:31.090 --> 00:37.180
but if we do tell it, it can skip the step of determining whether we do have a css animation attached

00:37.180 --> 00:37.830
or not.

00:37.870 --> 00:43.530
Because keep in mind, if we don't have name set up, that doesn't mean it doesn't look for css classes

00:43.540 --> 00:44.350
to attach,

00:44.380 --> 00:50.290
it means it looks to attach v-enter, v-enter-active and so on and it will find that these classes don't

00:50.290 --> 00:56.740
exist but we can skip this checking if we know well we won't attach once because we don't want to use

00:56.740 --> 00:57.560
them here.

00:57.910 --> 01:02.630
So you can tell it by adding colon css false,

01:02.770 --> 01:09.010
now colon css instead of just css because we want to pass a boolean here and not pass false as a

01:09.010 --> 01:09.760
string,

01:09.760 --> 01:12.280
this is why we need to use attribute binding.

01:12.280 --> 01:17.880
Now with false being passed here, this means don't look for css classes,

01:17.890 --> 01:19.030
we don't use them

01:19.030 --> 01:24.610
so you may skip the step and you immediately execute these hooks here, so that we can take over

01:24.670 --> 01:25.550
with javascript.
