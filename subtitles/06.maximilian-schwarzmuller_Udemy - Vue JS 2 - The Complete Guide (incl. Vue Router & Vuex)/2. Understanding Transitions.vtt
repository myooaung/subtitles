Let's start with the basics, with a simple transition. Consider this case, we have an element which currently

00:09.330 --> 00:10.660
is not attached to the dom,

00:10.680 --> 00:18.570
let's say some div and we use v-if or v-show to trigger or to check some condition, whether this should

00:18.570 --> 00:19.840
be attached to the dom.

00:20.070 --> 00:24.020
Now the condition becomes true, resolves to true so the elements should be attached

00:24.120 --> 00:29.300
and right now, we used v-if, v-show and that instantly attached it or instantly removed it.

00:29.490 --> 00:33.440
Well we could and also animate the attaching to the dom

00:33.540 --> 00:37.950
and then it would also be nice if you could animate the removal from the dom

00:37.950 --> 00:43.560
so once we click the button again, let's say, so that in the end state we still don't have the element

00:43.560 --> 00:43.990
maybe

00:44.010 --> 00:47.320
but we animated both the appearance and the removal.

00:47.490 --> 00:55.590
Well we can do this with a specific element or component, a wrapper vuejs offers us, this transition

00:55.590 --> 00:56.010
element.

00:56.040 --> 00:59.140
So let's have a closer look at this in the next video.
