00:01.670 --> 00:09.920
So finally at the end of this module, it was quite a bit of work I guess. Vuex is a powerful tool in large

00:09.920 --> 00:15.310
applications but it can seem very intimidating in smaller applications.

00:15.500 --> 00:21.230
It's up to you to decide if it's worth the extra effort especially when diving into namespaces like

00:21.260 --> 00:24.500
we did here at the end which as a side note is of course optional,

00:24.500 --> 00:27.760
you can use vuex as we used it before.

00:27.860 --> 00:34.540
So it's up to you to decide, is it worth it or not? In the next course module, we'll use it in our final

00:34.560 --> 00:35.820
course project,

00:35.840 --> 00:43.490
so that will hopefully get you some more practice using it and make it easier to make this decision

00:43.490 --> 00:47.170
and to see how much effort it really is in a real application.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.500
So let's move onto that.
