I already set up some classes in the css file here, here I got my player turn and monster turn classes

00:09.430 --> 00:13.170
which color the background in different colors, red and bluish

00:13.170 --> 00:20.560
basically. I want to attach these classes to my list item here by and I'll

00:20.680 --> 00:24.300
put this over multiple lines so that it's easier to read,

00:24.330 --> 00:34.850
so by simply adding a binding to class here with the colon at the beginning to bind to the class property here

00:35.150 --> 00:37.660
or the class attribute to be precise

00:37.780 --> 00:46.880
and I want to bind an object where I either attached a player turn let's say or the monster turn

00:46.890 --> 00:52.760
class, these are the classes set up in the css file. And the condition for the player turn class

00:52.820 --> 00:56.620
is if turn isPlayer is true,

00:56.630 --> 01:05.190
this is why I do have is isPlayer field here which I set true for each player action and false in

01:05.200 --> 01:11.380
the monster attacks function and therefore, the monster turn should be attached

01:11.380 --> 01:14.810
if turn isPlayer is not true,

01:14.890 --> 01:19.200
hence the exclamation mark. With that if I save it and reload,

01:19.240 --> 01:24.110
we now see we get some color coloring here, we get nicer styles

01:24.310 --> 01:30.070
and with that, we get a finished application with all the functionality I wanted to have with the working

01:30.070 --> 01:30.770
buttons,

01:30.850 --> 01:32.550
some nice styling,

01:32.710 --> 01:37.490
everything handled conditionally and dynamically by vuejs.

01:37.570 --> 01:42.160
And I hope you saw how easy it was to create this application with vuejs.
