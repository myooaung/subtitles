WEBVTT

00:02.240 --> 00:08.510
One thing we can do for example and I mentioned this earlier on the slide is we can add plugins after

00:08.600 --> 00:09.590
we created this

00:09.680 --> 00:15.020
and for this, of course we need to know which plugins exist. All plugins including the ones you could

00:15.020 --> 00:19.280
create manually have to follow a certain naming pattern,

00:19.280 --> 00:26.870
the package is published on npm have to be named vue-cli-plugin- and then the name

00:26.990 --> 00:29.910
of the plugin and you can choose that name on your own

00:29.930 --> 00:31.680
if you are developing such a plugin

00:31.820 --> 00:36.130
and here we already see some plugin, well suggestions by Google.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.380
There also are some official plugins,

00:38.390 --> 00:40.830
they are stored in @vue/cli-

00:40.880 --> 00:44.770
plugin folder, there we have things like babel linting,

00:44.780 --> 00:47.920
these were the options you could choose from during the set up

00:47.960 --> 00:53.240
but if you add your own ones or if you want to use plugins developed by other vue developers, well then

00:53.480 --> 00:55.760
you would name the package just like this.

00:55.820 --> 01:02.670
And here for example, let's look at that have vuetify plugin, we can install that plugin into our project and

01:02.690 --> 01:03.540
to install it,

01:03.560 --> 01:07.980
we don't need to run npm install but for packages which are named like this

01:08.030 --> 01:08.870
and that's important,

01:08.880 --> 01:13.460
this has to be the name, you can run a command in the terminal

01:13.460 --> 01:17.150
and this is the normal terminal here just opened in my project

01:17.420 --> 01:20.180
and that command is vue@

01:20.180 --> 01:23.440
and then just the last part of that name,

01:23.450 --> 01:25.290
so here we can add vuetify.

01:25.580 --> 01:27.380
So I can run vue@vuetify

01:27.650 --> 01:34.220
and it will automatically find this package because it follows that naming convention and we'll install

01:34.220 --> 01:40.060
it and set it up and run through any prompts this plugin might ask me.

01:41.080 --> 01:46.840
You'll find a link to how you can create your own plugins in the last lecture of this module so that

01:46.840 --> 01:50.460
you get a deeper understanding of how you could create your own plugins

01:50.470 --> 01:55.600
and this is of course a cool feature because it makes your app very extensible and it's easy to add

01:55.600 --> 01:59.320
new features to it after you create the project.

01:59.320 --> 02:05.200
So here the cli, the vuetify cli plugin for example asks me if I want to use a certain premade

02:05.250 --> 02:11.800
plugin which would replace some of my files and let's choose yes here maybe, we can choose a custom theme,

02:11.960 --> 02:12.280
I'll hit

02:12.320 --> 02:19.300
no, the other card components, now that's something vuetify specific which would simply mean we install

02:19.300 --> 02:23.340
or we import each component on its own to keep our bundles small so

02:23.350 --> 02:30.570
let's use yes. Yeah let's add a polyfill and let's hit enter and now this will install the package, the 

02:30.580 --> 02:31.290
npm package,

02:31.330 --> 02:34.700
we could have done that without the vue cli, with npm install

02:34.780 --> 02:41.650
but the thing it does besides that is that it adds this extra configuration, these extra prompts, it changes

02:41.650 --> 02:44.650
the project as you saw, it changed our files.

02:44.700 --> 02:48.890
And if I now bring up that dev server again and for that, I have to quit it first,

02:48.940 --> 02:53.560
you should quit it and restart it after well doing bigger changes like this,

02:53.560 --> 03:00.570
if I now run that again, whoops, npm run service command, now it will start the development server

03:00.570 --> 03:05.400
again and hopefully the vuetify plugin didn't break anything, so we should still see a working

03:05.400 --> 03:06.360
app here,

03:06.840 --> 03:07.820
yes we do

03:08.250 --> 03:15.630
and this is now using vuetify and gives us that default set up which we installed with our prompt answers.

03:16.380 --> 03:20.600
And that is how to think about the new cli, it's plugin driven,

03:20.640 --> 03:26.430
you can set up a configuration which is very detailed when you create a new project and you can always

03:26.550 --> 03:28.550
add plugins to the existing project

03:28.550 --> 03:33.420
thereafter. You can also still install packages without the cli of course,

03:33.420 --> 03:39.150
you can still run in a new terminal window here, npm install and then whichever package you need

03:39.150 --> 03:41.880
because not every package you need is a vue cli

03:41.880 --> 03:44.240
plugin, for example axios

03:44.520 --> 03:47.780
as far as I know doesn't have a vue cli plugin yet,

03:47.880 --> 03:53.030
so if you install axios, you still would have to do it like this and then you can use it as taught in

03:53.060 --> 03:54.970
the axios module of this course.

03:55.140 --> 03:56.850
So you are not limited to vue

03:56.880 --> 03:58.080
cli plugins only

03:58.230 --> 04:03.060
but if you got such a plugin, installing and adding it is particularly easy.
