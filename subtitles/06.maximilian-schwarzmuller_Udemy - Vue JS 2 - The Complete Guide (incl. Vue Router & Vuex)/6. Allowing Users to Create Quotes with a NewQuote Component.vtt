00:01.720 --> 00:10.360
We're able to display the quote here. Next, I want to implement the method to add new quotes, now for that,

00:10.370 --> 00:12.360
I'll first add a new component,

00:12.500 --> 00:21.150
the NewQuote.vue file. I'll copy the code from the quote grid here and insert it there

00:21.530 --> 00:26.280
and now how should this behave or what do we need in this new quote file?

00:26.500 --> 00:29.350
Well first of all I don't need to import the quote,

00:29.540 --> 00:33.650
second, I don't need props and I won't have components in there too,

00:33.680 --> 00:36.340
so let's empty this object for now.

00:36.350 --> 00:38.660
Now what shall we have in the template?

00:38.690 --> 00:51.070
I want to have a row and in this row, I also want to have a div with a class of col-sm-8 and some offsetting

00:51.130 --> 01:05.820
for nice or styling, col-sm-offset-2, col-xs-12, col-md-6 and col-md-offset-3.

01:05.840 --> 01:12.230
Now that is all brand new to you, that are just some bootstrap styles to make the grid look possibly as good

01:12.230 --> 01:17.990
as possible on all different device sizes and widths mainly.

01:17.990 --> 01:30.660
So inside here, I want to have my label quote and I want to have my text area,

01:31.110 --> 01:35.900
now for that to work, I need to wrap everything here

01:36.660 --> 01:38.330
in a form.

01:38.400 --> 01:43.610
Now we have learned about forms and I will come to them in the next course module,

01:43.620 --> 01:46.350
here is a very very simple preview,

01:46.350 --> 01:47.700
it's not that hard.

01:47.940 --> 01:54.680
So we have our default html form tag with our column in there, with the quote label and the text area

01:54.690 --> 02:02.670
field and that text area gets a class of form control, bootstrap styling and on the wrapping div, we have

02:02.670 --> 02:03.670
a form group,

02:03.720 --> 02:05.650
also a bootstrap style here,

02:05.700 --> 02:11.220
a bootstrap class to give this some nice styling. On that text area,

02:11.230 --> 02:16.140
I want to set up three rows so that's a normal html attribute

02:16.410 --> 02:20.390
and then I will bind it with two-way binding to quote,

02:20.460 --> 02:23.940
this is how you work with forms in vuejs, you use that

02:23.970 --> 02:27.550
v-model thing and I'll come back to this in the next course section.

02:27.600 --> 02:33.170
We already learned about two-way binding though so it should be rather easy to understand what's happening

02:33.180 --> 02:33.840
here,

02:33.870 --> 02:44.010
we need to set up this data function, return an object and in this object here, there we want to bind

02:44.230 --> 02:50.310
or we want to set up this quote property which is empty string initially to which we're binding

02:50.310 --> 02:51.960
from the text area,

02:51.960 --> 02:57.540
so this will get set whenever we enter something here in this text area.

02:57.990 --> 02:59.650
Well that's one thing,

02:59.670 --> 03:05.670
the second thing is I'll copy this column here and in there,

03:05.700 --> 03:12.890
I only want to have a button with the button and button primary bootstrap classes attached to it where

03:12.900 --> 03:16.170
I say add quote. Now on there,

03:16.170 --> 03:27.130
I simply want to add the click listener and say create new, execute this method and I will add the prevent

03:27.220 --> 03:33.040
modifier to prevent the default behavior because I don't want to submit the form, I don't want to send a request

03:33.040 --> 03:34.980
to the server, that will reload the page,

03:34.990 --> 03:36.130
I don't want that.

03:36.130 --> 03:42.490
Instead I want to prevent the default and only execute the create new method which I'll now add here in

03:42.490 --> 03:45.220
the methods key or object,

03:45.280 --> 03:55.060
here I'll have my create new method, ES6 style and in there, all I want to do is I want to emit this

03:55.060 --> 03:57.500
new quote.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.270
Now we solved that before

03:59.300 --> 04:02.870
but I'll come back to this in the next video you when I finally will send

04:02.890 --> 04:05.830
the quote created here to the parent component.
