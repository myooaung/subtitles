00:01.710 --> 00:06.300
Now let's finish up this module by having a look at the submit button here.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.740
Right now we're not using it,

00:07.800 --> 00:10.530
I'm always displaying all the data down there.

00:10.530 --> 00:13.670
Now I want to simply hook up this submit button,

00:13.710 --> 00:17.140
so I want to add a click listener to it

00:17.190 --> 00:23.460
and on this click listener, I will add prevent to prevent the form submission because this button here

00:23.460 --> 00:26.490
is the only button in my form element

00:26.760 --> 00:32.160
and if you get a button in a form element, it will by default once you hit it, submit that form to the

00:32.160 --> 00:32.670
server.

00:32.670 --> 00:36.450
Now we don't want to do that because our server is not the place where we want to handle it,

00:36.450 --> 00:37.990
we want to handle it with vuejs,

00:38.070 --> 00:38.940
.

00:38.990 --> 00:43.860
therefore the prevent modify makes sure we're not sending a request to the server, instead we prevent

00:43.920 --> 00:47.200
this default behavior and let vuejs handle that.

00:47.430 --> 00:50.350
So here I will simply add an event or method

00:50.370 --> 00:52.410
I want to execute, submit it

00:52.650 --> 01:00.590
and then I need to add this here to my methods property or object down there in my vue instance, here

01:00.600 --> 01:07.940
I got my submitted method and here, I simply want to say it is submitted, of course I have to create this

01:07.940 --> 01:09.970
property to true.

01:10.010 --> 01:14.390
That means that here I can now create this new property or I have to create this new property which is

01:14.390 --> 01:20.660
set to false initially and I want to use this property to conditionally show or not show this data

01:20.690 --> 01:21.290
panel,

01:21.320 --> 01:29.720
so this whole row here. I will add v-if here, I can simply check if isSubmitted, that will be a boolean

01:29.720 --> 01:30.660
true or false

01:30.770 --> 01:35.560
and if it is false like it is initially, we shouldn't see that data field, only after we hit the button

01:35.600 --> 01:36.720
should we see it.

01:36.770 --> 01:38.430
So if I save this and go back,

01:38.600 --> 01:40.970
we indeed see the data field is gone.

01:40.970 --> 01:44.300
Now let's enter some data in our input here

01:44.480 --> 01:50.050
and if I hit submit, we see it up here, down there with the data we added.

01:50.120 --> 01:53.690
And with this, we can still update it of course because this is how this is set up

01:53.810 --> 01:56.060
but now we're able to use our submit button.

01:56.060 --> 01:57.390
Very important here,

01:57.440 --> 02:01.670
the prevent option here which makes sure we're not submitting it to the server

02:01.670 --> 02:05.940
and then we can go from there and handle our data in the submitted method.
