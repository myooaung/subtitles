For example one important thing about events is the default event object

00:07.050 --> 00:08.530
we can listen to.

00:08.670 --> 00:14.820
There is this event object created by the javascript or by the dom which holds some information, for example

00:14.820 --> 00:19.810
on a click event that holds the coordinates of where this click event happened.

00:19.820 --> 00:26.790
Now let's say we want to access this information because we might be interested in outputting the data,

00:27.210 --> 00:36.540
so I'll quickly add a new paragraph here where I will say coordinates and I want to output the coordinates

00:36.540 --> 00:46.710
here, so that will output the x coordinate and then let's say next to it, it will output a y coordinate.

00:46.710 --> 00:54.990
Now of course these two don't exist so quick so I'll quickly set them up here, X and Y, and then upon hovering

00:55.020 --> 00:56.150
over this paragraph,

00:56.190 --> 00:58.540
I want to update these two values.

00:58.620 --> 01:03.230
So here I can say we on mouse move

01:04.940 --> 01:12.440
and execute update coordinates. Well let me quickly write this method down here,

01:12.460 --> 01:14.860
update coordinates

01:15.190 --> 01:21.850
and now I would need access to the coordinates, I would need access to this event object which gets created

01:21.880 --> 01:30.490
automatically. Turns out it not only gets created automatically by the dom or by javascript, it also gets

01:30.490 --> 01:38.880
passed automatically to each function we execute through this vuejs v-on binding here, vuejs

01:38.890 --> 01:40.600
does this for us.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.750
So here I can conveniently execute event

01:43.840 --> 01:47.830
and of course this should be a function, tiny mistake here.

01:47.950 --> 01:58.000
So I can conveniently pass event here and then here, I can say this X equals event, client X as it turns

01:58.000 --> 01:59.190
out to be

01:59.410 --> 02:08.500
and this Y event client Y, client X and client Y here are the default properties names of the event object,

02:08.500 --> 02:11.090
has nothing to do with vuejs,

02:11.110 --> 02:15.730
and I also rename this to update coordinates as I call it up here.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.890
You now see once I hover over it, these coordinates here update.

02:20.980 --> 02:24.280
This is a how we can listen to something else than a click

02:24.370 --> 02:32.050
but b very importantly, it shows us how we can pass this event object which again is created automatically

02:32.290 --> 02:34.450
and use it as we do here.
