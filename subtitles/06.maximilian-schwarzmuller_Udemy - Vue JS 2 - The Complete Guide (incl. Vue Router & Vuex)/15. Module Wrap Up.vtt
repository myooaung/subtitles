00:02.010 --> 00:05.680
Well that was quite a big module but it was important.

00:05.830 --> 00:12.360
You now hopefully get a better understanding on how the vue instance works, how vuejs works

00:12.360 --> 00:18.270
behind the scenes, how it creates these instances, how the lifecycle of such an instance looks like and how

00:18.270 --> 00:19.960
we may use that.

00:20.040 --> 00:28.230
With that, you will really get a lot of tools already in your pocket to use vuejs with. You know how

00:28.230 --> 00:34.290
to use it with template, you know how it works behind the scenes, you know how it basically works. With

00:34.290 --> 00:34.980
that,

00:34.980 --> 00:42.510
we can now make the next big step and move on to a different setup, a more complex setup, a real development

00:42.510 --> 00:49.470
workflow on our machine before we then dive into more advanced topics like components, routing, animations

00:49.500 --> 00:51.390
and much much more.

00:51.390 --> 00:52.520
So let's move on.
