With that we covered what mixins are, how we can use them to share some code and to avoid code duplication

00:10.080 --> 00:11.650
across components.

00:11.670 --> 00:17.970
You saw that you can add all the features you have in a normal vue instance like lifecycle hooks, the data

00:17.970 --> 00:21.650
property, computed properties, of course you could also share methods.

00:21.930 --> 00:27.840
You also learned that you can add a global mixin but do that with caution and you learned that you

00:27.840 --> 00:32.060
get a separate copy of this mixin for each component where you add it.

00:32.280 --> 00:38.670
You also learned how it is merged together in case that you're setting some data or methods here in the

00:38.670 --> 00:43.560
mixin that you also use in your component where you add it.

00:43.560 --> 00:44.510
Now before mixins,

00:44.500 --> 00:51.090
you also had a look at filters. You learned how to build filters with the vue filter command or by registering

00:51.090 --> 00:54.770
them locally with the filters property,

00:54.850 --> 01:00.870
you learned how filters transform data output in the template but also that there are some limitations and

01:00.870 --> 01:06.450
that you want to consider computed properties for more complex operations so that they don't get run

01:06.480 --> 01:07.460
all the time.

01:07.500 --> 01:14.290
Overall, you want to use filters rarely, use computed properties instead and use mixins to share them.

01:14.550 --> 01:18.890
And with that, I think we really really covered a lot,

01:19.050 --> 01:23.020
we covered a lot of the core features vuejs offers us.

01:23.280 --> 01:29.520
And next, I want to dive into animations, making our app a little bit more beautiful with some nice transitions

01:29.520 --> 01:35.870
and animations before we then really go into the more advanced stuff like accessing http,

01:35.880 --> 01:42.720
so reaching out to a server, using routing to really create a single page application, getting a better

01:42.720 --> 01:48.120
state management with vuex to be able to build bigger applications

01:48.120 --> 01:52.170
and then finally to build our final application and deploy everything.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.250
I can't wait,

01:53.250 --> 01:54.060
so let's start.
