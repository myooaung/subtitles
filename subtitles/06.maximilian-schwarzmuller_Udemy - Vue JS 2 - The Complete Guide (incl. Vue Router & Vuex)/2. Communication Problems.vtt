WEBVTT

00:01.850 --> 00:05.560
This is the application you found attached to the first lecture, here

00:05.570 --> 00:13.070
you're able to see a couple of components I created and you can see that we got a root user component

00:13.190 --> 00:19.730
and then we get two child components, the details and the added component here.

00:19.740 --> 00:25.460
This is also something you see in the app.vue file here, here I get my user component and in there, I got

00:25.460 --> 00:27.360
the two child components.

00:27.410 --> 00:34.610
This is also using scoped styling so that the parent component, the user component has this light blue

00:34.610 --> 00:40.610
background whereas the detail component has the red and the user edit component has the green background

00:40.610 --> 00:46.550
so that we can clearly see what component is well, which component is what.

00:46.550 --> 00:49.080
So this is the set up we're using here,

00:49.190 --> 00:58.100
now the first thing is I want to be able to pass data from the parent to the child and to do this, I

00:58.100 --> 01:02.720
want to simulate that in my user component here,

01:02.720 --> 01:09.480
I actually do have a button I can click to change some data which I then pass down to the user detail

01:09.500 --> 01:10.640
component.

01:10.670 --> 01:20.400
So for that, I'll add a new button in my user component and here, I'll say change my name,

01:20.420 --> 01:26.750
this allows me to well change my name surprisingly. In order to be able to click this button, I need

01:26.750 --> 01:30.620
to add a click listener and I will call change name, a method

01:30.620 --> 01:39.080
I of course have yet to create. Now in order to change it, I in my object down here need to have some

01:39.080 --> 01:46.610
data which can be changed, so I'll add a function as we should in anything which is not in the root vue instance

01:46.960 --> 01:50.140
and here I will return an object holding my data.

01:50.180 --> 01:56.780
Now in this object here, I will have my name which is Max by default

01:57.020 --> 02:03.350
and now I also want to have my methods property, my methods object here where I will have to change

02:03.440 --> 02:08.170
name method using ES6 syntax here with change name and then parentheses.

02:08.420 --> 02:13.170
Here I want to change the name and to change it,

02:13.170 --> 02:16.240
I will simply say this name equals Anna,

02:16.260 --> 02:17.430
so this is the change

02:17.460 --> 02:24.430
I'll make once this method gets called. Now I don't want to output this name in my user component here,

02:24.450 --> 02:27.940
instead I want to output it in my user detail component.

02:28.140 --> 02:34.830
So there let's say I have my many details and one of them is the user name and I somehow want to output

02:34.830 --> 02:35.730
name here

02:35.820 --> 02:38.880
but of course name isn't property in this object.

02:39.180 --> 02:45.660
So I could of course create the object and I could create my data field there and have a name property

02:45.840 --> 02:48.720
but how do I get the name from the parent component?

02:48.860 --> 02:50.820
This is the question I want to answer now.
