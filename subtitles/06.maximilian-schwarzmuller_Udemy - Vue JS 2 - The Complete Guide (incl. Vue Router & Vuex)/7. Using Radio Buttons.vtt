Well after having a look at checkboxes, let's move on to well kind of their sibling, radio buttons. The

00:09.160 --> 00:14.200
difference of course is that we may only select one radio button and a group of radio buttons,

00:14.200 --> 00:16.530
so right now it's not working correctly.

00:16.600 --> 00:22.690
So we want to ensure that we can only select one and then that we store the value of the selected radio

00:22.690 --> 00:24.560
button in some property,

00:24.700 --> 00:26.940
let's use vuejs to help us there.

00:27.100 --> 00:33.610
Well we're storing the gender there, so let's go down to our data field here and simply add gender here

00:33.710 --> 00:37.590
and I'll set it to male by default since well I am male, of course

00:37.580 --> 00:38.840
choose your favorite gender,

00:38.830 --> 00:40.780
nowadays we get a lot of options here.

00:41.020 --> 00:47.570
So with the gender set here, we want to go to the radio buttons here and now the important thing

00:47.570 --> 00:49.890
is how do we bind them? Again

00:49.900 --> 00:54.680
I set them up in a bootstrap style wrapped by a label to have the styling they do have

00:55.030 --> 00:58.960
but the v-model is of course also added to the input again,

00:58.960 --> 01:06.080
so we always add it to the input here, not to the wrapping label, not to the wrapping div, to the input

01:06.370 --> 01:09.740
and here, I want to bind to gender just like that.

01:09.760 --> 01:17.800
Now I can copy this same code to my other radio button, doing this acheives a lot of things in the background,

01:18.750 --> 01:19.540
first

01:19.650 --> 01:24.490
vuejs now knows both radio buttons belong to the same group.

01:24.490 --> 01:28.810
So if we save this, we can already see that I could only select one of the two

01:28.810 --> 01:33.550
now because again, vuejs recognizes they're bound to the same model,

01:33.580 --> 01:37.000
so they are a group, so only one of them is selectable,

01:37.030 --> 01:38.600
that's the first important thing.

01:38.620 --> 01:46.120
The second important thing is that vuejs automatically stores the value of the selected radio button,

01:46.350 --> 01:47.020
the values

01:47.020 --> 01:52.300
we set up here of course with the normal value attribute in our gender property

01:52.390 --> 01:59.350
and I can show this by simply outputting gender here, like that. If I do it like this, we can see that

01:59.350 --> 02:00.630
male is selected now

02:00.670 --> 02:07.470
and now watch the area down there, it switches to female and back to male, female, back to male.

02:07.480 --> 02:12.810
So this is how easy it is to bind radio buttons and of course, you could bind more than two,

02:12.820 --> 02:19.600
the key thing here is to use the same model to which are binding and vuejs will handle the rest like

02:19.660 --> 02:22.600
grouping, assigning the value correctly.

02:22.600 --> 02:27.670
That is how we use radio buttons in a vuejs form and how we can use the property as we switch

02:27.670 --> 02:28.750
between the buttons.
