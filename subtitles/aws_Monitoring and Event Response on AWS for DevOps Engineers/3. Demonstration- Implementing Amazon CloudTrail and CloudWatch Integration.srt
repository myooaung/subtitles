1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,540
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,840
we're going to be implementing CloudTrail and CloudWatch integration.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,940
We're going to be working with the AWS Console, and if you

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,940
wish to follow along with this demonstration,

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,240
you will need your own AWS account.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,240
Now, we do encourage you to follow along,

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,100
but please keep in mind that anything that you

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,470
deploy in AWS could cost you money,

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,580
so if you do follow along with the demonstration,

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,070
make sure you delete the features that you've

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,340
deployed once you no longer need them, or you will incur charges.

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,030
I've signed into AWS Console and, specifically,

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,440
I'm in the CloudTrail dashboard in the London region.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,590
We can see here that a couple of trails already exist,

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,140
and if I scroll down a little bit, we can see the Event history.

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,470
Remember,

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,060
Event history stores 90 days of CloudTrail activity, but

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,030
Globomantics has decided that they need to start their

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,730
CloudTrail activity over a longer period.

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,800
So if we select Trails,

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,850
and then Create trail, we're faced with a standard address form. So

22
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,640
we'll first of all give our trail a nice name,

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,340
and we'll call this trail GlobomanticsTrail.

24
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,840
Notice the tick box here that says Enable for all accounts in my organization.

25
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,050
If you select this,

26
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,840
and presuming the user you've logged in with has the appropriate permissions,

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,890
then this trail will be duplicated to all AWS accounts in your organization.

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,040
We'd be creating centralized audit logs for our entire organization.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,990
If we scroll down a little bit, here we can see the S3 settings.

30
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,540
So anything that CloudTrail collects must be stored in S3,

31
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,570
and optionally can be sent to CloudWatch. So we can select to

32
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,940
use an existing bucket or create a new bucket.

33
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,400
I'll create a new bucket and give it a name that I'll remember later on.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,280
Remember, S3 bucket names have to be globally unique,

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,200
so I've used my 12‑digit account ID here to hopefully guarantee a unique name.

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,230
Further down, we can see that log file encryption is enabled by default,

37
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,540
and we get to set the key that we use as part of this encryption.

38
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,140
So I'll choose the existing key. And if we scroll down a bit more,

39
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,640
we can see that log file validation is selected by default.

40
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,330
That means that for each log that's created a signed

41
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,170
hash value will also be created.

42
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,690
At a later date, I can use the same hashing algorithm,

43
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,630
compare hashes,

44
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,040
and if they're the same I know my log files have not been tampered with.

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,650
We can enable SNS notification if I want to be notified when

46
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,700
a log is created. Scroll down a little bit more, and we get

47
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,800
to our CloudWatch integration.

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,360
Now, I want to integrate this CloudTrail with CloudWatch, so let's tick

49
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,250
enabled. And we're asked about our log group, so which log group in

50
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,800
CloudWatch will this CloudTrail log be stored in. We can choose to use

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,590
an existing log group, but if I leave new log group selected and give

52
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,950
it a nice name. Again,

53
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,160
scroll down a little bit more, and we're going to choose a

54
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,900
role that has the correct permissions to send these

55
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,040
CloudTrail events to CloudWatch.

56
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,760
So you could leave New selected here if you don't already have a role

57
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,880
that can write to CloudWatch, and then just type in a nice friendly name

58
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,160
for that role. Or if you have a role already,

59
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,740
select Existing and choose a role name.

60
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,310
If you're happy with the role information, scroll

61
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,770
down, we can add tags if we need, and then select Next. Now,

62
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,490
as long as all the information you've put in is valid,

63
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,780
it would move to the Logged events section, but if,

64
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,440
like me, you receive errors, read those errors and adjust accordingly.

65
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,320
So in this example, it tells me this CloudTrail name already

66
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,540
exists so I have to choose a new name.

67
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,340
So instead of GlobomanticsTrail,

68
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,150
let's call this GlobomanticsCloudTrail. Scroll back

69
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,040
down, I'll select Next again.

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,760
Now it's about choosing the type of events we want our trail to

71
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,840
log. Management events are enabled by default.

72
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,140
Then we have Data events and Insights events. I'm going to select both of these.

73
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,680
We can then select the type of Management events that we wish to log.

74
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,410
Remember, Management events are all about our authentication and our

75
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,540
API activity. So here you can select if you want to log either Read or

76
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,190
Write API activity. I'll leave both selected, scroll down, and we're

77
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,660
now on Data events. With Data events, we can log S3 or Lambda function

78
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,340
activity.

79
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,150
If I leave S3 selected, we can monitor all S3 buckets, including current

80
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:13,140
buckets and future buckets. Or, if I untick Read and Write here, we can

81
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,940
choose a specific bucket. So let's do that.

82
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,090
So if I click in Browse, you can choose one of your buckets from the

83
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:23,140
drop‑down list. And, again, we can choose where we want to record Read or

84
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,860
Write actions on this bucket in our CloudTrail logs.

85
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,930
If you wish to add additional buckets, select Add data event type.

86
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,950
Or, indeed, if you want to log Lambda function activity, again,

87
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,480
choose Add data event type. Scrolling down again, I can select Next. We

88
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,240
get our Review screen, and everything looks good.

89
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,740
So now I'll select Create trail.

90
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,180
It should only take a couple of minutes to create the CloudTrail.

91
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,950
Once we create it,

92
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,680
we're sent back to the Trail dashboard, and we should be

93
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,440
able to see our CloudTrail in the list.

94
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,290
The thing to do now is to generate some activity and see what gets registered.

95
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,220
So, try logging on, logging off. If you're monitoring an S3 bucket, upload

96
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,170
content to the S3 bucket. Once you've generated some activity,

97
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,930
go to the CloudWatch dashboard and see what you can see.

98
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,740
So let's do that.

99
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,740
So I'm back in the CloudWatch dashboard.

100
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,240
If I select Log groups,

101
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,740
we can see the log group that CloudTrail created for us,

102
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,660
here Globomantics‑CloudTrail‑Logs.

103
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,690
So if I select that, we can see a log stream. If I select the log

104
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,610
stream, we can see all the CloudTrail log entries that have been

105
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:34,200
registered so far. We can expand them here and see the details, or under

106
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,740
Actions we can choose View in Logs Insights.

107
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,420
So here in Log Insights we can use this default

108
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,740
query or type in a query of our own.

109
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,150
If I select Run query then, we can see all the the different

110
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:57,000
entries organized by timestamp and message. Later in the course, we'll show some more detail filtering using Log Insights.
