00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,510
Hi there, and welcome to the module in our Pluralsight course,

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,040
Monitoring and Event Response on AWS for DevOps Engineers.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,830
My name's Mike Brown,

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,320
and I'm a senior cloud instructor at Firebrand Training here in the UK.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,240
In this module, we're going to introduce you to Amazon CloudWatch.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,640
We're going to begin this module with a brief course overview

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,970
followed by a discussion of why this course might be important to

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,230
you. We're then going to give a very quick module overview before

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,240
introducing Amazon CloudWatch.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,830
So let's begin then with a course overview. This course is intended

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,120
to give you a detailed understanding of Amazon CloudWatch so you can

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,890
leave this course with understanding of how CloudWatch can be used

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,640
for your DevOps projects.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,700
We're going to begin by introducing CloudWatch's main features before

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,620
setting our focus on Amazon CloudWatch Logs to give you an

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,690
understanding of what can be logged in CloudWatch and how you can use

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,840
those logs for monitoring and automation.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,570
Throughout this course,

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,180
we're going to be working with Amazon CloudWatch Events and

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,580
EventBridge, and we'll see how event‑driven architectures can

21
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,740
help you in your DevOps teams.

22
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,590
We're also going to be looking at CloudWatch Alarms and looking at

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,930
how CloudWatch Alarms can be used to automate responses to

24
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,790
performance metrics and information in our logs.

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,990
We're also going to take a look at how CloudWatch integrates with other

26
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,140
AWS services to help fulfill your DevOps requirements.

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,140
So, why might this course be important for you?

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,540
Well, automation is key to a successful cloud project,

29
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,240
and CloudWatch sits at the heart of automation inside AWS.

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,320
Now, we're all keen to save time, and usually for saving

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,590
time, that means we're saving money.

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,070
So understanding how CloudWatch integrates with event response will help

33
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,140
you save time and money that can be spent elsewhere.

34
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,110
Security is important to us all, so throughout this course,

35
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,710
we're going to be looking at different security aspects of AWS with a focus

36
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,400
on securing access to CloudWatch, as well as implementing tagging and EC2

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,490
metadata to help secure our AWS infrastructure.

38
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,830
So if automation, saving time and money, and

39
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,640
security is important to your projects, then you will benefit from this course.

40
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,620
If I was asked who should attend this course,

41
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,120
I would say anyone interested in using CloudWatch for

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,160
event monitoring and response, well,

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,360
this course is perfect for you. Also, any learner that's part

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,880
of a DevOps team or who has monitoring as part of their job

45
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,150
rule will benefit from this course.

46
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,430
But there are a couple of things that I would

47
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,940
suggest before attending this course.

48
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,350
The first is an understanding of core AWS services, services like EC2, VPC,

49
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,220
RDS. A basic understanding of these will help you understand the concepts

50
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,840
we're about to cover in the next couple of hours.

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,520
Also, an understanding of AWS cloud concepts, like server‑based deployments

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,880
for EC2 and serverless deployments with products like Lambda and API Gateway

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,240
will help you get the most out of this course.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,880
But even if you are new to AWS and new at DevOps,

55
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,820
I'm sure there's going to be plenty during this course

56
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,340
that'll make the next 2 hours worthwhile.

57
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:56,620
Now,

58
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,200
to help us understand some of the concepts that we're going to

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,820
be discussing over the next couple of hours,

60
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,240
we're going to be working of our customer, Globomantics. Now

61
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,440
Globomantics is a global healthcare organization.

62
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,110
They've been working with AWS for some time and use most of the AWS

63
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:16,390
core services, such as EC2, RDS, S3, and more.

64
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,370
We've been asked to identify solutions that Globomantics

65
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,140
can use for monitoring an event response.

66
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,390
We've also been asked help Globomantics understand how key monitoring

67
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,750
solutions integrate with other AWS services. So we're going to keep

68
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,520
coming back to Globomantics' requirements throughout this course, and

69
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,490
hopefully by helping Globomantics,

70
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,670
it'll make it easier for us to understand the concepts that we're

71
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,820
going to introduce over the next couple of hours.

72
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,270
So in this module, we'll be introducing CloudWatch.

73
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,480
We're going to start by listing some of CloudWatch's key features and

74
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,610
what they do. We'll then cover some of the details of logs and log

75
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,960
streams before going on to discuss securing CloudWatch with a focus on

76
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,000
permissions and encryption of logs. So, let's begin.
