00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,040
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,340
we're going to take a look at archiving CloudWatch logs to Amazon S3.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,730
Throughout this demonstration, we're going to be working with the AWS Console.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,140
And as always, to follow along this demonstration,

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,280
you will need your own AWS account.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,940
Keep in mind that anything you deploy to AWS can incur costs.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,870
I'm in the AWS Console,

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,140
specifically the CloudWatch dashboard in the London region.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,390
Let's select Log groups.

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:40,540
and from inside here, I'm going to choose Globomantics‑CloudTrail‑Logs log group.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,640
Then from the Actions drop‑down, we can see Export and Subscriptions.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,980
So if you want information in this log group to appear in Elasticsearch,

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,640
we can create an Elasticsearch subscription,

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,840
or if you want information in this log group to trigger Lambda function,

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,700
we can select Create Lambda subscription.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:06,440
I want to export data to Amazon S3, so I choose Export data to Amazon S3.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,090
We can then define the data that we want to export by

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,740
putting in a From and To date and time, and then we choose an S3 bucket.

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,550
So I want to export to a bucket in this account,

20
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,240
so I choose the bucket name from the drop‑down list.

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,740
We can add a prefix value here,

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,590
so we can more easily identify the objects that

23
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,540
will be created in the S3 bucket.

24
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,740
And then we select Export.

25
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,220
It should only take a minute to export the data,

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,340
and here we can see that it was successfully exported.

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,740
If I select Actions again,

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,240
there's an option here to View all exports to Amazon S3.

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,840
Let's select that.

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,740
And here we can see a couple of exports.

31
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,740
If I select the export from 1 minute ago,

32
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,440
I can choose the option View in Amazon S3.

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,940
So let's select that.

34
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,140
So we're jumped to the appropriate bucket,

35
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,140
if we navigate down,

36
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,940
we can see the object that was created for me as part of that export.

37
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,500
Now we have to update to an S3,

38
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,520
we can use things like storage classes to reduce costs,

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,850
lifecycle rules to automatically transition between

40
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,740
storage classes and to expire objects,

41
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,340
as well as advanced security controls like object log.

42
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,590
One other thing we're going to show you here while we're in S3,

43
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,740
if I go to the S3 bucket itself,

44
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,140
this is the S3 bucket that my objects have being exported to.

45
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,040
If I go to Permissions, and then Bucket Policy.

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,040
In order for CloudWatch to export data to S3,

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,740
the CloudWatch service needs permissions on the S3 bucket.

48
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,640
This bucket policy grants those permissions.

49
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,540
Notice the two Principal sections.

50
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,640
These identify the CloudWatch service.

51
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,540
It's important though we get the region correct.

52
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,380
If you're exporting data from the US region,

53
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,840
the US region needs to be listed as principal.

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,540
I was exporting data from eu‑west‑2, so eu‑west‑2 is the principal.

55
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,890
Also in this policy,

56
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,440
you have to include the correct bucket name in the Resource sections.

57
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,560
This has to match the bucket that the bucket policy is created on.

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,840
Without this bucket policy, CloudWatch will not be able to export to S3.

59
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,940
In this module, we discussed the importance of log retention.

60
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,130
We discussed different ways to archive logs,

61
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,670
and we showed you how to archive logs to S3.

62
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,440
In our next module,

63
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,720
we'll be discussing event‑driven automation, we'll learn how to

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,240
use event rules to trigger Lambda functions,

65
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,540
and we'll go in for a quick course review.

66
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,830
So join me there, and we'll continue along our Monitoring and

67
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:43,000
Event Response on AWS for DevOps journey. Thank you.
