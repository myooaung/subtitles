00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.470
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.990
we're going to deploy an EC2 instance and use user data to configure it.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.240
And we're going to connect to the EC2 instance and display its metadata.

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.050
For this demonstration, we're going to be working with the AWS console,

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.910
and to follow along, you'll need an AWS account.

6
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.240
Now a caution here, when you deploy EC2 instances to your AWS account,

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.740
you may incur charges.

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.940
So if you do follow along with this demonstration,

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.060
make sure you delete resources when they're no longer needed.

10
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.040
Any resources you create and then leave in your AWS account will cost you money.

11
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.040
So I'm in the AWS console, specifically, the EC2 dashboard.

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.020
If I select Instances, we can see that I've already got four running instances.

13
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.540
But let's launch another by saying Launch instances.

14
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.180
I'm going to choose a Windows AMI type and just

15
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.140
leave t2.micro as the instance type.

16
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.760
Then I'm going to select Configure Instance Details.

17
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.340
We've got the general configuration of instance.

18
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.230
If I then scroll down under Advanced Details of the

19
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.700
metadata and User data section.

20
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.860
So we can see here metadata is enabled,

21
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.650
and we can see it's going to deploy version 1 and version 2 of the metadata.

22
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.620
You can use drop‑downs here to make changes.

23
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.040
So we can disable metadata, and we can enforce just version 2.

24
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.370
Then we've got the User data section.

25
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.620
And it's in here you've got you Bash script or your PowerShell script.

26
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.150
We can type in the text,

27
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.840
or we can upload a file and specify whether that file is already base64 encoded.

28
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.410
So this being a Windows machine,

29
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.370
there's my PowerShell command that I want to be run

30
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.240
when this machine is launched, my user data.

31
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.060
So if I click Review and Launch here, we can review our settings,

32
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.200
then click Launch.

33
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.540
We'll be asked for a key pair and then say Launch Instance.

34
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.040
So that instance will take a few minutes to launch.

35
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.740
Once it's launched, we can connect to it.

36
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.100
I've rtp‑ed into the launch instance.

37
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.740
I've opened a web browser.

38
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.480
And I've accessed the 169.254.169.254 IP address.

39
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.040
This same IP address is available on Linux instances.

40
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.640
You can see the API version numbers there.

41
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.540
If I type in latest, we then get access to user data and metadata.

42
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.220
So if I type metadata, we can see the instance metadata.

43
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:20.540
And if I type public‑ipv4, we can see the instance's public IP address.

44
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.440
Let's take a look at user data.

45
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.980
So the same IP address latest/user‑data.

46
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.630
And here we can see the user data that was hopefully used

47
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.970
to configure this machine at launch.

48
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.240
Back in the EC2 dashboard, if I select my new launch web server,

49
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.640
then from Actions and Instance settings,

50
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.650
we can select Edit user data.

51
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.310
Here we can see that I'm not able to edit user data at the

52
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.360
minute because my instance is running.

53
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.640
But if I shut down the instance, we could edit the user data.

54
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.740
Now a little note of caution here.

55
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.840
If I were to shut the machine down and edit user data,

56
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.640
it does not mean that that user data will be executed.

57
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.260
In fact,

58
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.040
it won't be executed unless you change some settings inside the virtual machine.

59
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.240
So let's go back to the virtual machine,

60
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.340
and here you can see I've opened EC2 Service Properties.

61
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.740
And note it's the User Data tick box.

62
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.800
We have to tick this box if we want user data to be

63
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.100
applied each time the service starts, so each reboot for example.

64
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.450
If you don't select this, the user data might be changed,

65
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.040
but it'll have no effect.

66
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.040
So I'll select OK here.

67
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.780
If I select WebServer1 and then go to its public IP address,

68
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.740
we can see that it's got a website deployed.

69
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.820
Let's shut down WebServer1.

70
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:43.070
Once stopped, let's select the web server and go to Actions,

71
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.040
Instance settings, and Edit user data.

72
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.440
And now we can modify our user data.

73
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.740
So let's make a little change.

74
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.340
So instead of Install‑WindowsFeature, we're now saying uninstall‑WindowsFeature.

75
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.940
If I save that change, and let's start that instance again.

76
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.740
And once WebServer1 is fully started and finished initializing,

77
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.190
we should find that the new user data has taken effect,

78
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.370
and now our example would have removed the IIS so the

79
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.240
website will no longer be available.

80
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.830
So with WebServer1 selected,

81
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.240
we can use this public IP list again to try and access its website.

82
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.340
This time we receive an error because the user data has uninstalled IIS.

83
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.940
Don't forget if you want your user data to apply each time the system reboots,

84
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.840
you must change your EC2 properties from inside the

85
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.040
instance, regardless of whether it's a Linux machine or a

86
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.130
Windows machine. In this module,

87
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.540
you learned how to use user data to configure an EC2 instance at launch.

88
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.070
We also showed you how you can edit user data and use that to

89
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.590
reconfigure an EC2 machine as long as the EC2 service properties

90
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.230
have been configured appropriately. Our demonstration

91
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.640
concentrated on a single EC2 machine.

92
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.130
But there's nothing stopping you scaling this up and editing the

93
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.840
user data en masse for a large group of machines.

94
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.550
We also discussed EC2 metadata in this module. And metadata is a

95
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.650
powerful component that could expose all sorts of EC2 settings to

96
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.450
applications and services running on the EC2 instance. In our next

97
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.060
module, we're going to discuss CloudWatch logs,

98
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.840
alarms, and metrics.

99
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.370
We're going to view some CloudTrail logs inside CloudWatch. And

100
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.670
we're going to learn more about querying log data.

101
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.800
So join me there, and we'll continue along our Monitoring and Event

102
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.000
Response on AWS for DevOps Engineers journey. Thank you.
