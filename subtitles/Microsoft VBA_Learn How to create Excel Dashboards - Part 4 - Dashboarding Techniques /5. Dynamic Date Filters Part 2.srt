00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
Hagos,

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,200
welcome back.

3
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,220
So in this video,

4
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,200
we're going to discuss in of the technique for filtering dates using combo boxes or using

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,900
data validation lists.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:18,290
And we're basically gonna have some date ranges so you can select a starting month and you

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,670
can select unending month.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,830
And the data in your table is going to react to your selection.

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:30,460
So you're gonna have the data appearing for the sales between these two months.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,380
The March 14 for example,

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,670
on October 14 here.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,310
This is one way to do it.

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,620
Using combo box is the other way,

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,910
which performs the same function as well.

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,650
You can do it using data validation lists.

16
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,290
So we're going to see how both ways are constructed.

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:53,820
And I want to grab your attention as well to the fact that the sales here are sorted in

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,040
descending order.

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,710
Okay,

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,390
so here,

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,730
because Canada has the highest sales,

22
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,090
it's at the top.

23
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,150
And then us a having second place and so on and so forth.

24
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,810
And this is the case on both tables as well.

25
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,470
So we're going to discuss this ah,

26
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,100
date range dashboard,

27
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,700
and we're going to see what is behind all that.

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,040
That is feeding these tables.

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,670
OK,

30
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,110
so we're going to go to our data validation dates worksheet here,

31
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,410
and we're going to discuss actually the list of months.

32
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:35,270
The are feeding the combo boxes and the data validation lists.

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,160
So actually,

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,650
this list of months I have two ways for creating it.

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,050
The first way is to create a pivot table,

36
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:44,860
OK,

37
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:51,670
And this pivot tables sources actually the road data and have created a month column here

38
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,720
and this month column is created using the date function,

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,210
just as they explained on the previous video.

40
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,950
And basically,

41
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,110
I've created pivot table from that road.

42
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,780
It is sat and just put the month on the rose here.

43
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,370
And this will create this pivot table that you see here and to basically guarantee that the

44
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,180
months are sorted in ascending order.

45
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,810
You just click here and click on sort oldest to newest.

46
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,100
And every time this pivot table is refreshed,

47
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:30,620
the months are always gonna be sorted in ascending order and then you can have a dynamic

48
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,890
range on that table covering that table,

49
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:41,140
and this dynamic range will cover the list and then you assign that dynamic range to the

50
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,120
combo boxes or the date of elevation lists,

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,550
and we've learned how to do that Previously,

52
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,620
you could also do it in another way,

53
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,980
which is to basically write the list of months in a column here,

54
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,400
which is cold months.

55
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,330
And you just write the list of months by just writing,

56
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:58,860
for example,

57
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,480
January 14 year and just drag this handle like that.

58
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,500
And Excel will understand that you're trying to do a no to fill for months,

59
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,580
and it will just fill the months on.

60
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,670
Then you create a four minute here that checks if there are dates between this state,

61
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,850
which is here the first of January 2014.

62
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,790
But because of custom number formatting,

63
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,340
it looks like January forcing like that.

64
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,250
But the values the first of January.

65
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,450
And,

66
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:26,860
um,

67
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:33,820
this formula actually checks if there are dates between the this state and the end of month

68
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,520
for this state.

69
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:34,850
Israel.

70
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,230
The end of month for the States.

71
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,070
The under month function actually returns the last day of the month,

72
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:47,670
so it's going to check if there dates between the 1st January 14 and the 31st January 14

73
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,320
here in this row,

74
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,030
data on the order date column,

75
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,610
actually,

76
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,910
and if there are dates than this,

77
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,840
sell here is gonna be returned.

78
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,700
So basically,

79
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,300
it's going to check if there are dates between first junior 14 and 31st of January.

80
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,290
And if there are dates that it's going to return this cell,

81
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,080
If not,

82
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,210
then it is just going to give you a blank cell.

83
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,970
This is account ifs formula.

84
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,230
We've learned how to use the Countess formula previously.

85
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:22,420
So I'd recommend you check this formula on the simple workbook here to be able to

86
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,560
understand it and implemented as well.

87
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,150
And this is done for each and every month.

88
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,650
And if they're month exists,

89
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,820
or if there are dates,

90
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,740
that or between the first of the month and the end of the month,

91
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,730
then the months then the month is gonna be displayed here.

92
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,580
If not,

93
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,970
then it's gonna be blank.

94
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,720
As you can see here,

95
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,400
the formula is extended,

96
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,710
but only if there are dates than the month will appear.

97
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,190
If not,

98
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,660
then the month will just not appear.

99
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,090
It will be just a blank.

100
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,310
I personally prefer this method because it's easier to implement because you just create a

101
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,290
pivot table and make sure you sort it.

102
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,480
But the drawback to this method here,

103
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,970
the pivot table method for creating the months list is that you need to make sure to

104
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,400
refresh your pivot tables whenever you update your data.

105
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,750
OK,

106
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,050
so to hit this refresh button here refers All.

107
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,090
I've created this shortcut on my Excel,

108
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,350
but you can go to data top and click on Refresh old here.

109
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,990
But remembering to refresh my pivot tables is not a problem for me,

110
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,610
because I always refresh them.

111
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,130
It's just second nature to me whenever I update my road eight.

112
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,850
I just refresh my pivot tables so it's not a problem for me,

113
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,680
but it could pose a problem for other people.

114
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,560
This one is harder to implement,

115
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,310
however,

116
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:50,130
it actually updates the months lists without needing to refresh the pivot tables.

117
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,890
The months will be just updated instantaneously when you add some new months to your

118
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,400
rotator,

119
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,420
but it requires writing a formula,

120
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,070
so you're the judge.

121
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,670
Okay,

122
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,820
now let's go to our analysis formula stab,

123
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,600
and this worksheet contains some analysis form.

124
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,080
It is that we would use to control the sorting on this stable and also for the combo boxes

125
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,570
because we know that combo boxes would need some cells that actually,

126
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,630
they would output the index number for the selection in right,

127
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,890
because there is a combo box index number.

128
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,330
So,

129
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:25,910
actually,

130
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,550
this is the combo box index number four,

131
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,460
the date from combo box.

132
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,290
And this is the combo box index number for the date to combo box.

133
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,960
And after the combo box outputs the index number here for the selection in this cell,

134
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,220
there is actually an index formula that extracts the month using the index number,

135
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,620
the combo box index number.

136
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,060
It extracts the month from the months list.

137
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,950
But here,

138
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,590
actually,

139
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,260
we extract the month from the months list.

140
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,780
But we actually used the end of months formula to get the last day of the month,

141
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,800
and I'm going to tell you why just in a second,

142
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,450
Okay,

143
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:10,350
so we use the under month function to extract the last day because this is actually the

144
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:15,370
ending date that you need your filtration to extend to.

145
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:15,740
Okay,

146
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:22,490
so we need your filtration to extend between the first of March 14 and 31st of October 14

147
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:32,380
and here we've actually got some some If formula that axity sums up the sales between this

148
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,510
date and this date,

149
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,900
which this state is actually the 31st of October.

150
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,760
So if you check here on the home time on the ribbon,

151
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,220
their states,

152
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,250
if we just change its for it,

153
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,280
it's going to show us 31st of October.

154
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,000
This state is actually the 31st of October 2014.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,750
So this summer's form it out actually sums up the sales between these two dates and have

156
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,420
learned about the summits formative previously.

157
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:04,120
So please make sure to go back to that lesson if you struggle with that formula and this is

158
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,110
done for all the countries,

159
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,600
and then the grand old is simply the summation off the sales for all the countries.

160
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,700
The same thing is done for data validation lists.

161
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,590
OK,

162
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:23,290
so we're basically doing a some ish formula and then a some function here for the grand

163
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:23,920
total.

164
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,810
To sum up.

165
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:33,880
All the sales were older countries were also using a rank for media the ranked out e que

166
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,820
formula which is equivalent to the rank function in Excel 2007.

167
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,730
So this rank function basically assigns a rank for each country in a descending order.

168
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,520
So actually,

169
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:52,270
the country with the high sales will have the highest rank and then the lowest sales is

170
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,960
gonna have the lowest rank.

171
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,540
So here,

172
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,800
actually Canada is having the highest sales was having ranked number two because actually,

173
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,240
this formula is applied to the grand total as well.

174
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,690
And the grand total is having ranked number one.

175
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,000
Because,

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,370
of course,

177
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,170
it's gonna be higher than any country,

178
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:09,650
right,

179
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,300
because the summation off sales for all the countries.

180
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,550
So actually the highest country is gonna have number two and then the second highest three

181
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,120
and so on and so forth.

182
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,420
And then there is actually a sorting table.

183
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,350
And this is the stable actually feeding our tables here on the day train stash board.

184
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,210
So our tables air basically having an informant s.

185
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,590
So if a cell contains a value,

186
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,150
then give me the value.

187
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,840
If not,

188
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,450
then give me a blank.

189
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:47,540
And then there is a formula here that says that if the value is blank and give me a blank

190
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,330
else,

191
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,790
give me the value of the cell and this is applied for both e stables.

192
00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:00,280
This stable is copying its values from this stable and this stable is taking its values

193
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,490
from this stable,

194
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,090
basically.

195
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,630
And here,

196
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,040
actually,

197
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,640
to make sure that we get the correct rank for the countries we have actually written a view

198
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,530
look of formula with and,

199
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:10,880
ah,

200
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,140
if our if there is an error than give me a blank value,

201
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,760
basically.

202
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,790
And here you can see her that the look of value is basically the rose function.

203
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,190
And we've learned about the roads function before,

204
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:27,810
and we're generating the number to basically to look up the highest country because we're

205
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,350
gonna use this stable for the look up,

206
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:30,970
okay?

207
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,870
And we're gonna look up using the rank.

208
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,520
So we're actually going to look up the country's name using its rang.

209
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,160
And here the Rose,

210
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,930
for example,

211
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,940
Rose F A to F nine is gonna open it to OK,

212
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,650
so too is gonna be our look of value in this stable.

213
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,330
And we're gonna get actually the second column,

214
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,660
which contains the country.

215
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,700
So here this look of formula is going to generate our country's list,

216
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,580
and then our grand total is written actually manually here,

217
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:08,250
and there is also the total sales is generated as well using you could either do it using

218
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,410
the rank,

219
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,690
or you could do it actually using the country.

220
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,240
So here,

221
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,850
this one is looking up the country,

222
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,320
and this one is looking at the sales using the country from this stable as well.

223
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,670
Okay,

224
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,990
so be sure to check these formulas,

225
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,130
and that's it.

226
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:23,640
Basically,

227
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,920
this is how you generate the sorting table,

228
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,010
and then this dashboard is basically getting its value from the sorting tables.

229
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:37,720
And this is how you make sure that the country's sales are actually sorted in descending

230
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,180
order.

231
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,890
Okay,

232
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:45,890
So this technique here for the ranking table and the sorting table actually has a drawback

233
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:45,890
,

234
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,710
which is,

235
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,710
if you add a new country in your row data,

236
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,010
you need to make sure to add it to these two tables.

237
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,520
Okay,

238
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,740
but what I'm going to show you is actually a checkpoint the I have created,

239
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:06,520
which enables us to check for any missing countries on the fly really quickly so as to make

240
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:12,790
sure that we have data integrity and that we're not missing any countries on our data.

241
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,440
I'm gonna actually introduce two ways that you're able to do it,

242
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,170
and you could actually figure out your own way as well.

243
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,150
So here I've written a V look of formula,

244
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:33,240
and this formula looks up the country from the pivot table in this table here and returns

245
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,510
it.

246
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:40,740
But it there isn't if condition as well that says that if the cell in the pivot table is

247
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,400
blanked and give me a blank value else look up the country from the pivot table in this

248
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,310
table and return it basically returned the country itself and have actually put this if the

249
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,100
value is blanked and give me a blank.

250
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,410
So that will be able to extend the formula beyond the pivot tables as to allow for the

251
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,520
expansion off the pivot table so that if we add more countries,

252
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,010
pivot table is gonna expand,

253
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,370
they're gonna be more roast.

254
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,520
Two shows of the pivot table is gonna be longer.

255
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,920
And this if allows for the expansion.

256
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,050
So basically,

257
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:18,700
this actually looks up the country from the pivot table in this table and returns it.

258
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:24,730
And if the country is not returned and we get a hash and a value than the country does not

259
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,180
exist,

260
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,410
and we need to add it to the table There is also another way that you could do it here.

261
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,450
This formula basically generates true or false values and have added some conditional

262
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,890
formatting to as well.

263
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,860
So if it's true,

264
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,190
it's going to be green.

265
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,580
If it's fools,

266
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,900
then it's gonna be read.

267
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,840
And I'm gonna have a demonstration here for you by adding another country.

268
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:46,990
So,

269
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,600
for example,

270
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,850
if I take any row here,

271
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,290
just,

272
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:50,680
ah,

273
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,140
duplicated and just add a different country here.

274
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,560
Russia,

275
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,140
for example.

276
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:02,220
We don't have this country on our data on I refresh here my table and go back to the

277
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,980
checkpoint.

278
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:10,350
You can see here that Russia is reflected here as having a hash and a value on this column

279
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,950
and having a false value on this column.

280
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,580
Okay,

281
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:13,970
By the way,

282
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,990
you don't have to create both these columns.

283
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,780
It's just here two ways of doing the same thing.

284
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,400
OK,

285
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,770
so here you're If you check this checkpoint whenever you update your data,

286
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,160
you know,

287
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,910
I'm trying to introduce the concept of having checkpoints on your reports or dashboards so

288
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,150
that whenever you update the data here on the road data,

289
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,120
you look at the checkpoint.

290
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,860
You just have a quick lines of the checkpoint to make sure that you have data integrity,

291
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:47,570
that everything is adding up properly and that you don't have any gaps in your numbers.

292
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,170
Basically,

293
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,950
that all your numbers add up to each other.

294
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,310
Because if you're having problems with your data than the total sales on all the countries

295
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:55,310
,

296
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,140
air not gonna add up to the grand total,

297
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,910
for example.

298
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,800
So basically,

299
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,730
when we see this,

300
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,430
when we have a glance at our checkpoint and we see this,

301
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,260
we know that Russia does not exist.

302
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,880
So we're basically going to insert in euro here and right Russia here,

303
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,040
for example,

304
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:21,950
and right Russia here is well and just drag this formula and direct this formula as well

305
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,500
and dragged this rank formula as well.

306
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,600
Okay,

307
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,500
and everything is gonna be fine.

308
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,590
So as you can see here,

309
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,970
the checkpoint clears again.

310
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:37,570
And you know that you have accounted for all the countries on your road data.

311
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,170
Okay,

312
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:38,410
guys,

313
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,100
So that's it for this technique.

314
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:46,130
I hope that I have introduced some good ideas for you that you can implement as is,

315
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,050
or you can add your own as well.

316
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:54,340
And I hope I have simulated your minds to come up with some great looking and professional

317
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,190
dashboards.

318
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,710
I'd recommend that you would check all the formulas in this sample workbook thoroughly so

319
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,250
as to be able to understand this lesson better.

320
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank you very much for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
