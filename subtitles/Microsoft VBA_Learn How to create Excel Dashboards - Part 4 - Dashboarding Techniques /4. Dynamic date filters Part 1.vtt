00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Hey,

2
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.560
guys,

3
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.220
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.730
So this video is the first of two parts for dynamic date filters.

5
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.600
So in this video,

6
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.150
we're going to see a technique for filtering data tables using slicers.

7
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.670
So,

8
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.510
as you can see here,

9
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.790
I'm using a slicer and selecting a certain month.

10
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.610
And then my data,

11
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.650
as you can see here,

12
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.550
is reacting to my selection.

13
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.110
This data table here is reacting to my selection,

14
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.970
and also we could use our timeline.

15
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.400
So actually,

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.340
as you can see here,

17
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.770
I'm selecting between different quarters.

18
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.240
And also the data table is reacting and can also select from different years.

19
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.250
But actually this status,

20
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.720
it contains only one year.

21
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.190
That is 2014.

22
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.840
But if it had been the case that my data set contained several years,

23
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.220
then I would have been able to select from different years.

24
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.010
But you can see as well I can select from different month,

25
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.670
and I can actually select a period of time spanning between any two months as well using

26
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.690
the timeline.

27
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.810
So this is actually our final product,

28
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.670
and we're gonna look at what is behind all that.

29
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.850
What's in the back stage that's going to enable us to do this dynamic selection.

30
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.790
Okay,

31
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.810
so I've gone here to my row data worksheet,

32
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.580
which contains actually the road data behind this data table.

33
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.510
So I got here some Road eight is so Espersen the country order 80 order,

34
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.170
date order,

35
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.630
amount,

36
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.340
units sold.

37
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.680
And the month The month is actually a column that I have created,

38
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.790
which basically tags each state with the first day of the month so that I'll be able to

39
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.410
filter between different months.

40
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.660
And I'm using actually the date function to do that.

41
00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.890
So the date function is a function in excel that can generate a date when you give it the

42
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.410
year and the month and a day.

43
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.500
And I'm actually excusing the year function to extract the year from the date.

44
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.400
Okay,

45
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.110
So in this case,

46
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.120
in case of this state,

47
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.420
which is the 18th of April,

48
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.820
2014 is gonna extract 2014 and for the month,

49
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.760
it's gonna extract four.

50
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.610
And actually,

51
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:27.910
I'm putting the day to be a one for all the cells because I'm just trying to tag the month

52
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.650
with the first day of the month,

53
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.540
and I'm actually making it.

54
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.130
Look,

55
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.400
this way how making it look like April 14 this way doesn't look like the first of April 14

56
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.400
.

57
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.740
How I made it look like April 14 is by using custom number formatting.

58
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.210
So if you right click on your cell,

59
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.350
click on form,

60
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.110
it sells here and then go to custom.

61
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.920
You'll see have a custom number for murder,

62
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.770
is applied and discussed.

63
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.560
A number format is Mm mm.

64
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.430
Dash Y y.

65
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.940
And this will give you this.

66
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.370
Look for the date.

67
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.190
There are other for,

68
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.520
missus.

69
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.810
Well,

70
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.150
so dee dee Dash Mm mm will actually give you the day and the month,

71
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.940
which is not actually what we're requiring.

72
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.330
So these air different number formance that you can apply for dates,

73
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.230
But I'm using this one so that I would have the month having this format and remember,

74
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.980
guys is just a form it it does not change the value in the cell.

75
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.290
It just changes how the cell looks.

76
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.130
And I'm doing this because this format will actually be reflected on my slicers.

77
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.450
Okay,

78
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.670
so my slicers are gonna be connected to this format,

79
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.060
so the slicers actually are gonna look the way these cells look.

80
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.580
So I've actually opted for that format so that the slicers would have January 14 February

81
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.000
14 March 14 written on them instead of the first of January 2014.

82
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.950
That's not very representative,

83
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.320
right?

84
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.350
Because we're trying to filter for the month,

85
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.110
not for a certain day.

86
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.130
Okay,

87
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.720
so after creating this data table and creating this Month column,

88
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.160
what I did is that I created a pivot table by going to the insert tab on the ribbon.

89
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.400
After having any cell in the table highlighted,

90
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.350
you go to the insert tab on the ribbon and then click on pivot table here,

91
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.510
and then you insert a new pivot table I have inserted the PIB table,

92
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.910
shows its location on the pivot sheet here,

93
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.020
so you can choose any location and then click OK,

94
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.960
and you pivot table is going to be inserted.

95
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.050
And here is my pivot table here.

96
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.900
Okay,

97
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.790
so this is the pivot table that I inserted on this sheet.

98
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.520
So after doing that,

99
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.950
I actually put the month in the filter here,

100
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:56.950
and I put the country on the rose and the total sales on the summation of values to create

101
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.180
this Look for the pivot table and then to insert a slicer,

102
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.070
you can highlight any cell in your pivot table and go to the insert tab on the ribbon here

103
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.490
and then click on slicer.

104
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.850
And then are you need to insert a slicer for the month.

105
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.010
I need to make the month the filter for my pivot table.

106
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.060
So I selected here month and then click.

107
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.760
OK,

108
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.310
As you can see here,

109
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.930
here is the slicer for the months,

110
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.550
and you can actually use this slicer to filter your pivot table,

111
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.110
as you can see here.

112
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:40.960
So I'm just gonna delete this slicer cause I've got one already here on this worksheet and

113
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.820
to create a timeline,

114
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:49.870
you can just tie light any cell in your table and then go to the insert tab on the ribbon

115
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.020
click on timeline.

116
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.140
And here I'm going to choose the month column because the Month column is the one that I

117
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.850
have selected here in the filter.

118
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.550
If you want to choose the order date,

119
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.730
you will need to create another pivot table and actually make the order date the filter

120
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.590
column here.

121
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.450
So I'm gonna click OK here.

122
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.810
After selecting the month and Aziz,

123
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.650
you can see here.

124
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.990
We can actually select between different months,

125
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.660
and this will be reflected on our pivot table.

126
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.600
And also we can select between different quarters in 2014.

127
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.990
But in case of the days as well,

128
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.680
the days are actually limited to just the first day of the month because the month column

129
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.960
actually contains the value of the first day of the month on Lee.

130
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.860
OK,

131
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:43.650
but if you select the order day to be the column for your timeline than in this case,

132
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.940
you'll be able to select any day of the month depending,

133
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.380
of course,

134
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.160
on the availability of the data.

135
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.950
So if there are no data in a certain day than your pivot table will just displaying no

136
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.550
results.

137
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.370
So actually,

138
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.040
if you want to use the order date,

139
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.050
you will just need to create another pivot table.

140
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.020
So if you go back to the road data worksheet here,

141
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.140
go to the insert Tom here,

142
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.460
click on pivot table,

143
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.560
and then I'm just gonna put it in the pivot worksheet as well.

144
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.190
Here click OK,

145
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:18.720
and you just need to put the order dates to be the column here in the filter and then

146
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.790
country and order amount as well the submission of the order amount.

147
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.640
And then you can go to the insert tab.

148
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.930
Click on Timeline.

149
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:27.790
By the way,

150
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:28.180
also,

151
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.980
in other versions of Excel,

152
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.350
it could be the anal.

153
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.810
I stopped to create a slicer or timelines or year analyzed Insert slicer.

154
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.790
Insert timeline.

155
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.690
So you're gonna actually select order date from here?

156
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.780
Click OK,

157
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.950
and as you can see here now,

158
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.760
if used the order date,

159
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.960
then you're gonna have all the options available,

160
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.960
like quarters and days.

161
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:56.290
A month here is actually going for 2000 and 15 but 2015 does not have any data on then.

162
00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:02.150
If we select 2014 then we have our data being reflected here for the month SA's Well,

163
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.800
you can select one month.

164
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.190
You can select a period of time spanning between different months.

165
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:15.100
You can select a period of time spent spending between different days as well on a certain

166
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.510
month if you want to using the timeline.

167
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.620
So I'm just gonna delete that.

168
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.080
And by the way,

169
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.110
what I did to move the timeline or the slicer is very simple.

170
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:31.040
Selected press control on X on your keyboard and move it here.

171
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.790
Press control and V to paste it.

172
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:33.540
Okay,

173
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.930
so cut and paste.

174
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:35.880
Very simple.

175
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.050
So I'm just going to lead that one here.

176
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:43.240
And I'm gonna delete this pivot table as well because I'm basing the filtration on the

177
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.300
month columnist on the order date column.

178
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.310
Okay,

179
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.430
So selected.

180
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.350
I like to clear all to remove it.

181
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.110
No,

182
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.650
I'm going to go back to Slicer on timeline here,

183
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:59.850
and I want to show you something else as well as you can see here.

184
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.740
When I'm filtering the data using my slicers in a select a certain month,

185
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.000
you can see her that this table is shrinking and expanding.

186
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.280
Based on the data that I've got so you can see her The size of the table could change,

187
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.730
but actually,

188
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.950
the formatting of the table does not change.

189
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:22.330
And he always has the grand total column at the bottom with a certain format and the

190
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:28.220
countries in the middle with a different format and the titles for the table are with a

191
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.680
different format as well.

192
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.670
So how did we achieve that?

193
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.080
We achieve that actually,

194
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.980
through conditional formatting and also through formulas in this stable.

195
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.190
So this table is reading,

196
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.250
actually directly from the pivot table.

197
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.230
So the four minute here is actually very simple,

198
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.880
he says.

199
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.060
If the cell in the pivot worksheet is equal to Blank,

200
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.030
then give me a blank else.

201
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.290
Give me the value off the cell.

202
00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.810
So it's basically an equal formula with an if statement,

203
00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:01.400
so that if the cell is blanket will just display a blank value.

204
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.790
And after doing that,

205
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:09.880
there is actually conditional formatting that gives a formatting for the cell based on its

206
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.310
value.

207
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.510
So if the cell is one of the country's,

208
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.250
it gives it this gray color.

209
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:21.090
If it's the grand Total Cell gives it this blue filling with a white bolted fund.

210
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.720
And actually the title cell is is fixed in its place.

211
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.110
Okay,

212
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.740
so the title so does not have any formula.

213
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.440
And it just has this color here.

214
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.580
So the title cell does not have any conditional formatting.

215
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.290
Okay,

216
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:43.060
so let's check the conditional formatting applied so I can go to the conditional formatting

217
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.440
option here on my home tab on the ribbon click on manage rules.

218
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.780
And as you can see here in the current selection or you can also choose this worksheet to

219
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.260
Ciel,

220
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.140
the conditional formatting in the worksheet and let's start first by the conditional

221
00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.900
formatting of the country's If I Just Highlighted here this conditional formatting that is

222
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.590
gray click on it a Truell.

223
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:09.440
You can see here that the formula that the conditional formatting is based on is that the

224
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:15.390
value in the cell does not equal two grand total okay,

225
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:23.070
and also the value in the cell In column C does not equal to blank and notice here as well

226
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:28.600
that I have fixed the column reference for column seen on the conditional formatting.

227
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:35.080
So this is the conditional formatting that is applied for the cells having the countries

228
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:42.000
and for the cells having the grand total or it's actually one sell it actually just tests.

229
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.280
If the cell in column C has a grand total,

230
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:53.070
then give me a black color and both conditional formatting Z are applied to the cells in

231
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.800
column C and column D,

232
00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:01.320
and you can see here that I've applied it till row 23 on each column so that I would allow

233
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:08.520
for expansion and contraction off the table and also the form it is year actually extended

234
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:15.030
even beyond the table range to allow for expansion and contraction off the table.

235
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:19.840
I would recommend that you open this sample file and check it thoroughly.

236
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.940
Check the formulas and everything.

237
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.730
Okay,

238
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.920
so this concludes part one on how to create a dynamic date filter.

239
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.700
Thank you very much,

240
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:27.980
guys.

241
00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.020
Watching this video,

242
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.860
and I'll see you on the next one.
