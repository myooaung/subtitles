1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,370
tega is welcome back.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,290
So in this video,

3
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:08,410
we're going to discuss another dash boarding technique which on that technique,

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,570
we're gonna use,

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,100
Ah,

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,980
a table and a pivot table and a slicer and the choose function.

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,090
Okay,

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:25,050
so the objective is to create different aggregation methods for the user to choose from.

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,870
Okay.

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,630
So as you can see her on the slicer,

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,600
I can choose to get the average off the order amount.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,610
And you can see here that the average appears in cell G two or can choose to get the

13
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,720
maximum of the order amount,

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,810
and it appears here and sell G two or can choose to get the minimum,

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,610
Or I can choose to get the total.

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:52,440
So that's for your user who doesn't want to fiddle with the formulas and stuff.

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,240
They just want to see average,

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,830
maximum,

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,950
minimum and total.

20
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,860
Okay.

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,370
And you can apply other aggravations as well so you can expand the options on this slicers

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,470
or just giving you Ah,

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,310
an example.

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,540
Now,

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,970
I've got here some raw data okay for sales on the left,

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,940
and we're actually gonna work on the column for the order amounts.

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:24,220
This is what we're aggregating as you've seen when I was selecting the different selections

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,450
year on my slicer.

29
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,550
Okay,

30
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,620
now,

31
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,640
to apply this technique or to ah,

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,250
to do what I've done here with the slicer I had to create a table,

33
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,770
a mini table here.

34
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,500
As you can see,

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,420
that has two columns,

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,790
the aggregation and a number column that just assigns a reference number.

37
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,050
Ah,

38
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,210
a counter or so Ah,

39
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,660
just a key to the aggregation type that you want to apply.

40
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,990
So average have given it number one maximum,

41
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,010
giving it number two minimum.

42
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,880
I've given him number three and total.

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,620
I've given a number four.

44
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:04,960
OK,

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,650
it's just a reference number,

46
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,050
okay?

47
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:17,860
And I have created another pivot table here at the bottom that is based on the table at the

48
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,480
top.

49
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,400
OK,

50
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,930
so I just ah created a pivot table that is based on the table at the top.

51
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,550
And by the way,

52
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:32,490
if you're ah having any questions regarding tables or if you're not familiar with tables

53
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:38,040
are drink a mint that you watch the lost two lessons here on the course.

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,930
Ah,

55
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,210
that explain tables.

56
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:48,510
They are extra lessons bullet bonus lessons that explain the tables eso the explaining cell

57
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,740
tables in detail.

58
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,620
Okay,

59
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,350
Now,

60
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,350
after I've created this pivot table here that is based on the table at the top,

61
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:03,850
I've removed the grand total row from that pivot table.

62
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,090
Okay,

63
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,970
so I've done that by go by selecting my pivot table,

64
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,470
going to the design time on the ribbon and then going to grand totals,

65
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,180
clicking on F on off for rows and columns.

66
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,250
Okay,

67
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,000
so I've removed the grand total row,

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,490
okay?

69
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:30,950
And I have created a shoes function here in cell G two.

70
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,910
Okay,

71
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:37,560
So this choose function is on its first argument the index number argument or the index

72
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,240
number input.

73
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,990
It's referencing cell K 13 here.

74
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,700
That's got,

75
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,810
um,

76
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,440
estimation off the number,

77
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,080
because,

78
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,900
ah,

79
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,360
the discuss the submission of the number,

80
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,890
or actually the number Because the number here has only,

81
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,450
um,

82
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,230
every record has only ah,

83
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,390
every number has only one record here on the table,

84
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,860
at the top,

85
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,350
on the mini table at the top.

86
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,290
So the summation is gonna be the same as the number itself.

87
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:15,150
So the first argument here is referencing this cell here containing ah,

88
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,040
the summation.

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,570
Okay,

90
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,530
are actually the reference number on the pivot table.

91
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:27,700
And then the choices that I've put are the average of the order amount.

92
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:34,470
This is the first choice on A Put it as the first choice because the average here is having

93
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,920
the number one A referent,

94
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,550
the reference number one here on this table at the top.

95
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,830
Okay,

96
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:49,320
And then I've got the maximum as having the being the second option.

97
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,450
Because it's got number two here,

98
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:57,020
and I've got minimum as having as being the third option,

99
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,410
because it's got number three and some as being the fourth option.

100
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,460
Because total is number four here for here on the table at the top.

101
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,160
OK,

102
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:14,750
and what happens is that when I choose the type of aggregation that I want to apply self a

103
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,110
choose average.

104
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,250
Okay,

105
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,150
this gets put here in the pivot table,

106
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,190
okay?

107
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:28,350
And I get here the reference number off the aggregation type that I want to apply on.

108
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,220
Then the choose function reads that reference number.

109
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,910
Okay,

110
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,810
So que 13 is going to be one,

111
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,460
and so the chills function is going to choose to apply.

112
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,800
The first option here on the first option is the average.

113
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,650
This is the aggregation type that's going to be applied.

114
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,750
Okay,

115
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,250
on if I choose maximum,

116
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,050
I will get number two here,

117
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,250
okay?

118
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,390
And the second aggregation type will be applied,

119
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,910
which is maximum.

120
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,250
Okay,

121
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:11,410
so got the maximum order amounts put put here and sell G two.

122
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,830
And this is gonna be the same story with minimum and with some.

123
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,330
Okay,

124
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,060
so basically,

125
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,980
the truce function will refer Ah,

126
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,060
to this or reference,

127
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,270
this cell here will get its choice Ah,

128
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,760
number or the reference number of his choice from this cell here from self k 13.

129
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,570
And then it will apply that aggregation function.

130
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,630
Ah,

131
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,290
Teoh.

132
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:48,190
And get that the result And actually the aggregation functions are being applied to the

133
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,290
column for the order amounts here on the table.

134
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,870
And this is a structured reference for the table.

135
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,590
And if you're having any problem or you don't understand what a structured references I'd

136
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,230
recommend you watch the lost two lessons.

137
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,440
Ah,

138
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,240
on the course which are bonus lessons about tables about excel tables,

139
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,750
you'll be able to understand what a structured references,

140
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,610
okay.

141
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,450
And I have no problem understanding that.

142
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,980
Okay?

143
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,670
So,

144
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,620
basically,

145
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,750
whenever you choose what you choose here on the slicer.

146
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,630
The aggregation gets applied here in cell G two,

147
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,150
and then we've got some sort of an interactive text here.

148
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,390
So actually,

149
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,590
I'm aggregating.

150
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,450
What's Unseld J 13 here.

151
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,450
Okay.

152
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,960
With the word order amount.

153
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,100
But put a space beside before it so that there would be a space between the aggregation

154
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,430
type and the word.

155
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,950
The two words order amount.

156
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,910
Okay,

157
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,120
this is just,

158
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,560
um,

159
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,010
the text labour leader economic texts label that I've created to just ah,

160
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:10,220
have something that that would change dynamically as I change my choice Year is a choose

161
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,050
something different on the slicer.

162
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,150
Okay,

163
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,310
so Ah,

164
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,550
this is how the technique works,

165
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,090
guys.

166
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:18,780
Um,

167
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,650
so someone would ask,

168
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,950
What if I don't choose here?

169
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,990
A Ah,

170
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,680
I make two choices on the slicer.

171
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,300
Actually,

172
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,600
Excel will just ah,

173
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,790
do the first choice.

174
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,170
Or actually,

175
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:41,460
you will got the result off the first choice because we're referring to the first cell on

176
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,060
the pivot table here.

177
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,150
The first row under the sum of number.

178
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,290
Um,

179
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,030
call him,

180
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,680
and then he just changed the ah,

181
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,950
the header of that column to make a reference number something.

182
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,570
Okay,

183
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,830
of course,

184
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,480
Normally you be hiding this,

185
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,210
um,

186
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,510
pivot table from the user so the user wouldn't see that you'd be putting It may be in

187
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,300
another sheet.

188
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,850
And you be hiding that many table as well.

189
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,870
Okay.

190
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,480
And,

191
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:16,850
uh,

192
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,470
that's it.

193
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,540
You could maybe,

194
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,360
um,

195
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,800
have like,

196
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,350
um,

197
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,370
a cell here that would say,

198
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,040
um,

199
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,500
that would have a formula.

200
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,550
Okay,

201
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,580
that would count These cells here,

202
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,350
give you the count of these cells.

203
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,800
And remember,

204
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,770
guys that comes function,

205
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,580
it counts.

206
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,930
Only the cells having numbers.

207
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,450
Okay.

208
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,740
So,

209
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,710
um,

210
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:54,700
you could maybe put an EF four minute here if count of this is greater than one,

211
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,650
then,

212
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,400
um,

213
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:05,250
please choose one aggregation type.

214
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,260
Okay,

215
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,450
I'm gonna show you why I have done that.

216
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,940
Okay,

217
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,360
Else,

218
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,040
give me a blank cell.

219
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,630
It's on.

220
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm doing that so that if the user chooses to aggregation types,

221
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,750
you had got this cell here saying,

222
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,250
Please choose one aggregation type,

223
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,720
and you could maybe give this warning,

224
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,760
sell some conditional formatting,

225
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,560
so maybe you can go to conditional formatting highlights.

226
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,700
So rules and then text that contains,

227
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,870
please.

228
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,650
Shoes.

229
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,050
One aggregation type.

230
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,310
Okay.

231
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,540
Now,

232
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,590
so that if ah,

233
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,500
the user makes more than one choice,

234
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,360
this cell here would have a red color and some sort of a warning that says,

235
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,160
please choose one aggregation type,

236
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,190
and then the user would,

237
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,890
ah,

238
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,760
just choose one aggregation type on.

239
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,550
This warning would disappear.

240
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,520
Okay,

241
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,750
so you can do that.

242
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,110
Ah,

243
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:20,210
so that you'd give the user some sort of warning if they choose to arm or aggregation types

244
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,210
.

245
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,910
Zero shows in three works was three.

246
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,840
And it works with,

247
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,800
you know,

248
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,850
four aggregation types.

249
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,050
If you want to choose for it works with four aggregation types as well,

250
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,570
and it selected a same time.

251
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,260
Eso the user will get a warning.

252
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,110
You know,

253
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,300
when they select more than one aggregation type,

254
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,800
but it's just the select.

255
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,740
Just one.

256
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,120
Um,

257
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,750
the the warning disappears here.

258
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,470
Okay,

259
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,350
So I hope that was informative for you guys.
