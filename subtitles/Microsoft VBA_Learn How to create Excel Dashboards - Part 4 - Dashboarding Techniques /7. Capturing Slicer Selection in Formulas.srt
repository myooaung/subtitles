00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
Hey,

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,080
guys,

3
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,650
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,700
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,720
we're going to discuss another a technique that involves putting our slices selection into

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,160
formula.

7
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,200
So as you can see,

8
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,150
I've got a slicer.

9
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,980
And as I'm changing my selection to date on the chart changes this chart actually gets its

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,150
data from this table here,

11
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,970
and this slicer is actually linked to this pivot table.

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,220
This pivot table is a very simple pivot table that has the model field put in the row

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,060
section here.

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,660
And this pivot table is based on the actual sales road eater and the actual sales raw data

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,960
is one of two row data sets that we've got would get the actual sales and the forecast

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,550
sales.

17
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:46,920
So this stable axity just references the model name from our slicer selection.

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,660
So we've got a summits formula that calculates the sales,

19
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:57,130
the actual and the forecast from the respective data sets based on our slices selection and

20
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,890
that particular month also,

21
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,580
we have actually put this value here in cell p five,

22
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,110
which is our slicer selection.

23
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,980
We've made it a name drain so created a very simple name,

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,170
drains a scold slices election.

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:20,080
We've just made it equal to that cell just to be able to refer to that cell as slicer

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,710
selection.

27
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,050
It's not necessary,

28
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,150
but it just makes things easier.

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,500
As you can see here,

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,250
this is a chart title text.

31
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,150
This cell here contains the chart title text,

32
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:38,640
and this cell has a formula that tests if the cell under our slicer selection cell is empty

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,200
or not.

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,820
So if is blank,

35
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,930
so test if.

36
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,180
Is this blank or not?

37
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,500
Because if it is not blank than we've selected multiple models,

38
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,360
so he's sincere.

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,110
If I select multiple models,

40
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,400
it's not gonna be blank.

41
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,300
So two or more is gonna make cell P six not blank.

42
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,790
And this is something that we don't want to do because we don't want the user to select

43
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,890
multiple models because then the summers formulas were not work properly because they can

44
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,310
only reference one model.

45
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,300
So this is why,

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,660
in case the user selects multiple models,

47
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,640
he will get a warning messages.

48
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,780
This please choose one model on Lee.

49
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,290
So this is actually a test that we do in order to make sure that the user selects one model

50
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:28,360
on Lee and this title boxier just references this cell so as to make the title dynamic.

51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,830
And basically the title says the slice of selection actual versus focus sales.

52
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,570
So that particular model that we selected actual versus forecast sales.

53
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,860
So that's it.

54
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,890
This is a very simple technique to involve your slicer selection into a formula.

55
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,900
So thank you very much,

56
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,130
guys,

57
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,680
for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
