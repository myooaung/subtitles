00:05.350 --> 00:06.690
Hello and welcome back.

00:06.740 --> 00:10.810
In this lecture I'd like to provide a solution to our previous challenge which was implementing the

00:10.810 --> 00:15.000
proxy design pattern to control access to the Internet certain Internet sites.

00:15.010 --> 00:17.130
So let's bring up the ontology idea.

00:17.200 --> 00:21.760
We're gonna create a project we're going to name this project proxy solution

00:29.160 --> 00:37.330
remember again this is gonna control access to restricted to the Internet first thing we're gonna do

00:37.330 --> 00:39.020
is we're gonna create our subject.

00:39.040 --> 00:43.650
Remember this is the interface in new Java class and we're just going to name our subject.

00:44.020 --> 00:46.500
Enter net.

00:47.290 --> 00:51.430
And this is gonna throw an exception in our method.

00:51.430 --> 00:55.040
So we're gonna say in our method is just gonna be our connecting method.

00:55.110 --> 01:05.220
You're gonna say public void connect to string server host and this will throw an exception

01:08.410 --> 01:09.280
something like that

01:14.870 --> 01:19.890
and we need to make it an interface.

01:19.940 --> 01:22.910
Next thing we're gonna create the real real subject.

01:22.910 --> 01:25.250
This does the actual work.

01:25.370 --> 01:28.750
This is gonna be called real Internet.

01:29.630 --> 01:35.840
And this is going to implement the Internet interface.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.270
This is going to override our CONNECT TO

01:42.650 --> 01:46.710
GAIN taking a string server host and this is not going to have any real behavior.

01:46.730 --> 01:48.740
We're just going to put that hey we're able to connect.

01:49.220 --> 01:56.150
So we're gonna say system that out that print line we're gonna say connecting to a certain name of the

01:56.150 --> 01:56.780
host.

01:59.660 --> 02:01.270
Very straightforward.

02:01.310 --> 02:05.380
Now the key is writing the proxy that will determine access to the real Internet.

02:06.290 --> 02:10.700
So to create the proxy we're gonna need this proxy Internet.

02:11.160 --> 02:21.910
And this is going to be a regular class that implements are subject interface proxy Internet implements

02:24.130 --> 02:27.670
Internet.

02:28.420 --> 02:33.010
And this is gonna have a reference remember to the sub.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.460
We're gonna have two member variables here.

02:35.460 --> 02:37.980
One is the reference to the real subject.

02:37.980 --> 02:40.490
So private Internet Internet.

02:41.130 --> 02:45.720
And that's just gonna be a new real Internet.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.100
We don't have to worry about performance issues here.

02:48.120 --> 02:53.260
We're also gonna have a static list of banned sites.

02:53.310 --> 03:00.240
So we're gonna say banned sites and then we're gonna create that static list.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.770
It's just gonna be a new array list.

03:01.770 --> 03:04.350
We're just gonna put a bunch of arbitrary sites in there

03:08.310 --> 03:12.040
just to make it interesting something like fan sites.

03:13.990 --> 03:21.120
Yup dot com Hello Dot Com you know a bunch of nonsense sites and double quotes or not copy correctly.

03:21.120 --> 03:21.600
So

03:24.480 --> 03:25.620
there we go.

03:25.620 --> 03:29.100
Whatever dot com Nope dot com Yelp and hello.

03:29.130 --> 03:34.410
Now when we try to create to the connect to the Internet it's going to look up in this list.

03:34.410 --> 03:49.120
So we still need to override our connect to and we're gonna say F banned sites that contains server

03:49.120 --> 03:56.650
host and we'll just be safe here we'll say to lowercase if it contains that.

03:56.650 --> 03:57.930
Where are we gonna do.

03:58.180 --> 03:59.920
We're gonna throw no exception.

04:00.260 --> 04:07.330
That's requirements and the new Exception is going to say access denied.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.440
And if it's not in the banned list we can actually connect.

04:13.450 --> 04:21.370
So we'll just say Internet dot connect to and we'll pass it the server host.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.050
Again it's pretty straightforward.

04:23.050 --> 04:27.230
You should notice that the proxies controlling access to the Internet.

04:27.370 --> 04:33.560
It's not going to connect if you are banned site till the client becomes pretty simple as well.

04:33.970 --> 04:40.030
Just say new top class client and this is gonna need a main method

04:43.800 --> 04:50.620
and all this is going to do is try to connect with a good site and a bad site.

04:51.130 --> 04:54.880
So we're gonna first create a reference or an object proxy object.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.680
Internet Internet equals new proxy Internet

05:01.800 --> 05:05.040
and then we're going to need and close this in a try catch because it could throw an exception if it's

05:05.040 --> 05:06.090
a banned site.

05:06.090 --> 05:10.440
So we're gonna try to first connect to.

05:10.440 --> 05:15.720
I'll just say Jason fed and dot org.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.990
See if that works and then we're gonna try to connect to one of the banned sites.

05:18.990 --> 05:22.560
Remember when testing you always want to test a good case on a bad case.

05:22.560 --> 05:29.610
Here we're gonna say whatever which is in our band site list dot com and then we need to catch that

05:33.600 --> 05:40.050
and if we catch the exception we'll just get the message that was passed to the exception e dot get

05:40.440 --> 05:48.330
message and then we'll close our class so our client creates a reference to the proxy Internet not the

05:48.330 --> 05:49.370
real Internet.

05:49.680 --> 05:55.870
And then it tries to connect to using a good site in a bad site so we say build and then we try to run

05:55.870 --> 06:03.320
it say run client meet and again you'll notice we.

06:03.360 --> 06:09.780
We were able to connect to Jason Fed dot org but we were not able to connect to whatever dot com access

06:09.780 --> 06:15.570
was denied maybe beneficial to say access denied and then actually print out the hostname as well.

06:15.570 --> 06:19.220
But so that's the proxy solution to our previous challenge.

06:19.220 --> 06:19.610
Thank you.
