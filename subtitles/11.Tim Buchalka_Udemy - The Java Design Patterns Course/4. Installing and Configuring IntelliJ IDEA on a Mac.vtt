00:05.040 --> 00:10.680
All right so in this video we're going to install and configure Intel E.J. for the Mac.

00:10.750 --> 00:13.230
So again a reminder that this video is for the Mac.

00:13.230 --> 00:18.160
And check out the other videos in this section if you're on a Windows machine or using Linux.

00:18.250 --> 00:26.140
The first thing we want to you though is go to GIP brains dot com chip brains is a company that create

00:26.140 --> 00:33.070
or have created the Intel feature idea product which we'll be using in this course to write Java programs.

00:33.070 --> 00:38.860
Once you get to their site nothing over ever tools just hover over that come down here to Intel each

00:38.860 --> 00:39.760
idea.

00:39.820 --> 00:44.140
Click on that and come down here and select download.

00:45.990 --> 00:50.930
I'm just gonna close this little cookie window by clicking on yes I agree this when we do that we've

00:50.970 --> 00:52.680
got two options for Intel.

00:52.970 --> 00:59.180
Once we get to the screen we can download the community edition or the ultimate edition and you can

00:59.180 --> 01:02.380
see that the community edition is free and open source.

01:02.870 --> 01:06.190
So that would be the best option for you if you don't want to pay for the software.

01:06.410 --> 01:08.990
The Ultimate Edition is set up.

01:08.990 --> 01:12.920
If you're a professional programmer and you need access to some of the other features.

01:13.460 --> 01:19.680
So for now I suggest you download the community edition out of the stop at download and you can say

01:19.680 --> 01:21.590
it's downloading up here.

01:21.780 --> 01:27.040
And in terms of the ultimate addition you do get a trial we can a 30 day trial with that.

01:27.060 --> 01:33.990
So if you do want to try that out what I can do is I can actually extend that to a total of a 120 days

01:34.420 --> 01:40.170
intelligence because I've recommended the software so much have graciously given me the ability to give

01:40.170 --> 01:44.050
you a coupon to extend the trial to 120 days.

01:44.230 --> 01:49.380
So if you want to do that get into the last section of this course is a lecturer in that last section

01:49.740 --> 01:55.950
called extending trial for intelligent Ultimate Edition or words to that effect and that will give the

01:55.950 --> 01:58.440
instructions if you want to extend the Ultimate Edition.

01:59.100 --> 02:03.510
But as I mentioned earlier the Community Edition will do everything you want it to do and there's really

02:03.510 --> 02:09.090
no need to get the ultimate edition unless you specifically want to access some of the features on offer

02:09.120 --> 02:13.350
that's a professional programmer would do what I can say at this point.

02:13.350 --> 02:17.520
Now intelligence a Community Edition has downloaded for me I'm going to open it.

02:17.620 --> 02:22.790
They're going to navigate to the folder to double click to open it.

02:22.950 --> 02:30.280
I'm going to close down the browser because we're done with that now place and find a and he'd say being

02:30.280 --> 02:35.610
a Mac application it's quite easy to install it's going to drag it into the applications folder we have

02:35.640 --> 02:36.620
our moment to complete.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.240
So you can see they're competing on the screen

02:41.960 --> 02:42.740
that's now complete.

02:42.740 --> 02:49.880
I want to close up windows and I'm going to close is here I'm going to inject it and the other thing

02:49.880 --> 02:53.390
I would do then is start some just kind of open to find a window.

02:53.390 --> 03:00.560
I'm gonna go to my applications and were fine intelligent idea C C E standing for Community Edition

03:00.570 --> 03:02.680
and a double click that will open it up

03:06.180 --> 03:10.020
we'll give it a moment to verify click on open

03:12.880 --> 03:16.470
now the very first time that you open an intelligent idea.

03:16.590 --> 03:21.000
It is the first time ever on your computer or the first time for a new version you'll get this little

03:21.000 --> 03:21.770
pop up.

03:21.780 --> 03:26.350
This gives you the option if you've already got an installation of intelligent ideas you can select

03:26.350 --> 03:32.230
the location and download or import rather the settings from a previous installation.

03:32.240 --> 03:35.070
Now we don't need to do that here for two reasons.

03:35.070 --> 03:39.060
Firstly we have any setting changes but secondly we haven't got a previous installation either.

03:39.080 --> 03:42.710
Sorry to click on do not import settings but that's an option for you.

03:42.830 --> 03:48.270
And in fact if intelligent found in its previous installation of intelligent on the computer would actually

03:48.270 --> 03:49.880
come up with that directory automatically.

03:50.520 --> 03:53.810
I'm going to select do not import settings and click on okay.

03:54.570 --> 03:59.530
He may or may not get this option here for privacy policy depending where you are in the world.

03:59.610 --> 04:01.220
So I'm just gonna go down to the bottom.

04:01.470 --> 04:02.540
Click on accept.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.630
You can read that and do whatever is appropriate.

04:05.970 --> 04:07.530
Likewise for data sharing.

04:07.530 --> 04:11.100
You may or may not get this but if you do get it I would suggest don't send.

04:11.120 --> 04:17.820
But you can't send anonymous usage statistics to git brains to help improve their software if you want.

04:17.930 --> 04:23.250
I'm going to click on send so now we've got a couple of configuration options.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.370
You can choose the background.

04:25.440 --> 04:30.870
I'm gonna go with a light background like so if you want to choose dark Kula you can do that and you

04:30.870 --> 04:35.070
can change any of these settings and I'm showing you in these settings at a later point so I don't think

04:35.070 --> 04:37.370
that you can't change it down the track.

04:37.380 --> 04:38.370
You can do that if you want to.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.820
I'm gonna click on Next.

04:41.580 --> 04:46.050
I'm going to leave the default came at scheme if you know what you're doing and you want to change things

04:46.060 --> 04:50.400
you can do that but I'm going to leave the default and that's what I'll assume in the course that you're

04:50.400 --> 04:56.190
using the default key map settings click on launch a script.

04:56.310 --> 05:00.860
This is an option if you want to run intelligent idea from the command line.

05:00.990 --> 05:07.270
Now we won't be doing that in this course we'll just be invoking Intel A.J. by studying the icon that

05:07.290 --> 05:11.430
double clicking the icons we normally would but it wouldn't hurt to create to launch a script if you

05:11.430 --> 05:11.990
want to do that.

05:12.070 --> 05:14.280
If you click on that it's there if you need to.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.110
That's a shortcut.

05:15.120 --> 05:18.380
If you're a programmer he uses the command line.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.360
Click on next.

05:19.380 --> 05:26.280
And that's been created for us Intel each idea gives you the option to download install plugins and

05:26.280 --> 05:27.840
you can see there's a variety there.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.830
But all these points on the screen we aren't going to use but you can see it in fact some of them are

05:31.830 --> 05:35.600
actually set in fact all of them are set to be installed anyways.

05:35.610 --> 05:37.110
We're just gonna leave them as they are.

05:37.170 --> 05:42.750
We're not going to change anything and click on Next featured plugins and these options here we aren't

05:42.750 --> 05:46.830
going to install any of those because we're not going to be using these particular plugins for this

05:46.830 --> 05:47.760
course.

05:47.790 --> 05:55.300
So going to click on start using and tele GI idea of Kirby now depending on whether you selected the

05:55.300 --> 05:57.830
launch script or not you'll be asked to enter your password.

05:57.890 --> 05:58.780
I'm going to top that in

06:01.480 --> 06:03.060
and intelligent ideas.

06:03.130 --> 06:10.200
Starting as you can see all right so we've now got intelligent ideas installed but there are a couple

06:10.200 --> 06:13.530
of other things we want to do to get it ready to start using it.

06:14.010 --> 06:19.740
So the first thing we want to do is we want to connect or associate intelligence idea with the Java

06:19.740 --> 06:20.460
development kit.

06:20.460 --> 06:23.510
We downloaded and installed in the previous video.

06:24.300 --> 06:30.600
So to do that I'm going to select configure the command here and select project defaults then I'm going

06:30.600 --> 06:36.840
to select project structure I want to make sure that when this pops up that project is selected and

06:36.840 --> 06:39.020
you can see that was sector by default for me.

06:39.570 --> 06:45.600
Now that's is that this is the first time that I will install intelligent on this computer here an option

06:45.600 --> 06:51.630
that says no SDK if I select that you'll find that it may or may not have picked up that there's a Java

06:51.710 --> 06:57.090
11 installation in my case even though I haven't actually configured intelligence on this computer before

06:57.570 --> 07:00.990
it's actually found the installation for a sort of actually.

07:00.990 --> 07:05.180
So I can just click on that and I could do it that way I could configure it.

07:05.190 --> 07:10.660
But what I'm actually trying to do is come down here to SD ks and I'm going to delete this.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.360
And the reason I'm going to delete it is just to show you how to configure it if for some reason that

07:15.360 --> 07:16.020
wasn't selected.

07:16.020 --> 07:21.690
So if it is there you can leave it as it was showing or saying that it no longer exists.

07:21.690 --> 07:31.090
When I click on you we can select J.D. K. And you can see in this case that automatically intelligence

07:31.090 --> 07:33.710
has found the installation of Java for us.

07:34.140 --> 07:40.140
If I click here you can see that it's found the location and this is the location where the dreaded

07:40.150 --> 07:43.240
Kay was installed automatically for us in the previous video.

07:43.630 --> 07:47.530
So that would be the forward you would need to navigate to if you're doing this manually and for some

07:47.530 --> 07:49.840
reason it didn't pop up automatically.

07:49.870 --> 07:53.410
We've got the JT K 11 folder contents and home.

07:53.440 --> 07:59.500
But again intelligence as you saw found that for us automatically I'm going to click on open and you

07:59.500 --> 08:03.000
can see that we've got eleven Java Version 11 showing there.

08:03.010 --> 08:06.940
The other thing we need to do is change his project language level.

08:06.940 --> 08:10.020
When I click on here and we also want to click on and make that eleven.

08:10.510 --> 08:15.670
So that is set to the same version of the Java developer kit that we're going to be using.

08:15.670 --> 08:21.120
So I'm going to click on that you'll get this pop up and this is because it's relatively new.

08:21.160 --> 08:26.040
So when I click on accept that I most likely will disappear up to where that pop up I click on except

08:26.030 --> 08:28.090
if you say it and then click on.

08:28.090 --> 08:28.550
Okay.

08:30.010 --> 08:30.240
All right.

08:30.240 --> 08:35.290
So at this point we've now configured the Java development kit for intelligence so that we can use that

08:35.290 --> 08:37.590
to create Java programs.

08:37.590 --> 08:41.710
Now there's a couple of other settings which are optional but a highly recommended.

08:41.710 --> 08:45.150
So what I'm going to do is just configure those now and then we'll actually be done.

08:45.670 --> 08:51.670
So to get access to those settings on a click on configure I'm going to select preferences when that

08:51.670 --> 08:56.590
opens I'm going to come over here and select editor clicking on the disclosure triangle going to come

08:56.590 --> 09:02.350
out a general click on that and then I can click on the disclosure triangle and I'm going to first select

09:02.470 --> 09:03.730
auto import.

09:04.130 --> 09:10.120
And there's two checkboxes here we want to select to check rather first one ad an ambiguous imports

09:10.120 --> 09:10.710
on the fly.

09:11.170 --> 09:14.670
And the second optimize inputs on the fly for current project.

09:14.700 --> 09:19.450
Now actually talk later about what these are for but for now we're just going to configure this and

09:19.450 --> 09:26.080
set these settings up and these settings will be applied for every new project we create in the course.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.070
All right so moving on the next thing I want to select is appearance when I click on that you want to

09:30.070 --> 09:32.980
make sure that show line numbers is checked.

09:32.980 --> 09:34.830
You can see here that that is checked.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.120
So we don't need to do anything there.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.690
Then last area we need to go into his code forwarding.

09:39.700 --> 09:46.540
So I'm gonna click on that and what we're going to do is select or uncheck a number of these checkboxes.

09:46.540 --> 09:51.920
Now the reason we're checking them is we don't want intelligence to try and hide any of our code.

09:52.120 --> 09:56.590
When you're a professional programmer you'll find that you'll often want to hide aspects of the code

09:56.590 --> 09:58.150
that you're very familiar with.

09:58.630 --> 10:02.330
But when you're just starting out it's a good idea to make sure none of that happens.

10:02.350 --> 10:05.870
So for that reason I'm going to uncheck imports.

10:06.020 --> 10:12.040
I'm also going to uncheck what line methods I'm going to uncheck closures.

10:12.230 --> 10:16.310
And finally I'm going to uncheck generic constructor and method parameters.

10:16.910 --> 10:18.920
So don't worry too much about what they mean.

10:18.980 --> 10:20.990
I'll talk more about that in later videos.

10:20.990 --> 10:25.370
The point here is that we do selecting those so that we can access to all the code when we're writing

10:25.820 --> 10:27.120
our Java programs.

10:27.170 --> 10:30.040
So we'll click kind of K to save those changes.

10:30.270 --> 10:33.060
And at this point we're now done.

10:33.120 --> 10:33.410
All right.

10:33.410 --> 10:38.060
Some of the previous video we installed the Java developer kit in this video we've been through the

10:38.060 --> 10:40.930
process of installing and configuring Intel each idea.

10:41.480 --> 10:47.240
And we've associated it with the Java developer kit and we've configured a few settings as well.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.870
At this point we're ready to move on to the next video.

10:50.090 --> 10:56.030
And in actual fact you can skip the next two videos because they relate to an installation of the Jedi

10:56.030 --> 10:59.660
K and Intel T.J. idea for a Linux platform.

10:59.990 --> 11:03.770
So skip those two videos and look for the video after that.

11:03.850 --> 11:10.150
That's got a title of first steps and in that video we'll start work on creating our first Java program.

11:10.430 --> 11:12.040
So I'll see you in that video.
