WEBVTT

00:05.220 --> 00:05.570
All right.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.850
So this is the Windows installation video.

00:08.850 --> 00:12.750
Skip this if you're on a Mac or you're running Linux.

00:12.750 --> 00:13.040
All right.

00:13.050 --> 00:19.800
So we've established now that you want to install Java eleven or in our case the JD k of Java development

00:19.800 --> 00:22.220
kit version eleven.

00:22.260 --> 00:29.670
There is one got you for Windows users though and that's if you're running a 32 bit version of Microsoft

00:29.670 --> 00:31.020
Windows.

00:31.020 --> 00:38.360
In that case Oracle don't provide 32 bit versions of the Java development kit anymore.

00:38.430 --> 00:45.030
You'll have to install an older version of the Java development kit if your computer has a 32 bit version

00:45.030 --> 00:46.350
of Windows.

00:46.350 --> 00:50.550
Don't worry though you can still follow along with the course and not be affected.

00:50.610 --> 00:53.760
There's just a slightly different installation process.

00:53.760 --> 00:58.290
Most modern computers these days are running a 64 bit version.

00:58.470 --> 01:05.050
But how do you actually know if your computer is running a 32 bit or 64 bit version of Windows.

01:05.290 --> 01:09.100
What you need to do is first take it into a control panel in windows.

01:09.100 --> 01:17.050
It's going to come down here and right click on the windows icon and select settings that will usually

01:17.050 --> 01:19.340
work for most versions of Windows.

01:19.510 --> 01:21.440
Then you want to go into system.

01:21.520 --> 01:26.770
Now in my case because I'm running Windows 10 I can actually type system and then I get an option down

01:26.770 --> 01:27.100
here.

01:27.160 --> 01:34.030
I'm kind of typing sys about halfway down here we can see a batch or P.C. I'm going to click on that

01:35.370 --> 01:38.570
and that's how I can get to the screen that I need to get to.

01:38.610 --> 01:42.990
Now if you're not running Windows 10 you need to go into system and then you'll find an option for about.

01:43.410 --> 01:47.510
So either way you get to the screen here and it should look very similar to this.

01:47.520 --> 01:52.440
If you're not running Windows 10 and the big way down looking for down here is this and a system taut

01:52.920 --> 01:57.660
64 bit operating system X 64 based processor.

01:57.660 --> 02:03.080
The important bit is a bit on the left which my case says 64 bit operating system.

02:03.170 --> 02:08.790
So that's telling me then obviously I'm running a 64 bit version and therefore I can use the JT capers

02:08.790 --> 02:14.490
and eleven but if you do this and find on your computer it says 32 bit operating system then you'll

02:14.490 --> 02:17.520
need to install the older version of the GK.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.410
All right some of the closes down.

02:19.500 --> 02:26.630
And armed with that knowledge we can go grab the correct JT cave sorry to do that we're going to go

02:26.630 --> 02:35.090
to a couple hours away print I'm going to go to Java dot some dot com All right so once we get to this

02:35.390 --> 02:42.320
oracle page we can come up here and click on Java is a Java essay by the way stands for Java standard

02:42.320 --> 02:45.480
edition and that's what we're gonna be using in this course.

02:45.480 --> 02:51.160
So I can say when I've done that on the screen now we've got Java AC 11 and in parentheses we can see

02:51.220 --> 02:52.350
oh yes.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.680
So he s means long term support.

02:55.260 --> 03:00.260
So at this point if you are running a 64 bit version of windows like I am come over here to the right

03:00.350 --> 03:09.400
under Oracle JD K. click on Download bring me here to Let's page up for the JFK version eleven I will

03:09.410 --> 03:10.780
scroll down a little bit.

03:11.030 --> 03:14.250
I'm going to click on except license agreement.

03:14.270 --> 03:16.670
I'm going to come down here to Windows.

03:16.670 --> 03:23.640
I'm going to click on the executable when I click on rundown he while that's downloading I'm gonna show

03:23.640 --> 03:26.250
you what the 32 bit version would look like.

03:26.250 --> 03:31.470
So if you're running a 32 bit version of windows you can't download this version or we can download

03:31.470 --> 03:33.520
it but you'll find it won't work.

03:33.540 --> 03:40.630
So instead what you do is you get back instead you'll scroll down a bit further noting that there's

03:40.630 --> 03:46.480
a Java 10 version there but we'll ignore that and we'll come down here to Java 8.

03:46.600 --> 03:52.920
This is the version of Java that will work was the last version that worked for 32 bit users.

03:53.030 --> 03:59.860
Then you'll come down here to Jerry Kay download click on that and other options here.

03:59.860 --> 04:00.790
We've got two versions.

04:00.790 --> 04:04.890
Windows x 8 6 and Windows x 6 4.

04:05.020 --> 04:12.010
So in the case of 32 bit users you would select this file here this I 586 version which is the x 6 version

04:12.580 --> 04:19.090
and download it as you saw me download the 80 k version eleven but obviously that would be Java not

04:19.090 --> 04:21.310
my kid version 8.

04:21.380 --> 04:23.740
I was going to click on yes to start my installation

04:26.600 --> 04:32.550
so again that would only be the you only need to do that if you have a 32 bit version of Windows.

04:32.750 --> 04:37.850
And in my case I've got the 64 bit and that's why I'm going to download as I'm gonna get back now just

04:37.850 --> 04:38.970
to that page again.

04:39.150 --> 04:41.000
And that was the version that I selected up here.

04:41.000 --> 04:41.650
Java eleven.

04:42.220 --> 04:48.680
So at this point once you've downloaded either Java 11 or Java right you'll find that the installation

04:48.680 --> 04:50.760
process when you start it will be very similar.

04:50.840 --> 04:55.060
So I'm going to go through the installation steps now for JT K eleven.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.310
I won't click on Next there.

04:57.990 --> 05:02.610
I'm going to leave the default but to keep a note of what this folder is.

05:02.640 --> 05:09.750
In my case you can see it C colon backslash Program Files backslash Java backslash JT K eleven and that

05:09.750 --> 05:13.230
will be slightly different if you've downloaded the Jedi Kate.

05:13.410 --> 05:15.740
Click on next.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.240
It's fairly simple installation process which goes through

05:21.470 --> 05:22.100
at this point.

05:22.110 --> 05:27.940
We're actually done the second class now the Java development kit has been installed in the next video

05:27.950 --> 05:30.720
it's time to download and install tele J.

05:30.960 --> 05:35.780
And that's the program we'll be using in the course that works with the j k that we've just installed

05:35.780 --> 05:39.680
in this video and it helps you to write and execute Java programs.

05:39.860 --> 05:41.600
So I'll see you in the next video.
