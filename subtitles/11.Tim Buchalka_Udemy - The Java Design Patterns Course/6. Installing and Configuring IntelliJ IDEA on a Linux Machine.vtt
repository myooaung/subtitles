WEBVTT

00:05.270 --> 00:10.580
All right so we're gonna go ahead in this video and installing configure Intel E.J. for the Linux platform.

00:11.030 --> 00:13.760
So again a reminder that this is the Linux video.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.780
Check out the other videos in this section.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.850
If you're running Windows or a Mac computer.

00:18.940 --> 00:24.350
All right so now that we've installed the JD K the Java development kit in the last video we now need

00:24.350 --> 00:31.140
to install the intelligent idea product which is the I.T. integrated development environment they're

00:31.160 --> 00:34.580
going to be using in this course to write our Java programs.

00:34.810 --> 00:38.910
So we'll go and open a browser again and we need to go to git brain.

00:38.920 --> 00:49.290
So dot com git brains is the company that have created this intel each idea product once you arrive

00:49.290 --> 00:51.870
on the website hover over the Tools menu.

00:52.020 --> 00:53.930
Come down here to intelligent ideas.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.570
Click on Download.

00:58.810 --> 01:04.730
I'm going to close down this little cookies pop up and you got two options here to download intelligent.

01:04.730 --> 01:10.220
We've got the community edition and also got the ultimate edition the Community Edition is free and

01:10.220 --> 01:10.910
open source.

01:10.970 --> 01:13.970
And that's going to be the one that I recommend to use in the course.

01:13.970 --> 01:19.280
But there's also this option if you're a professional programmer to use the Ultimate Edition and that's

01:19.280 --> 01:24.380
actually commercial software and you will get a free trial but you'll need to buy this at some point

01:24.800 --> 01:30.320
by default the Ultimate Edition gives you 30 days or 30 days to trial it.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.830
And what I can do is pick it enter the last lecture in this course.

01:33.830 --> 01:40.370
I can give you an extra 90 days courtesy of budget brains have generously given me some coupon codes

01:40.370 --> 01:41.920
to pass on to students.

01:41.990 --> 01:46.550
So if you do want to try the ultimate edition for 120 days by all means visit the last lecture in this

01:46.550 --> 01:47.000
course.

01:47.010 --> 01:52.550
But the Community Edition which is free and doesn't need any coupon is going to be the one that I recommend

01:52.550 --> 01:53.310
you download and use.

01:53.330 --> 01:59.360
I'm going to click on Download I'm going to say that you're going to go to my deadlines forward.

02:00.560 --> 02:00.890
All right.

02:00.930 --> 02:02.320
We have to say that's downloading.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.340
So just keep that a moment to finish.

02:04.390 --> 02:09.350
And by the way the ultimate edition has got lots of extra tools and capabilities.

02:09.350 --> 02:12.320
And as I mentioned it's aimed at professional developers.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.910
So there may be a reason down the line.

02:13.910 --> 02:15.490
If you're just starting out with Java to buy it.

02:15.500 --> 02:20.620
But certainly now you can start off as often here in download the free community edition.

02:20.720 --> 02:20.980
All right.

02:20.990 --> 02:22.010
I'm going to pause the video now.

02:22.010 --> 02:24.700
We'll come back once the download has completed.

02:24.710 --> 02:24.940
All right.

02:24.950 --> 02:27.930
So as you can see now the download has completed.

02:27.930 --> 02:31.970
So I'm going to close down this browser with analog and need that and what I'm going to do you can get

02:31.970 --> 02:34.480
to the command line if you want to zip it that way.

02:34.520 --> 02:40.760
I'm just going to go to the file manager and I'm going to go into the downloads folder and I'm just

02:40.760 --> 02:47.570
going to right click the idea download the file that we downloaded click on extract here and that will

02:47.570 --> 02:49.180
automatically extract the contents out.

02:49.190 --> 02:52.100
You can see we've got a folder there now.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.860
And what I'm going to do is move that into another folder.

02:55.970 --> 02:58.290
You know you can actually move the files wherever you like.

02:58.290 --> 03:04.180
But what I'm going to do is create a supporter of my home folder called software and putting teletype

03:04.280 --> 03:05.620
in there as a sub folder.

03:06.010 --> 03:09.570
But it's up to us to which or where he would like to place it.

03:09.820 --> 03:16.070
So to do that I'm just going to right click that click on move to and I'm gonna go to my home folder

03:16.370 --> 03:20.960
parallels in this case and I'm going to create a new folder first we'll call it software

03:23.690 --> 03:24.940
create.

03:25.340 --> 03:26.430
I'm going to put the folder in there.

03:26.450 --> 03:29.130
I click on select and I forgot to have a look.

03:29.140 --> 03:32.280
Now back to home I have a look in software.

03:32.970 --> 03:35.640
We can see we've got an intelligent subform today.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.130
Now again you can do this from the command line.

03:37.130 --> 03:44.540
I'm going to right click and I click on open in terminal that folder I'm going to close down the file

03:44.540 --> 03:45.730
manager we're not even there anymore

03:49.540 --> 03:58.210
really go into the folder they're going to be in the bin folder or into the idea folder first and then

03:58.210 --> 04:05.800
we go into the bin folder and what we're going to do is run the idea DSH depending on who installation

04:05.920 --> 04:10.190
of Unix you may have to set the execute attributes for Aidid or his height.

04:10.210 --> 04:11.500
But in my case it's ready to go.

04:11.500 --> 04:15.780
So I can just type full stop period forward slash idea.

04:15.820 --> 04:22.210
Guess how much I'm going to stop space Ampersand so that it doesn't type the command window and that

04:22.210 --> 04:27.450
should start intelligent now and I'm just going to minimize the window for now.

04:27.520 --> 04:32.920
Now you'll get this option when you first install intelligent or anytime install a new version.

04:32.920 --> 04:33.460
It's asking.

04:33.460 --> 04:39.050
Have we got a custom location where we can import some configuration options from Intelligence.

04:39.190 --> 04:43.780
From a previous installation in this case it's a brand new install and you can see tuner import settings

04:43.780 --> 04:45.300
is automatically selected.

04:45.430 --> 04:50.830
So I'm just going to go with that and click on okay with this privacy policy that may or may not pop

04:50.830 --> 04:59.450
up have agreed to that described to the end and click on accept this is the data sharing option.

04:59.450 --> 05:05.540
If you're happy to send anonymous statistics or data about the features and plugins used etc then you

05:05.540 --> 05:07.840
can click on send usage statistics.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.590
I'm going to select don't send

05:12.520 --> 05:15.490
next we've got the theme that we'd like to use for intelligence.

05:16.030 --> 05:16.970
You can tackle it.

05:17.030 --> 05:19.780
Oculus selected by default which you can say is a dark background.

05:20.440 --> 05:25.210
I'm gonna select intelligence with the white background but that's a personal preference noting you've

05:25.210 --> 05:31.960
also got GTA plus as an option here and you can also go into settings at a later time and overall change

05:31.960 --> 05:32.620
those settings.

05:32.620 --> 05:38.080
Anyway I'm going to click on Next to desktop entry and we do want a desktop entry.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.010
You'd normally want that.

05:39.220 --> 05:44.050
Let's say you have to try and start Intel Jay from the command line like you saw me do so I'm gonna

05:44.080 --> 05:48.960
leave that to our option there they're checked to create a desktop entry and obviously you click and

05:48.970 --> 05:50.110
check for all users.

05:50.140 --> 05:53.160
If you actually want to ever use it to be able to start Intel A.J..

05:53.260 --> 05:54.980
I'm going to leave that off for now.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.200
Click on launch script.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.620
This gives you an option to run intelligence from the command line.

06:00.660 --> 06:04.240
If you spent a lot of time in the command line it's very useful to be able to do this type.

06:04.240 --> 06:09.180
I had ideas space and then a phone name and have an open up so I'm going to select out to check that

06:09.180 --> 06:11.010
checkbox.

06:11.040 --> 06:15.300
You can accept the default location for where the script would be created.

06:15.300 --> 06:18.170
I'm going to leave it on us are local bin.

06:18.480 --> 06:25.010
Click on next to default plugins by default is a series of plugins that intelligence customize for you.

06:25.050 --> 06:29.820
We're not going to be using these specifically in the course and we don't need to make any changes because

06:29.820 --> 06:31.050
they are actually installed anyways.

06:31.050 --> 06:35.350
You can say I'm going to leave it as he is and click on Next to featured plugins.

06:35.580 --> 06:40.690
Here we've got the option to download three featured plugins or three of these we won't be using.

06:40.890 --> 06:45.840
You could install already a features trainer if you wanted to but I'm going to leave them all and installed

06:45.870 --> 06:47.430
and click on start using intel.

06:47.430 --> 06:48.350
Jay idea.

06:49.830 --> 06:55.470
We need to enter our authentication details because I selected the option to create a script so we could

06:55.470 --> 06:58.710
run it from the command line from the top in my password.

07:04.160 --> 07:11.600
Scientology has no pain or death started to close it down just to confirm now I can open this up again.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.710
Up here here 5 top intelligence.

07:17.460 --> 07:20.460
Just a couple of letters of intelligence we've got our desktop entry.

07:20.500 --> 07:28.020
I can click on that to actually started in somewhere like Mount all right so this is intelligent idea

07:28.020 --> 07:29.130
installed.

07:29.130 --> 07:33.270
We've got a few configuration things so steps that we need to take still.

07:33.330 --> 07:36.440
Firstly we need to associate the Java development kit.

07:36.450 --> 07:41.370
So we need to connect intelligently to the Java development kit that we installed in the previous video

07:41.940 --> 07:47.910
so that it can communicate and actually execute or compile and execute our Java programs.

07:47.910 --> 07:56.870
To do that we can click on configure a select project defaults and then select project structure.

07:56.900 --> 08:02.030
This gives us this option here and depending on your installation of linux that may or may not find

08:02.060 --> 08:03.440
the installation.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.650
You can say in this case in fact it's found the installation.

08:06.650 --> 08:12.460
And if you come down here and click honesty case you can see that it's found the JD K. Levin in the

08:12.570 --> 08:13.900
Unsullied JVM folder.

08:14.300 --> 08:19.340
But just in case it isn't found on your system I'm going to delete that and I I'll show you the process

08:19.340 --> 08:21.840
you would normally follow to install it manually.

08:21.860 --> 08:25.320
Came back to project you have an option and there's now no other options.

08:25.400 --> 08:34.220
You'll click on new Select JFK and you'd navigate to the are lib JVM and then whatever the field supporter

08:34.230 --> 08:40.470
name is in this case Tracy K. Levin noted that until it I found that for us click on Okay noting that

08:40.470 --> 08:45.210
that's now slightly different it does say Java Version 11 instead of just 11 and then the other thing

08:45.210 --> 08:52.020
to do he is under Project language level that should be selected at the same level as the JD K. that

08:52.020 --> 08:54.240
we've installed at Java Version 11th.

08:54.330 --> 08:57.620
We need to come down here and make sure this is set to Version 11 as well.

08:58.320 --> 09:02.460
And what we're doing there is making sure that the features of the latest version of Java 11 in this

09:02.460 --> 09:08.310
case are going to work in intelligence because we've told it to support those first or that language

09:08.310 --> 09:11.010
level if you will which is the latest version of Java.

09:11.230 --> 09:14.070
You give us a little pop up which will probably disappear in the future.

09:14.160 --> 09:22.110
It's come up because the j k l ever is so new except in any case and you click on okay and we've now

09:22.110 --> 09:24.810
configured the Java development kit.

09:24.810 --> 09:29.160
Now there's a few last minute things that we need to configure which are once off settings which makes

09:29.160 --> 09:31.740
life a little bit easier when using intelligence.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.640
So let's do that before we end the video.

09:34.080 --> 09:40.120
So to do the configure we're going to click on configure I'm going to click on settings and come down

09:40.120 --> 09:46.150
here and click on the little triangle to the left of Ed and cricket again to the left of general and

09:46.150 --> 09:52.110
the first option we want to click is auto import we want to check both of these boxes add unambiguous

09:52.210 --> 09:58.870
imports on the fly and optimize imports on the fly for current projects and we'll talk more in later

09:58.870 --> 10:00.410
videos as to what these are doing.

10:00.730 --> 10:04.390
But basically just making life a little bit easier when you're typing in code.

10:04.450 --> 10:10.430
The next option down here we want to select his appearance you want to make sure show line numbers is

10:10.430 --> 10:14.750
checked and you can see that that that is checked and that again makes life a little bit easier and

10:14.750 --> 10:16.920
you'll see that in action in future videos.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.970
And the final option ones select in here is under Code folding click on that they want to select or

10:22.970 --> 10:30.870
uncheck imports if it's checked unchecked for imports unchecked for one line methods unchecked for closures

10:31.670 --> 10:35.940
and finally unchecked a generic constructor and method parameters.

10:35.960 --> 10:41.600
So what we're doing here is we're d selecting code forwarding which is basically saying that we want

10:41.600 --> 10:43.130
to see all the code.

10:43.130 --> 10:45.920
We don't want intelligent idea to hide any of the code.

10:46.670 --> 10:51.860
When you start getting more experience with Java you'll often want to hide parts of the code that you're

10:51.860 --> 10:53.000
very familiar with.

10:53.210 --> 10:57.260
And that's what this does by default but we're turning those options off so that early on we get to

10:57.260 --> 10:58.090
see all the code.

10:58.100 --> 11:02.240
We don't have to click extra buttons to look at that hidden code.

11:02.420 --> 11:03.050
Going to click on.

11:03.080 --> 11:07.770
Okay at this point and then saves those settings and I should be good to go.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.700
And at this point we're actually completed.

11:11.030 --> 11:13.260
So we've now configured intelligent idea.

11:13.730 --> 11:18.530
We've connected it to the Java development kit and we've also had made a few changes to settings to

11:18.530 --> 11:20.600
make our experience with Java a little bit easier.

11:20.600 --> 11:24.510
When we first starting up we are now ready to move on to the next video.

11:24.510 --> 11:29.270
Now when that next video the one immediately after this one we're going to start looking at our first

11:29.270 --> 11:30.650
program our first steps.

11:30.660 --> 11:33.540
We're gonna create our first Java program.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.050
So I'll see you in that next video.
