00:05.150 --> 00:07.040
Hello and welcome back.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.710
In this lecture I wanted to talk a little bit about how the class is organized.

00:10.730 --> 00:15.320
The reason I wanted to provide this quick short lecture is so that it can help you better decide on

00:15.320 --> 00:18.110
whether or not you want to sign up for the class purchase the class.

00:20.390 --> 00:25.640
So this class is a little different than many of the classes on you dummy and that it's not just a how

00:25.640 --> 00:27.180
to.

00:27.230 --> 00:31.610
This class is organized around explaining all the concepts of programming language.

00:31.610 --> 00:37.250
It's really focused on the why in addition to providing the how I'm going to provide many how tos on

00:37.250 --> 00:41.180
how to write certain programs and demonstrate different concepts.

00:41.930 --> 00:46.700
But again it's a little unique in that it's just not a how to you're going to understand concepts you're

00:46.700 --> 00:50.210
going to understand why you're doing the things you're doing when you're writing your code.

00:50.330 --> 00:55.100
So it's a complete learning experience at the end of this class you're going to fully understand the

00:55.100 --> 01:01.580
program language specifically you're going to understand how the programming language works and all

01:01.580 --> 01:04.380
the concepts associated with that language.

01:04.460 --> 01:09.480
And again as I mentioned earlier I find this is lacking in many of the Udemy courses.

01:09.650 --> 01:17.990
Many of the NUMMI courses are nothing more than demonstrations of projects of of certain how tos on

01:17.990 --> 01:25.130
how to create a particular coding project without fully understanding what you're doing or why you're

01:25.130 --> 01:26.660
doing it.

01:26.660 --> 01:31.550
I also want to describe how I'm going to present this information and how you're going to learn it.

01:31.550 --> 01:37.040
First and foremost we're going to have all video lectures you know that policy and you dummy is mainly

01:37.040 --> 01:42.290
that the way they can provide a lot of some of the exact some of the material is going to provide it

01:42.290 --> 01:46.780
through PowerPoint slides and some people are negative on PowerPoint slides.

01:46.790 --> 01:51.180
They don't really like to learn from PowerPoint slides.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.380
They're just real not keen on it.

01:54.380 --> 02:00.140
The reason I provide PowerPoint slides is because I have to provide these concepts and definitions often

02:00.140 --> 02:06.640
is the case and they're very abstract and I can't just go into an idea and demonstrate the code.

02:06.950 --> 02:10.130
I have to provide the content some kind of text.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.480
Now I could provide that notepad word pad.

02:12.530 --> 02:20.150
Any other editor I choose PowerPoint slide PowerPoint because it has a nice visual representation and

02:20.150 --> 02:21.870
it's very useful in that manner.

02:21.890 --> 02:26.900
I'm not going to just be reading from the slides so I will hear some complaints often in other classes

02:27.200 --> 02:30.710
where hey you're using PowerPoint slides and you just going to read from them.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.470
Well no I'm not just going to read from them.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.320
I'm going to provide insight via my experience.

02:35.630 --> 02:41.300
So the PowerPoint slides again they're designed to provide for you the understanding of the material.

02:41.390 --> 02:47.270
I'm not sure any other way I can do that without providing at least some PowerPoint slides especially

02:47.270 --> 02:49.490
concerning abstract concepts and definitions.

02:49.490 --> 02:51.700
I just don't know no other way to do it.

02:51.770 --> 02:55.340
You have to listen and you have to try to understand from it.

02:55.340 --> 02:59.300
Now that doesn't mean we're going to not going to provide other concepts of learning but there are going

02:59.300 --> 03:02.430
to be PowerPoint slides so I understand that coming in the class.

03:02.480 --> 03:07.300
And these are going to contain thorough explanations VMI experience.

03:07.310 --> 03:11.060
It's a way for you to understand the concepts in the class.

03:11.060 --> 03:14.820
It's not the only thing that I'm to provide but you are going to see a PowerPoint slide.

03:14.840 --> 03:20.600
So don't just necessarily get negative on the entire class because there are PowerPoint slides.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.090
It's one technique in helping you learn.

03:23.090 --> 03:28.550
And I think a technique that needs that is needed in the class in addition to the PowerPoint slides.

03:28.580 --> 03:32.320
I'm going to do tons of practical hands on demonstrations of code.

03:32.690 --> 03:37.640
So I'm going to bring up the idea I'm going to bring up an editor I'm going to show you how to write

03:37.640 --> 03:39.400
the code in an editor.

03:39.430 --> 03:42.190
I'm write code examples I'm going to type in the code.

03:42.210 --> 03:43.260
These are gonna be concrete.

03:43.250 --> 03:48.170
They're gonna be real world so if this this type of learning will be more practical and we'll be more

03:48.170 --> 03:49.360
hands on learning.

03:49.660 --> 03:52.040
And I know many students like this and it's needed.

03:52.040 --> 03:57.200
I love it because it's more practical and actually see you can see how I'm writing code.

03:57.560 --> 04:03.350
Again though if I'm if I'm trying to present information or concepts such as polymorphism I also want

04:03.350 --> 04:07.880
to provide a lecture or a PowerPoint slide associate with that to give you a formal definition so that

04:07.910 --> 04:11.630
we don't just dive into the code and then you have to kind of scratch your head and say what exactly

04:11.630 --> 04:12.890
is he doing in the code.

04:12.980 --> 04:18.710
So pi point slides in addition and demonstrations are gonna be provided in this class.

04:18.770 --> 04:22.460
This will help supplement your learning of the language itself.

04:22.460 --> 04:28.070
In addition you need a way to assess how well you're doing in the class in what you're learning and

04:28.070 --> 04:33.470
if you're learning so we're going to provide challenges challenges that are essentially coding assignments

04:33.720 --> 04:38.830
through additional projects how it will work is provide you with this assignment.

04:38.870 --> 04:44.630
I'll tell you the requirements explain maybe give you some tips on how to complete the challenge and

04:44.630 --> 04:46.360
then you'll go off and do it on your own.

04:46.760 --> 04:51.800
And then I'll provide another video which will be a solution to that lecture so you can see whether

04:51.800 --> 04:53.660
or not you did it correctly.

04:53.660 --> 04:58.910
The solution will be a complete walkthrough or what is called a code along of the solution.

04:58.910 --> 05:03.860
I'll go line by line explaining every line of the solution in an integrated developed environment in

05:03.860 --> 05:06.920
an environment where you write your code I'll run it.

05:06.980 --> 05:08.900
I'll demonstrate how it works.

05:09.020 --> 05:09.700
Everything.

05:10.570 --> 05:15.800
And then addition to going through this video walkthrough I'll also provide all the source code to you

05:15.800 --> 05:22.880
so that you can download it and you can compare the source code to your source code in text but again

05:22.880 --> 05:26.870
I wanted to just provide this quick lecture so that you know how the class is organized in terms of

05:26.870 --> 05:29.730
how you're going to learn and what you're paying for.

05:29.960 --> 05:35.450
And if you see a lot of PowerPoint slides try to give you an idea of why provide them and why I think

05:35.450 --> 05:37.070
they're useful.

05:37.070 --> 05:42.500
Again I want to provide a complete learning environment and I don't think I can do that by just doing

05:42.500 --> 05:44.900
a how to of walking through projects.

05:44.900 --> 05:50.590
So I hope you appreciate this lecture and I hope you understand where I'm coming from and how you're

05:50.600 --> 05:51.440
going to learn in this class.

05:51.440 --> 05:51.830
Thank you.
