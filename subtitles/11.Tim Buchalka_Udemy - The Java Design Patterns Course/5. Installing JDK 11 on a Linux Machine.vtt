MARK COLVIN All so just a reminder here that this particular video is a boon to Linux.

00:10.750 --> 00:13.120
Check out the other videos in this section.

00:13.120 --> 00:16.040
If you're on Windows or you're running on a Mac.

00:16.200 --> 00:21.870
So at this point now it's time to download and install the Java development kit.

00:21.940 --> 00:25.470
We're going to be using version eleven as we've discussed previously.

00:25.540 --> 00:28.160
So I want to go firstly to the Java web site.

00:28.480 --> 00:36.490
And that is Java dot some dot com and we're going to download the Java development kit.

00:36.490 --> 00:42.890
So once we arrive at the site it's going to size this up so you can see it click on Java AC DC.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.920
By the way stands for Java standard edition.

00:45.970 --> 00:53.470
You can see over here we've got Java SC L1 LTE s LTE stands for long term support and come down over

00:53.470 --> 00:55.340
here to the right hand side under Oracle.

00:55.510 --> 00:56.450
JT okay.

00:56.680 --> 01:01.840
And I'm going to click on download that brings us to this page which is where we can download the Jedi

01:01.840 --> 01:02.570
okay.

01:02.890 --> 01:08.410
I need to click on it accept a license agreement because I'm on a boat to Linux I'm going to download

01:08.410 --> 01:14.140
and install the Tada GZ file and that will probably work with most destroyers.

01:14.290 --> 01:19.750
But if you want to depending whether you've got red hat or Debian or some other distro of Linux you

01:19.750 --> 01:25.430
can download one of these I love images so I'm going to select the duck tartare GZ I'm going to save

01:25.420 --> 01:30.110
that to my downloads folder and look at that a moment to complete.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.900
Now the process is going to be a little bit different because we on lyrics we're going to basically

01:34.900 --> 01:38.440
move it over manually ourself into the relevant folder.

01:38.440 --> 01:42.320
So to do that I'm going to do is go into the command line for this.

01:42.540 --> 01:46.090
So I'm gonna wait for this download to finish and then meanwhile make a start on it.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.700
Well actually mass will open the terminal window now while that's still downloading.

01:50.830 --> 01:57.850
So don't come up empty your activities I'm going to open terminal from the top terminal in here but

01:57.970 --> 02:04.600
you can just open the terminal in the normal way the way you would normally open it I can just size

02:04.600 --> 02:07.610
this up once this is finished downloading so I can see what we're doing.

02:08.070 --> 02:10.210
I'll just pause now until this is finished downloading.

02:11.110 --> 02:16.060
Okay so I can say that's not downloaded I'm just going to minimize the browser for now and bring back

02:16.060 --> 02:23.290
our terminal window which I've opened and I'm going to come into the downloads folder seedy space to

02:23.290 --> 02:25.810
the forward slash downloads with a capital D.

02:26.660 --> 02:32.800
And if we do what else we should be able to see our tidy K file there and what we wanted to do now is

02:32.800 --> 02:36.860
we want to unzip it first really use tough for that.

02:36.860 --> 02:39.740
So I can't make this a bit bigger so I can see the commands I'm typing here.

02:41.650 --> 02:42.410
So I'm going to talk.

02:42.420 --> 02:51.730
Tall spice dash SPF spice and I'm going to stop cherry K and press tab and choose our version of the

02:51.730 --> 02:57.250
GZ file and presenter and you can see that unzip that file.

02:57.500 --> 03:03.470
Now if we have a look again we could say we've got a JD K eleven far in the bottom my left hand corner

03:03.470 --> 03:03.690
there.

03:04.350 --> 03:09.630
So the next thing I want to do is create a directory to store our Java development kit.

03:09.740 --> 03:13.140
I'm gonna put it in USL Libre JVM in a sub folder.

03:13.370 --> 03:19.040
And the advantage of doing that is when we come to install Intel E.J. in the next video it looks there

03:19.400 --> 03:21.020
by default for that.

03:21.020 --> 03:24.310
For the JT K and you'll find it for us automatically.

03:24.740 --> 03:31.310
So I'm gonna start by typing sudo we need to do that because we're trying to access files that have

03:31.310 --> 03:39.560
been created by root so pseudo space in K desire space on us P and it's forward slash U.S. R fourth

03:39.560 --> 03:44.090
slash lib forward slash JVM forward slash.

03:44.090 --> 03:49.030
And I'm just going to create a new directory and call it JT K dash eleven.

03:49.190 --> 03:54.050
Now if there's a new version of the JT K there's a sub version that's come out eleven point one you

03:54.050 --> 03:59.690
might want to change the the directory name to be that but I'm just kind of stick with JT Kadish 11

04:00.380 --> 04:05.150
and put a forward slash there right and that's our forward created by saying to my password

04:07.760 --> 04:12.870
next I want to then move the contents of our unzipped JT K into that folder.

04:13.040 --> 04:13.770
So over the top.

04:14.090 --> 04:22.410
So we don't space in the space and JT K and I'm just pressing the tab there forward slash and then star.

04:22.430 --> 04:26.870
So basically the contents of the JT K eleven forward folder that we've unzipped.

04:27.020 --> 04:34.280
They want to move the contents to forward slash U.S. are would slash lib fourth last JVM forward slash

04:34.730 --> 04:40.030
press tab there because it's the any forward out what the any directory in there JT K level Hurricane

04:40.400 --> 04:48.960
Center and that's the contents now moved and just to make sure we can type Ellis s space slash USAF

04:48.970 --> 04:59.030
slash lib slash JVM slash JT K level and you can see the files when they never can see a number of file

04:59.030 --> 04:59.710
folders.

05:00.410 --> 05:06.080
Now depending on whether you've got Java or the java compiler configured we can actually use a pseudo

05:06.080 --> 05:11.240
update alternatives command to set it up so that Java will work from the command line at the moment

05:11.240 --> 05:19.160
if I type Java space dash version we'll get the fact that it's not found so if you're happy with that

05:19.280 --> 05:24.590
and you are only gonna be using Java from the intelligence a IDC the tool that we're going to be sorting

05:24.590 --> 05:29.600
in the next video you won't need to do this that command and I'm about to show you but if you actually

05:29.600 --> 05:38.270
want to run Java from the command line I suggest you type this command in top sudo space update space

05:38.300 --> 05:39.900
alternatives.

05:40.610 --> 05:47.820
Space minus minus or dash dash that should be install space and in double quotes forward slash U.S.

05:47.820 --> 05:56.410
R fourth slash in fourth slash Java double quotes the space and then double quotes again.

05:58.230 --> 06:03.020
So where Java in between and then we're going to point to Java on our installation so let's give me

06:03.020 --> 06:04.070
double quotes.

06:04.070 --> 06:13.370
Forward slash U.S. R force slash lib forward slash JVM forward slash and straight K eleven toward slash

06:14.070 --> 06:22.060
spin and forward slash Java enclosing double quiet space in ten ten.

06:22.720 --> 06:28.720
And now we can talk Java space minus version we could say we've got Java eleven actually working.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.550
So I'm going to do the same for the java compiler.

06:31.590 --> 06:39.650
I'm just gonna press the up arrow twice and change Java to Java C here and go back and change Java to

06:39.650 --> 06:41.030
Java C there.

06:41.030 --> 06:44.280
Then the final one third place Java C there as well.

06:45.090 --> 06:49.280
So we've done the same for Java as you can see there all right now the other thing we could do we could

06:49.280 --> 06:52.550
spend time setting up environment variables for Java.

06:52.550 --> 06:58.490
We don't need to use that or do that rather because we're going to be using the teletype idea tool for

06:58.490 --> 06:59.290
programming in Java.

06:59.290 --> 07:02.780
So for that reason I'm not going to spend any more time any more time configuring comms going to close

07:02.780 --> 07:09.080
down terminal window typing exit and we'll finish the video here in the next video we'll actually move

07:09.080 --> 07:15.800
on and start installing the tool intelligence idea that we gonna be using to write our Java programs.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.170
So I'll see you in the next video.
