00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] This course is designed

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:06.002
as an architectural focused, code agnostic offering,

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:10.003
and as such, your knowledge is centered around what you know

4
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:13.009
about the underlying technologies at play.

5
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.006
There is a little prerequisite knowledge

6
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:19.005
that I expect you to have before we start this course.

7
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.008
I would expect you to have a solid grasp

8
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:24.007
on the microservices architectural models

9
00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:27.000
before you begin this course.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.003
If you feel you need some help there,

11
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:31.003
or even just a refresher,

12
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:35.004
consider watching my course, Microservices Foundations,

13
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:38.009
available here in the LinkedIn Learning Catalog.

14
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.001
I would also expect you to have some basic understanding

15
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:46.000
of restful communications over HTTP,

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.002
and really, the important aspect here is the HTTP part.

17
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:54.002
If you understand how TCP/IP work,

18
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:57.001
especially in the context of HTTP,

19
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.001
the better prepared you will be when identifying

20
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.002
where these asynchronous patterns

21
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:04.008
can help you in your system.

22
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.008
I'm going to also expect you to understand

23
00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:10.001
the very basics of asynchronous messaging.

24
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:14.003
I don't need you to understand RabbitMQ, JMS, or Kafka,

25
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:16.004
just some base conceptual understanding

26
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:19.006
of messaging in computer systems.

27
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:21.008
Now let's get some work done

28
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:25.000
with asynchronous messaging in microservices.
