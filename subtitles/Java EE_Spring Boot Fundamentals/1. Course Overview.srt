Hi everyone.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,870
My name is Kesha Williams, and welcome to my course, Spring Boot Fundamentals.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,320
I'm a software engineering manager in the IT department of Chick‑fil‑A.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,380
In this course, we are going to learn about Spring Boot,

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,370
an extension of the Spring Framework that helps developers build simple and

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,820
web‑based applications quickly with less code by removing much of the

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,840
boilerplate code and configuration that characterizes Spring.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,800
Some of the major topics that we will cover include

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,560
Spring Boot and its benefits,

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,750
like automatic configuration and Spring Boot Starters, bootstrapping a simple

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,780
application using Spring Initializr, accessing data with Spring Boot and H2,

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,500
along with the auto configuration Spring Boot provides, configuring a spring

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,440
MVC application using Spring Boot,

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,980
developing a RESTful API using Spring Boot, building a

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,640
GraphQL server that exposes APIs,

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,120
making your application production ready using the Spring Boot Actuator,

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,920
and we wrap up with writing unit and integration tests in Spring Boot.

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,250
By the end of the course,

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,190
you will have mastered Spring Boot to make

20
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,150
development faster and deployment easier.

21
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,380
You will learn all of this while using a fun case study called Trackzilla,

22
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,800
a bug tracking application that you will help develop using Spring Boot.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,680
Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with Java and have a

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,790
beginner‑level understanding of the Spring Framework.

25
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,300
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about the

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:47,000
time‑saving features of Spring Boot in the Spring Boot Fundamentals course, at Pluralsight.
