1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,450
Now that we have the database properly configured

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,590
and accessible via a web browser,

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,270
let's talk about object‑relational mapping with the Java Persistence

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:18,055
API. There are several layers of abstraction. At the lowest level,

5
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:20,290
there is the persistence data store.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,670
Above that is JDBC. JDBC is a Java API to connect and

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,430
execute queries against the database.

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,150
JPA is an abstraction on top of JDBC that makes it easy to map Java

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,680
objects to relational databases and vice versa.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,180
Now JPA is just a specification or a set of

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,320
guidelines and can do nothing on its own,

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,900
as it is only a set of empty methods and collection of interfaces that

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,760
only describe Java persistence methodologies. In order to be fully

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,710
functional, JPA needs an implementation,

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,420
also known as an instance provider.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,620
If you're familiar with Spring, Spring with JPA uses Hibernate

17
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,800
as the persistence provider and makes it very easy to access our

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,210
H2 database. Spring Data JPA provides repository support for the

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,120
Java persistence API.

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,740
It eases development of applications that need to access JPA Data sources.

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,440
Spring Boot selects a recent version of Spring Data modules for you. In

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,510
the POM file, I've included spring‑boot‑starter‑jpa,

23
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,440
which is a starter that provides a quick way to get started.

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,470
It provides the following key dependencies, Hibernate,

25
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,340
which is one of the most popular JPA implementations, Spring Data JPA,

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:50,000
which makes it easy to implement JPA‑based repositories, and Spring ORM. It's the core ORM support for the Spring framework.
