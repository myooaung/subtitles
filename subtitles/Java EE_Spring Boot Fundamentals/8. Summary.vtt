00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.655
Today we learned how to build RESTful APIs using Spring

2
00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:08.940
Boot. I taught you about the REST architecture style and

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.840
the @RestController annotation.

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.570
We saw that the annotation includes the @Controller and the @ResponseBody

5
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.650
annotations. @RestController simply returns object data that is written

6
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.500
directly to the HTTP response as JSON. Along the way,

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.870
we discussed the autoâ€‘configuration done by Spring Boot.

8
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.720
We wrapped up by discussing exception handling and the response status

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:43.000
exception that applies a status code to an HTTP response. Next, we will learn about creating a GraphQL server using Spring Boot.
