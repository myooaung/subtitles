00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,970
Today, you learned about GraphQL, a query language for APIs.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,100
We discussed the GraphQL schema,

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,600
which defines the data points offered via an API. Don't forget

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,520
the schema contains the data types and relationships between them

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,100
and the set of operations available.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,620
Next,

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,460
we saw the importance of using resolvers for queries and mutators. Resolvers

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,550
allow Spring to automatically detect and call the right method in response to

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,100
one of the GraphQL queries or mutations. We wrapped up with learning about a

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:40,000
useful tool called GraphiQL that allows you to execute queries and mutations against a GraphQL server.
