Hi. This is Kesha Williams from Pluralsight.

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.510
Welcome to my course, Spring Boot Fundamentals.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.200
During the rollout of changes,

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.050
the Trackzilla product team noticed that one small change seemed

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.200
to break functionality elsewhere in the system.

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.040
The developers did test their code and conduct unit testing,

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.940
but they were just unsure of all of the dependencies that needed to be tested.

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.770
We will look at ways to automate testing and increase confidence that

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.320
minor changes will not break existing functionality.

10
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.550
Today, we're going to look at testing with Spring Boot.

11
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.100
I will teach you about writing unit tests and integration tests,

12
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.350
leveraging Spring Boot features like the @SpringBootTest

13
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.700
annotation and the @WebMvcTest annotation.

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:59.000
I will also show you how to test using a mock environment. I will also teach you about the Spring Boot TestRestTemplate.
