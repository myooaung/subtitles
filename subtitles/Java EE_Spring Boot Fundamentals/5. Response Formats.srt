1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,540
ResponseEntity is a generic type.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,040
As a result, we can use any type as the response body.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,700
In one case, I'm returning a list of tickets,

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,860
and in the other case, I'm returning a list of applications.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,270
Since we specify the response status programmatically,

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,210
we can return with different status codes for different scenarios.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,240
There are several status codes, 200 represents OK,

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:40,000
400 represents a bad request, 409 represents a conflict and the infamous 404 represents not found.
