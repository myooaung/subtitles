00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,420
Now let's look at how we query.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,390
The first step is to implement a query resolver,

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:11,900
which will use our repository to query the database.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,050
I've opened the project and navigated to the Query.java file. The query

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,840
resolver allows Spring to automatically detect and call the right method in

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,220
response to one of the GraphUL queries defined inside of a schema. Notice

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,820
we have the implementation for the findAllApplications operation and the

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,300
countApplications operation.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,010
If you remember from the GraphUL schema within our query section,

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:46,880
we had these two operations, findAllApplications, countApplications. Notice

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,380
for the find all applications, it's a simple call out to our

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,580
applicationRepository to find all of the applications. And in a similar

13
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,880
manner, on line 21 for countApplications, we're making a call to the count

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,000
method of the application repository. The query response is typically sent using JSON.
