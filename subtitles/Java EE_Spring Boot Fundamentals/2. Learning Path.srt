1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,120
This course targets Java developers who want to increase their

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,080
understanding of Spring Boot and focus on fundamentals.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,310
This course assumes viewers are proficient with the use of IntelliJ or

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:21,130
another Java IDE, Java 8 or above, Maven 3 or above, and have at least a

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:27,450
beginner‑level understanding of the Spring Framework.

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,190
This course is not the best starting point if you are just getting into Spring.

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,030
Fortunately,

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,075
the Pluralsight library has several of these courses. I would recommend

9
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:41,200
the courses shown for students to gain the beginner‑level understanding

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,950
required for this course. Along with the basic knowledge highlighted in

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,840
the learning path, they are prerequisite tools needed on your machine:

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:00,830
Java JDK 1.8 or later, a favorite text editor or IDE. For this course,

13
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,570
I will be using IntelliJ, but tools like Eclipse

14
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,990
will also work. Maven 3.0 or above.

15
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,160
This runs in the IDE, but you can also run it from the command line,

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,000
which requires you to install it. And Git. So let's get started with Spring Boot.
