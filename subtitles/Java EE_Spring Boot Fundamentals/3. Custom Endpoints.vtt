00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.520
Spring Boot provides a bunch of ready‑to‑use health indicators; however,

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.050
you can add your own custom health indicator.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.170
For example,

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.530
let's say the Trackzilla application gets a list of people

5
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.280
or application owners from the HR API.

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.055
Let's add a custom health indicator to let us know if that HR

7
00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:27.950
API is down and not accepting requests.

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.730
Let's see this process in action. I have opened the project,

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.890
and I've navigated to the PeopleHealthIndicator.java

10
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.880
file found in the actuator package.

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.240
Let's take a look at it. To create a custom metric, all you

12
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.100
need to do is implement the HealthIndicator interface and

13
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.990
then override the health method.

14
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.100
This will determine the health of the dependent service. So let's take

15
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.980
a look at this. On line 13, there's a method,

16
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.570
isRunningServicePeopleService. Here on line 18, I'm simply returning

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.980
false as a test. In the real world, you would add real logic here to

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.440
test if the People Service is up and running.

19
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.940
I skipped it for demo purposes.

20
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.820
So, if the People Service is not running on line 14, we return

21
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.180
Health.down with a detailed message of Not Available, else we return

22
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.240
Health.up with a detailed message of Available.

23
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.180
So let's see this in action.

24
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.130
I've already deployed the application, and it's up and running.

25
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.120
So this is the Actuator link, nothing different here, but now

26
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.400
let's click on health. Notice the status of the application is no

27
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.640
longer UP, it has the status of DOWN.

28
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.460
Although the database here, the DB, is UP and the diskSpace is UP, because the

29
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.000
PeopleService returns Not Available and has a status of DOWN, the entire application is marked DOWN.
