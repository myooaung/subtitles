00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.470
If you're not familiar with H2, it is an open source database written in Java.

2
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.260
It is an inâ€‘memory database,

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.640
which means that data is stored in memory and will not persist to the disk.

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.160
Now H2 is not recommended for production environments,

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.020
but it is good for POCs, dev environments, and

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.610
projects that need a simple database.

7
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.380
The nice thing is that H2 can be easily integrated with Spring. H2 provides

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.400
you with an administrative tool called the H2 console,

9
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.810
and you will work with it through a web browser.

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.210
We will dig in a bit more with the H2 console in the next module.

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.400
The first step is to include the H2 dependency in the Maven POM file.

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.300
Thanks to auto configuration, since we are adding H2 as a dependency,

13
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.480
Spring Boot knows that in this project we will be connecting to

14
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.090
the H2 database, so it auto configures H2 related properties like

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.970
the database URL, username, password, etc.

16
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.760
These are the defaults.

17
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.840
So for the data source name, it's testdb. For the Driver class,

18
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.170
it's the org.h2.Driver.

19
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.685
The default username is sa. There is no default password,

20
00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:19.740
and the Spring H2 console is disabled.

21
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.030
I'm overriding H2's default configurations in the application.properties file.

22
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.990
The most important thing I'm doing is enabling the H2

23
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.000
console and setting the path to H2. I've also changed the database name to bugtracker.
