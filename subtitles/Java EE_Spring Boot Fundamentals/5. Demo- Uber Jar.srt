1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,620
Let's see this in action.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:13,810
We'll look more closely at the application layers used to create this uber‑JAR.

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,460
When the TrackZilla application is deployed,

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,760
it's packaged in an uber‑JAR with an embedded Tomcat server.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,300
Let's review an extract from the log files. So the first thing that I

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,320
want to point out here is that Tomcat started on Port 8080, so we're

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,100
using the embedded Tomcat web server.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,540
It's a configuration that you can change in the application.properties file.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,320
Spring Boot also provides a number of options to configure the

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,730
embedded server through application.properties as well.

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,640
Now there's one other thing in this log file that I want to show you.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,530
So notice here, this is the JAR artifact name,

13
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,000
and this JAR can be used to run the application on any machine where Java 8 is installed.
