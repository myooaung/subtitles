REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,530
It's a set of guidelines that application developers use to design APIs.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,200
There are four principles that APIs follow. First data and functionality in

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,440
the API are considered resources and identify through something called the

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,810
URI, or the Uniform Resource Identifier.

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,020
These are accessed by Web links. Second, resources are

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,070
manipulated using a fixed set of operations.

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,780
GET retrieves a resource, POST creates one, use PUT to update the resource, and,

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,310
of course, DELETE will remove it.

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:44,500
Third, resources can be represented in multiple formats like HTML,

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,540
XML, plain text, and other formats defined by a media type.

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,010
Finally, communication between the client and endpoint is stateless,

13
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,000
meaning the server will not remember or store any state about the client that made the call.
