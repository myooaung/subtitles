00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.150
Hello.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.850
In this video we'll do the location and on top in four section.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.590
So let's make a new group and then the name,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:21.130
location slash contact and next next,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.570
make a base ship.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.070
This will be the bishop for our Google map.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.390
I open the you come up here and we're goingto bring screen this.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.600
It brings screen Prince killing on your keyboard and this space it.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.770
So I know document here.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.570
It's fine here.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.830
So control V and then let's get your let's get the markets jitter marked,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.260
told and throw.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.130
Cut it out,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:03.580
using the most and get to our mean 10 of us quite small,

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.190
But let's make it bigger control T and drag it.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.780
Hold the shift key to make a constraint the shape and then click in the middle toe,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.570
clipping the lower layer.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.910
Next nets,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.570
but some stands to it.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.750
Number plate.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:39.640
The dish base ship in a shadow zero in distance and size 29 pixels.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:49.750
Never done the capacity door 37 because is that 7%?

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.070
All right,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:00.090
then a rectangle enter the of 600 pixels,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.930
and for the I,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.450
the one that 59 cents it's all right it's actually in the middle,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.000
so it's unclear on and then using the move,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.150
don't its position it nicely.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.130
Then they changed the caller toe.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.640
Right.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:31.360
Noble click this layer and Bleakney stroke option for a size 10 fixes and then lower down

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.150
your capacity to make it transparent.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.870
36% on size 16 exists.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.490
All right,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.000
it looks good.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.160
And then let's get this home icon.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.780
Put these.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.440
Put the address here.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.660
Yes,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:08.920
I see toe one pixels both with a night there again to show the first time said a color

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.870
overly just d read our main color.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.720
And now get the type and it's type our address.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.860
Make a paragraph,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.400
Tex.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.650
And there any address Put me Andres here.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:40.950
I just made up this address from the building Send Philippines And so the Philippine and

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.660
although I don't know wasn't home at this just made it.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.710
All right then.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:04:14.170
First the home icon using the keyboard battle in the address and next me contact phone

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.020
number Make it smarter.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:47.490
Explain this drug aligning our home icon still beaks on making smarter publicly the layer

00:04:47.490 --> 00:05:11.730
and our men color Just copy this key and then dragged down and Theis address.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.800
Enter value planting,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.600
then hit.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.330
Enter in your number G not your main.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.650
Enter in your favor.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.450
Okay?

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:28.010
And then position it the icon.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.110
The next one's the maid.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:53.090
Make its mother big cells and hit Enter in your given the main enter are you can use the

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.520
numbers.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:05.690
Enter what I'm using on the thing I changed the color toe friend and then copies duplicated

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.160
on alki in your gibbon.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:20.150
And then that's type in full yummy spaghetti.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:32.630
Okay,

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:49.750
and then let's see if they are select this layer.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:57.740
Let's see if we be lowered down the field capacity and it looks it's not good.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:05.650
So this pull it back again and this put me being being here,

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:26.790
this one that you don't know that this well and hit enter your given I mean red.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:35.720
Okay,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.420
let's zoom out and see if our I promise.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.850
Okay,

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.650
it's more a little bit to the right.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:52.190
You see people battle on and then it's cool stuff in your mouth again.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.730
Next safety.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.750
First,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.110
make sure you always save your design,

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.560
your project all right,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.490
and then this.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.270
Let's arrange the layers properly.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:28.350
Now let's find the layers that are related and group there this contact info and that's

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.370
separately being like this.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.980
Put it down and then click,

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:43.400
kiss and hold ship and click on the upper layer and control G cycle.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.160
And it's no in one group.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.210
Let's move it side.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.890
I'm eyeballing it,

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.870
all right?

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.740
And that looks fine.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.520
In the next video,

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.850
we'll do the general section of our design.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.720
I hope you enjoy this video and see you next time.
