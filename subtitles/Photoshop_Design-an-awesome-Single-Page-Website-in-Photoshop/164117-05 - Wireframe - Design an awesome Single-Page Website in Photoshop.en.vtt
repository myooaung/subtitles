00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.130
like I said,

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:58.920
changing color toe at least the fun size.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.010
This will be our editor and next hour,

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.630
zero area our background will be.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.960
That will be our backgrounds.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.180
Well,

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.050
for our hero and then menu.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:23.070
The reason for doing this is is toe not forget when we're doing the individual sections you

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.790
want Oh,

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:32.420
what the tightens up Each section's right next but me about us.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:52.660
The location and gallery course footer finance And next let's get their capital were going

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.330
toe put.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:08:01.400
The lighter frame might offering is very important because it will serve us our backbone.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.720
The design distinction,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.860
the color So we can see.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.590
Now we will do the boxes.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:23.570
This will be our white friends you can use on programs like mock ups for for mark flow

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:28.090
There are there are other framing you instead you can use for free.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:28.700
Of course,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.450
what I'm doing right now is the middle section.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.270
Yes,

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:45.350
capping the boxes that click and run copy and then control the precise shape.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:09:00.620
This will be the black both section lugs section and next is about us Doing the background

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.380
are right now just this.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.540
But the image here and then takes on the right side.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:16.140
All right for the occasion.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.510
There will be an image here,

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:27.480
so let's cover the hole location section and next list this copy that for our gallery

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.980
sexual but the biggest here.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:39.150
Let's try putting the individual boxes for the images.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.600
Copy that and select posts.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:48.710
And then this truck holed up in drug on,

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.560
lastly with footer section.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:58.330
And that's our my friend very fast.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:06.150
You can make it nicely and clean unless it for one toe show it your client client.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:12.680
Then you want to use other programs like cops to send them because they're going toe

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.450
approved the wire brains before moving on to the project.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.920
So you really need a very nice and presentable wire frames.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.260
But for us,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.750
since we're going toe,

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.120
just practice it and we're going toe.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.580
Delayed it anyway later.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.880
So it's fine.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.970
Just,

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.360
um,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.570
the point of our wiping his toe.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.840
Remember the areas in the parts of our website,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.480
So it's OK.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.250
That's their right frame
