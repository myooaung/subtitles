00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
Hello and welcome.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.750
My name is Tony,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.800
and in this video we're going to talk about the types off headers,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.070
the fixed and center headers.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.770
These headers are very common and popular in Web designs.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.350
We will start with fixed header.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.460
Most fixed other websites placing off their logo,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.840
usually on the left side,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.610
and the navigation bar is on the right side.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.760
But the basic idea is when you scroll down to see the content of a page,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.230
the header on top space.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.510
It won't move.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.320
So whatever part of a page you go,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.960
you will see the other area.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.940
That's why it's called fixed Heather.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.610
Let's see some examples.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.890
This is the first example this site uses fixed heather.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.850
As you can see,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.150
single beach websites usually use this kind of feather.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.460
Like this site single page website is when you click on the navigation,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.830
you don't go to other beach just on one fish.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.290
Let's click one Nick here and other one is volunteers.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.060
You can see I didn't go to other pitch.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.380
Another example from went in money that that come and you can see the header.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.180
It stays up and didn't move right,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.140
and these are the links minutes example From yahoo dot com.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.890
You can see this header.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.650
You see that when a scroll down,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.650
it just stays on top.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.680
Nasty fix header.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.180
That's idea for ah,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.850
information.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.760
Maybe sign where you want to go to other pages immediately,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.460
and these are the examples off my own designs.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.950
Here you can see the head there with transparent background.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.170
It means that if sticks Edgar,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.720
you condone that by lowering known your capacity.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.370
If he and it's the layer,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.990
you're different,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.660
You're developer will understand that the next example.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.960
Just white background.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.210
Also fix header.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.080
All right,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.700
and let's go toe.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.790
Another lesson for today.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:33.310
Just the center heather center header is the When your logo on your page is right on the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.520
sender and below that is their navigation bar or links it straightly simply.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.390
They go for this type of weather because everything looks balanced and clean on the other

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.740
part,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.290
where you want to focus on your logo for Brenda.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.230
Okay,

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.880
so let's see some websites using this type of weather.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.720
The first example,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.550
excluding usa dot com,

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.530
you can see their logo here on top and below.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.520
That is the navigation bars.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.380
Oh,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.910
Navigation bar and see the next example many,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:22.930
many simo dot com The letter m and next is I t B that worldwide that gun also using center

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.970
header and finally,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.940
the EPO dash i.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.170
N.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.550
C.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:42.590
That JP and show you some of my designs where I use the centre either and year example,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:50.880
You can see the header and the navigation and let's see the next one and usually another

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:01.200
one big logo there and the navigation bar a simple Anglin website website design.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.100
Let's see the first design again.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.880
This design is an equal MERS design that I did before and the soul for this video.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.900
I hope you enjoy it and see you next time.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.320
I hope you practice doing Web designs and post your questions and designs on the discussion

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.710
bird.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.980
Thank you.
