00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.290
Create a new group and name it Ming.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:19.570
And next get your title are type in your table with 41 points,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.720

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.830
And please check if you are satisfied.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.370

Shifty.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.930
Make a eight to constrain the shape,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.120
all right,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.680
and then they changed the color.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:07.300
Let's make it something great like this one.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.670

Next center this control A and,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:38.220
like these align horizontal centers like the Mayor and Control de Toe Select and get the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:50.400
gun told and like the 370 for me and for height 334 pixels,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.550
and we're going to edit the science of this ship.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.000
Its position it first to our grill.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.820
And let's see,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.700
this is the design we're going to do.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:16.320
Let's measure so we can make sure that the squares that we're going to do is align mean my

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.670
snot.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.490
Yes,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:29.990
but a are 33 and the position off then picked eight.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.880
All right.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.330

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:27.650
Will and I ds It's close to stop every going toe up in a new image Drug one.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.440
Well,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.100
where when you drop the image on that,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.870
it will open a new term.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.520
And this,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.870
I mean lefties and drag it over many of us.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.520
He controlled the toe,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.960
show the transform tool and recites it.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:57.420
Make sure it will fit to our shape and always on shift key when drugging rece icing and

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.860
clip it to our ship and position it using your keyboard.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.190
And now I will show you how you can announce your image.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.230
If you have a bad image,

just click this adjustment layer and Levins there so many choices.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.370
But we use levels for now.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:30.550
You need to do is just drug it block somewhere somewhere like here and That's basically how

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:56.510
The adjustment layer and sleeping must again the spaghetti image and New Sea or Derek

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.590

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:09.410
er and for its toe what they write stroke and no points.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.190
And now he was control.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.790
Tito,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.220

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.980
This will be our style for our menu.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.250

Tool is your keyboard,

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:37.210
and then Saki and drug make a duplicate,

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:44.390
and it looks nice on its position.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.250
