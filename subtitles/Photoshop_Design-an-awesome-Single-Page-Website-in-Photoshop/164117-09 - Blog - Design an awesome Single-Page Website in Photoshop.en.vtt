00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
in this video,

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:15.020
we're going toe design the black section off our single beach website that zooming a little

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.060
bit and waken see it better now.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.540
Create a new group and tight black books.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.350
Then it's hide this line of cream.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.110
We already have the guide,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.680
so it's good.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.790
Then,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.750
using the rectangle rectangle,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.810
make sure you're using your guide.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.480
Double that at the name,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.270
then the pattern of early.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.550
Be using this one.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.630
Now you can use anything one but something that very important here is the then moved.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.420
Okay,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.040
wait an experiment.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:28.560
Then let's see a shadow zero in distance in size nine.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.870
Let me see the original Wisconsin.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:49.980
He's our original and toe go to the that right on that layer control click and the CD

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.260
shadow.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:58.650
It's 59 the nine pictures and with the other leg.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.890
Yeah,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.370
yes,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.910
I'm using on 90 degrees and 59.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.510
Okay,

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:22.690
let's put that never designed in a shadow degrees and increase this picture name itself.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:38.990
You can play along with the capacity in this hour bathroom for our bread boost.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:53.940
And next we're going toe happy.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:02.950
The Titan click toe Duplicate the layers layer on.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.080
Now let's more get up our black.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.110
Both group.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:19.400
It's changing the golden backspace toe play the macron cooler and position it sent.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.450
Ever get the title This change the name,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:41.540
toe reason black posts and then nets move it up,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:04:00.550
using most the name the group name lampposts and then get the rectangle and clicking the

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:11.020
canvas and like 170 pixels for with and also 176 s,

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.420
right,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.980
it will be the base they re going toe our image.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.960
Make sure our rectangle is aligned.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.660
Our agreement.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.750
Next,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.570
let's drug image that really this one guitar canvas,

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:45.320
precisely holding shift key and then get our basic position it and clip it on and flicked

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.150
in the middle of the two layers.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.100
Next,

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.970
that's type liteks.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:03.030
Let's get the layers tithe.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:12.480
Drop shadow is 27 pixels or size I want to apply and 17% for the capacity.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.490
Now let's apply.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.550
Don't be shape the stroke.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.950
Our big sense changed the colder toe.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:54.600
Thesis one are B B and shut up the stance zero 29 and click.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.030
OK,

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:03.970
let's change the stroke Color toe T C C Fee Fi Fi.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:14.520
I think it's better and just entering your people and also the pattern.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.250
I think they've changed that.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.770
It's in this way.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.930
This one's,

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.370
I think,

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:33.080
the original one and next.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.160
See,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.270
that's putting It takes now in London for Please stop it,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:07:01.270
fun size doing my points and merry way they're going now let's type it,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.620
get the type tool.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.680
It's already applied,

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:14.120
as you can see the Eckstein's in the Bronstein's Some ready Merryweather during the high

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.670
points.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:23.150
Now let's type wonderful place.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.020
You can type anything here,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:36.130
do the thin species then I think,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:57.930
right now and and also de spaces

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:10.500
waking up in the spaces here if you want.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.450
But it's not.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:27.770
I guess I involving it and using the keyboard arrow.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:47.970
Now let's get me like ones that we need social media accounts and these are the icons that

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.220
I don't notice from.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:09:03.880
That ones are that ones that is really small,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:16.720
So let's make that bigger And now,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.720
like all and then you control your keyboard and precise them,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:40.020
and the pixels are now positioning and cilic one and more to the right.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:49.750
Then select on the icons the distribute horizontally centers,

00:09:49.750 --> 00:10:07.410
and it's changed the order off the cyclones that to show the style and other overly change

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.150
the orderto not You're right.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.990
Maybe it's the 60 66 copy that,

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:25.650
and nobody again in the layer it controls week and press enter in your keyboard.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:32.830
Do that again and it enter in your keyboard.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.550
And that's our social media icons.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:46.370
You can recite it if we think is quite big there.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:11:10.580
And this group that ontology rename it Tankan's and using your make sure they're in right

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:23.350
position for our 16 points regular in very way.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.770
Appoint.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.840
Israeli bowlers have toe toe toe.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.580
Now,

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.530
using your type Tony,

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:39.550
make a paragraph takes my click and drag.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.770
Don't release your mouth.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:53.200
Let me read it the height and that's basically not and if so,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.650
that you can found in type.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.450
That's a moment.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.740
These I always did it.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:06.510
The few first lines off the and then it's got this.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:23.570
And there it's our dicks that looks find me on.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.610
Let's see,

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.970
they are equal position.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:52.630
Rightly this hour background housing on the mayors and group because we're going to

00:12:52.630 --> 00:13:13.070
duplicate it century control and then hit the nine distribute centers and copy I didn't

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.850
drag down.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:18.170
Now it's moving down again using keeping battle,

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:25.300
doing the nice presentation,

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:48.420
this image first and then next drugging thistle chickie

00:13:48.420 --> 00:14:08.300
and click it to that base ship off the image using your given battle on this.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:26.200
Edit the title Nice presentation so we can see the the alignment of our day.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.440
It's not actually equal on the top,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:43.760
so a remove some breezes so it didn't it didn't make it 19 and that's happy again.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:49.410
Is duplicate holding our key keyboard Natural.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.730
What's in Mark?

00:14:52.730 --> 00:15:18.650
Computer issues forgetting on this image on many

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:40.770
and flip it How are beast,

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:45.420
sheep and,

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.090
of course,

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:53.190
the Titan spaghetti.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:16:05.230
I am the dates trying toe.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.130
Thank you.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.900
Look at the there.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.760
A line on the top,

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.650
All right.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.750
And this group,

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:30.990
Can you see your moved?

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.000
You can moan.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.690
You are both making spaces.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:48.250
I think there are three d green right now.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.950
So and that's it for this video.

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:53.250
I hope you enjoy it.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:57.030
And in the next video we will do the about that section
