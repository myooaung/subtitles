00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
you see you next election to go to not feel and changing the color red.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:22.300
This will be the over state when one of your when your visitor go to your website and over

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.260
the mouse this'll what it looked like.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.660
Let's change the title of this mineral toe shrimp,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:48.210
spaghetti control A to select one and then exchanged the fun style Bold.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.460
Then,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.880
of course,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.900
the quarter and pricing.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.310
$42.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.040
This will be the hover states,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.120
all right,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:22.400
And then let's put a pointer icon that I don't know did from flat this open toe predatory

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.100
canvas.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:32.340
Let's move it on top off the image and zoom out to see our design.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.630
All right,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:47.740
but also the one on our header the homes home A link from navigation.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.380
All right,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.150
make sure you have a nice layers.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.440
You shouldn't have a very organized layer.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.750
When you're submitting your designed during playing,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.800
save it.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:17.520
Let's type Yami is spaghetti and just click this Okay,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:26.300
Always save your design will never know when you're when you're 40 Crash.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.660
So all these savior design When then let's continue.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.530
Let's make another cap off this one.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.060
The 1st 1 on its egg dispersed the sites.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.000
Let's remove the corner points.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.420
So said the base and using on,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.870
Derrick said.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.030
I controlled Click the Shape so the like,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.310
Hey,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:08.990
properties will be like and let's type 70 because we need 30 pixels on the Regis.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.920
But this this is the first step.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.400
Link all of them.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.930
Then let's type 30 pictures.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.400
So it it applies toe all the corners and the other one,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.950
but we're going to do it is through the layer person and click the shape.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.110
It's individual.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.530
We can link on the corners and individually,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:49.000
the 30 vixens like what I'm doing 1930 but much better if you know the 1st 1 All right,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.460
then let's see.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.690
It's close,

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:19.320
this group now let's duplicate the 1st 1 key and then drug right and position it,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:28.420
for instance,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.910
the Gorn nurse again.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.370
Select the base layer,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.940
then get the direct selection toe,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:45.460
clipped the sheep and open your life properties a link so we can enter the values

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.530
separately.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:55.640
Zero on the left side and the bottom 70 pixels zero and then on the upper right,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.650
70 pixels.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.790
There's another way,

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:00.250
toe.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.890
We're going to reverse it.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:04.390
Actually,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.410
it's another one on underway.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.380
Just control and then rightly and sleep.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.500
Vertical or horizontal?

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.670
I see it's another way.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.840
Next,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:32.640
let's change the image that and Whitney right layers before you hit the on your keyboard.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.420
Next drug.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:54.590
This in drop to our canvas precisely holding our shift key and drag it okay,

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.840
hit.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.630
Enter in your keyboard and I'll click between the layers to clipping mask and also the

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.590
levels adjustment layer.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.230
All right,

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:26.870
misjudged Evening spaghetti Bolognese and this change the price as well.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.750
What's the price?

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:58.120
$49 and that's our first line off Minnow and then on your grades are going to duplicate

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.540
this.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:04.750
So what we're going to do is be just changing the images.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:27.740
Today the's seem lattice and the median part exchange these red I'm on the field color,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:42.760
moving that and changed the white stroke but the right stroke and also the pointer.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:49.320
Let's change the Feinstein off the title toe regular,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:57.260
and of course,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:07.060
the caller changed and it's too light.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:26.730
So get the type total and by tapping the cooler that our word and peace all right,

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:33.740
this hour middle section.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:42.450
But let's change the images off our menu on this on the left side and the right side.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:58.930
So said the right layer and deleted in cynic one and drug to our canvas on chief Geek and

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:18.410
positioning and it enter and flip it kick and then click in the middle of the two layers.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:25.150
Now also this one that and get the best.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.020
The image that we need thinks one.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:46.890
Drop it to our canvas and cheeky enter and alky and then click to clip it on our base shape

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.460
and see.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.560
That's our menu section.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:10:05.690
I hope you enjoy doing that and disclose these groups in the next video.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.700
Dodi Luck,

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.190
boss.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.110
