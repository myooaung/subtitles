Now it's lower down.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:46.220
The opacity have to 30% and it attracted 30% a system of the gates for no so we can see it

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.220
.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.980

This will be our header background,

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.110

57%.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:48.200
It's no time to design our logo using our the once Let's zoom in,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.070
get your tiptoe.

Since we adjust our logo,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.640
I'm using my keyboard arrows move.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:59.900
It's a moment,

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.500

Now it's sender and move it down using keyboard arrows for our takes.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:06.210
Making a paragraph takes goto and face Lottum Epsom.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.810

There are good and we're going to duplicate it on G and then run to the right,

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:22.540
so like both layers and hold alky.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:27.070
And and then I changed the color white.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.490
They didn't sell it.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:38.450
Got this buttons and political these distribute horizontally centers to make the space is

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.230
equal and then group them.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:51.250
Put the name on it modern's and that Santa is again control day and click this align

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.450

It's seek,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.910
and next put the arrows to the left,

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.470
using the line full hold,

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.650
shifty dragging to make a negative country that five degrees.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.940
Let's change the corner toe.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.750
One D.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.350
One D one d and think OK,

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.310
next we're going toe.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:24.070
Duplicate it.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:29.000
Control J in your Hubert and Control T toe.

Move it down,

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.890
make sure it's looks arrow,

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.300
and then group this too,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:14:00.140
on duplicated again Control J and then control Key right click again and fully horizontal.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.690
And they're now let's drag to the right side.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:12.980
Let's edit the arrows.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.890
They are overlapping the two lines,

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:30.310
so I select the upper part and move it using the keyboard Arrow up Come Mimi three pick

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.980
sense the same time,

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.450
the other side.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:51.170
Make sure they're not overlapping and select both and group them.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:56.470
But any money does.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:05.010
And then let's see now saying next we're going toe.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:12.030
Put a design here that he got out from this white part here in the middle of our image.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:22.670
So let's select the background control control and then click to press the image and then

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.280
click this layer is the background off our area.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:40.390
Move it down and then next on top of our field corner,

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:45.050
using the McDonnell tool dry shape,

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:48.910
changing the corner to right.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:16:01.350
And next get the polygon told not in the custom shaped get deep polygon Tony,

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.630
and for the sites,

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:09.250
make it three and draw the shape.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:16.670
Hold shift key in your keyboard to make an upside down triangle like this,

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:22.700
Then release it if you have the triangle upside down,

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:31.480
we need that because we were going tow truck.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:36.190
This strangle to our wrecked under that we just did available.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.070
So Andrade,

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.310
then control,

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:45.350
See to copy Finnic our rectangle then controlled the pace.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:51.190
Position the triangle in the media off Dungan,

00:16:51.190 --> 00:17:04.940
then go to this icon and subtract from shape.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.390
And now we cut out the triangle.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.350
Indirect angle.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.740
Next.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:11.050
Next,

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.930
let's edit the rectangle.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.250
Select that in the layer funding.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:27.900
Make sure you're in the right player in control,

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:44.160
and then more this side of the So we have a very nice looking cut out in the hunger in

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:44.510
there.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.670
That's our hero area.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:47.530
And Heather,
