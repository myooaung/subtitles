00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.009
- Most of the work we will be doing in this course

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.002
is adding security to a web application.

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.008
To save immense time,

4
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.008
and you watching me type a whole bunch of code,

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:13.006
and so that we can focus on spring security,

6
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:16.002
I've created a spring boot based web application

7
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:17.005
that we will use.

8
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:21.001
The project details are important to fully understand.

9
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.007
This is a simple monolithic web application

10
00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:27.005
based on spring MVC.

11
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:31.001
I am using Thymeleaf with a little bit of bootstrap styling

12
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:33.005
to make the application more attractive.

13
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.003
And, so you can work with principles

14
00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:37.005
in the application itself

15
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.004
in both the view and the model.

16
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:42.009
We're using an embedded H2 database

17
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.002
with default schema and data files

18
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:49.000
that are preloaded by the application context starting up,

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.007
so we have a fresh database at every restart.

20
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:55.009
We also have simple spring data repositories

21
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.006
to connect to that data source itself.

22
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:02.006
Now, let's take a look at the application.

23
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:03.009
You'll see in the exercise files,

24
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.006
there's a spring security folder.

25
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.003
And, within there is our default application

26
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:10.001
called admin web.

27
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.008
Now, you can choose to continue to modify this

28
00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:13.006
throughout the course,

29
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.003
or you can copy it,

30
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:17.003
however you see fit.

31
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:18.005
Within admin web,

32
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:21.001
you'll notice we've got a Palm file.

33
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.002
So, now if we want to source main Java,

34
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:24.006
you'll see our base package.

35
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.009
And, within there, we have a data package.

36
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.004
In there, there's a model package

37
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.003
that has a model for our customer,

38
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:32.002
a model for our orders,

39
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:34.007
and a repository for each one.

40
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:36.008
And, in our web package,

41
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:39.001
we have a controller for the customer,

42
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.001
our home controller, an order controller,

43
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.006
and an order model,

44
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:46.001
because we combine some of the data models

45
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:49.006
into a single model for one of our pages.

46
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:53.005
We've got the standard spring boot application starter

47
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:55.001
and then, within our resources,

48
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.002
we've got the schema file that has two tables

49
00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:01.005
for table customer and table orders.

50
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.004
And, then a data file that populates that

51
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:05.006
with some default data.

52
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:10.009
Let's go ahead and start up our application

53
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.002
and allow it to build and start.

54
00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:18.004
And, now, on a web browser,

55
00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:24.000
let's navigate to local host 8080,

56
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.008
and you'll see we have our application.

57
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:27.001
I can go to customers.

58
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:29.003
I can see all of our customers.

59
00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:35.003
I can see details of those customers.

60
00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:37.007
I can also go to orders and I can look at the orders.

61
00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:40.008
And, from there I can get into a detailed customer view.

62
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:42.008
It's a pretty simple application.

63
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:45.005
It's whole purpose is just to show you different pages

64
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:48.008
so we can secure them as we go throughout the course.

65
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.005
And, that's the introduction to the project

66
00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:53.000
and we have everything we need to get started.
