00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Frank] To say security is easy

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:06.004
is to invite malicious actors to attack your systems.

3
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:10.005
I would never go on record saying security is easy, done,

4
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:14.001
or a site I worked on is impervious to attack.

5
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.003
It is just flat out irresponsible.

6
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:19.007
That being said, building a layered approach to security

7
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:22.004
starts with authenticate and authorization

8
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:26.003
for many developers, as well as basic web filtering.

9
00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:29.001
And this is where Spring Security shines.

10
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:32.008
If you are building applications for the JVM today,

11
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:36.005
there is a high likelihood you are leveraging Spring.

12
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:40.003
And if so, using Spring Security is the preferred

13
00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:43.003
and easiest way to build a layer of security

14
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.003
into those applications.

15
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.000
Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.004
I'm an engineering leader, architect, engineer, student,

17
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.004
and teacher of modern application development,

18
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.009
focused on public and private cloud development.

19
00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:00.000
I have built massive scale systems in both public

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.009
and private clouds and have spent a significant portion

21
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:07.004
of my career leveraging Spring to do this work.

22
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:10.002
I have been involved with the community for over 12 years

23
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.009
and find Spring Security to be a powerful tool

24
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.007
in your tool belt for building applications that participate

25
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.005
in the layered security approach.

26
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.009
So get ready to dig in deep and learn Spring Security

27
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.000
from the ground up.
