00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] In order to be successful

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:02.007
in this course,

3
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:04.003
there are a few things you need to know

4
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.006
before proceeding with the material

5
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.003
as well as a few tools you will need

6
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:09.007
on your machine.

7
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:11.000
While you can use Spring

8
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.004
with several JVM languages,

9
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:16.006
we will be focusing on using the Java language.

10
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:17.007
For this course,

11
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:20.002
I will be using the latest long-term support

12
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:23.000
version for the Java language itself

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.007
that is supported by Spring,

14
00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:27.005
and that is Java 17.

15
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:29.005
Well, we won't use any of the newer features

16
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:30.004
of the language.

17
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.003
You should have a good understanding

18
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:34.001
of Java in general

19
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.001
so that you're not struggling with the code

20
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.004
as we're writing it,

21
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.005
you will need to have a JDK installed

22
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:40.007
on your machine.

23
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.006
Again, I will be use the standard

24
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:45.007
Oracle JDK version 17.

25
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:48.002
Any valid and supported JDK will work

26
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:52.006
for this course including OpenJDK for instance,

27
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:55.004
this is a course based on the Spring framework.

28
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.001
So there is an expectation

29
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.000
of knowledge of Spring.

30
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.003
If you are new to Spring,

31
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:02.000
stop this course,

32
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.009
and go through my learning Spring

33
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:07.006
with Spring boot course at a minimum.

34
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:08.004
As I just said,

35
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:11.001
a base understanding of Spring is important.

36
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:12.004
We are going to focus

37
00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:16.004
on the security framework not Spring itself.

38
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:18.003
We'll be leveraging Spring Boot

39
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:21.002
as our framework for running our applications.

40
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:22.001
As such,

41
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.001
you will need a base knowledge of Spring Boot,

42
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.007
and how it works.

43
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:27.007
Once again, my course learning Spring

44
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:30.001
with Spring boot is a great starting point

45
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.004
if you need it.

46
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:34.000
Spring security is primarily designed

47
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.006
for Spring Web.

48
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.003
You should understand how Spring Web works,

49
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:40.009
especially in Spring Boot,

50
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.000
and we'll be working with timely templates

51
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.004
a bit in this course.

52
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:47.004
As such, some basic knowledge would be good.

53
00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:50.001
Once again, I talk about this in my course

54
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.002
learning Spring with Spring Boot,

55
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:53.009
and that should help you with the basic

56
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.005
knowledge you need.

57
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.003
There are a few more pieces of software

58
00:01:57.003 --> 00:01:59.000
that you will need to have on your computer.

59
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.001
for this course.

60
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:02.005
We will be using Maven

61
00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:04.009
as our dependency manage system.

62
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.005
Spring supports it or Gradle.

63
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:10.003
But for this course, I will be using Mavin.

64
00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:11.007
Now, if you prefer to use Gradle,

65
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:13.000
it will work

66
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.002
but you will need to adjust

67
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:17.002
as you go with the dependency sections.

68
00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:19.000
You will need a command line tool

69
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.004
to call web URLs and execute requests.

70
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:25.008
Now, I'll be using a tool called HTTPie

71
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:29.000
but cURL should work equally well.

72
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.008
You will just need to use the appropriate options

73
00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:33.003
as I won't show those.

74
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.005
Again, I'm using a different tool.

75
00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.004
We're going to be using a web browser more

76
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:40.003
than the terminal itself to execute web requests.

77
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:43.000
So you need to have a web browser up and running,

78
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.009
and get one that support

79
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:48.005
private motor incognito mode or guest mode,

80
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:49.008
because we're going to have sessions

81
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:51.000
flying all over the place,

82
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.008
and need to switch them out regularly.

83
00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:55.004
You also need to have an IDE.

84
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:58.006
While you can write Java in a text editor,

85
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:02.005
IDEs make it infinitely easier to do your work.

86
00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:05.005
Now I use intelligent ultimate from JetBrains.

87
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:07.003
I do that because these are the tools

88
00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:10.000
that I use every single day.

89
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.009
You do not need to match my IDE.

90
00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.008
There's no reason to do so.

91
00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:16.008
If you use intelligent already,

92
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:18.001
great continue to use it.

93
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:20.003
If the Eclipse, use that.

94
00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:22.006
What matters most with an IDE

95
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:24.008
is that you are comfortable with it,

96
00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:26.004
and know how to use it

97
00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:29.002
especially for the Java language.

98
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:32.001
Most modern IDEs have plugins for Spring,

99
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.006
and they become very valuable tools

100
00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:36.008
when working with the Spring framework.

101
00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:38.005
Now I'm also going to be using Docker

102
00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:40.002
for one part of this course

103
00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:41.003
Now, it's not a requirement

104
00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:42.009
that you run Docker and you can do

105
00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:44.009
all of the work just by using

106
00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:46.009
standard Java commands.

107
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.004
I use Docker because I find it easier

108
00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:51.006
for portability between my machines

109
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:54.002
as well as when I'm instructing courses.

110
00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:56.006
Do as you wish when it comes to that,

111
00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:58.000
and I'll call that out.

112
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.006
But again, I'm running Docker,

113
00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:03.000
and that's how I'm going to execute these commands.
