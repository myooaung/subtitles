00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Instructor] So let's start where we said we would

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:06.001
with the login page.

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:07.003
Now, once again, I want you to go ahead

4
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:09.000
and grab the exercise files.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.009
I've done all of this for you because typing a lot of HTML

6
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.005
doesn't add a lot of value,

7
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.009
but instead I do want to talk through it.

8
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.008
So to the header

9
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:22.002
we added the security name space here on line two.

10
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.009
And then if you scroll down to line 25,

11
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.009
I've added an element to our nav bar

12
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.005
that basically is a button to log out if you are logged in.

13
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:34.005
And if you are not logged in,

14
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:38.000
to click that button to go to the login page.

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.005
So on 29 is when you are not logged in,

16
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:44.008
and on 26 is when you are logged in.

17
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:48.005
Now, I also created a login dot HTML page

18
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.003
and that login dot HTML page copies our standard header

19
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.002
and then builds a form.

20
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.002
Let's talk about a few elements of our form.

21
00:00:56.002 --> 00:01:00.001
So on line 13, we're creating an error div

22
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.003
if there's an error,

23
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:03.009
and on line 14,

24
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.001
we are creating a logout message

25
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.003
if you have logged out.

26
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:08.008
And we're going to redirect to that,

27
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:11.006
both of those are parameters.

28
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:15.003
Then on line 15, we actually start our forms.

29
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:18.002
So we are going to post back to login.

30
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:21.000
And from there, we are going to post a username

31
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.005
and a password, and then there's a submit button

32
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:26.004
on that form.

33
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.009
Now this is a pretty basic plain Jane form,

34
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.002
but it gives you the idea

35
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:34.003
that nothing in forms off is different at this point.

36
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:38.009
It's simply we've added a page to handle the login flow

37
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.000
and for convenience, I've given us a button in the header.
