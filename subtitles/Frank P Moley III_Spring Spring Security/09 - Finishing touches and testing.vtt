00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Instructor] Everything should be in place now

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:05.001
for us to run and test this complete picture.

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.007
And we're going to do that by testing

4
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:09.007
all of the flows and looking at all the functionality

5
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:12.009
of the forms based authentication that we've just created.

6
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.000
So let's do that.

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.005
So, one thing to note before I start this up

8
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.006
is the whole logout process

9
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.006
by clearing the browser window is now gone.

10
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.001
We no longer have to worry about that.

11
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.008
Let's start up our web application.

12
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.009
Let's jump into a browser.

13
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm going to go ahead and refresh.

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.002
You'll see that we have a login button at the top right.

15
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.006
And we created that in the header.

16
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:41.003
But before we test that functionality,

17
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.000
let's jump into one of our protected pages

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.009
and you'll see that it automatically

19
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:48.001
redirects us to the login page.

20
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.008
If I click orders, it does the same thing.

21
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.004
If I go back to customers, once again,

22
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.004
it does the same thing.

23
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:57.005
So let's log in as our user,

24
00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.004
and it remembers where you clicked.

25
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.007
So it knows to redirect you back to customer.

26
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:04.004
We did nothing to make that happen.

27
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.007
That happens all on its own.

28
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.009
So let's test that our authorizations are still in place.

29
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.008
So let's click details,

30
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.004
and you'll see that we have no order details

31
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.003
for this person.

32
00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:17.002
And if we go to orders,

33
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:19.005
we still get our 403.

34
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.002
Great, let's log out.

35
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.009
And you'll see that we now see our logout message

36
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.004
because it has now sent us to login question mark logout

37
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:30.004
in the URL,

38
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:33.000
which told it that you've been logged out of the flow.

39
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.008
So go ahead and display that message.

40
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:39.005
Now that's a great time for us to test our other message.

41
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:41.009
So let's type in an invalid username and password.

42
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.005
So we will create a user of Foo with a password of Bar.

43
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.008
Invalid username and password.

44
00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:50.000
Let's just double check.

45
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.001
We'll put in admin, but we will put FOOBARBAZ.

46
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.008
Still invalid username and password.

47
00:01:57.008 --> 00:02:00.000
This time let's do it correctly.

48
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.001
And log in with admin and password.

49
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.002
Takes us back to the landing page

50
00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:08.002
because we had gone through a logout flow.

51
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.008
Good, and click customers and details.

52
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.002
We see the order details.

53
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:15.003
We can go to orders and see them.

54
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:18.000
And once again, we can log out.

55
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.009
Now, the only thing that we haven't tested so far

56
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.006
is going straight to login.

57
00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.005
So let's do that now.

58
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:25.004
So we'll click on login.

59
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:28.004
As you would expect, it takes us to the login page.

60
00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:31.000
Click admin and password.

61
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.004
Takes us back to the homepage,

62
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:34.005
but now we've logged in.

63
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:36.000
And you can see, we go to customers.

64
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We go to orders, everything looks like we would expect.
