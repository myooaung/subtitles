00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] So in the last video

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:04.003
we used an in-memory user store.

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.002
This not only isn't tenable for real situations,

4
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:10.008
it isn't scalable or safe for that matter.

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:13.007
If you are keeping your users within your walls

6
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:17.000
the next step is adding the users to a database.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.004
So let's do that.

8
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:22.002
Okay, I want you to open up admin-web, source main,

9
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:27.002
resources, and open up the schema.sql file.

10
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:28.008
All right, we're going to create our new schema

11
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.001
and this schema actually comes from spring.

12
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.004
This is the default schema that they are looking for

13
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:38.001
for the JDBC connection that we are going to use.

14
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.008
So create table users.

15
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:44.003
You can to define your own as you feel necessary

16
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:47.007
and you just create a specific case to handle that.

17
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:51.005
It's not very difficult and it's well documented.

18
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.006
So that's up to you if you want to try that down the road

19
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:55.009
and in the real world

20
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.007
I would definitely create my own schema.

21
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:00.004
But for now this works just fine.

22
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:04.002
So create a username, varchar_ignorecase 50,

23
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.001
not null primary key.

24
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:14.006
A password, varchar_ignorecase 500, not null,

25
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:22.005
and enabled boolean, not null.

26
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:29.002
And now let's create another table called authorities,

27
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:37.007
and authorities has a username, varchar_ignorecase 50,

28
00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:40.002
not null.

29
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:51.000
And an authority, varchar_ignorecase 50, not null.

30
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.008
And it has a constraint, fk_authorities_users.

31
00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:02.007
It's a foreign key constraint

32
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:14.004
on username and it references user at username.

33
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:16.004
And the last thing that we need to do

34
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:25.001
is we need to create a unique index, ix_author username

35
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:29.004
on authorities,

36
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:33.009
and it's on username and authority.

37
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.006
So what this says is

38
00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:39.004
you can have instance of username multiple times

39
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:41.009
as long as each time it has a different authority

40
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.001
but you cannot have a same tuple

41
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:46.009
that has a username and authority that are identical,

42
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.003
pretty self-explanatory.

43
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:51.004
Okay, so now let's open up our data file

44
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.001
so that we can put some data in here.

45
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:58.004
So we will do an insert into users.

46
00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:03.006
Username, password, enabled.

47
00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:07.009
Values of user,

48
00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.007
password.

49
00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:10.008
Let me use that plain text for now.

50
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:12.006
We will fix that later,

51
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:15.001
but for right now it works just fine with plain text.

52
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.006
So we will use it.

53
00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:24.001
Let's go ahead and create our admin user.

54
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:30.005
And now we need to do an insert into authorities,

55
00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:33.005
username, authority.

56
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:43.001
Values of user, ROLE_USER.

57
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:48.008
And we will now do an admin.

58
00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:50.008
Our admin will have a role of user

59
00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:55.007
as well as a role of admin, and we're almost done.

60
00:03:55.007 --> 00:04:00.009
So source main Java, base package, config, webSecureConfig,

61
00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.003
go ahead and open that up.

62
00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:06.006
Remove the override.

63
00:04:06.006 --> 00:04:08.009
We will now call this users

64
00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.008
and we are going to pass it a data source.

65
00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:15.007
And that data source will come from our application context

66
00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:20.003
and it will be our embedded database.

67
00:04:20.003 --> 00:04:26.000
And we will simply return a new JdbcUserDetailsManager

68
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.004
that accepts our data source.

69
00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:30.009
Now one more bean that we need to configure

70
00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.008
and this is something that we will eventually get rid of

71
00:04:33.008 --> 00:04:36.003
but for now we will put it in.

72
00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:45.004
And this is just a password encoder.

73
00:04:45.004 --> 00:04:49.007
And the password encoder we're going use for right now,

74
00:04:49.007 --> 00:04:54.007
NoOpPasswordEncoder.getInstance.

75
00:04:54.007 --> 00:04:56.002
And you'll notice that's deprecated,

76
00:04:56.002 --> 00:04:58.007
plain tech should be deprecated.

77
00:04:58.007 --> 00:05:03.003
Let's go ahead and run our application.

78
00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:04.006
Everything started up.

79
00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:08.001
So let's jump a into our web browser,

80
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:11.006
and let's navigate to localhost:8080.

81
00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:13.005
Notice I'm using a new guest instance,

82
00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:15.006
so I have no cookies.

83
00:05:15.006 --> 00:05:17.007
Now, when I click on customers,

84
00:05:17.007 --> 00:05:19.009
it's going to ask me to sign in.

85
00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:25.005
So we will put in our user and our password or password

86
00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:29.007
and we have authentication to the JDBC base database.

87
00:05:29.007 --> 00:05:30.009
Everything that we expected,

88
00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.006
let's go ahead and make sure that orders works.

89
00:05:33.006 --> 00:05:35.008
And our detailed customer works.

90
00:05:35.008 --> 00:05:36.007
Everything looks great.

91
00:05:36.007 --> 00:05:40.000
So we have JDBC wired up into our authentication system.
