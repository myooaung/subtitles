00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] Now let's go through the actions

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:06.008
of configuring a local embedded LDAP server.

3
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.006
The first thing I want you to do is to grab

4
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:11.005
the exercise files from the start of this video.

5
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:16.007
I've added a file for you in source, main, resources,

6
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.004
and it's called test-server.ldif.

7
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:23.003
And what this is is a local LDAP configuration

8
00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:27.002
that basically matches what we are doing

9
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.008
in our traditional forms based authentication

10
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.006
with the JDBC backing.

11
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:35.004
And all we're actually going to do is replace the JDBC

12
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:39.004
and the database with the LDAP server itself.

13
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:43.002
So this will get loaded as we're doing our operations.

14
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:44.008
Okay, so let's get started.

15
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:46.006
Let's jump into the Pom file,

16
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:50.004
and in the Pom file, we're going to add a few dependencies.

17
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:52.004
So let's start with the dependency section.

18
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.000
And the first dependency that we're going to add

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.006
is spring.ldap.core.

20
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:08.005
And that's going to come from org.springframework.ldap.

21
00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:12.003
And then we're going to add another dependency

22
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:18.002
and this one is spring-security-ldap.

23
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:28.001
And that is going to come from org.springframework.security.

24
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.002
And then the last one that we are going to add

25
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:37.006
is unboundid-ldapsdk,

26
00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:41.008
and that is going to come from com.unboundid.

27
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:46.004
Now let's do a Maven dependency check.

28
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:48.008
And everything has imported.

29
00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:52.002
So now let's jump into our source main Java,

30
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.006
our config package underneath our base package

31
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:59.000
and let's go to our web security config.

32
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.005
So let's drop down here

33
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:05.004
and let's create an override

34
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:12.002
on public.void configure

35
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:14.000
and this configure is going to take

36
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.002
the AuthenticationManagerBuilder.

37
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:27.004
We will simply call that auth and this throws an exception.

38
00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:29.007
Go ahead and do an import.

39
00:02:29.007 --> 00:02:30.007
So now we're going to do

40
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:40.003
an auth.ldapAuthentication.userDnPatterns

41
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:42.002
and the user DnPattern that we are going to use

42
00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:54.003
is uid={0},ou=people,

43
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:59.009
and then we are going to do a group search base

44
00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:04.000
of ou=groups.

45
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.006
And all of this matches our ldif file.

46
00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:11.001
Our contextSource,

47
00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:14.003
the URL and the URL that our LDAP server exists on

48
00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:23.009
is local host and we're going to expose it at 8389/dc=landon

49
00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:31.003
and that is defined in our ldif, and dc=org.

50
00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:34.001
Now we're going to do an and here.

51
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:38.000
We will do a password compare,

52
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
a password encoder and the encoder that we are going to use

53
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.009
is a new BCryptPasswordEncoder,

54
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:56.001
and the passwordAttribute is going to be userPassword.

55
00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:58.005
Now, there's one more thing that we need to do.

56
00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:02.001
We need to actually go and configure,

57
00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:05.004
in our application.properties file,

58
00:04:05.004 --> 00:04:06.007
the properties for the LDAP.

59
00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:11.005
So spring.ldap.embedded.ldif

60
00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:13.008
and the embedded ldif that we are using

61
00:04:13.008 --> 00:04:21.007
is classpath:test-server.ldif

62
00:04:21.007 --> 00:04:27.002
and spring.ldap.embedded.base-dn.

63
00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:35.008
The base dn is dc=landon,dc=org.

64
00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:42.006
And the last one is spring.ldap.embedded.port

65
00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:47.007
and again, we will do 8389.

66
00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:51.004
Now let's go into our schema file

67
00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:55.003
and let's remove the users and authorities tables

68
00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:58.004
and go into our data file

69
00:04:58.004 --> 00:05:01.004
and remove all of the inserts into those tables.

70
00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:03.005
And now we're ready to start up our application,

71
00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:09.002
so let's do that.

72
00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:11.008
And you'll see by the third from the bottom message

73
00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:14.000
that it's saying, the userDn is not set

74
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.009
and we're going to use the anonymous context

75
00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.008
so we know that our LDAP server is running.

76
00:05:18.008 --> 00:05:21.002
So in our web browser, let's just go ahead and refresh,

77
00:05:21.002 --> 00:05:22.008
make sure we have the latest version.

78
00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:24.000
Let's do a login.

79
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.005
And the login that we are going to use first

80
00:05:26.005 --> 00:05:30.006
is user and password.

81
00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:33.007
So now you can go to customers,

82
00:05:33.007 --> 00:05:36.001
go to details, you don't see them.

83
00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:38.005
Orders we're still blocking.

84
00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:45.001
Log out, let's go to admin, password, go to customers,

85
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:48.004
go to details, we see them, go to orders, we see them.

86
00:05:48.004 --> 00:05:52.007
Log out once again and let's do our foo bar,

87
00:05:52.007 --> 00:05:54.003
invalid username and password.

88
00:05:54.003 --> 00:05:56.005
So we removed everything from the database

89
00:05:56.005 --> 00:05:58.009
and we provided it all through LDAP.

90
00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:02.002
That's as simple as it is to use LDAP

91
00:06:02.002 --> 00:06:05.000
as an authentication and authorization source

92
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.002
within your organization

93
00:06:06.002 --> 00:06:07.004
and this is a great tool

94
00:06:07.004 --> 00:06:09.009
if you're doing enterprise development

95
00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:14.000
in an active directory or similar directory structure.
