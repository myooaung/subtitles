00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] So now that we've talked about OAuth2

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.005
and OAuth2 with Spring,

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.007
it's time for us to actually use OAuth2 as a provider,

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.005
and we're going to do that using GitHub.

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.002
Now, the reason we're using GitHub is,

6
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:13.007
I'm speaking to developers here,

7
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.002
and most of us have a GitHub account.

8
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:17.008
If you don't have a GitHub account,

9
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.005
you can either create one for free or use another service.

10
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:23.009
The steps will be the exact same,

11
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.007
other than you will use their authentication provider

12
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:27.009
as opposed to GitHub.

13
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.001
But for what I'm going to explain, use GitHub

14
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.006
and it'll be much easier if you use your GitHub account.

15
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:35.009
So the first thing that I'm going to do

16
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:38.006
is I'm going to actually create a new project,

17
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:41.005
just because it's going to be significantly easier.

18
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:46.007
And I'm going to use the built in tool in IntelliJ.

19
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:49.006
Again, most IDEs have the same concept

20
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:52.003
of creating a new Spring Boot starter project,

21
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:55.001
or of course, you can always go to start.spring.io,

22
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:56.003
create one and download it.

23
00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:57.008
Either way works fine.

24
00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:01.003
So let's call this one admin-client.

25
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:07.005
We will set our group to be com.frankmoley.lil,

26
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:11.001
JDK 17, we're going to create a jar.

27
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:15.004
And we are going to bring in web.

28
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:23.007
And we are going to bring in OAuth2 client.

29
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:27.008
And we will bring in security.

30
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:34.007
Go ahead and hit finish.

31
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:36.004
All right, make sure that we are in the client.

32
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm going to go ahead and get rid of some of these files

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.008
that we don't need.

34
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:43.004
If you don't have Maven installed,

35
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:45.003
you are going to want to keep these,

36
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:48.002
if you're using the default way of handling Maven.

37
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.004
I use the built in one on my operating system

38
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:52.009
so I can get rid of those.

39
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.002
So let's open up source, main, resources

40
00:01:56.002 --> 00:02:00.004
and in static, I'm going to create a new HTML file

41
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:02.009
and I'm going to call it Index

42
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.003
and we will simply call this Hello World.

43
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:08.004
And we're going to put an H1 tag in here

44
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:15.006
and just say Hello LinkedIn Learning Students.

45
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:16.009
Excellent.

46
00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.002
So now that we've got that done,

47
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:21.009
it's time for us to go create a GitHub app.

48
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.002
So I have GitHub loaded up here

49
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:28.005
and I am going to go into my profile and settings.

50
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:30.005
And on the bottom, on the left side,

51
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:32.009
I'm going to go to developer settings

52
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.006
and I'm going to go to OAuth apps

53
00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:38.002
and I'm going to register a new application.

54
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:43.008
And we will call this one admin-client.

55
00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:50.002
The URL that we will use is local host 8080.

56
00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:52.002
Description doesn't matter

57
00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:54.005
but we do need to put in a callback URL

58
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.009
and the callback URL we are going to use

59
00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:12.005
is http://localhost.8080/login/oauth2/code/github.

60
00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:15.005
Go ahead and register this application.

61
00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:16.006
And you'll see we have a client ID

62
00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:17.007
but we don't have the secret yet

63
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:19.001
so let's just hang on

64
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:20.006
and let's do a little bit of configuration

65
00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:22.001
and we'll get back to this.

66
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:22.009
So in our IDE,

67
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:27.001
I want you to open up the application.properties file,

68
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:28.006
and we're going to put a couple properties in here.

69
00:03:28.006 --> 00:03:39.009
So spring.security.oauth2.client.registration-

70
00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:45.008
.github.client-id, and the value for that,

71
00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:49.002
we will get back on our GitHub page,

72
00:03:49.002 --> 00:03:56.004
grab that client ID and drop it in there.

73
00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:58.002
Now we're going to do another property

74
00:03:58.002 --> 00:03:59.006
and it all looks the same,

75
00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:05.008
except for now it's going be a client secret.

76
00:04:05.008 --> 00:04:08.000
And now back to GitHub.

77
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.008
We'll go ahead and generate a new client secret.

78
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:14.009
You're going to have to put in your password.

79
00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:17.007
And you're going to want to copy that client secret.

80
00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.004
Now I'm going to delete these.

81
00:04:19.004 --> 00:04:21.006
Don't commit this to source control

82
00:04:21.006 --> 00:04:23.007
because you will run into issues.

83
00:04:23.007 --> 00:04:25.004
I will delete this app once it's done

84
00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:26.007
so that it's no longer valid

85
00:04:26.007 --> 00:04:29.003
but don't ever commit these things to source control.

86
00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:31.008
They are a client ID and secret.

87
00:04:31.008 --> 00:04:33.009
So back in our application,

88
00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.007
we'll go ahead and paste that value.

89
00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:41.000
All right, so now all we need to do is run our application.

90
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.006
So I am going to select my client application and run it.

91
00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:50.001
And once it's up and running,

92
00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:52.004
I'll navigate here to a web browser

93
00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:55.003
and I'm going to open up local host 8080

94
00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:58.009
and you'll see, it's going to ask me to authorize admin client

95
00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.001
and it's going to do that with my GitHub account.

96
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.004
So I'll go ahead and authorize it

97
00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:06.002
and it logs me back into my application.

98
00:05:06.002 --> 00:05:09.002
That's really all there is to getting anything working

99
00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:10.007
with an OAuth2 client

100
00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:14.001
because everything is built into Spring Boot.

101
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:15.005
So we now have an application

102
00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:19.004
that's protected by an OAuth provider, in this case, GitHub,

103
00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:23.000
and we can see our application only once we've logged in.

104
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.003
Now, obviously you can take this as far as you want.

105
00:05:25.003 --> 00:05:27.002
You can put logout pages,

106
00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:29.000
you can do all kinds of protections,

107
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.008
but for now, this is the simple form

108
00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:33.009
and apply everything else that we've learned

109
00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.006
and you can build a full featured application

110
00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:40.000
using one or more OAuth providers.
