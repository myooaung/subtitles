00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] So we've made the page changes

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:03.004
that we needed to make.

3
00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:05.005
So let's put the wiring in place

4
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:09.004
so we can actually run our forms-based authentication.

5
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:11.004
So remember in the previous video

6
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.000
that we created a login page,

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but right now we don't have a controller for that.

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So let's go to our HomeController

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.004
and let's remove the RequestMapping on line nine,

10
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:28.004
and let's add a GetMapping to /

11
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:33.002
on the existing, getHome method.

12
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:39.009
And now let's add a GetMapping to /login.

13
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:45.006
So public String getLogin.

14
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.007
We don't need a model for that.

15
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:52.008
And we will return Login.

16
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:54.006
Pretty straightforward.

17
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:59.006
Now, let's go enable the configuration that we will need

18
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:03.000
in order to make forms-based authentication a reality.

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.003
So in our WebSecureConfig, in the config package,

20
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:08.007
let's take a look at what we have.

21
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:11.003
So we've got some antMatchers here,

22
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.002
and then we get into basic auth.

23
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.000
We don't need basic auth anymore.

24
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.008
We are now going to use formLogin.

25
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:23.002
And to the formLogin

26
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:26.002
we're going to tell it where the login page is

27
00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:33.009
and the login page is at /login.

28
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.000
And then we are going to give it a failureUrl

29
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.007
and the failureUrl that we are going to give it

30
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:48.001
is /login?error.

31
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:52.002
And from here, we will permitAll.

32
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.009
And then we're going to do another and.

33
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.006
And now we're going to specify our logout process.

34
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:04.000
So logout, we want to clearAuthentication.

35
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And we want to set that equal to true.

36
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.004
And we want to invalidate any HTTP sessions that we have.

37
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:20.007
And on a logoutSuccessUrl,

38
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:31.001
we want to go to /login?logout.

39
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.004
And then we'll do a .permitAll

40
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:37.001
Now, real quick, let's look at these parameters

41
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:38.001
and why they're important.

42
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:41.001
If you remember back in the previous video

43
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.005
when we created at our login page,

44
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:47.000
we set a param of error.

45
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.009
If that is set,

46
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:52.001
then we want to present the alert danger box

47
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:55.003
that says invalid username and password.

48
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:58.007
And if the param logout is set,

49
00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:00.008
we want to say that we've been logged out.

50
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:03.001
So that way we will return to the login page

51
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:05.001
with appropriate messaging

52
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.002
based on our login and logout flow.

53
00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:11.000
And that's really all there is to converting our application

54
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.006
from basic auth to login.

55
00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:14.008
In the next video

56
00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:17.003
we're going to go through and test some of these scenarios

57
00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:21.000
and run the system to see the fully functioning flow.
