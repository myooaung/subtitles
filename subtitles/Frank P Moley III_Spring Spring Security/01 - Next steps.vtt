00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Frank] So before I let you go,

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.003
I want to talk a little bit about what we've done

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.002
and what's next.

4
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.001
Real quick on a review.

5
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.002
So we've introduced the concepts around Spring Security,

6
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.006
and what it does, and how it operates,

7
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:16.003
as well as some of the security terminology

8
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:19.004
that you should know when you're working in this paradigm.

9
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.005
We've secured a basic web application.

10
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:22.009
We did it through basic auth.

11
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.005
We did it through forms-based authentication.

12
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:28.003
We used an in-memory bogus database.

13
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:33.006
We've used a real database that exists on the system.

14
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:36.002
We've also integrated it with LDAP.

15
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:40.001
We've looked at OAuth 2 and built an OAuth 2 client.

16
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:41.004
And we've done security

17
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:44.007
around a reactive-based web application.

18
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:46.007
Now, what I always encourage people

19
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.006
to do as they're working in Spring

20
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.009
and they are starting to get deep

21
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:53.001
into different concepts is to get involved.

22
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.006
Find a local Spring user group.

23
00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:58.008
If there isn't one, consider starting one.

24
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm one of the co-founders

25
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.004
of the local Kansas City Spring user group

26
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.007
that we've now merged into a Java user group,

27
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.007
which I also helped co-found.

28
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:07.009
But it's a very valuable way

29
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.006
to not only meet people in the community,

30
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:13.005
but to have really good discussions maybe you can present.

31
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:15.000
Join an online community.

32
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.002
Something like Stack Overflow.

33
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:19.008
And in that online community, become active,

34
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.002
answer questions that you know,

35
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.009
ask questions that you need help with;

36
00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.004
and follow the contributors and the advocates on Twitter.

37
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:28.003
A lot of times,

38
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.007
the content that they're building for things

39
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.004
that they're working on in the framework

40
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:36.002
or presentations they're giving, they will put links to.

41
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:37.001
And that's a great way

42
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.000
to kind of get involved with the community

43
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.005
while at the same time learning the behavior

44
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:47.000
that you need to to be successful as a Spring developer.

45
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And if you're so inclined, commit to the project.

46
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.008
They've got a ton of bugs that are great starter bugs

47
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:55.008
or great starter contributions

48
00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:57.008
that you can get involved with.

49
00:01:57.008 --> 00:01:59.006
But if nothing else, asking them questions,

50
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:02.000
learn what they're doing, follow them.

51
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.001
Now, my commitment to you.

52
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:05.003
I take teaching here

53
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:08.000
on LinkedIn Learning very, very seriously.

54
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.005
And I actually am very grateful of the fact

55
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.007
that you have spent your time

56
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.003
with me to learn this material.

57
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.005
And that doesn't fall lightly on me.

58
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.009
You can take your time in many different places,

59
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:20.005
but you've chosen to do it here.

60
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.006
And I am appreciative of that.

61
00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:25.003
Hence the reason that my commitment exists.

62
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:29.005
And that commitment doesn't end with this video ending.

63
00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:33.000
Reach out to me on places like Twitter, or Stack Overflow,

64
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.009
or GitHub at my handle on all three of FP Moles.

65
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.002
Ask questions or answer other people's questions

66
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:43.008
on the LinkedIn Learning platform itself.

67
00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:45.005
It's a great tool that you get

68
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:48.003
just by being a member of LinkedIn Learning

69
00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:49.008
where you can ask me questions,

70
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:52.001
ask others questions, or answer things.

71
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:55.003
It works very much the same way that Stack Overflow does,

72
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:58.005
but it's specific to the content of the video

73
00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:02.003
that we're talking about or the course itself.

74
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:05.006
And finally, I ask you to provide me course feedback.

75
00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:08.009
This update itself has many different changes

76
00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.005
from the original version based on feedback

77
00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:12.006
from other learners.

78
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:14.000
And I take it very seriously.

79
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.005
I listen and I try to adjust not only my teaching style,

80
00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:20.004
but the material based on what people

81
00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:21.009
want out of these courses.

82
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.006
So I love feedback;

83
00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:26.000
whether it's negative or positive, I love hearing it.

84
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.008
So please provide it.

85
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:28.008
With all that being said,

86
00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.006
I want to thank you again for your time.

87
00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:34.000
And I hope to see you around working in Spring.
