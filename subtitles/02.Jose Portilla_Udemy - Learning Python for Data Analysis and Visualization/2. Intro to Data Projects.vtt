00:00:00.160  -->  00:00:01.735
We're just gonna talk about a few links,
2

2

00:00:01.735  -->  00:00:04.300
a few things you should know before
you head on to the data projects.
3

3

00:00:04.300  -->  00:00:09.260
So first off, if you completed the course
up to this level, you already have
4

4

00:00:09.260  -->  00:00:14.161
the skill set to just go ahead and
tackle public datasets and analyze them.
5

5

00:00:14.161  -->  00:00:14.801
However, you see fit.
6

6

00:00:14.801  -->  00:00:19.042
There's no need to actually go through the
projects that I'll be presenting for you,
7

7

00:00:19.042  -->  00:00:22.661
but if you want, you can do that as
well and just continue with the course.
8

8

00:00:22.661  -->  00:00:25.939
But if you've gone all the way
up to this level of the course,
9

9

00:00:25.939  -->  00:00:28.401
you are ready to tackle
projects on your own.
10

10

00:00:28.401  -->  00:00:32.369
So in order to do that, I'm just gonna
show you a few links that you might want
11

11

00:00:32.369  -->  00:00:34.601
to know about, as far as public datasets.
12

12

00:00:34.601  -->  00:00:39.141
First one,
you wanna go check out is Data.Gov.
13

13

00:00:39.141  -->  00:00:44.087
So Data.Gov is the home of all the open
data that US Government has and
14

14

00:00:44.087  -->  00:00:47.342
there's awesome, awesome datasets here.
15

15

00:00:47.342  -->  00:00:52.179
There's over 100,000 datasets and
they're all grouped by different topics,
16

16

00:00:52.179  -->  00:00:57.800
such as agriculture, health, government,
manufacturing, ecosystems, education.
17

17

00:00:57.800  -->  00:01:00.250
So you just click on the topic
you want to check out.
18

18

00:01:00.250  -->  00:01:04.710
Go to the Data tab and then you'll
see all the different datasets.
19

19

00:01:04.710  -->  00:01:09.115
So for instance, right now education
has 293 datasets, which is awesome and
20

20

00:01:09.115  -->  00:01:11.591
they're in all different kinds of formats.
21

21

00:01:11.591  -->  00:01:16.280
Some are in CVS, some are in XL,
some are in HTML.
22

22

00:01:16.280  -->  00:01:20.517
But remember, we've gone over lectures on
how to deal with different formats, so
23

23

00:01:20.517  -->  00:01:22.950
you're already prepared
to do that in Python.
24

24

00:01:22.950  -->  00:01:27.551
Another great resource for
public datasets is on Amazon Web Services.
25

25

00:01:27.551  -->  00:01:32.620
So if you just Google search
Amazon Web Services plus public datasets,
26

26

00:01:32.620  -->  00:01:38.451
it'll take you to this link right here,
aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets and
27

27

00:01:38.451  -->  00:01:43.791
there's tons of other public datasets
here, such a human genome, NASA.
28

28

00:01:43.791  -->  00:01:47.491
A bunch of different scientific
datasets here, you can also play with.
29

29

00:01:47.491  -->  00:01:52.031
Another great resource
is Google Public Data.
30

30

00:01:52.031  -->  00:01:54.451
So you can go ahead and
check this out, as well.
31

31

00:01:54.451  -->  00:01:58.420
They have a little directory here and
it has links to where they're getting
32

32

00:01:58.420  -->  00:02:02.011
the data from and you can actually
explore the data in your browser.
33

33

00:02:04.151  -->  00:02:09.951
So go ahead and check those out, if you're
interested, just go straight for it.
34

34

00:02:09.951  -->  00:02:12.776
Think of the questions you want to answer,
what you're interested in,
35

35

00:02:12.776  -->  00:02:15.111
just check out the public datasets and
you're ready to go.
36

36

00:02:15.111  -->  00:02:20.791
Continuing to the data projects in this
course, we're going to be gonna over.
37

37

00:02:20.791  -->  00:02:26.610
First thing you're gonna wanna
do is create a GitHub profile.
38

38

00:02:28.130  -->  00:02:33.140
So go ahead and go to GitHub,
create your profile and
39

39

00:02:33.140  -->  00:02:38.060
then go ahead and
go through their tutorial on GitHub.
40

40

00:02:38.060  -->  00:02:41.890
Download their GitHub for Windows,
they also have GitHub on Mac.
41

41

00:02:41.890  -->  00:02:47.450
Go through tutorial, this is just
a way to put your stuff online for
42

42

00:02:47.450  -->  00:02:50.910
your future employers or
friends to see in the same way
43

43

00:02:50.910  -->  00:02:54.660
I show my IPython Notebooks online, you'll
be able to show your projects online.
44

44

00:02:55.750  -->  00:03:00.390
So go ahead and download GitHub and
also sign up for
45

45

00:03:00.390  -->  00:03:03.420
an account and
then you'll have a GitHub account.
46

46

00:03:04.430  -->  00:03:05.480
Great.
47

47

00:03:05.480  -->  00:03:08.520
So, another account you're gonna
have to make is on Kaggle.
48

48

00:03:08.520  -->  00:03:12.501
So Kaggle is just a great resource for
data science in general.
49

49

00:03:12.501  -->  00:03:16.615
And if you click here on
Get Started on kaggle.com,
50

50

00:03:16.615  -->  00:03:19.241
you can get to their Sign Up page.
51

51

00:03:19.241  -->  00:03:21.510
So go ahead and make a Kaggle account.
52

52

00:03:23.290  -->  00:03:28.267
For Kaggle, what we're gonna be
doing in the very first project
53

53

00:03:28.267  -->  00:03:31.415
is checking out their Titanic data set.
54

54

00:03:31.415  -->  00:03:36.769
They hae a really awesome dataset on
survival data on the Titanic crash,
55

55

00:03:36.769  -->  00:03:42.650
so we'll go ahead and be looking at
that further in the first project.
56

56

00:03:42.650  -->  00:03:48.400
But in order to get this data,
you'll have to sign up for Kaggle.
57

57

00:03:48.400  -->  00:03:49.970
So just a quick review.
58

58

00:03:49.970  -->  00:03:52.511
You already have all the skills
you need to tackle datasets.
59

59

00:03:52.511  -->  00:03:54.792
Go ahead and just go for it, if you want.
60

60

00:03:54.792  -->  00:03:59.807
There's Data.Gov, Public Data Sets,
Google Public Data or you can just
61

61

00:03:59.807  -->  00:04:05.060
Google search free public datasets
anywhere and go ahead and just go for it.
62

62

00:04:05.060  -->  00:04:06.620
You have the tools,
you have the knowledge.
63

63

00:04:06.620  -->  00:04:07.621
Totally believe in you.
64

64

00:04:07.621  -->  00:04:11.140
Go ahead and just go for it,
that's the best way to learn.
65

65

00:04:12.230  -->  00:04:15.610
If you wanna keep staying on with
this course, that's no problem.
66

66

00:04:15.610  -->  00:04:18.597
Just go ahead and
make sure you have a GitHub account, so
67

67

00:04:18.597  -->  00:04:22.286
you can show off all of the cool
things you've built in this course and
68

68

00:04:22.286  -->  00:04:24.080
then go head and sign for Kaggle.
69

69

00:04:24.080  -->  00:04:25.436
And then in the next lecture,
70

70

00:04:25.436  -->  00:04:29.141
we'll be going over this Titanic Machine
Learning from Disaster competition.
71

71

00:04:29.141  -->  00:04:33.310
Awesome.
72

72

00:04:33.310  -->  00:04:33.810
I'll see you there.
