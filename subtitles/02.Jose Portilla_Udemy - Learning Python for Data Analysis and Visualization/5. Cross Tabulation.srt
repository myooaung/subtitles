00:00:00,025  -->  00:00:05,200
Hey, welcome to lecture 46,
2

2

00:00:05,200  -->  00:00:12,681
and this lecture will
be on cross tabulation.
3

3

00:00:12,681  -->  00:00:17,130
So for this lecture we're just going
to need to import pandas as pd.
4

4

00:00:18,530  -->  00:00:21,060
So this is gonna be a quick
lesson on cross tabulations.
5

5

00:00:21,060  -->  00:00:25,310
They're basically just
a special case of pivot tables.
6

6

00:00:25,310  -->  00:00:30,010
So let's create a quick data set, and
since this is gonna be such a quick
7

7

00:00:30,010  -->  00:00:33,880
lesson, I'll show you a little
trick in addition to the lesson.
8

8

00:00:33,880  -->  00:00:38,920
So I'm gonna from string IO, I'm going
9

9

00:00:38,920  -->  00:00:44,131
to import string IO, and
10

10

00:00:44,131  -->  00:00:50,850
that will allow me to
create some data like this.
11

11

00:00:50,850  -->  00:00:55,580
So I'm gonna make some comments lines,
do a new line.
12

12

00:00:57,235  -->  00:00:57,735
Set.
13

13

00:01:02,305  -->  00:01:09,755
I'm setting right now the column
names as one line, and then,
14

14

00:01:09,755  -->  00:01:16,990
for my sample animal intelligence columns,
I'm going to have sample number one.
15

15

00:01:16,990  -->  00:01:18,055
The animal will be dog.
16

16

00:01:18,055  -->  00:01:19,500
Its intelligence will be smart.
17

17

00:01:21,230  -->  00:01:22,490
We'll have sample two.
18

18

00:01:22,490  -->  00:01:23,890
It's gonna also be a dog.
19

19

00:01:23,890  -->  00:01:25,550
It's also gonna be smart.
20

20

00:01:27,080  -->  00:01:30,340
Sample three.
I'm gonna have a cat.
21

21

00:01:30,340  -->  00:01:31,280
It's gonna be dumb.
22

22

00:01:32,380  -->  00:01:35,595
Sample four,
gonna have cat it's also gonna be dumb.
23

23

00:01:35,595  -->  00:01:40,940
And then sample five, let's make it a dog.
24

24

00:01:40,940  -->  00:01:44,050
I guess we'll have one dog be dumb.
25

25

00:01:46,240  -->  00:01:51,230
Sample six, we're gonna make it a cat,
and we'll have one smart cat.
26

26

00:01:52,890  -->  00:01:59,120
And then I'm gonna end this just
by CC ing that comment chunk.
27

27

00:01:59,120  -->  00:01:59,930
Okay.
So
28

28

00:01:59,930  -->  00:02:04,840
this is just a little trick for
using string IO to read data.
29

29

00:02:04,840  -->  00:02:07,970
So this data's just
basically a big comment.
30

30

00:02:07,970  -->  00:02:09,900
And then I can store it as a D frame.
31

31

00:02:11,520  -->  00:02:15,133
By saying pd dot reed underscore table,
and
32

32

00:02:15,133  -->  00:02:18,561
this is where we're gonna use string IO.
33

33

00:02:18,561  -->  00:02:23,741
It will analyze that data,
34

34

00:02:23,741  -->  00:02:29,373
and then the separator is just
35

35

00:02:29,373  -->  00:02:36,150
gonna be equal to backslash S plus.
36

36

00:02:36,150  -->  00:02:42,100
So don't worry about this, you can explore
string IO documentation in Python if you
37

37

00:02:42,100  -->  00:02:47,950
wish, this is just kind of a little
trick for creating data sets.
38

38

00:02:47,950  -->  00:02:50,530
We won't be creating any
more data frames this way,
39

39

00:02:51,550  -->  00:02:54,170
it's just that cross tabulation
lecture's gonna be pretty short, so
40

40

00:02:54,170  -->  00:02:56,230
I figured I'd add a little trick there for
you.
41

41

00:02:57,375  -->  00:03:02,490
Okay, and our data frame worked out well,
we got out sample numbers,
42

42

00:03:02,490  -->  00:03:05,920
the animal type, dog or
cat, and its intelligence.
43

43

00:03:05,920  -->  00:03:07,350
It's either smart or it's dumb.
44

44

00:03:08,560  -->  00:03:12,041
Okay, so, now we can create
a cross tabulation table, and
45

45

00:03:12,041  -->  00:03:14,840
it's basically just
the the frequency table.
46

46

00:03:14,840  -->  00:03:22,050
so if we call pd, cross tab that's how
you can create a cross tabulation table,
47

47

00:03:22,050  -->  00:03:26,581
and we're gonna create it
using the animal column
48

48

00:03:28,221  -->  00:03:30,650
The intelligence column.
49

49

00:03:32,331  -->  00:03:38,230
Has arguments, and
I'll set margins equal to true.
50

50

00:03:39,950  -->  00:03:40,970
So what is this gonna do?
51

51

00:03:42,575  -->  00:03:45,935
Well nothing apparently,
it will say I spelled something wrong.
52

52

00:03:45,935  -->  00:03:50,225
Margin, should be margins, excuse me.
53

53

00:03:50,225  -->  00:03:51,445
There we go, okay.
54

54

00:03:52,605  -->  00:03:53,615
So what does this do?
55

55

00:03:53,615  -->  00:03:58,560
It creates basically, a pivot table
that is almost like a frequency counter.
56

56

00:03:58,560  -->  00:04:03,240
So it's counted the total number of cats.
57

57

00:04:03,240  -->  00:04:04,070
It's created this all column.
58

58

00:04:04,070  -->  00:04:10,440
It's counted the total number of dogs and
then the total number of all the items.
59

59

00:04:10,440  -->  00:04:15,260
And then it's separated out by the second
input argument, which was intelligence.
60

60

00:04:16,280  -->  00:04:20,250
So it's grabbed all the animals
as your first input.
61

61

00:04:20,250  -->  00:04:24,850
It's separated them out by intelligence,
and then it's counted their frequencies.
62

62

00:04:24,850  -->  00:04:28,710
So you have two dumb cats,
one smart cat, all of them are three.
63

63

00:04:28,710  -->  00:04:32,910
You have one dumb dog, two smart dogs,
all of them together have three.
64

64

00:04:32,910  -->  00:04:36,140
And then for all the animals,
you have three and three.
65

65

00:04:36,140  -->  00:04:37,350
And all of them together is six.
66

66

00:04:38,750  -->  00:04:41,920
You could of also done this
using a pivot table, but
67

67

00:04:41,920  -->  00:04:45,610
cross tab is just a little shortcut for
this special case.
68

68

00:04:46,640  -->  00:04:49,251
Okay, and
that's really it about cross tabulations.
69

69

00:04:49,251  -->  00:04:53,536
We won't use them anymore throughout this
course, but it's important that you know
70

70

00:04:53,536  -->  00:04:57,220
about them in case you find
yourself needing to use them.
71

71

00:04:57,220  -->  00:04:59,490
Okay, and that's it.
72

72

00:04:59,490  -->  00:05:04,500
The next lecture is lecture 47, and
we'll be learning how to install seaborn.
73

73

00:05:04,500  -->  00:05:05,080
I'll see you there.
