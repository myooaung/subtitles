Hey everybody,
2

2

00:00:01,660  -->  00:00:07,170
welcome to just this quick introduction
video on Appendix B- Statistics Overview.
3

3

00:00:07,170  -->  00:00:11,790
So in this Appendix B, it's just gonna be
a series of IPython notebooks that go over
4

4

00:00:11,790  -->  00:00:15,010
various topics and statistics and
5

5

00:00:15,010  -->  00:00:19,010
these topics can help you a lot when
you're thinking about data analysis.
6

6

00:00:19,010  -->  00:00:21,680
Or even some machine learning topics.
7

7

00:00:21,680  -->  00:00:24,330
So just to give you a quick overview of
8

8

00:00:24,330  -->  00:00:27,830
what these appendix notebooks
are gonna look like.
9

9

00:00:27,830  -->  00:00:31,010
They'll usually have
an overview of the main topic.
10

10

00:00:31,010  -->  00:00:34,810
Then they'll start off with either
an example problem or a manual creation
11

11

00:00:34,810  -->  00:00:39,900
of the distribution if it's talking about
a specific statistical distribution.
12

12

00:00:39,900  -->  00:00:41,410
Then you'll see the notebook.
13

13

00:00:41,410  -->  00:00:47,460
We'll use SciPy to either create or
analyze the specific statistics topic,
14

14

00:00:47,460  -->  00:00:49,560
and then you'll have links
to additional resources for
15

15

00:00:49,560  -->  00:00:51,750
learning more about the topic.
16

16

00:00:51,750  -->  00:00:55,060
So all the online notebooks
can be viewed at this link.
17

17

00:00:55,060  -->  00:00:58,330
It's the same nbviewer link
you've been using before.
18

18

00:00:58,330  -->  00:01:03,830
Except instead of the Udemy course,
it's in statistics notes.
19

19

00:01:03,830  -->  00:01:09,057
So it's just
nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jimportilla,
20

20

00:01:09,057  -->  00:01:14,350
and then /Statistics-Notes/, and
then you go to the tree and master.
21

21

00:01:14,350  -->  00:01:18,850
So if you click this
link you'll go ahead and
22

22

00:01:18,850  -->  00:01:21,570
see a page that looks something like this.
23

23

00:01:21,570  -->  00:01:23,730
And then some of these
are still being created,
24

24

00:01:23,730  -->  00:01:28,710
so just have a little patience if
a particular topic isn't ready yet.
25

25

00:01:28,710  -->  00:01:31,470
Or for something like the continuous
uniform distribution,
26

26

00:01:31,470  -->  00:01:33,910
you just click on that link.
27

27

00:01:33,910  -->  00:01:37,020
And then you'll see the IPython
notebook here, so like I was saying,
28

28

00:01:38,350  -->  00:01:43,010
there's a little introduction to
the topic, an example problem.
29

29

00:01:43,010  -->  00:01:45,350
We solve it using Python, and
30

30

00:01:45,350  -->  00:01:50,830
then we see how to create distribution
automatically using SciPy.
31

31

00:01:50,830  -->  00:01:55,590
For the rest of these lectures, I'm not
gonna be typing as I go along and talking.
32

32

00:01:55,590  -->  00:01:59,650
I'm just gonna open up the IPython
notebook and view it with you guys.
33

33

00:01:59,650  -->  00:02:03,910
And just go over it, cuz there's quite a
bit of LateX use to write these equations,
34

34

00:02:03,910  -->  00:02:07,220
and it just takes too long to type it out.
35

35

00:02:07,220  -->  00:02:09,780
So go ahead and check out these notebooks.
36

36

00:02:09,780  -->  00:02:12,590
You can even just check
them out by yourself.
37

37

00:02:12,590  -->  00:02:14,720
You don't really need to
follow along with the videos.
38

38

00:02:14,720  -->  00:02:16,730
Everything's really heavily commented, and
39

39

00:02:16,730  -->  00:02:19,830
it has explanations within
the notebooks themselves.
40

40

00:02:19,830  -->  00:02:24,060
And it's just an additional resource for
you guys to learn about statistics, or
41

41

00:02:24,060  -->  00:02:27,930
give you a refresh,
in case you don't remember.
42

42

00:02:27,930  -->  00:02:29,430
All right, so thanks a lot.
43

43

00:02:29,430  -->  00:02:32,655
And just remember you can view
these online notebooks at this link
44

44

00:02:32,655  -->  00:02:39,760
mpviewer.ipython.org/github/jmportilla/St-
atistics-Notes/tree/master.
45

45

00:02:39,760  -->  00:02:42,490
And the text file attached to this
lecture will have that link in it.
46

46

00:02:42,490  -->  00:02:43,700
All right.
47

47

00:02:43,700  -->  00:02:44,200
Thanks, guys!
