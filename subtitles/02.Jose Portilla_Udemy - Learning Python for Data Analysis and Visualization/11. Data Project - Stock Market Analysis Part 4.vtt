00:00:02.410  -->  00:00:03.370
Hey everyone.
2

2

00:00:03.370  -->  00:00:08.160
Welcome to part four of the stock
market data analysis project.
3

3

00:00:09.440  -->  00:00:15.240
And we're going to be looking at in
this part is stock and its risks.
4

4

00:00:15.240  -->  00:00:18.500
So we're going to be look at various
methods to analyze the risk of a stock.
5

5

00:00:18.500  -->  00:00:24.290
Let me go ahead and
jump over to the iPython notebooks.
6

6

00:00:25.820  -->  00:00:31.580
So I'm gonna put a new tab here,
and this is just the off nbviewer,
7

7

00:00:31.580  -->  00:00:34.380
the iPython notebook that I've already
created for you guys to follow along with.
8

8

00:00:35.470  -->  00:00:38.650
So we just finished using paraplots,
9

9

00:00:38.650  -->  00:00:42.530
and we're gonna see now
how we can quantify risk.
10

10

00:00:42.530  -->  00:00:47.460
So one of the most basic ways of using the
information that we've already gathered
11

11

00:00:47.460  -->  00:00:51.380
on daily percentage returns is to
compare the expected return with
12

12

00:00:51.380  -->  00:00:53.870
the standard deviation
of the daily returns.
13

13

00:00:55.040  -->  00:00:59.770
And so what I mean by that is if we
scroll down here we're gonna analyze and
14

14

00:00:59.770  -->  00:01:01.640
compare the risk,
15

15

00:01:01.640  -->  00:01:06.720
which is the standard deviation of your
daily returns versus your expected return.
16

16

00:01:06.720  -->  00:01:09.110
So we're gonna go ahead and
make this scatter plot.
17

17

00:01:10.290  -->  00:01:15.310
So, jumping back to our coding,
let's go ahead and start.
18

18

00:01:16.520  -->  00:01:20.560
So I'm gonna define a new
data frame called rets, and
19

19

00:01:22.330  -->  00:01:26.530
I'll set that equal to tech_rets.
20

20

00:01:26.530  -->  00:01:29.365
And I'm gonna drop all
the null values using dropna.
21

21

00:01:29.365  -->  00:01:34.399
Now I have that new New data
frame what I'm going to do as
22

22

00:01:34.399  -->  00:01:39.331
well is set area equal to numpy.pi or
np.pi * 20.
23

23

00:01:39.331  -->  00:01:42.930
And what I'll be using the area for for
24

24

00:01:42.930  -->  00:01:49.810
is just to define the area of these
circles for the scatter plot.
25

25

00:01:49.810  -->  00:01:51.680
Otherwise, you'll just get
these tiny little points and
26

26

00:01:51.680  -->  00:01:52.640
you won't be able to see them.
27

27

00:01:53.770  -->  00:02:00.550
And then I'm going to use PLT.scatter and
28

28

00:02:00.550  -->  00:02:05.070
I'm gonna set mean of
the returns on the x axis.
29

29

00:02:06.110  -->  00:02:12.049
On the y axis I will set the standard
deviation of those returns.
30

30

00:02:12.049  -->  00:02:17.227
And, whoops,
I will set s equal to that area.
31

31

00:02:19.734  -->  00:02:23.821
And then before we plot it out
I'll set the x and y labels.
32

32

00:02:23.821  -->  00:02:29.997
So my xlabel is going to
be the Expected Return.
33

33

00:02:35.570  -->  00:02:42.141
My ylabel is going to the risk
that the stock holds.
34

34

00:02:42.141  -->  00:02:48.241
And then if I just come back here and
take a look at this plot,
35

35

00:02:48.241  -->  00:02:56.793
in order to label scatter plots you can
use the annotations guide from matplotlib.
36

36

00:02:56.793  -->  00:03:02.530
So I've provided the link here for you
matplotlib.org/users/annotations_ guide.
37

37

00:03:02.530  -->  00:03:05.320
So go ahead and
follow that link you'll get to this page.
38

38

00:03:05.320  -->  00:03:10.030
And you'll see that there's tons of
different ways to annotate axes and
39

39

00:03:10.030  -->  00:03:11.580
points using matplotlib.
40

40

00:03:12.730  -->  00:03:16.530
So, there's a bunch of different box
styles you can choose from: square,
41

41

00:03:16.530  -->  00:03:18.350
sawtooth, roundtooth, circles, etc.
42

42

00:03:18.350  -->  00:03:21.390
A ton of different arrows you can use.
43

43

00:03:21.390  -->  00:03:26.420
Here you can see the curves,
arches, angles, squares and
44

44

00:03:26.420  -->  00:03:30.680
then thicknesses, the wedges,
the fancies, the simple type of lines.
45

45

00:03:30.680  -->  00:03:31.910
You have a lot of options here.
46

46

00:03:34.610  -->  00:03:41.200
I'd just basically am going to whoops,
copy and
47

47

00:03:41.200  -->  00:03:44.950
paste what I've already done here,
as far as the annotation.
48

48

00:03:44.950  -->  00:03:47.470
Cuz, it's a lot to type out,
and I'll break it down for you.
49

49

00:03:48.860  -->  00:03:53.750
So what I did here was I said for
label x, y, and zip.
50

50

00:03:53.750  -->  00:03:57.330
And zip just allows me to call
these three things at once.
51

51

00:03:57.330  -->  00:04:02.050
So I said for every column and
52

52

00:04:02.050  -->  00:04:04.990
returns in that rets data frame.
53

53

00:04:04.990  -->  00:04:07.470
So for
every column in that rets data frame,
54

54

00:04:07.470  -->  00:04:12.210
set x equal to the mean of that column and
set Y equal to the standard deviation.
55

55

00:04:13.400  -->  00:04:15.960
And then go ahead and using plt.annotate.
56

56

00:04:17.130  -->  00:04:20.130
Set the label and
set these various arguments.
57

57

00:04:20.130  -->  00:04:24.909
So all these various arguments of
text cords, HA horizontal access,
58

58

00:04:24.909  -->  00:04:27.170
VA vertical access.
59

59

00:04:27.170  -->  00:04:31.910
All these needs to be customized using
the information in the documentation.
60

60

00:04:33.190  -->  00:04:35.580
So if you scroll down here
you'll be able to see you
61

61

00:04:36.700  -->  00:04:38.330
can put in a bunch of
different data arguments.
62

62

00:04:38.330  -->  00:04:43.060
And I'm just going to go ahead and
run this.
63

63

00:04:44.640  -->  00:04:46.240
And there you have it.
64

64

00:04:46.240  -->  00:04:49.350
So if you're running
this on a different day,
65

65

00:04:49.350  -->  00:04:50.800
you're gonna get a different scatter plot.
66

66

00:04:50.800  -->  00:04:58.310
Cuz remember, using our date time.now,
we received one year's worth of stock.
67

67

00:04:58.310  -->  00:05:02.268
So if you do this a month from now,
you'll get a different scatter plot.
68

68

00:05:02.268  -->  00:05:05.040
Now if you notice, Google or
69

69

00:05:05.040  -->  00:05:08.030
Microsoft labels are hovering
right above each other.
70

70

00:05:09.340  -->  00:05:14.120
You can go ahead and keep messing
around with these annotation styles.
71

71

00:05:14.120  -->  00:05:17.020
Change the radius here of
the connection style or
72

72

00:05:17.020  -->  00:05:23.240
just set the offset points to
make sure nothing's overlapping.
73

73

00:05:23.240  -->  00:05:25.510
And you can get it to
look something like this.
74

74

00:05:25.510  -->  00:05:28.580
I've set everything here
working correctly for
75

75

00:05:28.580  -->  00:05:31.680
this particular days
analysis of that stock.
76

76

00:05:32.960  -->  00:05:34.410
So I'll leave that up to you.
77

77

00:05:34.410  -->  00:05:35.980
If you want to go ahead and analyze that.
78

78

00:05:37.330  -->  00:05:43.300
But looking at the overall
picture of the scatter plot.
79

79

00:05:43.300  -->  00:05:47.440
Preferably you would want a stock
to give a strong expected return or
80

80

00:05:47.440  -->  00:05:50.510
a positive and a lower risk.
81

81

00:05:50.510  -->  00:05:53.020
So it looks like Apple is
the best stock here to pick from.
82

82

00:05:54.350  -->  00:05:57.280
And you really wouldn't want
a negative expected return,
83

83

00:05:57.280  -->  00:05:59.880
so a daily percentage loss on your stock,
84

84

00:05:59.880  -->  00:06:03.960
with a high risk cuz that would mean
you have a huge standard deviation.
85

85

00:06:03.960  -->  00:06:08.630
Now, where it gets a little troublesome is
if you have a very high expected return,
86

86

00:06:08.630  -->  00:06:09.720
but also your risk is high.
87

87

00:06:09.720  -->  00:06:12.700
Then you're just playing
the stock market there.
88

88

00:06:14.050  -->  00:06:14.550
Okay.
89

89

00:06:15.660  -->  00:06:20.110
In the next video, we're gonna go
ahead and look at value at risk, and
90

90

00:06:20.110  -->  00:06:23.205
we're gonna look at how to do
it using two different methods.
91

91

00:06:23.205  -->  00:06:26.385
Using the bootstrap
method with quantiles and
92

92

00:06:26.385  -->  00:06:29.985
then we'll also look at value at
risk using the Monte Carlo Method.
93

93

00:06:31.075  -->  00:06:35.735
And we'll go over
the Monte Carlo Method later on.
94

94

00:06:35.735  -->  00:06:40.200
Okay, so I'll go ahead and stop here,
and this video, just a quick overview.
95

95

00:06:40.200  -->  00:06:45.520
We looked at how to do a basic risk
analysis by comparing your expected
96

96

00:06:45.520  -->  00:06:49.800
return with your standard deviation of
that return, otherwise known as risk.
97

97

00:06:50.820  -->  00:06:53.530
So we'll look at value at
risk in the next video.
98

98

00:06:53.530  -->  00:06:55.820
All right guys, thanks and
I'll see you there.
