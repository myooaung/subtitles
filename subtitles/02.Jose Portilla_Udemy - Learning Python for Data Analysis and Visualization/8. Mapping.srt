Hey guys, welcome to Lecture 36 and
this lecture will be on Mapping.
2

2

00:00:08,420  -->  00:00:12,438
So, we're gonna import the usual,
3

3

00:00:12,438  -->  00:00:17,104
import numpy as np,
import pandas as pd and
4

4

00:00:17,104  -->  00:00:22,434
then from pandas, import Series,DataFrame.
5

5

00:00:22,434  -->  00:00:28,279
All right, so mapping is a great
way to add columns to dataframes.
6

6

00:00:29,560  -->  00:00:31,750
And I'll show you what I
mean by that in a second.
7

7

00:00:31,750  -->  00:00:33,400
So let's create a dataframe to work with.
8

8

00:00:35,210  -->  00:00:38,980
We'll say dframe equals,
let's make a DataFrame.
9

9

00:00:42,050  -->  00:00:45,780
And then we're gonna say,
let's have it be a column for
10

10

00:00:45,780  -->  00:00:50,400
city, we'll pass a dictionary,
and then this key will have.
11

11

00:00:50,400  -->  00:00:54,690
I'm just going to get some
information off Wikipedia.
12

12

00:00:56,460  -->  00:00:59,790
These are some of the highest
elevation cities in the United States.
13

13

00:01:04,820  -->  00:01:09,510
We got Alma, Brian Head, and Fox Park, and
14

14

00:01:09,510  -->  00:01:12,780
let's create another entry,
another key in that dictionary.
15

15

00:01:14,550  -->  00:01:16,120
We'll create altitude.
16

16

00:01:20,530  -->  00:01:24,097
And here's the altitude for
17

17

00:01:24,097  -->  00:01:28,853
each of these cities, 3,000 and
18

18

00:01:28,853  -->  00:01:35,410
this is in meters I believe,
2762, all right.
19

19

00:01:35,410  -->  00:01:37,120
And then let's go ahead and
show that data frame.
20

20

00:01:38,520  -->  00:01:41,960
Cool, so now you have a data frame that
has the altitude of the cities, and
21

21

00:01:41,960  -->  00:01:43,240
the city names themselves.
22

22

00:01:44,320  -->  00:01:49,260
So let's say you wanted to add
a column to this data frame.
23

23

00:01:49,260  -->  00:01:52,900
But you wanted to add a column for
each state that the city is in.
24

24

00:01:54,140  -->  00:01:58,210
So you can use mapping to map the column,
so
25

25

00:01:58,210  -->  00:02:01,380
that your states match and
map onto your cities.
26

26

00:02:01,380  -->  00:02:03,210
So I'll show you what I mean by that.
27

27

00:02:03,210  -->  00:02:04,618
So let's go ahead and create a dictionary.
28

28

00:02:04,618  -->  00:02:10,860
Say state_map = curly brackets for
the dictionary.
29

29

00:02:14,230  -->  00:02:15,985
So Alma is in Colorado.
30

30

00:02:15,985  -->  00:02:20,780
Brian Head
31

31

00:02:20,780  -->  00:02:26,110
is in Utah.
32

32

00:02:29,520  -->  00:02:35,350
And Fox Park is in Wyoming.
33

33

00:02:42,070  -->  00:02:44,040
All right.
So now we have our dictionary state map.
34

34

00:02:45,350  -->  00:02:48,940
And then let's go ahead and
we'll call dframe.
35

35

00:02:50,780  -->  00:02:56,106
We'll create a column,
say dframe ['state'] = dframe,
36

36

00:02:56,106  -->  00:02:59,130
and this is how we're gonna map it.
37

37

00:02:59,130  -->  00:03:03,653
We are going to say, call the city column,
38

38

00:03:03,653  -->  00:03:07,080
and then pass the method .map.
39

39

00:03:07,080  -->  00:03:12,760
And what we're gonna map to it is,
that dictionary we made called state_map.
40

40

00:03:12,760  -->  00:03:17,490
So what we're doing right now is we're
creating a new column called state, and
41

41

00:03:17,490  -->  00:03:21,640
we're calling the map method
onto the city column.
42

42

00:03:21,640  -->  00:03:25,870
So now wherever these cities match
up in our state map dictionary,
43

43

00:03:25,870  -->  00:03:28,840
it'll add the state into a state column.
44

44

00:03:28,840  -->  00:03:32,064
So we'll do that, now let's see what our
dataframe looks like by calling dframe.
45

45

00:03:34,080  -->  00:03:36,890
And so now we have an altitude,
the city, and the state.
46

46

00:03:36,890  -->  00:03:40,310
And the states have been correctly
matched with their cities.
47

47

00:03:41,400  -->  00:03:42,290
Cool.
48

48

00:03:42,290  -->  00:03:45,810
So mapping is a great way to do
element wise transformations and
49

49

00:03:45,810  -->  00:03:47,619
other data cleaning operations.
50

50

00:03:49,170  -->  00:03:53,080
There's lots of different ways you can use
this, but as far as the overall method
51

51

00:03:53,080  -->  00:03:57,930
the simplest way is just creating or
modifying a new column and
52

52

00:03:57,930  -->  00:04:02,660
then using the .map method to
pass a dictionary object and
53

53

00:04:02,660  -->  00:04:06,350
map it to a column that already
exists in your data frame.
54

54

00:04:06,350  -->  00:04:07,350
Okay.
55

55

00:04:07,350  -->  00:04:08,700
So that's it for mapping.
56

56

00:04:08,700  -->  00:04:11,230
Next up,
we'll learn how to replace values.
57

57

00:04:11,230  -->  00:04:11,900
I'll see you there.
