00:00:02.180  -->  00:00:06.940
Hello everyone and welcome to a preview
of the Data Projects in this course.
2

2

00:00:06.940  -->  00:00:10.620
This video is mainly directed to people
considering in enrolling in the course.
3

3

00:00:10.620  -->  00:00:14.300
If you're already enrolled in this course,
go ahead and skip to the next video for
4

4

00:00:14.300  -->  00:00:16.579
a more in-depth introduction
to data projects.
5

5

00:00:18.020  -->  00:00:21.270
In this video we're gonna be doing a quick
overview of the different data sets
6

6

00:00:21.270  -->  00:00:22.790
we'll analyze in the course.
7

7

00:00:22.790  -->  00:00:25.630
And how we'll gather insights and
great visualizations from the data.
8

8

00:00:26.990  -->  00:00:31.960
So in the first project, we'll be tackling
the Kaggle Titanic challenge, and
9

9

00:00:31.960  -->  00:00:34.440
taking a look at the data there.
10

10

00:00:34.440  -->  00:00:36.600
So we're gonna be answering
questions along the way,
11

11

00:00:36.600  -->  00:00:39.140
such as who were
the passengers in the Titanic?
12

12

00:00:39.140  -->  00:00:40.710
Where the passengers come from?
13

13

00:00:40.710  -->  00:00:43.130
And what factors helped
someone survive the sinking?
14

14

00:00:43.130  -->  00:00:44.990
As well as other questions.
15

15

00:00:44.990  -->  00:00:46.630
And throughout our entire analysis,
16

16

00:00:46.630  -->  00:00:51.520
we'll be visualizing the data using
Seaborn libraries and also matplotlib.
17

17

00:00:51.520  -->  00:00:54.667
And as you can see here,
we'll get some pretty nice insights and
18

18

00:00:54.667  -->  00:00:55.837
data visualizations.
19

19

00:00:57.753  -->  00:01:02.115
So after we're done analyzing Titanic
data, we'll be going on to the next
20

20

00:01:02.115  -->  00:01:06.120
project, which is
the Stock Market Analysis project.
21

21

00:01:06.120  -->  00:01:08.760
In this project, we're gonna be
looking at how we can use Pandas and
22

22

00:01:08.760  -->  00:01:11.430
Python to get stock information
directly from the web.
23

23

00:01:11.430  -->  00:01:14.810
And then we'll be answering a couple
of questions along the way,
24

24

00:01:14.810  -->  00:01:18.960
such as how the price change overtime,
or the daily returns.
25

25

00:01:18.960  -->  00:01:22.670
We'll look at moving averages and
correlations between different stocks.
26

26

00:01:22.670  -->  00:01:26.430
And again, the whole time we're gonna be
visualizing the data insights we get.
27

27

00:01:28.530  -->  00:01:31.320
After looking at correlations,
we'll look at different ways to visualize
28

28

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:34.710
correlations between multiple stocks,
as you can get a quick glimpse here.
29

29

00:01:36.830  -->  00:01:40.740
And furthermore,
we'll look at risk analysis for stocks and
30

30

00:01:40.740  -->  00:01:44.740
we'll look at how we can measure values at
risk, easy with the Bootstrap method and
31

31

00:01:44.740  -->  00:01:46.960
also using the Monte Carlo method.
32

32

00:01:46.960  -->  00:01:51.100
And how we can simulate a bunch of
different stock prices throughout time.
33

33

00:01:53.630  -->  00:01:57.000
And then the third data project
we'll be looking at Election Data.
34

34

00:01:57.000  -->  00:01:59.090
Such as polls, and some donation data.
35

35

00:02:00.410  -->  00:02:03.880
So in this project,
we'll be looking at who was polled, and
36

36

00:02:03.880  -->  00:02:06.050
what was their party affiliation.
37

37

00:02:06.050  -->  00:02:09.700
How the poll results changed over
time to favor either Romney or Obama.
38

38

00:02:09.700  -->  00:02:11.940
This was the 2012 election
that we're looking at here.
39

39

00:02:13.170  -->  00:02:18.100
And after that, we'll be visualizing
the different poll data that we get,
40

40

00:02:19.550  -->  00:02:22.330
as well as how sentiment changed overtime.
41

41

00:02:22.330  -->  00:02:26.590
We'll also look to see if events such as
the debates marked here in this little
42

42

00:02:26.590  -->  00:02:28.900
visualization change voter sentiment.
43

43

00:02:30.440  -->  00:02:32.560
After that we will be
looking at donations.
44

44

00:02:32.560  -->  00:02:37.070
And how different donations changed
between the candidates that were running.
45

45

00:02:38.360  -->  00:02:42.970
And we will see if we can find any trends
between the donor's occupations or
46

46

00:02:42.970  -->  00:02:44.149
their party affiliations.
47

47

00:02:45.550  -->  00:02:48.190
And along the way we'll be
visualizing all of this and
48

48

00:02:48.190  -->  00:02:52.520
getting some great data analysis and
some great data visualizations.
49

49

00:02:52.520  -->  00:02:54.380
Great, so that's just a quick,
50

50

00:02:54.380  -->  00:02:58.100
brief overview of what the data
projects in the course look like.
51

51

00:02:58.100  -->  00:02:59.221
And I hope you enroll.
52

52

00:02:59.221  -->  00:03:00.128
Thank you.
