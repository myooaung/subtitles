Hey Guys,
this is lecture 47 installing Seaborn.
2

2

00:00:05.910  -->  00:00:11.720
So in this lecture we are just going to go
over very briefly how to install Seaborn.
3

3

00:00:13.640  -->  00:00:17.495
So Seaborn you can just click the link
to the IPython Notebook viewer.
4

4

00:00:17.495  -->  00:00:21.905
It will have this link on it,
stanford.edu.
5

5

00:00:21.905  -->  00:00:27.545
It will take you to this Seaborn page,
so just install and get it.
6

6

00:00:29.155  -->  00:00:32.530
You can just use pip install for Seaborn.
7

7

00:00:32.530  -->  00:00:36.130
The dependencies are nunpi,
saipai, matpot, and pandas.
8

8

00:00:36.130  -->  00:00:38.970
You should already have
those because of all
9

9

00:00:38.970  -->  00:00:41.190
of the other installations
we have done in the past.
10

10

00:00:41.190  -->  00:00:42.930
It has recommended dependencies.
11

11

00:00:42.930  -->  00:00:45.260
You might not have downloaded those yet.
12

12

00:00:45.260  -->  00:00:48.150
That's gonna be stats, models and patsy.
13

13

00:00:48.150  -->  00:00:51.460
So you can go ahead and
pip install those and you can
14

14

00:00:51.460  -->  00:00:55.920
also do a Conda install if you ended up
downloading the Anaconda distribution.
15

15

00:00:58.470  -->  00:01:01.560
Seaborn is a really,
really great visualization library for
16

16

00:01:01.560  -->  00:01:04.030
statistical data sets.
17

17

00:01:05.080  -->  00:01:08.010
Here's just the example gallery off
their website and we're gonna learn
18

18

00:01:08.010  -->  00:01:12.660
how to make a lot of these types
of plots for analyzing our data.
19

19

00:01:12.660  -->  00:01:16.910
Another nice thing about Seaborn is you
can choose different color pallets,
20

20

00:01:16.910  -->  00:01:20.490
has a lot of options for you, and
it even has color blind options
21

21

00:01:20.490  -->  00:01:23.270
in case you're color blind so
you can explore that as well.
22

22

00:01:24.690  -->  00:01:28.210
But as far as installing Seaborn,
it should just be simple,
23

23

00:01:28.210  -->  00:01:30.625
either a pip install and then Seaborn, or
24

24

00:01:30.625  -->  00:01:35.620
Conda install Seaborn if you
downloaded the anaconda distribution.
25

25

00:01:35.620  -->  00:01:38.759
All right, that's about it go ahead and
install Seaborn, and
26

26

00:01:38.759  -->  00:01:42.031
we will get started how to visualize
our data in the next lecture.
27

27

00:01:42.031  -->  00:01:42.990
I'll see you there.
