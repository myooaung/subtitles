Hey guys, welcome to lecture 37.
2

2

00:00:02,560  -->  00:00:08,800
And this will be just a quick lecture on
how to use replace with your data frames.
3

3

00:00:08,800  -->  00:00:10,730
So, Copy and Paste or
4

4

00:00:10,730  -->  00:00:15,480
just type out the normal imports
which is import numpy as np.
5

5

00:00:16,770  -->  00:00:19,840
Import pandas as pd.
6

6

00:00:19,840  -->  00:00:26,590
And then, from pandas,
import series and data frame.
7

7

00:00:28,440  -->  00:00:29,230
All right, awesome.
8

8

00:00:29,230  -->  00:00:30,850
So, let's go ahead and make a series.
9

9

00:00:32,430  -->  00:00:37,595
We'll call it ser1 and
the series we just build using a list.
10

10

00:00:37,595  -->  00:00:42,280
So, I'm just gonna go one, two,
three, four and then again,
11

11

00:00:42,280  -->  00:00:43,520
one, two, three, four.
12

12

00:00:44,630  -->  00:00:47,080
And then, let's go ahead and
show that series.
13

13

00:00:49,180  -->  00:00:49,970
There we go.
14

14

00:00:49,970  -->  00:00:53,810
So we have an index and it's one, two,
three, four, one, two, three, four.
15

15

00:00:53,810  -->  00:00:58,341
So, using replace,
we can select which value we wanna
16

16

00:00:58,341  -->  00:01:02,390
replace with the new value, and
the new value to replace it with.
17

17

00:01:02,390  -->  00:01:06,550
So for instance, the way this works
is you call the replace method,
18

18

00:01:06,550  -->  00:01:08,175
which is just .replace.
19

19

00:01:09,450  -->  00:01:13,410
And then you select the value
you want to replace, and
20

20

00:01:13,410  -->  00:01:15,810
then the new value you want in its place.
21

21

00:01:15,810  -->  00:01:19,460
So for instance, I can say that I want
22

22

00:01:19,460  -->  00:01:24,480
every one value in that series
to be replaced by a null value.
23

23

00:01:25,480  -->  00:01:28,470
Let's go ahead and
see if that worked, awesome.
24

24

00:01:28,470  -->  00:01:32,200
So now, every value that was one
has been replaced with a null.
25

25

00:01:34,020  -->  00:01:39,420
You can also input lists into the replace
method to show you how those work.
26

26

00:01:41,220  -->  00:01:48,500
Let's say,
I want to replace the ones and fours,
27

27

00:01:48,500  -->  00:01:54,390
and I want to replace them with 100 and
400 respectively.
28

28

00:01:54,390  -->  00:01:58,790
So the lists need to match up so
that every value of
29

29

00:01:58,790  -->  00:02:03,930
your first list that will be replaced
by the value in your second list.
30

30

00:02:03,930  -->  00:02:08,370
So every 1 will be replaced by 100,
and every 4 will be replaced by 400.
31

31

00:02:08,370  -->  00:02:10,620
So let's go ahead and pass that.
32

32

00:02:11,880  -->  00:02:16,410
Cool, so that worked, and that's how
you can do multiple replaces at once.
33

33

00:02:17,430  -->  00:02:20,040
And then the last thing,
you can also input a dictionary.
34

34

00:02:21,210  -->  00:02:28,670
So for instance, I have my SER1.replace
and I can pass a dictionary so that
35

35

00:02:30,040  -->  00:02:35,340
in a similar manner every four
gets replaced by a null value.
36

36

00:02:35,340  -->  00:02:37,920
So you can just input a key and
a value to be replaced.
37

37

00:02:37,920  -->  00:02:41,570
So let's go ahead and
see how that works, and so
38

38

00:02:41,570  -->  00:02:44,370
now every 4 value was
replaced by a null value.
39

39

00:02:45,440  -->  00:02:50,390
So that's it for replace, just a quick
overview, you can just call .replace
40

40

00:02:50,390  -->  00:02:55,260
onto your series, and then you call
the value you want to replace, and
41

41

00:02:55,260  -->  00:02:57,620
then the value you wanna replace it with.
42

42

00:02:57,620  -->  00:03:01,170
You can also pass lists to
do multiple values at once.
43

43

00:03:01,170  -->  00:03:05,870
You can also pass dictionaries
in a similar manner.
44

44

00:03:05,870  -->  00:03:08,050
You replace the key with its value.
45

45

00:03:09,160  -->  00:03:12,943
So that's it for replace, up next we
are gonna learn about renaming and
46

46

00:03:12,943  -->  00:03:14,270
access index.
47

47

00:03:14,270  -->  00:03:15,060
I'll see you there.
