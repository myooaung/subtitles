1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,800
OK, so up until now, we've been writing little snippets of programs in code and things and to test

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,430
them out.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,250
We just keep running the actual program and we have to go all the way through all the various scenarios.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:23,070
Now, one of the keys to being a really great developer is knowing all of your techniques really well.

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,540
And one of the best techniques to know as a software developer is automated testing.

6
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:38,610
That's where you're able to actually test your code in an automatic way where you yourself don't have

7
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:45,750
to keep manually trying everything out from beginning to end repeatedly over and over and over again.

8
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:52,500
As your programs get larger, you won't be able to scale doing that type of testing, which is just

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,850
manual testing.

10
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,460
I'm not saying you'll never manually test, you're probably never going to get completely away from

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:00:59,670
it.

12
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:07,710
But the more you know how to write tests that can run automatically, the more work you can get done.

13
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,990
So in this module or chapter, we're going to learn about automated testing in Java.

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:24,870
So Java has a few different what are called frameworks for writing automated tests.

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,300
These frameworks, especially the most popular ones, are all developed by third party organizations.

16
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,270
And in general, as far as I'm aware, they are all what are called open source projects, meaning they

17
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:48,240
are non-profit projects usually maintained by volunteers, and they make the code that they write for

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,310
these frameworks freely available.

19
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:59,640
And so these frameworks are generally implemented as add on libraries that we can use with Java.

20
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,720
So up until now, we have not explicitly been making use of any add on libraries at all.

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,800
But now we will.

22
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:14,820
And the testing framework that we're going to be looking at in this course is called Jane Unit.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,230
And I would say that is by far the most popular testing framework for Java, though by no means is it

24
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,290
the only one.

25
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,940
There are a few others that are fairly popular as well, but I wouldn't say they're anywhere near G-Unit

26
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,480
and to get a job as a professional Java developer.

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,440
Most companies, if they care about your ability to write tests at all, if you only know one testing

28
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,730
framework, it had better be a unit that is basically the the de facto standard of testing in the Java

29
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,150
world.

30
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,470
So without further ado, let's jump in and take a look at how that works.
