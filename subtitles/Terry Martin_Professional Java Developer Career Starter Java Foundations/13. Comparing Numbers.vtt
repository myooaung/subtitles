00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.590
OK, next up, we'll learn about equalities and inequalities.

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.350
This is where we can have Java determine whether or not two values two numbers in this case are equal

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.560
to each other, or one may be greater than or less than the other variations like that.

4
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.120
So let's see how to do this.

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.370
All right.

6
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.750
So clear this bit out.

7
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.190
OK, so what I think will do is make actually, we'll just have the two numbers again.

8
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:41.040
Let's do number one and number two, and let's set them both to three and then let's print out something.

9
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.780
And so first off, let's just ask Java if these two numbers are the same number.

10
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.550
And to do that, we can do number one space.

11
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.800
Now here's something that's going to be a little unique if you've never seen this before.

12
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.590
We're going to use equals equals.

13
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.300
Now you have you have seen this in one lesson earlier where we were comparing two objects to determine

14
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.270
whether or not they were both pointing at the same memory location, the same location in memory.

15
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.100
However, when the equals equals operator, also known as just the equals operator, is being used for

16
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.910
numbers.

17
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.420
There's no memory comparison going on.

18
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.990
And instead, it's literally just trying to determine whether or not the two numbers are the same.

19
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.650
So let's see how this behaves when we run it.

20
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.680
OK, we get a true so just as when we were using the equals operator with objects, it returns a boolean

21
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.310
true or false truth in this case, if they are both the same number or as false.

22
00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.690
Now, please keep in mind the difference between the assignment operator, which is this thing one equals

23
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.540
sign versus the equals operator, which is two equal signs together.

24
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.410
This one, the assignment operator, assigns a value to a variable.

25
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.460
OK.

26
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.310
Whereas the equals operator answers the question of whether or not the two things on either side are

27
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.200
equal to each other or point to the same memory location if it's objects.

28
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.990
So pretty, pretty huge difference there.

29
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.880
There are some other operations that we can use when comparing numbers, though they should generally

30
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.700
all be familiar from algebra class.

31
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.130
So in addition to asking if two numbers are equal, we can also ask is one greater than or less than

32
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.580
another?

33
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.970
And we use the greater than and less than symbols just like this.

34
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.680
So let's run this.

35
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.230
OK, so three is not greater than three if we make number one, a five and run this.

36
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.830
OK, now we get a true as you would expect, and then we can use the less than and that's going to do

37
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.360
what you would expect it to.

38
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.320
OK, so we get a false there and then we'll change this bottom line to something else.

39
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.950
OK, now there's one more pair that you will want to be aware of, and that is greater than or equal.

40
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.340
OK, so we can also ask is one number greater than or equal to another one?

41
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:45.320
So if we do another minute here, if we do six and five.

42
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.960
Is six greater than or equal to five?

43
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.210
The answer is true, which is yes.

44
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.490
And if we turn this five into a six and run this again.

45
00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.770
That is also true.

46
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.940
Six is equal to six, six is greater than or equal to six.

47
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.890
And then there's also a less than or equal less than or equal.

48
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.420
And that does what you would expect.

49
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.620
I'm not going to run through that.

50
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.760
OK.

51
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.580
And there's one more.

52
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.220
What if you want to ask if two numbers are not equal to each other?

53
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.850
You can do that.

54
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.820
Also, the way to do that is with an exclamation equals sign.

55
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.420
OK.

56
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.380
So let's run.

57
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.140
This is six, not equal to six.

58
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.940
That is false because they are equal.

59
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.140
So now if we make one of them different and run this.

60
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.670
OK, so that would be true, three is not equal to six.

61
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.950
Now the way I'm showing you these here, you may be questioning, and rightly so.

62
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.560
This isn't all that useful to just be printing out whether or not these things are equal or not equal

63
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.760
to each other or whatever.

64
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.140
Where this is usually used is with if statements.

65
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.600
And I don't want to go too much into this right now, though, we have touched on if just a tiny, tiny

66
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.780
bit earlier, but you will learn this in a later section where we'll go all into control flow and things.

67
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.380
But yeah, so we would use an if statement typically.

68
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:25.140
And then we'd say something like if no one is greater than or equal to number two, then do some things

69
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.470
right.

70
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.800
We will revisit some of this a little bit later.

71
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.230
But since these equalities and things are part of dealing with numbers and we're in the number chapter,

72
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.270
I thought I'd go ahead and and introduce them to you now, even though they won't be of significant

73
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.870
use until we get to control flow and learn how to use the if statements and things of that sort.

74
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.830
And that's going to wrap up this short little lesson and I'll see in the next one.
