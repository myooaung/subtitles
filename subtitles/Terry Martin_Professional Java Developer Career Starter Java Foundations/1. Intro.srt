00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,170
Hey, there, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:09,660
So in this module, we are going to revisit more of the concepts around object orientation classes,

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,310
models, things of that sort.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:19,350
I did not try to teach everything that there was to learn about this topic in the original module where

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,230
we first got into it with classes and objects.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,640
There's just too much.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,160
And I thought you might want to have some fun writing, some cool little programs like the guessing

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,880
game and things of that sort, which you don't need to know these concepts to any real degree to to

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,500
do what we've done so far.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,040
But going forward, we will need to learn a bit more.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,680
And so that's what this module is for.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:52,170
The techniques you will learn in this module will really unlock a lot more of the power of object oriented

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,550
programming, for sure.

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,970
And I want to share with you the fact that I've worked with a number of Java developers over the years

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,570
who definitely know the language of Java, but they never really learned how to use the most powerful

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:14,790
aspects of Java to model concepts effectively and really just unlock all of the power that really exists

17
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,900
in Java.

18
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:23,430
And so it is my hope that by teaching you the remaining concepts in this module, you'll really have

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,620
the foundational skills you need to take your Java development skills to the next level.

20
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,360
So let's jump on in.
