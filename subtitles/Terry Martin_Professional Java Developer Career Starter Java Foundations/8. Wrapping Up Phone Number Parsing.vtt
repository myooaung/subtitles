00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:08.600
OK, so let's get ready to wrap up on this whole phone number passing, and let's implement one last

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.720
thing with the passing of this phone number that I eluded to a bit earlier, and that was the fact that

3
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.430
we might want to enable phone numbers of this format.

4
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.120
In fact, let me see, maybe I'll delete that for a moment and.

5
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.800
So in North America.

6
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.560
Well, here, actually, and I'll even do this in North America, we will often see phone numbers in

7
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.310
this format.

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.680
And if we run this right now, this is going to fail because we didn't teach it, particularly how to

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.170
pass with the parentheses there.

10
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.780
But let's go ahead and run it and see that it will fail.

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.570
OK.

12
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.120
So it just, well, it doesn't blow up, but it just doesn't match anything, right?

13
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.030
Because the whole entire string doesn't match our expression here.

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.280
So we want to expand our regex a bit so that it will accept everything that we've had thus far, but

15
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.000
also this format.

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.470
OK.

17
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.050
And so really, what we're focusing on here is just the use of the parentheses.

18
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.170
And in fact, if I remove these parentheses, this should work.

19
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.820
Yeah.

20
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.260
So we get Noel for the country code, which is appropriate because we're not specifying a country code

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.890
right now.

22
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.290
And then we get the rest of it just fine.

23
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.190
So all we have to really do here is just teach it to optionally accept those parentheses.

24
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.490
Now I'm going to make this a little bit of a challenge to you to pause the video and see if you can

25
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.950
figure out a way to do this without breaking the existing functionality.

26
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.030
So why don't you take a few moments to do that and then unpause when you think you've got it?

27
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.100
OK.

28
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.890
Hopefully, you were able to get that.

29
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.800
Now let me work out how to do it in front of you.

30
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:57.080
OK, so the part that we're interested in is the area code, which is this bit here and we want to allow

31
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.710
for this format.

32
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:09.980
Additionally, OK, so I think probably an easy way to do this would be first off, I don't want I don't

33
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:17.540
want those parentheses to be captured, so I don't want to specify anything inside of here.

34
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.060
So this is going to go outside of that.

35
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.850
So I think what I'm going to do now.

36
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.020
Oh yeah.

37
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.570
So you may have had a problem if you tried to do this because there's something that I did not explicitly

38
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.060
teach you.

39
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.860
Maybe some of you might have figured it out on your own, but as you already know, parentheses are

40
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.560
special characters in regular expressions.

41
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.720
And in this particular case, we don't want to use the parentheses as a special character.

42
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.340
We want to use it literally right as just another character.

43
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.480
So we need to tell the regular expression engine to ignore the special meaning of the of the parentheses,

44
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.530
both the opening and the closing, and instead to treat it just as text, right?

45
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.880
Just as a literal.

46
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.280
And to do that, we have to escape it like so right.

47
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.990
So to back slashes allows me to escape the use of the parentheses.

48
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.910
Now the other thing we may or may not have parentheses here, right?

49
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.780
So what do we want?

50
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.960
We probably want to say something like allow for zero or one parentheses in this location.

51
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.290
And how do we do that?

52
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.400
You remember we use the question mark, right?

53
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:44.360
So this question mark after the thing that we care about means zero zero or one of that really of of

54
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.230
all of that, but of the opening parentheses there.

55
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.740
OK.

56
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:58.410
And then we want the same thing after this as well, so this parentheses here is the closing capture

57
00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.920
group.

58
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:10.110
So we might want to do something like here's a closing parentheses and then zero or one of that.

59
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.760
Let's try this and see.

60
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.690
Hey, looks like that works.

61
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.970
Yeah, looks like it accepts it.

62
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.950
And then if we get rid of these here, let's make sure that still works.

63
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.150
OK, good.

64
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.100
And then if we have the country code with space.

65
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.610
Yeah, that's still good.

66
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.660
And a period now technically, we could probably even do this, which looks weird.

67
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.370
In fact, we could probably even do this in just pretty weird.

68
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:55.240
Yet that works to now, technically, you might not want to allow that, but I honestly think that our

69
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.630
projects is going to get pretty unwieldy, potentially.

70
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.120
I'll leave that as an exercise for you if you really, really care about those rules, because then

71
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.770
you're getting into things where you kind of want to exclude now, actually, not that it's actually

72
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.580
all that hard.

73
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:16.420
What you could do is if you wanted to say that use of the period or the opening parentheses are mutually

74
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:25.360
exclusive, then one thing you could definitely do is simply include the opening parentheses there within

75
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.480
the bracket expression, right?

76
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.700
So you're saying accept any one of these, but not multiples of that, so you could do something like

77
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.300
that.

78
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.000
But I opted to just put it here explicitly because I didn't want to think that hard right now in case

79
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.030
there may be some other repercussions to that decision.

80
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.220
But on the face of it, I think that would work just fine, at least for simple cases or relatively

81
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.120
simple cases.

82
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.480
Right?

83
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.320
OK.

84
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.490
So yeah, I think we pretty much got it there.

85
00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.270
You know, for, like I said, for a relatively simple pass at least and put this back to that format.

86
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:08.260
And so hopefully this has opened your eyes to how you can pass something out.

87
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.970
That is, yeah, a little.

88
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.050
I don't know.

89
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.320
I don't know if you consider this to be trivial or not.

90
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.560
Maybe I would call it somewhere between beginner to intermediate, perhaps.

91
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.810
But you know, with these skills that you've learned here so far, you can start to open up the world

92
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.400
of possibilities to do more things.

93
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.200
And we are going to jump into some more examples here in the subsequent lessons.

94
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.210
We're not quite done with rejects just yet.

95
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.860
All right.

96
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.100
So that's going to wrap up.

97
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.020
I think everything that we want to do with phone numbers for for the time being, and we're going to

98
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.580
move on to some other regex related topics in the next lessons, and I'll see you there.
