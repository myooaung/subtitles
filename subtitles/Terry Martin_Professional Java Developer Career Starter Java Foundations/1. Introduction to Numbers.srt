00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:08,780
OK, so in this new section, we're going to discuss mostly numbers how to work with numbers a little

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:16,340
bit more about how data and numbers in particular are stored in the actual memory of the computer.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,760
Now, don't worry, if you're not a math person, we're not going to go super super deep into all of

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,770
the theory and everything else there.

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:33,020
But I am going to pull back the covers a little bit on some of the inner workings of the computer and

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,720
how it's using these numbers and things, only to the extent that it will help to better inform what

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,490
you're doing as a as a programmer.

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:47,330
And some of your decisions as well in terms of what kinds of data types you want to use in certain circumstances.

9
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,710
So let's jump on in and see what we can do with numbers in Java.
