00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:08.430
OK, so let's jump back over to the business project now, and there's one last set of examples I want

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.550
to show, and that is just the fact that everything we just did with methods in terms of member visibility

3
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.000
also applies to fields or instance or variables within a class.

4
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.720
So let's let's take a look at that real quick.

5
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.520
So I'm going to jump back over into the person class here because I think this is kind of a good one

6
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.620
to play with sometimes.

7
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.970
All right.

8
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.190
So let's introduce a couple more fields to the person class.

9
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:49.680
And if you'll recall when you hear me refer to a field, I'm simply talking about variables that exist

10
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.540
directly under the class.

11
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.940
OK, so like this middle name here?

12
00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.440
That is a field, by the way, that also will become what is called an instance variable.

13
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.190
And that just means that when I create an actual instance of this class person or instances, we can

14
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.720
create multiple ones when we create an instance of the person class.

15
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.950
These particular variables, these fields here become unique to that instance.

16
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.190
OK, we'll talk more about that in a subsequent lesson.

17
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.510
All right.

18
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.560
So I'm going to create a couple more here.

19
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.500
We'll we'll go ahead and create some fields for the first name and we'll create one for the last name.

20
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.020
And while we're at, it might as well do the data birth thing kind of like we have done in the past.

21
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.010
Date of birth.

22
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.990
OK, now out of habit, out of a relatively good habit.

23
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.800
I have made each of these variables private.

24
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.090
But we're going to play around with different levels of visibility for these.

25
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.970
So let's start right here in the main method itself and see how we can access these fields.

26
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.350
So down here we are creating a new instance of the person class, and we're storing that reference to

27
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.990
the instance in the P one variable here.

28
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.770
So let's see if we can simply access the first name or any of these fields directly.

29
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.940
I'm going to just put my cursor here and make a new line and then do p one dot first name.

30
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:43.260
And looks like I can do that here, so I could set this to Jake right there.

31
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.690
OK, so it lets me do that.

32
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.070
Let me let me do one more p one dot last name equals Smith.

33
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.830
All right.

34
00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.720
So the reason I'm able to do this in this main method is because the main method is a member of the

35
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:11.220
class, and as I have stated, private members are always accessible to other members of the same class.

36
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.910
So there's no problem accessing any of these fields down here directly.

37
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:27.140
However, if we try accessing them from another class, like, I'll go into the news agency here and

38
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.540
let's create a method in here.

39
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.690
Access method.

40
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.200
And let's create a person.

41
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.930
OK, so again, we're creating a new instance of a person right here.

42
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.530
We're actually creating the person and then we're going to store reference to that person in this variable

43
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.700
called person.

44
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:07.140
Now, let's see what we have access to Person Dot, so here we don't see any of those variables, any

45
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.130
of those fields, first name, last names, not there.

46
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.500
The get middle initial method is here, but not the actual middle initial variable itself, just the

47
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.190
method.

48
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.060
So none of those private fields are accessible here.

49
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.740
And that makes sense, right?

50
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.400
Because comment that out for a moment and that makes sense because we're in a different class.

51
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.280
And so nothing that's private in the person class should be accessible to to this class.

52
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.840
OK.

53
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.510
So let's jump back over to the person class, and now let's change a few things here.

54
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:58.000
So let's make the last name public, like so and now let's jump back over to news agency and I will

55
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.410
uncomment this.

56
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.080
And now let's see what we have access to.

57
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.940
Well, there it is.

58
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.460
Last name shows up Smith.

59
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.920
So there you go.

60
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:18.260
If you make a member public, just like with the methods, if you make an instance variable or a field

61
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.680
public, you can access it directly from anywhere.

62
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.970
Now I'm going to stress this is probably always a terrible idea, and we'll learn more about why.

63
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.040
I think I've mentioned it a little bit before.

64
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:39.260
You want to be careful to limit the amount of access to internal data of a class from outside of that

65
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.800
class.

66
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:47.270
That sort of defeats a lot of the whole entire purposes of object oriented programming to just allow

67
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:56.150
any and every other class to be able to directly manipulate the data on a class with no guards of any

68
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.630
kind.

69
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.500
But yes, if you make a field public, you can access it just like this, and then we'll jump back over

70
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.660
to the person class again and we'll make the date of birth.

71
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.550
Protected.

72
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.760
All right.

73
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.340
And then if we jump back over to the news agency, let's see what happens here.

74
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.960
Yet we can access the date of birth.

75
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.480
Now, why is that?

76
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.860
Let me finish.

77
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:42.480
OK, and again, we're able to access the date of birth, which is protected because we are in the same

78
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.380
package.

79
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:52.080
The news agency and person are both in the default package and therefore news agency can access the

80
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.670
date of birth being protected.

81
00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:00.030
And I'm not going to go ahead and finish up the last bits because it is totally a repeat of everything

82
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.160
that you saw four methods.

83
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:09.270
So I just wanted to show that everything we can do for method visibility applies to fields as well or

84
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.670
instance variables as well.

85
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:18.120
So I think that's going to wrap up this lesson and I will see you in the next one.
