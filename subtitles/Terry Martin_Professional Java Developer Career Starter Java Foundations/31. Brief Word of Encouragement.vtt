00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.410
The last point that I want to make is I can easily imagine that a lot of you in this lesson, maybe

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.530
for many lessons, but especially for this lesson, a lot of you may still feel a little lost, perhaps.

3
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.150
Let me tell you something.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.050
If I were taking this course, even being me being a relatively intelligent person, I can definitely

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.430
imagine that I might find it a little difficult to follow someone who's going through all of these steps

6
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.740
in one setting in one video like me just sitting down and watching the lesson all the way through just

7
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.430
one lesson.

8
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.900
It might be a little hard for me to follow.

9
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.050
Now I don't know about you.

10
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.000
Different people learn in different ways.

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.340
But for this lesson to be most effective for a person like me, I would probably need to maybe watch

12
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.350
it first one time through.

13
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.000
And there's a good chance.

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.540
There's a lot that I'm not going to quite catch, then I might need to put that lesson aside, put that

15
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.470
video aside and then go, try to implement everything here without cheating, without going and looking

16
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.110
at the lesson and just see if I can make sense of the concepts on my own.

17
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.250
And I would probably get stuck in a few places and then it would be most beneficial for me at that moment.

18
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.580
When I get stuck a little bit here and there to go back to the video and then try to get myself unstuck

19
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:34.050
by seeing OK, because then you will have a better appreciation and context for why I did the things

20
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.720
that I did and what I was meaning when I was saying various things, just watching this whole entire

21
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.320
lesson in one setting and expecting to understand all of it may not be realistic for everybody.

22
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.570
It probably wouldn't be realistic for me.

23
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.200
And I also want to share with you that I myself have bought numerous courses on Udemy from other developers,

24
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.610
not for Java, but for other languages and other technologies and things.

25
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.910
And I, myself, a seasoned veteran software developer, have run into that same situation where I'm

26
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.010
watching a lesson and the person's doing all kinds of things all over the place.

27
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.140
And it's a little bewildering.

28
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.520
And really, in a lot of cases, the best way that you're going to get past that is to just jump in

29
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.140
with both feet and try to duplicate what you're seeing the instructor do on your own and then get stuck

30
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.770
and scratch your head and try to understand why yours doesn't work and then go back and then rewatch

31
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.090
at least parts of their lesson to see what did they do differently?

32
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.200
And where did you go wrong or what were you not understanding or something like that?

33
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.270
That's where you'll get the most benefit.

34
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.540
So I really want to strongly encourage you not to be discouraged if you just watched this lesson and

35
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.320
you're like, Man, I don't I don't understand all of what he just did there.

36
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.640
There's a lot of stuff there.

37
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.880
Even as I was teaching it, I was a little concerned about all of the places where I was extracting

38
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.860
methods and introducing new parameters.

39
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.220
I can imagine that some of you may have gotten a little confused by why I did a lot of that stuff.

40
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.120
And so again, if you try to implement this yourself and you just hold fast to a couple of basic principles

41
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.910
such as you don't want duplicated code or you want to minimize the amount of code that you're duplicating,

42
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.880
you will eventually arrive at the same conclusions that I arrived at, which is that OK, if I don't

43
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.430
want a duplicate code and I want to reuse code, I'm going to be forced to introduce some parameters.

44
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.150
I'm going to be forced to extract some methods, things of that sort.

45
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.370
They will become more logical to you if you just try these things on your own.

46
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.490
OK, so that's just a little word of encouragement for anybody who feels a little discouraged from this

47
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.290
lesson or any of the other lessons previously or of my next lessons, right?

48
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.920
I feel like in this database module, I'm probably really ramping up some of the intensity.

49
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.490
I've introduced a number of new techniques, as well as just piling in a lot of the previous techniques

50
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.320
that we've learned because this is where we can start to really use them in a more realistic way.

51
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.800
All right.

52
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.600
So that's enough said on that.

53
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.920
I'll see you in the next one.
