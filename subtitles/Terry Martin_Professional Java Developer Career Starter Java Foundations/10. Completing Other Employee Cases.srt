1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:00,880
All right.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,470
So let's pick back up where we left off.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:15,780
So we had just finished implementing a little bit of logic to pass the details field of a programmer.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:23,190
And now let's go ahead and finish up by passing the details field of the manager, analyst and CEO,

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,550
which will be easy because the Rig X will pretty much be the same.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,880
The only difference will be the number of subfields within the detailed field and then the names of

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,750
those fields.

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,560
So down here is where we created the programmer.

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,400
So let's create one now for the manager.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,240
OK, so I think we can even just start off by copying the programmer bits.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,610
Come down here.

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,690
Do this.

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:01:02,340
Let's rename this to Manager Rig X and Manager Pattern, and then we'll just change this pattern here.

14
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,180
Let's see.

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,370
So the fields are org size and direct reports.

16
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:07,980
D.R.

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,480
All right.

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,860
So.

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:11,750
Org.

20
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,340
Is that how I called it?

21
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,770
Org org size and D.R..

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,180
And then we can get rid of everything else.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,850
Like so.

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,760
Let me make sure I got that right.

25
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:39,040
Words equals org size, comma words equals direct reports.

26
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,370
Yep.

27
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,490
Oh, by the way, now when I was troubleshooting what my issue was earlier when this programmer regex

28
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,330
wasn't working.

29
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:52,120
You may recall I put in a number of additional things just to make sure that it wasn't an issue like

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,910
the equals sign had some special meaning or whatever.

31
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,750
I'm pretty sure I we don't really need these escaped things here.

32
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,250
And in fact, you know, I will.

33
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,980
I'll take them out here and confirm that.

34
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,230
So, yeah, we'll get rid of these.

35
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,230
I think that's it.

36
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,890
And then if this works, then I'll come back and clean this one up as well.

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:17,870
All right.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,750
And then in the case of the manager will do similar things as what we did for programmers.

39
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,160
So let's see here.

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,130
We extracted out the details.

41
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,580
We can just duplicate that line and bring it down to the manager.

42
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,330
And then we created our matchers, who will do that matter?

43
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:56,010
This is the manager matcher equals manager pattern matcher and then we'll match on details.

44
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,730
And then we'll test if we have a match.

45
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:13,120
So if manager, match or find, then we'll do some stuff, so we'll set up a variable to grab the salary.

46
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,350
Salary equals zero.

47
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,270
And then inside of here, let's see now what are these?

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,730
These values are all numeric and they are all integers.

49
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:36,480
So we can we can use the integer wrapper again, integer dot pass and see manager Matt.

50
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,260
Sure.

51
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,730
Dot Group.

52
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,510
And I've already forgotten the names of the fields.

53
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,750
Org size and direct reports.

54
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,210
Org size.

55
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,180
And I guess I can just duplicate this.

56
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:04,960
Direct reports, I'm writing it out, spelling it out, and then we'll just call that dear.

57
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,670
All right.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,590
So now we'll have that data.

59
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,190
And for now, I think we'll just do the same basic math.

60
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,870
Let's see.

61
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:25,630
Salary equals 3500 plus or size times.

62
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,230
Direct reports.

63
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,810
And again, this is just, you know, some random formula, I'm just making this up something simple,

64
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,290
it could it could be way more complex than this.

65
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:46,830
If we wanted to wanted it to be right, the square root of something times whatever it could be anything.

66
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,270
All right.

67
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,330
And then we'll set up our else block.

68
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,150
Else salary equals just 3500 on its own.

69
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,500
And then we will yield salary.

70
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,840
And let's comment out this system that out here, and let's run this, see what we've got now.

71
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,860
Wow, that really blew up into a larger number, didn't it?

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,350
And we're not even done yet, so seven million.

73
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,280
OK, that makes sense, though, because we're doing a lot of multiplication.

74
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,350
And then let's set up the Reg X for the analyst, right?

75
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,450
So, again, copy.

76
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,480
Paste.

77
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,680
Analyst.

78
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,210
And last.

79
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,640
And then the fields here, there's only one and it's project count, so I will just put it right here.

80
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:03,260
Project count and then I will get rid of all of that because that's the part with the comma and there

81
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,700
is no comma here.

82
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,290
Oh my bad.

83
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:14,120
I forgot to update where these what the pattern was supposed to be compiling the pattern here.

84
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,260
The manager pattern should be compiling.

85
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,510
The manager rejects my bad.

86
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:21,730
Yeah.

87
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,650
See how easy it is to make little dumb mistakes like this.

88
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:31,750
And then the yeah, we want this rejects here.

89
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,910
Some of you probably saw that and were yelling at your screen.

90
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,160
All right.

91
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,090
Out of curiosity, let me run that again and see what the number will change to.

92
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,370
Hmm.

93
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,950
Not much, not different or not much different, I don't remember it was seven million something before.

94
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,390
Well, whatever.

95
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,600
And I'm going to get rid of that.

96
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,770
All right.

97
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,990
And same as before, I will copy this line.

98
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,900
Paste it right there.

99
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,990
Then create a new, mature, mature analyst.

100
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,950
Matt Equals Analyst.

101
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,870
Pat Matcher.

102
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,950
Details.

103
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:22,750
Then.

104
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,250
Set up our variable here, then.

105
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:36,970
If analyst matcher, find if it finds anything, then we will do some stuff here.

106
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,950
So we will.

107
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,520
Let's see.

108
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,660
I mean, double check.

109
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,230
I think the data here is also numerical, right?

110
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,330
This is the analyst.

111
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:46,680
Yep.

112
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,250
So integer pass and

113
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:07,900
analyst matcher Dot Group and the name of the field was project count, I think.

114
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,860
Project count.

115
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,820
Project count.

116
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:25,850
Then capture that into a variable called Project Count, and then we will do some formula here, salary

117
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,040
equals.

118
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,250
Let's see, what do we want to do here?

119
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:42,610
It was based off of 2500, 25 000 plus just do something like project count times to maybe project count

120
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,750
times two.

121
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,980
All right.

122
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,900
Else?

123
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,010
Salary equals 2500.

124
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,840
And then just return the salary.

125
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,250
All right.

126
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,260
And then the last one is the CEO.

127
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,690
All right, let's set that up.

128
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,090
This time, I'll use the.

129
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,060
Little trick here of multiple cursors, so I can.

130
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:27,540
Take care of this all at once, c e o, and then I'll grab that name that rejects there and put it here.

131
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,590
All right.

132
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,390
And now we'll set up this last block new line.

133
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,920
Copy this again, paste it right there.

134
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,050
Create a new matter.

135
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,680
CEO Matt Equal, CEO Pat Matcher details.

136
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,690
Set up our salary variable.

137
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:06,470
If CEO matcher Dot find then.

138
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,180
Let's pass out.

139
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,280
Integer percent.

140
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,940
CEO matcher Scott Group.

141
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,470
And the group name there was a project.

142
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,890
No.

143
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,910
Average stock price, so I forgot to update that, didn't I?

144
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,110
Average stock price.

145
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,310
Make sure I was updating this, so the analyzer has a project account.

146
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,570
The manager has organized and direct reports that were good.

147
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,380
OK.

148
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,060
Average stock price for the CEO.

149
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,400
A veggie stock price, is that how I wrote it?

150
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,350
A big stock price, yes.

151
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,730
And capture that.

152
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,870
There we go.

153
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,720
Salary equals 5000.

154
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:28,230
And for this, let's do Time's average stock price otherwise.

155
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:38,420
Salary equals just the base 5000 and then yield the salary.

156
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,800
All right.

157
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,510
Let's run all of this.

158
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,800
Eight million.

159
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:50,890
Now, let's let's print out, let's print a little output here just to kind of double check that this

160
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,330
is actually correct.

161
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,230
Let's see.

162
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:01,300
So what we can do is maybe we'll just print out the salary and a formatted way.

163
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,920
Percent Skogland percent this.

164
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:13,640
In the first person, deaths will be, oh, let's see, I guess, their name.

165
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,140
People matter, not group.

166
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,350
Last name.

167
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,660
All right, so hold on, maybe then.

168
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,170
Last name, comma, first name.

169
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,430
First name, and let's I guess let's extract these two, so it's a little easier to read.

170
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,290
Turn that into a.

171
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,540
String do the same thing for this one here.

172
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,430
First name.

173
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,200
And.

174
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,310
Duplicate that line and then this bit here, will you actually I guess that's all.

175
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:08,900
And then the last bit will be the salary, and let's let's format that salary.

176
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,180
Let's see if we can do this all in one.

177
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,440
I don't know if it's going to look too messy or not, but let's see.

178
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,640
So we'll use a number formatter.

179
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:24,230
Does it get currency instance dot format?

180
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,790
Salary.

181
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,200
Yeah, it fits.

182
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,070
All right, then we're going to grab all of this.

183
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:44,840
And duplicate that in in each of these cases.

184
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:50,870
Now the reason we kind of need to do it this way, I'd prefer to do it one time in this whole entire

185
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,550
block of code here.

186
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:59,860
But the salary is unique to each case, and I want that all printed on one line.

187
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,670
And so for right now, without me thinking about it too deeply, I think we need to do it this way.

188
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,490
Now I can think of some smarter things to do that we might actually do later.

189
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,250
Well, there's lots of smarter things we can do.

190
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:19,340
In fact, just so you know, I'm intentionally doing this semi painful, long, protracted implementation

191
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:25,080
so that you can have a better appreciation for some of the alternative ways that we could do this.

192
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,850
OK, so I'm doing it in this way on purpose, and I will point out a few facts about the way that that

193
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,300
this is being done, in fact.

194
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:32,870
All right.

195
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,340
So there's that.

196
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:40,640
So we'll just pop that code right above every place where we yield the salary, I guess.

197
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,050
So here.

198
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,820
And here.

199
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,460
All right, let's run that and see if we get some, some output here.

200
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,950
I forgot to forgot to put new lines in.

201
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,650
Here will do it all in one.

202
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,290
So cursor there.

203
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,580
Cursor here.

204
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,300
Cursor here.

205
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:19,870
And cursor here, and then we'll do percent in in all of those places all at once.

206
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:27,110
All right, see what I did there, I just put the percent in in all of these spots all at once with

207
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,030
an option shift and then a click to put the cursor in all those places at once.

208
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,580
All right, and then we'll rerun this control.

209
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,330
Shift our.

210
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,580
All right.

211
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,900
Let's see what we've got here, Fred Flintstone.

212
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,460
2.8 mil, one point eight.

213
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,340
So that's almost three, that's almost two, that's five, six seven.

214
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,370
Seven point five.

215
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:56,630
Hmm.

216
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,590
Yeah, okay, I guess this number is correct.

217
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,810
That was the main reason that I wanted to point these out.

218
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:06,390
I was trying to gauge whether or not the salaries made sense.

219
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,980
But yeah, I see it now.

220
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:15,660
It's because Programmer had three three detail properties and I'm multiplying those by each other.

221
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,980
And so that makes this number quite a bit larger.

222
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:26,970
And then these other roles, I think all only had two details, right?

223
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,140
So I'm talking about.

224
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:35,870
Here, just two numbers, although that's not a small number, but I guess that ends up being 3000 vs.

225
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,620
oh yeah, here we are.

226
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:36,890
Yeah.

227
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,850
These numbers are all in the thousands generally to begin with.

228
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,340
Times 10 times numbers in the 100.

229
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,930
So that's why those values those.

230
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,550
Yeah, that's why these these amounts get pretty big, pretty quickly.

231
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:51,890
Yeah.

232
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,800
OK, so that number makes sense to me.

233
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,580
That's all.

234
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,330
I just wanted to double check if that number actually was making sense.

235
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,200
I think it does.

236
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:00,950
All right.

237
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,340
So I'm going to assume that this is all correct.

238
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,850
Let's see here now what can we say about this implementation?

239
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,920
So yeah, let's let's look at this now.

240
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:17,960
So I have no doubt that some of you, some of you will be looking at this and are struggling to understand

241
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,370
what's going on here.

242
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,590
And that's partially the point.

243
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,910
Now some of you may be right there with me, but it'll be kind of hit or miss.

244
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,260
So let me tell you my own sense of looking at this and working on it.

245
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,250
It's getting to be kind of scary looking for me.

246
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,200
I don't typically write code like this.

247
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,120
This is not my natural way of writing code.

248
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,530
And what do I mean by that?

249
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,320
Well, let's see here.

250
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,740
So we've got one.

251
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,830
For me, this is one monster method.

252
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,430
OK.

253
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,290
It's one.

254
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,110
It's a whole entire program implemented in one method.

255
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:01,130
I haven't coded this way since I was a young kid who didn't know how to code better than this.

256
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,260
I don't normally code this way anymore, but I'm intentionally doing it for you.

257
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:14,330
Now I want to point out something I know lots and lots and lots and lots of programmers who probably

258
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,840
don't really see anything wrong with this code as long as it works.

259
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,970
They think they're done.

260
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:25,550
And let me tell you, just getting the code to work doesn't really mean you're done.

261
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,400
Maybe it's a start, but you're not really done.

262
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,850
So the problem with writing code like this?

263
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,120
First off, this is completely procedural.

264
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:42,740
OK, Java is an object oriented language, which simply means that it lends itself towards somewhat

265
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,110
easily writing object oriented code.

266
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:51,020
It does not mean that all of your code that you write in Java is truly object oriented.

267
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,320
This code here is not object oriented at all.

268
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:01,820
You could have written equivalent code like this or very similar to this in any procedural language,

269
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,310
such as the language of C, which was invented in like 1970 or something, right?

270
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,920
This is very procedural code.

271
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:15,350
Furthermore, there are lots of duplicated blocks within here.

272
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:23,420
I mean, the fact that I was able to copy and paste bits and pieces all over the place is a strong indication

273
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,360
that there's a lot of duplication there.

274
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,840
OK.

275
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:35,780
So we're not taking advantage of hardly any of the benefits of Java's object oriented capabilities with

276
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,720
this implementation and just looking at it.

277
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,600
And in even while I was working on it, it started to get really easy for me to lose track of what I

278
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,160
was doing and where I was.

279
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:53,780
So I kind of, you know, stuck with this approach on purpose, and I kind of wanted you to feel the

280
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,550
pain of me hunting and looking out, OK, where am I now?

281
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:05,090
Because that's what it feels like to write overly procedural code that isn't very good.

282
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:11,060
And by the way, notice I said overly procedural code that isn't very good, which means, I mean,

283
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:18,410
it is possible to write good procedural code, but very few developers that I've ever known who who

284
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:24,950
tend to write procedural code, write good procedural code and by good, I mean code, that's relatively

285
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,090
easy to maintain.

286
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:33,260
Let me also state that if you are a if you are relatively new to programming, as I assume the majority

287
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:41,180
of you who are taking this course will be, you may have the misconception that writing complicated

288
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,690
looking code and perhaps this looks somewhat complex to you.

289
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,050
It's, you know, it's not it's not fun for me to look at.

290
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:53,780
I can tell you that, you know, I'm having to use a little bit more brainpower than I'd like to now

291
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,750
on the scale of complexity of code that I've worked on.

292
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,560
This isn't at the top of my list for sure.

293
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,650
I've worked on way harder stuff than this, but particularly for what it's doing, which is something

294
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:12,770
relatively simple, which is just basically applying some dumb, you know, formula to these numbers,

295
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,730
parsing them out and then just adding up some values, right?

296
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:22,640
It's unfortunately more complex than I would like it to be.

297
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:28,390
So anyway, my point was going to be, I think there are a lot of particularly novel.

298
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:37,590
Or new programmers who may write code like this and like their code to be this way because it makes

299
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:43,500
them feel smart as if they've done something intelligent by writing this type of code.

300
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:49,960
Let me tell you something right here and right now you're not all that smart to write this, OK?

301
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,470
This is a bit of a mess.

302
00:21:52,830 --> 00:22:01,020
The smartest programmers that I have worked with could take this and make it look so simple that no

303
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,820
one would be impressed by it at all.

304
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:09,210
It would look really obvious in terms of, Oh yeah, obviously, you know, you wrote the code to to

305
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,180
be very simple such that anyone can understand it.

306
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:21,330
But the the irony here is that taking something like this and rewriting it to be really, really trivial

307
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:27,060
looking and very, very simple oftentimes is actually quite difficult to do.

308
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,800
OK?

309
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,820
The easiest thing a programmer can do is make a big mess like this.

310
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,190
OK?

311
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:40,440
Because think about it to make a big mess like this, you don't have to put a lot of forethought into

312
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:40,530
it.

313
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:46,260
You just start kind of writing code stream of consciousness until you get it to do whatever it is that

314
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,120
you were setting out to do.

315
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,440
And as soon as it does that bare minimum thing, then you just kind of stop right there.

316
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,130
OK.

317
00:22:53,370 --> 00:23:01,470
So I think that's the main thing that I want to convey with this approach is that this isn't great at

318
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:01,800
all.

319
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,240
This should not be what you're aiming for.

320
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,740
OK.

321
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,340
You should be striving to do way, way better than this.

322
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:14,160
Now, within a procedural approach, there are some things that I could have done to be better, such

323
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,800
as I could have extracted this block here, which is duplicated.

324
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,170
What is it?

325
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,660
Four times or so I could have extracted a method out of that and then just had one line, which is the

326
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,980
call to that method.

327
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,960
And in that method, we'd just be passing in the salary and everything else.

328
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,910
Well, we'd be passing in the salary.

329
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:40,290
And I don't know, maybe the the match or the people match or I guess, just passing in maybe two inputs.

330
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,050
And then it would print this stuff out, and that would have made this code a little better.

331
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,980
And there might be other opportunities to extract methods out.

332
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,670
If I did, if I took the time to do a little more analysis here.

333
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,600
And that's one thing.

334
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:00,720
Like a lot of programmers who naturally write code like lists, they don't take the time to really think

335
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,910
it through and analyze.

336
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,450
OK.

337
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,030
So in the next few lessons, that's what we're going to be doing now.

338
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:16,410
We're going to be kind of analyzing this and trying out a number of different approaches to improve

339
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,020
this code using more of Java's object oriented capabilities.

340
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:22,500
OK.

341
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,060
All right.

342
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,880
So yeah, let's let's jump into that in the next lesson.
