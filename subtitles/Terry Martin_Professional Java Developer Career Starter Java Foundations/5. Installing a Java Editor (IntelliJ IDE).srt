1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,870
Welcome.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:08,760
So in this lesson, we're going to download and install an I.D. I.D. stands for integrated development

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,630
environment.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,590
And you can basically think of it as a word processor for programming.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,730
The idea we will be using is called intelligence by a company called Jet Brains, and we'll be using

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,220
their free version of this idea, which is a very capable ADC.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,040
So without further ado, let's go grab it now.

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:29,730
All right.

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:36,300
So first up, let's go install the latest version of intelligent idea from the company called Jet Brains.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,860
So to do this, I'm going to simply Google in any browser.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,670
I'm using Safari.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,800
But if you're using Chrome, that's fine too.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,480
You just want to go to Google and we're going to search for download intelligence.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,830
And the very first link that I see here says download intelligence idea, so that's what I want.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,310
Now I happen to be on Mac OS at that at the moment.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,840
And so I'm going to make sure that I have macOS selected.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,600
But if you're in Windows or Linux, you can choose accordingly.

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,840
And the version of Intel is that I will officially be teaching from is the Community Edition because

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,180
it's completely free and super capable.

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,450
The Ultimate Edition will only work for you without paying for it for, I think, 30 days and then you'll

21
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,100
have to pay or something like that.

22
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,810
Now, when I started recording this course, Java version 16 was the current version.

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,570
But since that time, version 17 has come out and I have now subtly been updating my course in a few

24
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,720
minor places to teach the very, very few updates that are pertinent for us in Java 17.

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,410
However, in order to ensure that some of my lessons that I was teaching with Version 16 continue to

26
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,730
work for you.

27
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:02,550
With version 17, you will need to download a version of the I.D. that has better support for version

28
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:08,880
17, specifically better support for one of the build tools that a few of my lessons will utilize,

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,260
which is called Gradle.

30
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,830
So on this screen here, normally we'd just be clicking on either of these and starting a download.

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,270
However, we want to make sure that we're getting a version of the ADC that has completely full support

32
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,710
for version 17.

33
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,140
Specifically around Gradle.

34
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,200
So looking over here, we see that this is version 2021. 2.3, and now that's what I'm getting at the

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,430
time of this recording.

36
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,500
What we really want is 2021. three or higher.

37
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,190
OK.

38
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,400
So if at the time that you're watching this recording and you come out here and follow these instructions

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,670
and you're still seeing something less than 2021. three such as that too, like I have here, you're

40
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,920
going to want to follow what I'm saying next.

41
00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:00,270
If you do have 2021 three or higher, you can go ahead and just choose your operating system and then

42
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,660
the community version of Vidi.

43
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,380
And if you're on Mac OS and you're on an Intel Mac, then you choose this.

44
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,440
Otherwise, you can click on this and choose Apple Silicon.

45
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,680
If you happen to be looking at this, though, and you're on something lower than 2021. three, then

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,570
you're going to want to come up here and click on coming in 2021. three.

47
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,330
Click on that link and you can download their early access version of 2021.

48
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,140
Three.

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,650
All right.

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:35,010
So again, just choose your operating system and then you're going to download the community version.

51
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,830
And again, I'm on a Apple Silicon Mac, so I'm going to choose that.

52
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:46,320
But if you're on Intel, Mac or Windows, you will just choose Windows or Linux.

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,250
Some choosing that and then that's going to start to download.

54
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,330
All right, and so that's done.

55
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,810
And so now I can go ahead and start the installer and hopefully you know how to start an install installation

56
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,140
of downloaded applications for your given operating system.

57
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,720
So I'm going to do it this way.

58
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:12,490
And then I'm just going to drag this on to my applications folder here.

59
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:18,220
And yes, I do want to replace in my case because I already have a previous version installed.

60
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,420
So I'm going to replace the one that I currently have.

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,100
All right.

62
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:30,190
And then I can launch it, so I will open up my spotlight search here.

63
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,970
Or you can.

64
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,250
However, you normally find applications that you've installed into the applications folder via the

65
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,620
Finder or File Explorer if you're on Windows or the Start menu and start typing whatever you do.

66
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,280
All right.

67
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,670
So I've just opened up the applications folder by actually just double clicking on this icon and I.

68
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,150
And my operating system is just asking me if I'm okay with opening something up that I downloaded from

69
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,950
the internet, which yes, I am.

70
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,980
There we go.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,120
And so now I can see that I'm running twenty twenty one point three and I can double check that up here

72
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,000
with the about intelligibly dialogue.

73
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,790
Yeah.

74
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,270
Idea twenty twenty one point three release candidate.

75
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,520
That's what the RC stands for, which means that it's almost basically done.

76
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,920
They're just putting it through its final paces.

77
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:29,230
And when they finalize the release, by the way, we should be able to just update this to the final

78
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,950
release.

79
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,440
All right, so that is good.

80
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,260
All right.

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,730
And so now we have the latest, greatest version of Intel is installed and it's ready to work well with

82
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,830
version 17 of the JDK.

83
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,090
See in the next one.
