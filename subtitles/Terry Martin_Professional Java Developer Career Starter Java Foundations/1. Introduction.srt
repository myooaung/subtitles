1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,970
Guess what, you have finally reached the final section of this course.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,670
Congratulations, if you've made it this far.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,810
We're almost done now.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,680
I think this section will likely be the most fun for the majority of you because we will finally be

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:24,540
building a full application with a proper graphical user interface, and that'll be a web application

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,930
that we will be building in this entire section.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:36,120
OK, so we'll be using what is arguably the most popular framework for doing this type of work, which

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,130
is called the spring framework.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,160
So in this intro, I just want to let you know a little bit about the spring framework and let you know

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,750
a little more about what we're going to be building and how we will be using it and what to expect.

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:57,150
So the spring framework is the most popular framework used by Java developers, especially in the enterprise

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,380
space and enterprise really just means large corporation, for the most part.

13
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:09,390
So it is the most popular add on framework for enterprise java development when it comes to building

14
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,330
web applications, web services, microservices and applications of that sort.

15
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,960
And I would say the reason that it has become so popular is because it's been around nearly 20 years.

16
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:29,400
As of the time of this recording, it was first released back in 2002, and it's been going strong ever

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,030
since.

18
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,740
And it made it significantly easier to write so-called enterprise level applications than any of the

19
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,170
technologies that existed before then.

20
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,950
And it's done a great job of keeping enterprise Java development relatively easy ever since.

21
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,450
Now there was at least one major competitor that existed.

22
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,920
I consider it a competitor, at least that existed before the spring framework came out, and there

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,380
have been some that have come out since then.

24
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,960
But the spring framework has definitely become the de facto standard among corporations, at least in

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,990
the U.S. I have not worked as a Java developer in other parts of the world, but I'm guessing it's pretty

26
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,230
much the standard everywhere for corporate enterprise development.

27
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,350
So let's talk a little bit more about what is it, actually?

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,470
So the spring framework is a collection of sub projects.

29
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:20,880
OK.

30
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,790
And I'm actually on the spring frameworks website right here, which is spring that i o.

31
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,480
That's how you can get to a spring that i o.

32
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,210
OK.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,240
And so right here on the main page, you can even get a sense of what you can use the spring framework

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:44,430
for microservices, reactive applications, cloud applications, web apps and a lot of other things

35
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,760
too.

36
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,240
OK.

37
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,370
So then we can even dig into some of the projects here, and you can see a few of the main ones Spring

38
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,920
Boot Framework, Cloud, et etc. And then there's even more if I click on this and you can scroll through

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,400
here.

40
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,940
There are plenty that are actively in development right now.

41
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,770
And then even more that may not actively be under development at this time.

42
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,570
So it's a very productive framework where they're really creating a lot of functionality.

43
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,700
So let me just tell you a little bit about a few of these modules, especially the ones that we're going

44
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,770
to be using primarily in this section.

45
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,820
OK, we'll be using spring boot.

46
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,530
I will explain a little bit more about that later.

47
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,280
When we start getting into it will be using obviously the core spring framework.

48
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,580
So I would say this represents kind of the original thing that the spring framework was, and that's

49
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,740
why it still gets the name spring framework.

50
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,900
And then a lot of these other sub projects kind of sprung out of the spring framework.

51
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,900
And so they kind of formalized them into their own projects.

52
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,770
But this one right here was pretty much the original thing that was called the spring framework.

53
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,270
It will be a little difficult for me to explain much of what it does without showing you.

54
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,500
So I'm going to hold off on that for right now.

55
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,920
Spring data is a great one, though, so in our last section, we spent the entire section learning

56
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,130
how to write Java code that interacts with a database using the JBC framework.

57
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:15,870
So spring data is a framework that makes it way easier than what we did in the last section to write

58
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:21,320
code that works with a lot of different kinds of databases and database technology.

59
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:31,410
So in the last section, we used JTBC to work with one particular database, which is H2 and H2 is a

60
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,950
relational database.

61
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,420
OK.

62
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:40,080
But there are other types of databases besides relational databases, and the spring data framework

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,460
can enable us to interact with lots of different kinds besides just relational or object databases.

64
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:54,690
You can interact with pretty much all of the most popular types of databases there are and write very,

65
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,620
very little code in many cases to have a lot of functionality.

66
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,640
So the spring?

67
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:05,180
ADA Project is kind of magical, in my opinion, it just does amazing things.

68
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:13,040
But what we did in that last section on GDC and databases will give you deeper insight into some of

69
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,960
the magic that's happening with spring data.

70
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,460
OK.

71
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,580
And then if we dig in to the spring framework itself, we will see that one of the breakout projects

72
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,910
or sub projects of the spring framework is spring in the sea, and we will be making heavy use of this

73
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,360
framework.

74
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,530
So Spring in the Sea is the sub framework for building both web applications and web services.

75
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,230
So one way of thinking of a web application is basically it's a type of website, but it's frequently

76
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,550
one that is intended to be more interactive, like in both directions.

77
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:53,570
So if you think of a website like CNN or a web news website and you're mostly just consuming content

78
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,770
from the website and you don't do a whole lot of interacting with it.

79
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,860
But in many web applications, maybe not all, but in many of them, you may be doing various forms

80
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,780
of entering lots of data and consuming lots of data back out of that website.

81
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,080
And when we make websites of that type, especially when they're purpose built within a corporation

82
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,700
or something like that, they're usually referred to as web applications.

83
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:26,510
A few examples that most people might be familiar with would be Google Docs, where they've implemented

84
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,080
basically competing applications to Microsoft Office.

85
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:37,490
So you've got the ability to make spreadsheets and type documents and Duke slide deck presentations,

86
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,600
those kinds of things.

87
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,630
And then even Microsoft has their own Microsoft Office implementation in the web as well.

88
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,990
So those are fully functional web applications on steroids.

89
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:55,640
Now, usually, most of the typical types of web applications that you'll be building in the Java enterprise

90
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:02,720
space won't be nearly as advanced as Microsoft Office running in a browser, but it could be.

91
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,350
But my point here is that those are applications where you're very much interacting and creating content

92
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,230
within the browser rather than just consuming it.

93
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,540
So if I had to summarize what the spring framework really is, I would just say it's a collection of

94
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:24,830
APIs, frameworks, projects that make it easier to develop enterprise applications in Java.

95
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:31,700
Now let me also remind you this section is only meant to be an introduction to the spring framework.

96
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,730
The spring framework is massive, like truly.

97
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:40,700
I mean, you can see right here there are many, many modules of the spring framework, and there are

98
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:47,510
many, many books that focus just on one of these modules, okay, let alone the whole entire thing.

99
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:54,380
So we won't be going really, really deeply into all of the aspects of this of the spring framework.

100
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,930
I will offer additional courses in the future that will go into those topics in more depth.

101
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,920
My purpose in this section is to primarily accomplish two things.

102
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,220
First off, I want you to be able to get a sense for how we can put a lot of what you've learned throughout

103
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,940
this course all together to build something more realistic.

104
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:14,510
OK?

105
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,300
And there's nothing like building a fully functional web application where you can actually interact

106
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,170
and see things visually instead of having to work on the command line.

107
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,760
Secondly, I want to cover some of the most common use cases that a lot of enterprise Java developers

108
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,330
will encounter when making basic web applications.

109
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:42,200
Just as we implemented a crud application in the last section, from the databases perspective in this

110
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,110
section will be creating an even more fully functional crud application in the web browser.

111
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,590
OK.

112
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:55,250
And we will cover enough common cases that many of you will be able to take what we are going to learn

113
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:01,880
in this section and kind of treat the techniques in the code that will be implementing here as a template

114
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,330
for how to make basic crud applications.

115
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,150
So we will be solving a number of problems that you are very, very likely to encounter as a professional

116
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,420
developer without you having to learn the entire spring framework.

117
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,740
So even if you don't go any further with me, with any of my future courses, you will leave this course

118
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:28,190
with an incredibly practical set of skills that will enable you to be able to build useful applications

119
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,120
immediately.

120
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,460
All right.

121
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,880
So without further ado, let's get started.
