00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,420
All right, in this lesson, I'm going to show you how to install the latest version of Java on a Windows

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:06,990
machine.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,610
The latest version as of this recording is Java version 17.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:20,970
So in any web browser, I like to start with Google and what we will do is we'll just Google for install

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,270
Java 17.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:36,710
And from here, we can go down here to this Java C17 archive downloads, so I'm going to click on that

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,970
and then scroll up.

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,430
And as you can see here, there are downloads for installing Java 17 on various operating systems,

9
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,860
from Linux to Mac to Windows.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:54,200
This video will be for Windows, and the particular one that we're going to go for is the Windows x64

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,280
installer.

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,850
OK.

13
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:02,060
And the reason for that is because this other one up here, the compressed archive, doesn't give us

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:07,760
a nice, easy to use installer, so that may be a little bit more problematic for some people to figure

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,030
out.

16
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,590
I think probably the easiest thing to use, though, is this installer here.

17
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,920
So just make sure you're clicking on Windows x64 installer and what you're actually going to click on.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,290
Sorry, is this link over here on the right?

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,160
So I'm going to click on that, and that started the download, and it's coming down pretty quickly.

20
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,460
All right, there we go, and it's done, and now I can go ahead and click to open the file and it's

21
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,860
asking me, do I verify?

22
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,740
So I'm going to click, Yes.

23
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,720
And that should launch the actual install program.

24
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,220
All right.

25
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:57,700
And so when that's done, installing it may not be super obvious, it will just stop doing things.

26
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,420
So now we can test to see or verify whether or not it's been properly installed, and my preferred way

27
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,670
to do this is at the command line.

28
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:15,370
So what we can do is go down to the little windows start button there, and I like to type in a command

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,140
as in command prompt.

30
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:23,260
And you can see here there's an app for that command prompt and I will click on that that opens up the

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,460
command line.

32
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:32,530
It's kind of like the old school dos command line, and if Java installed properly, we will be able

33
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,480
to issue a command with it.

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,100
And so the command we can type out is Java all lowercase space.

35
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,990
Dash Dash like two minus signs version.

36
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,710
Enter.

37
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,440
And as you can see here, it says Java, seventeen point zero point one.

38
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:01,360
And so that is confirming that we have indeed successfully installed Java version 17 on this computer.

39
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,130
And that's the end of this lesson.
