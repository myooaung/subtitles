00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.320
All right, so the first thing we're going to need to do is to install a Java.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.330
So to do that will open up a browser and we'll just search for install.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.650
JDK JDK stands for the Java development kit and that is the name of the Java development system that

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.430
we would need.

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.340
So I'm just going to go to my browser here and I'm going to type in install JDK.

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.990
And as of the time of this recording, the most recent version is 17.

7
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.840
All right.

8
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.350
So let's see installation of the JDK on Microsoft Windows.

9
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.490
Now I happen to be right now installing this on Mac.

10
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.700
If you're on Windows, go check out my video for how to install on Windows, although most of the steps

11
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.840
are fairly identical.

12
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.080
All right, so I'm going to select Java downloads from Oracle here.

13
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.030
All right.

14
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.650
And Java 17 available now, and so I'm going to choose my operating system, which is Mac OS right there

15
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.240
and then.

16
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:16.460
I need to choose the version for my processor now I happen to be on an M1 Mac, which uses an ARM 64

17
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.520
processor for Mac OS.

18
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.220
There are both ARM versions or M1 versions of Macs, as well as Intel processors.

19
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.510
So if you happen to be on an Intel processor, that's the one you'll want to take.

20
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.010
And I'm going to go for the DMG installer because that's a nice, easy to use install program rather

21
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.250
than having to decompress some image or something.

22
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.140
So I'm going to go for the ARM 64 DMG installer and I'm going to click on that.

23
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.450
So if you're on Intel, you'll want to use the x64 DMG installer.

24
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.260
All right.

25
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.040
And that's finished downloading, and then I will just click here and double click it, and that gives

26
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.660
me this little thing, and now I can just double click this package to in to run the installer.

27
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.410
All right, and now we have this nice, easy to use install program.

28
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.390
And so I will just click continue and install, and I need to enter my password for logging into my

29
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.930
computer.

30
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.250
All right.

31
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.500
And that is done, and now I can move it to trash to just get rid of that package install program now

32
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.860
to verify that I've actually successfully installed the JDK.

33
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.560
One thing that I usually like to do, first and foremost, is just open up a command line prompt and

34
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.590
Typekit Java command to see what version of Java the computer system thinks I have installed.

35
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.520
So on a Mac, you can invoke the spotlight command.

36
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.740
That's usually in the way that I like to do it, and I usually do it by keyboard shortcuts with command

37
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.350
space and that opens up spotlight.

38
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.190
Or you can go to the little hourglass in the upper right hand corner of your menu bar.

39
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.400
Sorry, my recording software isn't set to actually show that sort of that side of my screen, but hopefully

40
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.660
you know what I'm talking about.

41
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.440
So I'm just going to type in terminal to launch the terminal program.

42
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.400
And so here's the terminal program.

43
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.730
And so from here, let me let me zoom in on that.

44
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.840
All right.

45
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.550
And so from here, if Java was installed successfully, I should be able to execute the Java command

46
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.270
right here.

47
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.910
So all lowercase Java Java.

48
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.010
Dash Dash version.

49
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.890
All lowercase, the dashes are minus signs, OK?

50
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.780
And then hit return.

51
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.210
And yeah, looks good.

52
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.840
I have.

53
00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.590
It's reporting back that it have Java seventeen point zero point one, so it looks like that got installed

54
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:12.030
successfully, and this completes the installation process for installing Java version 17 on an M1 ARM64

55
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.570
Mac.
