WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.260
OK, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.580
So now we're going to switch over to Intel.

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:11.160
So I'm going to jump over into Intel AJ myself and I'm going to go up to the menu for it file and we

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.860
can just open the project that we just downloaded the zip file project that we just downloaded, not

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.750
the zip file, but the unzip version of it.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.260
So I'm going up to file open and I have navigated into my ideal project folder.

7
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.320
Now again, that's just where I put mine.

8
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.800
You can put yours and you may have just decided to leave it in the downloads folder.

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.960
For all I know, it doesn't really matter.

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.580
OK, but I put mine in the Idea Projects folder and it was was it people dbe das web.

11
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.150
So there it is, right there, people db das web already unzipped.

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.840
And so I'm going to actually jump into that folder.

13
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.700
OK, so now I can see the build.gradle and all these things.

14
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.600
Now I'm not going to select any of the I'm not going to click on any of those, I'm just going to click

15
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.720
open and I'm going to open this project as a standard Gradle project.

16
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.860
OK, now I just got this little message asking me if I want to trust this project and I will tell it

17
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.590
yet, I want to trust all of these projects.

18
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.100
And then I'm being asked if I want to open this up in a new window or in my existing window, which

19
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.300
you can't see, it's off screen, but I will go ahead and say Yes, new window, please.

20
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.740
All right.

21
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.740
And so this new window is opening up, and you can see down here that various things were happening,

22
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.910
well, you might have seen that it happened pretty quickly, but it was getting the project ready.

23
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.730
OK, so I'm going to close close this tip of the day right here, and here's our project ready to go.

24
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.040
OK, so the very first thing we're going to do is just start up this project.

25
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.360
So let me explain something real briefly here, and I'll explain a little bit more later, OK?

26
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.120
When we run a web application of this sort, we actually need a web server, OK, which is its own application

27
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:22.000
that is capable of waiting and listening for a web browser, typically to request web content from it.

28
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.420
OK?

29
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.800
So we have to start up this web server, essentially.

30
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.980
One of the beautiful things that we get for free with an application that we create in this way, using

31
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.490
the start that spring that Io website or web application is that we get a web application that is based

32
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:48.340
in spring boot and that spring boot application will have essentially a web server embedded in it.

33
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.790
So when we start our application, we're actually starting up not just the application, but a web server.

34
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.480
I'm using a I'm using a simplified term, by the way, right now.

35
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.120
Later on, I'll get a little more specific with what we're really starting up.

36
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.800
Basically, it's a web server.

37
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.270
OK.

38
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.240
And so that's what we need to start up first.

39
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.670
Now, the nice thing is that we start this up the same way we run any other application from the web

40
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.120
browser.

41
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.450
So I'm going to navigate to the main folder here.

42
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.700
Oh, and I'm sorry, let me switch in to presentation mode, by the way, so that you can see everything

43
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.660
a little more easily.

44
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.490
Here we go.

45
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.830
Yeah, now everything's nice and big and easy to see.

46
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.320
OK, so I'm going into source main Java.

47
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.750
And let me make this a little bigger, and if you named everything the same way that I did, then you

48
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.470
will have one class file here called people DBE web application.

49
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.080
OK, that was generated for us by the start of spring.

50
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.700
That is a web application.

51
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.760
OK, so you can select that and right click on it and then go down to run.

52
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.340
Just as you would any other class that has a main method.

53
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.100
In fact, I'm sorry.

54
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.770
Real quick before we even run that if we double click on it, you can open it up and see what it is.

55
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.210
It's it's just the class that has almost no code in it whatsoever.

56
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.960
But.

57
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.170
But one of the things that does have is this public static void main method that essentially starts

58
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.260
up our spring application.

59
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.190
Okay, so spring application got run.

60
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.670
OK.

61
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.930
So that's what you have here.

62
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.280
OK.

63
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.510
And so we can start this up in a number of ways and click the play button here or here.

64
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.180
Or we can right click on the class and then choose Run.

65
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.630
OK.

66
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.240
All of those things do the exact same thing.

67
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.900
So I'm going to just go ahead and run this now.

68
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.910
And it has started OK.

69
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.120
Now, what do we do?

70
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.300
Well, we can open up a browser and try to see what we have running here, OK?

71
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.490
So let me open up a browser.

72
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.830
And I guess I don't need this start that spring, I issue page anymore, so I will go somewhere else.

73
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.800
So I need to specify a u r l that will allow me to access the web server that is now running on my computer.

74
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.600
The way I can do that is I have to specify the address of a computer.

75
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.180
And since this web server is running on my computer, I need to specify the address or an address for

76
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.930
my computer.

77
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.620
One of the most common ways to do that is to refer to your computer as something called local host.

78
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.100
OK.

79
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.720
And so what we can do is simply type local host all one word.

80
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.590
OK.

81
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.070
And then we have to specify what is called a port, and I will explain these concepts shortly, OK?

82
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.630
But you will type colon and then 1880.

83
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.260
These are default settings essentially to access an application, a spring boot based application.

84
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.710
If you haven't changed any of the defaults, OK, and I'm going to hit return all right now.

85
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.190
Believe it or not, even though this looks like an error, this is actually not a bad thing.

86
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.820
This is actually telling me that something is actually running on my computer because if I were to do

87
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.880
this, for example, use a port that's that doesn't exist at all, like 9000.

88
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.970
I get I get even less.

89
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:25.890
OK, so local host Colin, 80, is telling me that I do actually have something listening on that port,

90
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.750
as we would say in the business.

91
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:35.250
OK, so now let's make this not give us this white label error page, but give us something a little

92
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.880
more useful.

93
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:45.960
So I'm going to jump back over to the e-mail and I will minimize the little console output here, and

94
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.910
I will come down here to resources by double clicking.

95
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.430
I'm just going to open that up.

96
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:57.210
OK, so what we're going to do is click on this static folder here, and then I'm going to right click

97
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.110
on it, go to new HTML file.

98
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:10.700
And then we're going to give this file a name and we will call it index study HTML and then hit return.

99
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:18.950
And so now the idea has created this new file with some boilerplate HTML code in it and with the word

100
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:25.880
title highlighted because the ideas waiting for us to put our own title word in here.

101
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:32.930
So let's call this something like hello, and then I will hit return, and then the cursor jumps down

102
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:39.110
to line eight in between these two body tags, these two, the spacing between these body tags is where

103
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:44.030
the core content of our web page is intended to go.

104
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.540
OK.

105
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.070
And so here, let's just type something like Hello, world.

106
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.750
And so this is kind of us coming full circle now within this course.

107
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:59.780
And one of the earliest lessons of this course, we created our initial command line version of a Hello

108
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.100
World application.

109
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.780
And now we're creating the web application equivalent of that.

110
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.820
OK, so we've got that there.

111
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:16.130
And now we will do a command F9 on Mac or control F9 on Windows or Linux.

112
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.160
And then if we jump back over to the web browser now.

113
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.440
We can update this URL.

114
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:31.500
And just hit return and look at that, we now see Hello World and make that a little bigger.

115
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.180
OK, so we're not getting that error anymore, OK?

116
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.540
And so congratulations.

117
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.350
We've just created our first Hello World Web application.

118
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.510
Not much of an application, really.

119
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.600
There is no dynamic behavior here, but it's a good start.

120
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.050
OK.

121
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:51.780
So in the next lesson, I want to talk a little bit about some of the technologies that are working

122
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.000
here.

123
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.080
Like, how is the web browser communicating with the web server?

124
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.360
What does that web server kind of doing?

125
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:03.490
How is all this fitting together before we proceed to write much more of the real application?

126
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.490
OK, so I'll see you in the next one.
