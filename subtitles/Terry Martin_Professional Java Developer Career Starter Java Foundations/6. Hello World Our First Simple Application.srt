1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:07,950
Welcome back in this lesson, we're going to do the typical first program that everybody always does

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,520
when learning a new language and that is called Hello World.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:18,120
And basically all that is is just writing the minimal amount of code to cause our program to print the

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,670
words Hello world or whatever message you will you like to the screen in the simplest way possible.

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,280
The reason this type of application or program is usually the very first one we write is because it's

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,950
usually pretty simple and people want to see, OK, how do I actually write anything in this language

7
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,580
and get it going?

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,250
So that's the purpose of this, and that's what we're going to do.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,510
All right.

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,150
So the first thing we're going to need to do is click New Project so that we can start a new project

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,890
for our Hello World program.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,520
And after a few moments, a dialog box will open up.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,660
Like this one here?

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,580
All right, so we want to make sure that we have Java selected here because we're going to make this

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,520
the standard plain Java program for the project SDK.

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,720
If your computer already had a previous version of Java installed before Java 17, that is, it might

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,740
be showing up here.

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,590
If so, just click on this dropdown.

19
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,170
You may have noticed there was a little window open just a moment ago, it was searching the computer

20
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,720
to see if there were other or additional versions of Java installed, which in this case we do have

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,790
Java 17 installed in addition to 16 on this computer that I'm working on now.

22
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,710
You might not have Java 16 or anything else installed other than 17.

23
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:43,580
Hopefully you did follow the Java 17 installation process, so hopefully you should be seeing something

24
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,770
referencing JDK 17.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,290
If so, go ahead and select that.

26
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:49,830
All right.

27
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,760
That took a moment to register, but it is giving me the option now of Java 17.

28
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,090
And then you can click next.

29
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,850
From this point forward, my screen might look a little different because you may be seeing instructions

30
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,240
that I previously had for setting up this Hello World program on a slightly previous version of Intel

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,850
with Java version 16.

32
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,060
But everything else will be the same other than just this step here of choosing Java 17 and then click

33
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,300
next and then click next again.

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,940
And here we're going to name our program.

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,670
Well, we're going to name our project.

36
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,110
Hello, world.

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,520
I'm naming mine with what's called Camel Case, where the the first letter of each word is uppercase

38
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,510
and there's no space between the words.

39
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,920
So H and W are capitalized and there's no space there.

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,510
This is a common convention in Java for naming things not absolutely necessary for the project name

41
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,630
because that's not technically part of the program, but still pretty typical to do and then click finish.

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,940
And so what's happened there is that the I.D. will have created a new folder on your computer somewhere

43
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:10,260
on my Mac, it's in my home directory under a directory called Idea Projects and then under a new folder

44
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,330
called Hello World on Windows.

45
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,540
I'm not sure where it will put them, but it doesn't really matter.

46
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,020
OK, let's see.

47
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,310
So we are ready to start creating our program.

48
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:28,020
If for some reason this left a project pane isn't open on your computer and your screen might look something

49
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:37,200
like this, if it does, you can hit on Mac Command one to open that on on Windows and Linux Alt one

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,460
to open and close this project tab so that toggles open and closed with Alt one or command one.

51
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,540
OK.

52
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,960
You're going to go down here to source and you can right click on.

53
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm sorry, you're going to go down here to where it says SIRC.

54
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,730
That stands for source.

55
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,720
That's short for source code, which means the code that we are writing.

56
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,030
This is where all of your code files here that you're going to create to make your program will will

57
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,420
go.

58
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:10,020
So you can right click on that folder and then select new and then Java class.

59
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:19,340
And here we will have to name a new file, a new Java class that we're going to create Java class and

60
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,880
file are typically pretty much synonymous.

61
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:29,000
So here we're going to name our Java class file Hello world again.

62
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,730
Same as the project, so capital H.

63
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:38,920
Capital W. No space between the words hello and world and make sure you've got class selected here.

64
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,080
If it if it wasn't for some reason and then hit return.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,420
OK.

66
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,160
And so we've now created our first Java class file.

67
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,680
Now I'm going to kind of zip through this real quick, but you can follow along, so I'm going to create

68
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,780
a new line and I prefer to use keyboard shortcuts for as much as I possibly can.

69
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,110
So you won't see me spending a lot of time going up into the menus.

70
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,740
I will try to remember to state what those menu items are, but I strongly, strongly, strongly encourage

71
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,420
you to get very familiar and comfortable with the keyboard shortcuts.

72
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,260
This course isn't just to teach you Java, it's it's to teach you to be an excellent Java developer,

73
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:27,340
and part of that is learning your tools well, and part of it is getting proficient and fast with using

74
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:27,880
your tools.

75
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,940
So keyboard shortcuts are a big part of that.

76
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,640
OK, so I'm going to create a new line after line one, and I'm going to do that by hitting shift and

77
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,420
return.

78
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,040
And that creates a new line.

79
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,630
And then we need to create what's called a method here.

80
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,430
And there is a standard method.

81
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,250
So I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on on why we do all of these things in this video.

82
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,440
Let's just get this program written in and get it running.

83
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,730
And then in a subsequent video, we'll come back to it and I will explain in detail every single aspect

84
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,840
of this program, OK?

85
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:10,960
So we're going to type P s v, which stands for public static void main and then hit return, and that

86
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,690
expands out into what is called a method.

87
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,760
Lines two through four.

88
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,620
And then it puts our cursor right in the middle of that message so that we're ready to start typing

89
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,110
our first statement or command.

90
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:31,450
OK, and here we're going to do another little shortcut, a little macro s o u t and then hit return

91
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,020
again.

92
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:38,020
And that expands out into system that out that print line, which is generally pronounced print line.

93
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,260
And then we're going to type one quotation mark.

94
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:48,440
But that expands out into two quotation marks automatically by the ADP and puts our cursor in the middle

95
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,940
of them, and then we can type Hello World just like that.

96
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,520
OK.

97
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,560
And congratulations, you've just written your first program in Java here.

98
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,200
And now we just want to run it now.

99
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,830
I don't mean to overwhelm, but there's a million ways to run this thing.

100
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,690
Of course, I'm going to prefer to use the keyboard shortcuts, but let me quickly just tell you all

101
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,370
the ways that you can do this.

102
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,210
So you can run this by clicking on this little green play button here and selecting Run, which is telling

103
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,080
the idea to run this method, which is called main.

104
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,310
OK.

105
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,850
Or you could click on this higher green play button and choose to run the whole entire class.

106
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,930
Or you could go up here to run menu and and select run here.

107
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,900
But the way that I'm going to do it is just to do the keyboard shortcut control shift.

108
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:50,950
Ah, and down here the lady is calling Java to build our project.

109
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,950
So it took a few seconds there, but it did build and then it ran it after it was finished building.

110
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,090
And now we have the words Hello world down here in this little console.

111
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,870
Now, just to make sure that that's not some weird trick.

112
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,360
Let's come back into line three and add a little bit more now you can feel free to put whatever words

113
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,300
you want in here.

114
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,280
It doesn't matter.

115
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,530
It's just that's why we have it in quotes, because the computer is simply going to print whatever we

116
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,190
pass in.

117
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,200
To those the quotes there, I'm going to add in a little more and say something like, Hello world.

118
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,120
Nice to meet you.

119
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,030
OK, in this time, I'll run it, I don't know.

120
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,970
I'll use the top play button here just to mix it up a little bit.

121
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,970
So that's building again.

122
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,280
And after a second, there we go.

123
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,480
Hello, world, karma.

124
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,420
Nice to meet you.

125
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,220
OK, so that just ran our first program, and that's the end of this lesson.

126
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:57,460
So in the next two lessons, I'm going to give you a little bit of background on the nature of Java,

127
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,020
the language and its and what type of language it is.

128
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:07,630
And then we will do a slightly deeper dive into every nook and cranny of this short program.

129
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,240
I will make sure that you understand what every key word means in this entire program.

130
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,820
So I'll meet you in the next video.
