Hello and welcome to my course, professional Java developer career starter, Java Edition, I know

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,490
I know the title is a mouthful.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,730
It's a course teaching the foundations of Java.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,850
It's for people who want to start a new career doing Java and becoming professionals.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,040
So there you go, the long title.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,370
Anyway, I'm so happy and pleased that you've chosen to take my course to learn Java.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,880
I think you're going to get a lot out of it, and I hope that I can bring a slightly unique perspective

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,540
to teaching Java based on both my background and my way of thinking in terms of background.

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,240
I have an extensive career as a professional software developer.

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,990
The majority of which has been specifically with Java and I've worked with tons and tons of developers

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,130
as a co-worker, manager, mentor, consultant, architect, etc. So I've seen a very wide range of

12
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,020
skill sets among all of the different Java developers that I've worked with over the years.

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,440
Some were amazing.

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,380
Some were maybe not so much.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,830
And I've made a lot of notes over the years of some of the same patterns that I've seen in terms of

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,920
weaknesses among a lot of developers.

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,970
Now, these are not universally true weaknesses for everybody.

18
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,600
But I've been a little startled from time to time to see some of these weaknesses pop up over and over

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,030
again among a large number of developers.

20
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:35,850
I'm talking about skills like pattern matching for text or using some of the latest APIs of Java that

21
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,450
help to modernize the language and keep it fresh and current in today's climate of functional programming

22
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,860
and other paradigms.

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:51,510
So it is my goal in this course to give you an incredible foundation as a Java programmer so that you

24
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:59,280
feel confident and capable to go toe to toe with even a lot of seasoned Java developers, and that won't

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,750
be as hard as you may think.

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,130
You see, even a lot of seasoned Java developers haven't kept up with some of the latest APIs introduced

27
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:13,500
into Java to keep it both relevant and effective as a modern programming language.

28
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,760
And I'm teaching a lot of those APIs in this course.

29
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,310
So if you learn them, there's a good shot that when you're working with more seasoned Java developers,

30
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:29,280
you'll be able to show them a thing or two, whether it's the streams and lambdas API or even an old

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,730
technology that a lot of Java developers just don't tend to be very good at regular expressions or test

32
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,700
driven development.

33
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,780
Also known as TDD using J Unit.

34
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,580
So I've put a lot into this course so that you can get a lot out of it.

35
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,040
But I'm also open to your feedback.

36
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,530
This is my first course of this magnitude, and I know there are going to be a lot of things that I

37
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,370
didn't think of.

38
00:02:53,670 --> 00:03:00,150
So I want you to reach out to me and give me a chance to address any issues that you may encounter while

39
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,350
you're taking this course.

40
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,310
I'll be constantly updating this course to make it even better with more images, additional resources

41
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,220
and additional lectures as time goes on.

42
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,350
You can help drive what direction this course takes with your feedback.

43
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,290
So without further ado, let's get going.
