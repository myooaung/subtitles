1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,340
Let's talk a little bit about Java.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,720
What is Java?

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,100
Well, Java is a programming language that was originally created by a company that no longer exists.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,900
Sun Microsystems and it was released in 1995.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,430
The chief architect behind Java was James Gosling.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,470
I sometimes like to jokingly refer to Mr. Gosling as Java God.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:34,170
The language was originally targeted to be embedded in consumer electronics devices like VCRs and eventually

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,020
DVDs, where it has made some appearances.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,040
But another key area that Sun Microsystems really heavily pushed and marketed, Java was as an early

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,290
competitor, if you can believe this to the product that eventually became Adobe Flash.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,490
Do you remember Flash, the technology that Apple eventually killed?

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,840
It gave us animations and simple video games and things of that sort.

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,440
Running in the browser, you had to install a flash player or plug in in order to run any of these things.

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,910
Well, back in the mid to late 90s, Sun Microsystems took their Java programming language and tried

15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,230
to bring it to the web via a plug in for your browser as well.

16
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,660
These were called Java applets.

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,070
Unfortunately, applets never caught on the way that Flash did.

18
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,560
And as a result, lots of people don't even realize that Java ever was able to do that.

19
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,400
The funny thing, though, is that it was Java's third incarnation where it really started to make its

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,290
mark, and that was as a server side application platform.

21
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:47,040
Now, I know you may not even know much of what that means, but essentially, if you think of lots

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:55,590
of very popular websites that you probably visit, like Amazon or eBay sites like that, many of those

23
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,160
sites, especially in the early days and to a large extent even today, are heavily powered by Java

24
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,300
applications.

25
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,960
A lot of the data processing that has to take place when you make orders or click on a video to watch

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,000
on Netflix.

27
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:17,430
A lot of that is being handled by Java code running on servers in the background.

28
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,670
And for those of you who are old enough, if you may remember going into banks or various types of businesses

29
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,910
where you sit down with a worker there and they'd have a green screen terminal and they'd enter things

30
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,000
and look up records and things like that.

31
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,710
A lot of that type of computer work has moved away from mainframe computers that those terminals were

32
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:44,760
connected to and into web applications that now run in a web browser but are powered by Java in many

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,490
cases.

34
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,770
So Java really has taken over huge parts of the application development world, particularly for business,

35
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:00,360
and so much so that, according to two of the most well-known indexes that track popularity of programming

36
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,980
languages the Tobie Index and the People Index.

37
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:12,180
Java has consistently been among the top three most popular programming languages for years and years.

38
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:19,020
Both of these indexes use various techniques and strategies to determine this popularity.

39
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,870
One relies more on Google trends.

40
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,580
That is to say what programming languages are people searching for the most?

41
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:33,210
This tends to give an indication of popularity or rising trends in popularity, and the other does a

42
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,800
lot with surveys of companies to determine what they're actually doing today.

43
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:45,240
Now, Java is what's known as an object oriented programming language, and much of this course is really

44
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,910
going to help define what that means.

45
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:55,560
But in a nutshell, it means that the language is strongly geared towards a particular programming paradigm

46
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,140
in which we are encouraged to try to think of the problem that we're trying to write code for in terms

47
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,270
of objects that encapsulate data and behavior.

48
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,150
Perhaps a small example of that would be if we were writing a program that could track companies.

49
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,660
For some reason, we'd almost certainly be modeling or creating objects that represent the concept of

50
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,500
a company.

51
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,550
And examples of some of the data that would pertain to a company would be the number of employees the

52
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:33,780
company name, what sector the company operates in, and perhaps some of the behaviors of a company

53
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,710
that we might model into our objects could be the ability for the company objects to calculate various

54
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:47,880
performance metrics or financial data or implement various H.R. activities, things of that sort.

55
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,450
So a lot of what we'll be learning in this course will pertain to various techniques and capabilities

56
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,920
within Java to allow us to model concepts effectively.

57
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,790
Overall.

58
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,960
It's a really cool language, and I think you're going to really enjoy learning what you can do with

59
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,110
it.
