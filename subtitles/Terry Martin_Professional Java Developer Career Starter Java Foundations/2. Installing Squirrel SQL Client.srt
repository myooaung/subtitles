1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,580
All right, so here I am in a browser and I'm going to search for download.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,640
Squirrel.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,930
Sequel client.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,310
All right.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,290
And I'm just going to jump right down here to the link for downloads.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,140
All right, and we've got a big green download button there that looks like a good candidate to me,

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,550
some clicking on that.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,180
And it's telling me that it's going to start the download in a few seconds, and there we go, so I

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,560
can click Allow.

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,510
If you're on windows, it might operate a little bit differently depending on what browser you're using,

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,980
but it should be pretty much the same.

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,900
All right, and so that is starting the download, all right, and that's done, so I'm going to go

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,850
ahead and launch this.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,580
So now I'm getting a security message on my operating system.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:06,950
I'm on macOS telling me that I can't just run this application by default because it's from an unidentified

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,950
developer and it's something that I downloaded from the internet.

17
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:17,300
So on my Mac, I'm going to have to go into my security settings and allow this program to be installed.

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:27,750
So let me just clear that out for a second jump up here to the system preferences, security and privacy

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,950
general.

20
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,970
All right.

21
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:36,510
And so down here, it knows that I tried to run this squirrel jar and it's asking me if I want to open

22
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,970
it anyway, and I do.

23
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,330
So I'm going to click on that.

24
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,900
All right.

25
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,220
So now.

26
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,550
I can click open.

27
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,920
There we go.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,630
There we go.

29
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,380
All right, and so now I'm in the installer and so I can click next and next again.

30
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,020
And it's asking me, where do I want to install it?

31
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,600
This is the standard location, so I'm not going to change that.

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,670
I'm going to allow that in next and it's going to create that directory.

33
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,320
That's fine.

34
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,200
Click OK.

35
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,920
And then it's asking me, what additional plugins do I want?

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,290
I don't have to select any at this time.

37
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,870
I could select them later on, since I do know, though, that we are going to be working soon here

38
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,330
with the H2 database.

39
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,030
I am inclined to go ahead and click on that right now.

40
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,070
And that's it.

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,940
So I'm going to click next.

42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,330
And next again and done, all right.

43
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,380
And then I'm going to close down a couple of these little bits here.

44
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,310
All right.

45
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:44,640
So now you should have squirrel installed on your computer and I'm going to go ahead and launch it.

46
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,190
I'm just going to use the keyboard shortcut for Spotlight and I'm going to type Squirrel.

47
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,780
And there it is, right there under Application Squirrel sequel.

48
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,190
OK.

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,250
And I'm going to close that help window there.

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,980
All right, so here we are in Squirrel.

51
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,100
Let me make that bigger.

52
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,650
All right, so now that we've installed Squirrel, the next step is that we're going to have to install

53
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,700
a driver.

54
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,970
So in order to understand what drivers are, let's talk about the database that we're about to use and

55
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,040
how all of this stuff kind of works.

56
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:28,930
So first thing I want to state is that Squirrel is a database SQL client that is written in Java, so

57
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,720
this is an actual Java desktop application.

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:40,870
As such, it uses Java's own standardized API and mechanisms for connecting to various databases, and

59
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,930
it's capable of connecting to just about every relational database there is as long as there is a so-called

60
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,110
driver for that database for Java.

61
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:57,940
So Java has a standardized API for programming against various databases.

62
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:06,460
This API is called JDI B.C., and it stands for Java database connectivity, so you can basically think

63
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,210
of the ABC API as a set of interfaces.

64
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,720
OK.

65
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:20,320
And each company or organization that makes a database that they want to be connectable by Java has

66
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,000
to write classes that implement these standardized interfaces.

67
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,020
So this is one of those places where interfaces are being used to make code very flexible in that different

68
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:39,610
database providers can all allow their different databases to be interacted with in a standardized way

69
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:47,650
because they're all hiding behind a standardized abstraction layer, which is the JBC API interfaces.

70
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:55,960
So their drivers are really just the implementation classes for the standard ADC interfaces.

71
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:04,870
So if we want to connect to a particular database with Java, typically that database has to provide

72
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,970
JBC drivers for us, and this is actually a very common pattern.

73
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,730
Even outside of the world of Java, most programming languages and platforms have their own equivalent

74
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,930
to ABC.

75
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:26,710
So the database we're going to be working with in this module is called H2, and I like this database

76
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:35,950
a lot because it's very small and very easy to download and install, and it offers some very flexible

77
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,530
options for how we can interact with it.

78
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:45,610
I mentioned at the beginning that generally speaking, databases are programs that are installed on

79
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:52,510
a computer, and those programs usually sit and wait for other computers on the same network to connect

80
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,790
to them to issue SQL commands, essentially.

81
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,360
And the H2 database can be used pretty much in that same standard type of way.

82
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:10,540
However, H2 being that it is a very lightweight database is also able to be embedded within another

83
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,240
program.

84
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,980
OK, so it doesn't have to be installed as its own standalone program, though it can be.

85
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:25,180
It can also be embedded in other programs that we would write, and it can also access data that is

86
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,480
stored very simplistically in an individual file.

87
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,920
And so this just makes H2 really convenient for us to work with as I am teaching you the beginning basics

88
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,980
of databases.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,360
You don't have to like install a whole entire application, which can usually be somewhat involved.

90
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,700
We can keep it relatively simple.

91
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:46,770
All right.

92
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:53,710
So now we're going to actually go download the H2 driver, someone to go back to the browser here and

93
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,560
type download H2.

94
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,230
Driver.

95
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,930
There we go and there's our downloads right here.

96
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:09,530
And what we can do is just grab this platform independent zip file here, so I'm going to click on that.

97
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,470
All right, so that's downloaded.

98
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,110
OK, so now I will click here to open that file.

99
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,360
Now, that was a zip file, by the way, my operating system automatically unzipped zip files.

100
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,070
If yours does not, then you'll want to download the zip file, then go to wherever it downloaded,

101
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,810
probably in your downloads folder.

102
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:40,830
Unzip that file, which will expand out into a folder called H2 mine, is called H2 Dash, too, because

103
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,510
I already had another one on the computer.

104
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,610
And then you can go inside of that folder and then you should see everything that I'm seeing here.

105
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,600
All right.

106
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:55,020
So at this point, you're going to have to make a decision as to where you want to store this folder

107
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,040
permanently.

108
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,650
Some of you may choose to just leave it in the downloads folder, and that's fine if that's how you

109
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,820
operate your computer.

110
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,550
Some of you may prefer to move this into somewhere like a home directory or something like that.

111
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,590
To keep this simple, I'm going to just leave this in my downloads folder for now.

112
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:20,460
But just be aware that if you were going to continue to operate with H-2 in the way that we will in

113
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:27,510
this module, you might want to consider grabbing this whole entire H-2 folder and moving it somewhere

114
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,710
a little more permanent.

115
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,600
If you don't like your downloads folder, getting cluttered up with all of the download stuff and you

116
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,130
occasionally like to delete a lot of that stuff, you don't want to accidentally delete this.

117
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,150
All right.

118
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,140
But like I said, I'm going to just leave mine in the downloads folder for right now.

119
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,300
OK, so here's the folder.

120
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,470
It's in my downloads.

121
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,570
So you're going to want to make a note of where you're leaving this H-2 folder because we're going to

122
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,210
have to go back to it in just a moment here.

123
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:54,840
All right.

124
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,290
So now I will go back to Squirrel.

125
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,130
All right.

126
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,090
So we're going to go to drivers and then.

127
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,330
Click on H-2 Embedded.

128
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,050
And then right click on it and modify driver.

129
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,140
Then click on extra class path.

130
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,110
Add.

131
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:24,020
Now, because I've already installed an to drive around here, it's opening me up right to where that

132
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:30,170
driver is installed, but now that you've downloaded and unzipped the H2 folder and you may either have

133
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,780
left it in your downloads folder, or you may have copied it into another folder, like in your home

134
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:41,210
directory or somewhere like that, you'll want to navigate to wherever that HS2 folder is.

135
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:47,450
So in my case, I moved the two folder into my home directory under Terry.

136
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,480
OK, so you'll want to go find that wherever you've unzipped it and copied it to, or if you left it

137
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,520
in the downloads folder, that's fine too.

138
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,890
And then from there.

139
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,440
So let's say that now you're in the H2 folder.

140
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,970
From here, you'll want to also go into the bin folder.

141
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:11,030
That's short for binary, and then you'll want to find the file that starts with the word H2 and ends

142
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,500
with J.R.R that J.R. stands for Java Archive.

143
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:23,120
It's really just a zip file that contains Java compiled code, so select that file.

144
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,670
Pay no attention to the numbers that I have here.

145
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,490
If you're watching this lesson sufficiently, some time after I've recorded it, there will likely be

146
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,820
a newer version of H2 at the time that you're watching this.

147
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,910
It might be 1.5 1.6.

148
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,030
It doesn't really matter.

149
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:38,630
OK.

150
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:44,180
So just make sure you select the file that starts with H two and ends with J.R.R.

151
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,180
Click Open.

152
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:54,490
All right, and then if you don't have anything the down here at class name, then as long as the H2,

153
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,900
blah blah blah, that jar file is selected.

154
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:03,260
You can click the list drivers button here, and that should populate this class name down here.

155
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,420
And now you can click OK.

156
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,740
All right, so now let's create a connection to the database.

157
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:16,430
So we're going to go up here to aliases and click on this plus button here, and then we're going to

158
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,720
set a name for this.

159
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,840
So I don't know we can call this anything we want.

160
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,570
It's just a name for our connection to this particular database with this particular driver.

161
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,860
So let's call it people test.

162
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,220
And now for the driver, I'm actually going to change this.

163
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,740
We want to choose H Embedded.

164
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,430
OK, so select that.

165
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,520
And then further, you are L..

166
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:51,410
I'm going to remove from the double forward slashes there, so I'm going to delete all of that.

167
00:11:51,410 --> 00:12:00,890
So I start off with JTBC Colon, H2 colon, OK, and then the tilde symbol forward slash people test.

168
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,790
So that's the tilde symbol on the keyboard underneath the escape and then click on the test button and

169
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,780
then connect.

170
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,160
And connection successful.

171
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:12,850
Very good.

172
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,230
So click OK.

173
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,320
And then click Connect and connect again.

174
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,470
All right, so now we are actually connected to an H2 database.

175
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:34,330
Now I want to explain very briefly what is different between the way that we're connecting to H2 to

176
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,690
talk to this new people database versus the way that most database connections, especially in a professional

177
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,950
business setting, would be.

178
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,740
As I mentioned earlier, typically when something is connecting to a database, the database is first

179
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,580
an application typically that's installed on a server.

180
00:12:51,820 --> 00:13:01,120
The server is on a network, and other computers on that network are making network connections to the

181
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:08,290
database server and then firing off SQL commands and things to get data back or to either insert data

182
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,990
into the database and or get it back out.

183
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,530
That's the standard way that most professional applications work with databases.

184
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:24,700
However, because we're using this very lightweight H2 database and this database supports connectivity

185
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:31,050
in a number of ways, the way that we're currently using it is not as a server per se.

186
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,340
In other words, it's not an application that we've installed on the computer and we've told to start

187
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,840
running and then it's sitting there waiting for network connections to it.

188
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,440
Instead, we're using it in its embedded form.

189
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:52,570
And so first off, we're connecting to H2 not via a network, but really as a programming extension

190
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,680
of the Squirrel database client in this case.

191
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:05,590
So Squirrel is really just calling code or methods that exist within the H2 jar file that we were pointing

192
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:14,500
to the driver and we told the H2 Jar file methods to open up a connection to a file.

193
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,500
Now that file did not already exist on the computer.

194
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,280
And so H2 saw that and created the file for us.

195
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:29,710
And so any data that we push into H2 while we're connected in this way is going to actually just be

196
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,280
written out to an actual file on the computer.

197
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,750
This is a very lightweight way of just basically playing with the database.

198
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:46,810
You would not want to use a database in this very lightweight, non server based approach with a file.

199
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:52,450
If you were writing an application that needed to support simultaneous multiple users connecting to

200
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:52,660
it.
