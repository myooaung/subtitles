00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.710
All right, so now we're going to do a few small little projects so that you can see how to really apply

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.150
some of these mathematical functions and things that we can do in Java.

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:20.610
So we'll start off with a small little method that will calculate the area of a circle and to calculate

4
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.650
the area of a circle.

5
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.060
The formula is pretty simple.

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.820
It is pi r squared area equals pi our squared.

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.030
So what we will do will stick with this math stuff class and we'll just create a a method in here to

8
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.950
calculate the area of a circle.

9
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.840
And we can call this method calculate area of circle.

10
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.880
So see here now.

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.800
We don't need this function to be part of any object oriented model or anything like that.

12
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.740
And because we don't need it to be like in an object oriented fashion, the way will implement this

13
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.810
is simply as a static method on this class math stuff.

14
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.390
Much the same as the methods that we just went through on the math class itself.

15
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.040
Those are all static methods.

16
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.940
So we'll follow a similar signature to our main method here with a few small differences, though public

17
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.330
static.

18
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.370
Now, this won't be void because we want a method that will return the actual area, and we'll just

19
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.620
use the default numeric type for non integers of double.

20
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.870
All right, so it will return a double.

21
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.060
And I don't know.

22
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.390
We'll call it calculate.

23
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.770
I'll shorten it to count area of circle.

24
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.680
OK, now what is the input of this?

25
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.490
While the formula is area equals pi, our squared R squared R is the radius of the circle.

26
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.470
So that would be the unknown thing that we would need to use as an input.

27
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.450
So we will take that as an input and we'll make that a double as well.

28
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.770
All right.

29
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.320
So we'll call this radius.

30
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.350
OK.

31
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.170
So this should be pretty, pretty straightforward.

32
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.260
All we need to do is to return to the area, which is calculated as pie.

33
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.490
Now I just showed you in one of the previous lessons recently that the constant of pie is already given

34
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.560
to us on the math class, so we can just invoke that by calling math dot pie.

35
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.490
All caps pie.

36
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.890
And the formula is pi r squared, in fact, you know.

37
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.450
Let me let's just do this area equals pi times R.

38
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.780
Squared, OK.

39
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.170
That's one way to kind of.

40
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.170
No, no, take this in a comment.

41
00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.370
OK, so pi times radius to the second power.

42
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.620
Now the way to do this would be to call math, not power.

43
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.240
The first argument will be the radius, and then the second argument is the power to which we want to

44
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.870
raise it.

45
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.900
OK, so radius and then two.

46
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.040
So there we have it.

47
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.710
Pi times, radius squared.

48
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.990
That's that's how you would do this.

49
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.990
All right.

50
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.330
So now let's try it out.

51
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.660
So I'm going to just make a new line here to pronounce system that out that print line.

52
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.100
And now we can just call our new method calc area of circle.

53
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.970
All right.

54
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:49.550
So let's say if we have a circle of Radius nine now, I have a website over here that we can use to

55
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.210
kind of check whether or not we're actually going to do this correctly.

56
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.960
So here they give an example of a radius of three meters.

57
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.150
OK, and then they're showing the formula there, and then they're showing what the area is, which

58
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.580
is twenty eight point two seven meters squared.

59
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.290
So let's use their values and see if this works.

60
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.740
OK.

61
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.290
So we'll use three.

62
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.660
And then let's run this and see what we get.

63
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.300
OK, so their answer on the website was twenty eight point twenty seven meters squared and our answer

64
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.030
is twenty eight point two seven and then a whole bunch more.

65
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.830
I think we've got a winner here.

66
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.760
All right.

67
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.370
So that was a really easy one.

68
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.950
Let me show you something else, by the way.

69
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.200
So I put this formula here just as a little note.

70
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.320
So Java has a standardized way of of making of documenting your methods.

71
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.390
And the way you do that is you put your cursor right above the method itself.

72
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.380
And you can even do something like this and then use a forward.

73
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.960
What we're going to do is create a certain type of comment called a Java doc, which is short for Java

74
00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.580
documentation, and to do so, you put your cursor right above the method forward slash star star and

75
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.780
then enter.

76
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.890
And the A.D. knows that you're trying to create a Java doc.

77
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.760
And so then it fills in a few things for you automatically.

78
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.380
A couple of things for you automatically and then you can say whatever you want to, so you can say

79
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:26.550
something like this method calculate the area of a circle, and then it documents what the input is,

80
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.880
which is radius and the return type, or whatever.

81
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.290
So this is a way.

82
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:40.470
So anyway, what what what you could do, though, is also you could say it uses the formula area equals

83
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.650
pi times radius.

84
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.220
Squared.

85
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.390
Just like that.

86
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.540
So that's a way that you can document your methods.

87
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.540
All right.

88
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.540
And we're going to wrap up this one.

89
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.900
But we're going to do a few more so that you can get more of an idea of how to actually put these mathematical

90
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.950
functions and capabilities to work for you see in the next one.
