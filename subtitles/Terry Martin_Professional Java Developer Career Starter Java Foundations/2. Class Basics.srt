1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,280
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:07,820
So in the last lesson, we did a whirlwind tour of object orientation.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:14,510
We wrote some classes so that you could get an idea of how modeling works, modeling of ideas, works

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,150
and object orientation and how to do that in Java.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,900
In this lesson, we'll take a deeper dive into the basic anatomy of a class how to and how to create

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,380
a class.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,520
For clarity sake, we will do this in a new project.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,430
So this is going to be another mostly lecture.

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,010
So you are welcome to follow along.

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,920
But I won't be going too slowly for you here because I'm mostly just wanting to show you a few things

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,300
about how to make a class.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,140
Don't worry.

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,440
In some subsequent lessons, I will be going slower and you will be expected to follow along and you

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,700
will even get some homework.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,740
OK, but you don't have to do that here.

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,310
All right.

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,810
So I'm going to create a new project.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,480
I'm going to accept the defaults.

19
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,870
Let's see, I'm going to call this business.

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,520
And I will do this in a new window.

21
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:19,880
OK, so what I want to do is I want to model a little bit of a world here, a world in which there is

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:27,890
a business and there is a news agency and the news agency can interview the business.

23
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,010
Let's call it a company.

24
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:35,270
The news agency can interview the company, but there may be one or two other entities or one or two

25
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:41,330
other concepts that I don't necessarily want everybody to be able to interact with.

26
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,310
That will become clearer in just a moment.

27
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,620
So first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to model a company, so I'm going to create a new Java class.

28
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,950
I'm going to call this company with a Capital C.

29
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:57,410
Real quick note about naming conventions of classes real quick by convention.

30
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,710
Class names are always capitalized.

31
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,390
They do not have to be.

32
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,670
Java will allow you to create a class that's lowercase, but don't do that if you're taking this course

33
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,850
so that you can become a professional software developer, especially working in a company and you create

34
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,040
your classes in lowercase.

35
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,250
You'll be showing them that you might not know what you're doing.

36
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,690
So just don't do that.

37
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,650
Class names should be capitalized because that is the standard convention.

38
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,540
Class names can start with an underscore, but don't do that.

39
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:35,180
Class names cannot start with numbers or symbols other than an underscore.

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,010
So don't try to do any of those things, though the good thing is that the idea will generally stop

41
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:40,700
you from.

42
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,690
In fact, it will.

43
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,440
It will stop you from doing everything that isn't allowed by Java.

44
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,230
It won't stop you from doing the things that are technically allowed by Java, but shouldn't be done.

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,530
So just do yourself a favor.

46
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,870
Keep your class names as words that are capitalized that start with a capital letter.

47
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,440
OK.

48
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,480
Don't make the class name all caps, either, though that also goes against convention.

49
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:05,990
OK.

50
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,640
So those are some basic things.

51
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,260
You can have numbers in the middle or at the end of the class name.

52
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:18,530
There might occasionally be some good reasons to do that, but in my 20 plus years of experience as

53
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:25,340
a Java developer, there have been very few reasons why I've ever needed to put numbers at the end of

54
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:25,880
something.

55
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,070
But I'm sure I've done it once or twice.

56
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,990
OK, let's see.

57
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,070
So now let's look at the anatomy of this.

58
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,330
The first bit here is the visibility of the class.

59
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,870
I will explain what that means.

60
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,970
Very shortly in this lesson, someone to skip past that.

61
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,190
For now, the next part is the keyword class, which just indicates that we're creating a class.

62
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,560
The reason we need this keyword is because there are a few other things that you could create besides

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,580
a class, and you will learn about those in subsequent lessons.

64
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,890
The next bit here is the name of the class.

65
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,550
We've pretty much already covered the ground rules for how to name that.

66
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:08,300
And then the next two bits here are just an indication that here begins the class and here ends the

67
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,680
class.

68
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,460
And these are just curly braces.

69
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:16,130
These have to be here because these let Java know where the body of the class goes.

70
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,110
So if I were to do this, for example, and I could start typing, you know, code or whatever.

71
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,080
By the way, these forward slashes that I'm putting are two forward slash, as that means I'm just making

72
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,370
a comment which will be ignored by Java.

73
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,190
I can type pretty much whatever I want here, and it'll just be ignored.

74
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,830
OK, so that's what these forward slashes mean.

75
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,640
So I'm just showing you that this represents the body of my class where the good stuff goes right,

76
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,390
the definitions and code and all of that, all that kind of stuff.

77
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,810
All right.

78
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:49,620
OK.

79
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,030
Know, get rid of all of that.

80
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,720
So there is one piece of this skeleton of a class that is actually optional and that is this visibility

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,350
bit here.

82
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,360
I actually could get rid of that.

83
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,090
And this is a perfectly valid class.

84
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,200
And this is the most minimal class that you could possibly define.

85
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,660
Of course, it does absolutely nothing at all, but this is the most minimal that you could have.

86
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,410
All right.

87
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,760
So we've got a class.

88
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,150
I'm going to leave it this way, by the way, and now I'm going to create another class.

89
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:24,150
So let's say that a company can have a worker creating a class here.

90
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,480
I don't know.

91
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,730
Let's call it a factory worker.

92
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,810
OK.

93
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,390
And again, I'll get rid of the public here because I don't technically need it right now.

94
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,320
Then if I go back over here to company, I can even say that there is some kind of relationship between

95
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,970
the company and the factory worker.

96
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,860
So I could say factory worker and I'll just call him or her a worker.

97
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:55,930
Now in the Hello World program, when I created fields like this in a class, you may recall that I

98
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,450
was putting the word private there.

99
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,290
And that is the typical way that I would be doing things.

100
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,720
I'm going to maybe not put that in here for right now, only because I don't want to confuse you when

101
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,910
we get talking more about visibility and things, but that is typically how I would do this.

102
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,250
All right.

103
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,690
So basically, what I'm saying right now is company has some type of relationship with a worker.

104
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,850
OK, now not necessarily specifying what type of relationship that is, but a company has some type

105
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,200
of relationship with a worker.

106
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,220
All right.

107
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,350
Now I'm going to create one more class and this will be a news agency.

108
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,510
OK.

109
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,230
And again, the idea, by the way, is the thing that's throwing this public bit in here.

110
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,730
I don't need it as you have seen, but the idea just assumes that most of the time when you're creating

111
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,370
a class, you want the class to be public.

112
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,270
And I would say that probably might be true.

113
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,230
Most of the time.

114
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,510
But for right now, I'm going to get rid of that.

115
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:58,420
Now I'm going to say also that the news agency has some type of relationship to a company.

116
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:06,970
And I can say that by just making a field for the company and I'll call it company just like that.

117
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,080
All right.

118
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,810
So I've kind of set up this little world here.

119
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,650
Now, let me lay down some ground rules.

120
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:21,930
Let us assume that the purpose of a news agency is to interview companies.

121
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:31,680
Let us also assume that a news agency should not be permitted to interview factory workers of the company.

122
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,060
OK.

123
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,590
So the CEO of the company just makes a rule.

124
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,480
I don't want any factory workers talking with the news.

125
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,100
OK.

126
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,420
I want to stop that from happening.

127
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:53,820
Well, so right now, there's nothing stopping us from saying something like factory worker right here.

128
00:07:53,850 --> 00:08:00,210
OK, so in other words, what I'm saying is the news agency has full access to factory workers.

129
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,190
But the company doesn't like that and doesn't want that.

130
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:05,970
OK.

131
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,090
Company needs factory workers to get work done.

132
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:16,090
But company doesn't want news agency to be able to interact with a factory worker.

133
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,880
How can this be stopped?

134
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,110
How can we stop?

135
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,940
How can we prevent the news agency from being able to access a factory worker?

136
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:35,230
Well, the first thing that we could do is to take our company and our factory worker and put them in

137
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,560
their own little package, if you will.

138
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:45,280
And the way that I would do that is to click on the source folder and then create a new package.

139
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,510
And I did this in the Hello World program as well when we created all of our models.

140
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:56,210
I created a package called Model, and that's where I put what was that person and dog and pet and all

141
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:56,860
of those things.

142
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,480
OK, so now I'm going to create a package and I'm going to call this business.

143
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:03,830
All right.

144
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:10,820
And now I'm going to grab my company and my factory worker, and I'm going to just move them both into

145
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,540
the business package and the way I'm doing that is just dragging them.

146
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,830
There are a couple of ways that I could do it, but that might be the easiest for me right now.

147
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,200
And I'm going to accept all of these default things here, and I'm going to ignore all of that for right

148
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,860
now.

149
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,590
OK, cool.

150
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,750
Now I'm getting some errors and we'll go take a look at what those are in just a moment.

151
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,870
But for right now, company and factory worker are now inside of a package, which is really just a

152
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,700
folder called business.

153
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,080
And then if I jump over here to the news agency now, look what's going on.

154
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,370
I'm getting all these red marks on the company and on the factory worker.

155
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,320
And if I hover over one of these, the ID will tell me, what's what's going on here?

156
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:02,850
Business, that company is not public in business, cannot be accessed from outside the package.

157
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:16,220
So what it's saying is that news agency is no longer allowed to see or or interact with the company

158
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,010
or factory worker classes.

159
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:27,620
And the reason for that is because news agency, which is this guy here he is in his own package.

160
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,470
I didn't create a package for him, but he is in a package.

161
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,490
He's in what is considered the default package.

162
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,880
It's the invisible package that all classes are in if you don't explicitly put them in a package.

163
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:48,440
OK, so the news agency is in his own package called the default package, and the company and factory

164
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:57,620
worker are in their own package called business and company and factory worker.

165
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,680
Are not public.

166
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,430
Their visibility is called package protected, OK?

167
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:15,020
And what that really means is that the company and factory worker can only see each other inside of

168
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,430
this business package.

169
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:24,110
But other classes that are outside of the business package can't see or interact with these two classes

170
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,280
anymore because they are both package protected.

171
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,120
OK.

172
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,300
And so that's why I'm getting these complaints here that the news agency can't see these guys anymore.

173
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:43,190
Now I do want the news agency to be able to see the company so I can fix that really easily by simply

174
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,970
declaring that the company class is public.

175
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,380
Yeah.

176
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:49,900
OK.

177
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,250
Right.

178
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,260
The company can be seen by the public, and now if I jump back over here to the news agency, the red

179
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,650
mark went away for the company, so news agency can now see the company because the company is public.

180
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:08,430
I did not do that for the factory worker, though the factory worker is still package protected.

181
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,740
And this is a pretty good relationship, according to the rules that I laid out.

182
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:19,500
I want the news agency to be able to interview the company, but not the workers, not the factory workers

183
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,550
of the company.

184
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,440
The company, however.

185
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,070
Can interact with the factory workers.

186
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,350
And that is appropriate, I want that to be the case.

187
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,470
OK, so this is this is all good and we'll just take another look at the factory worker.

188
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,960
And again, the factory worker is package protected because I do not have the word public here.

189
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,430
So this is pretty good.

190
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:50,040
So now I could just get rid of this reference to the factory worker because I don't want news agency

191
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,500
to be able to interact with a factory worker.

192
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:52,860
Right.

193
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:59,160
So I can do this and then I can also get rid of this lying to here just like that.

194
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:08,130
OK, now one more thing that I want to call attention to this first line here in the news agency class

195
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,110
import.

196
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,470
What is that all about?

197
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:18,270
So basically now that the company class is in a different package from the news agency, when I refer

198
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:25,800
to company down here, I have to tell Java, Where is this company class coming from?

199
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:26,590
OK?

200
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:35,280
By default, Java will expect to find the company class within the same package as this class, or it

201
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,610
will also look for it in one or two other packages.

202
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,740
One of them is called Java Dot Lang.

203
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,000
That is a default package that Java will look for things in as well.

204
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,400
This company class is in neither of those, though.

205
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,450
And so if I want to be able to refer to the company class by just its name and nothing else, just the

206
00:13:54,470 --> 00:14:02,850
short name here, I have to import it into the class so that Java knows what company I'm talking about.

207
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:07,860
So basically, I'm saying, Hey, Java, anytime you see me refer to this name company like this.

208
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,330
Just know that that I'm really talking about business dot company.

209
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:18,820
That's the fully qualified name of this class business dot company.

210
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,320
OK.

211
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,390
Now I don't have to have this line this important here at all.

212
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,330
I could get rid of this.

213
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,570
I can comment it out, for example, or I could delete it.

214
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,550
And then I could come down here and just ride out.

215
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:42,070
The fully qualified name of this class business accompany the fully qualified name, right, the whole

216
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,110
entire name, so I could do that.

217
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:50,200
And every time I refer to company, anywhere in my program, in this, in this class or other classes

218
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,940
that are outside of the business package, I would have to write all of that out.

219
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,590
Most good programmers are a little bit lazy and wouldn't want to have to do that.

220
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:08,620
And so rather than having to do all of that, I can get rid of that and instead just import the specific

221
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,210
company class that I want.

222
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,790
Now, just to make this even slightly more clear, I'm going to create one more package here.

223
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,800
And I'll just call it other.

224
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,500
Package.

225
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:29,500
And in this other package, I could create another class and I could call this company also.

226
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,580
And so here's another reason why importing is important.

227
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,520
Well, here, if I comment this out, how does Java know which company I want?

228
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,850
And in fact, right here it's saying, hey, you have multiple choices for which company you're referring

229
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,060
to.

230
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:52,010
So if I just do it like this, Java doesn't know which company I'm referring to.

231
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,300
Am I talking about the company that's in the in the business package?

232
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,020
Or am I talking about the company that's in the other package, right?

233
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:08,600
So I again would either have to be very explicit and say, I want other package dot company.

234
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,070
I could do that.

235
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:13,730
Or.

236
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,100
Business Dot company or.

237
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:27,550
I could import business stock comp at company or.

238
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,290
I could import.

239
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,840
Or I could import other package company, and in fact, see, it's giving me the option there.

240
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,950
But I want the business company for now, and I'm going to get rid of this other package in the class

241
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,580
they're in.

242
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:53,730
OK.

243
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:03,330
So one last thing I think I want to just note here is this protection of classes and visibility is a

244
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,600
is another pretty powerful concept in object orientation.

245
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:16,210
If I were writing a really complex project with tens or hundreds of classes, I might very well have

246
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,040
some classes that I want.

247
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,270
For example, the company to be able to use, but I don't want other classes outside of this package

248
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,240
to be able to use those, those those classes.

249
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:36,700
And so in order to keep the overall structure of my program relatively simple from the perspective of

250
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,850
certain other classes, this whole idea of visibility and things is actually quite useful.

251
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,000
OK, so that wraps up this lesson.

252
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,270
In the next lesson, we will do a little deeper dive into methods.

253
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,940
So I will see you in the next one.
