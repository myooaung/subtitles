00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.230
All right, now in this next lesson, I'm going to show you how we can use the capabilities of spring

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.350
boot to provide internationalized support for our web application.

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.270
And what I mean by that is if we are willing to translate certain texts within our page here or any

4
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.590
pages for that matter, we can have our application present the text in various languages that we provide

5
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.850
translations for.

6
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.890
So I want to show you how to do that now.

7
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.330
And considering that I think more than half of my students are actually in non-English speaking countries,

8
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.300
this might be particularly of interest to you.

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.170
Let's see here.

10
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.370
So where we will begin is first, let's check how our I.D. is actually configured to make this a little

11
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.000
bit easier.

12
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.540
So we'll go into the preferences you can get there either on Mac by coming up to this menu item here

13
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.830
and going to preferences.

14
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.230
I think on Windows and Linux, I believe it's under the file menu, but you want to go into the preferences.

15
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.090
All right.

16
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.760
And the first thing I recommend doing is clicking on this little search area here and typing in plug

17
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.200
in.

18
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.070
So we want to go check what plug ins we have installed, and you can click on the installed tab right

19
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.480
here and then come over here under plug ins and type in Greece source.

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.350
And you want to check and see if you have the resource bundle ED installed.

21
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.190
Now I'm going to tell you now this isn't a great plug in it.

22
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.680
It crashes constantly.

23
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.400
It really does.

24
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.610
But even with the crashing, I think it's still better than probably not having it and you'll see why

25
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.810
when we start using it.

26
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.400
So you want to check and see if that is installed, if it's showing up here, then you have it installed.

27
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.590
If it's not showing up here, then you don't have it installed.

28
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.800
If you don't have it installed, then you can click on this tab here marketplace and then search for

29
00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.130
it again.

30
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.840
Resource Bundle.

31
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.090
That should be all I need to type in.

32
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.530
OK.

33
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.410
So here it is.

34
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.090
And so if you don't have it installed on your computer, then you'll probably have a green install button

35
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.160
next to it, and you can just click that and then follow the instructions to get it installed.

36
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.640
OK.

37
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.010
And you may have to restart intelligence, but just follow the instructions that the plug in tells you

38
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.400
to do.

39
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.800
OK, so assuming you've got that installed, then the next thing you'll want to do is come back over

40
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:34.640
here to this little search window and type in encoding like so and you'll go down here to file encoding.

41
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.610
And you want to get to this encoding screen here.

42
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.580
Now I'm going to just assume that by default, you probably already had global encoding and project

43
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.200
encoding set to UTF eight.

44
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.680
And if so, then you will just leave those alone if you don't have those set already.

45
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.080
It's up to you if you want to mess around with both.

46
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.890
You may.

47
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.140
You might want to try just leaving them as they are for now and see if you run into issues with what

48
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.190
I'm about to teach.

49
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.510
And if you do run into issues, then try changing these to UTF eight, OK?

50
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.460
That's how I'm going to tell you.

51
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.540
For now, the main place where we really want to look is down here.

52
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:21.720
Now on my I.D. by default, I had this setting down here where it says properties files, default encoding

53
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.230
for properties, files that was set to ISO eighty eight, fifty nine, Dash one and basically ISO 88

54
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.740
fifty nine.

55
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.490
Dash one, for all intents and purposes, is ASCII.

56
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.090
And if you may recall from the lessons that I've taught earlier, ASCII encoding only provides codes

57
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.670
primarily for the Latin character set.

58
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.220
OK, so mostly the letters that you would see in Western European languages and English.

59
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.750
So we want to change this now so that we can have better support for more internationalization.

60
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.190
So I'm going to select that and I'm going to choose UTF eight.

61
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.550
Now I'm going to tell you now I learned the hard way, what happens if I choose UTF 16?

62
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.000
I'm sure it can be made to work if I cared to spend enough time making it work, but I'm not going to

63
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.360
do that.

64
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.680
So I'm just going to warn you now.

65
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.850
Probably don't do that unless you're willing to spend a lot of time figuring it out.

66
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.140
Or or maybe you go Google.

67
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.970
A lot of things.

68
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.090
I don't have time for that now, so I'm going to recommend that you choose UTF eight.

69
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.350
In theory, the only difference between the two is that if you're going to have a lot of text that is

70
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:39.930
primarily Latin script, then UTF eight will likely be a more efficient encoding and it will use less

71
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.560
space.

72
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.650
On the other hand, if the majority of the data or typing or translation translations you are going

73
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.430
to enter into these properties files is not Latin script, and especially if it's something like Korean

74
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.950
or Chinese or Japanese or something like that in all likelihood.

75
00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.940
UTF 16 in theory.

76
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.520
Would likely be the more efficient encoding to use.

77
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.860
I'm just telling you the theoretical differences between UTF eight and 16, however, functionally they

78
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.420
both can do the same thing.

79
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.830
It's just a question of how much space is getting used up now.

80
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.940
In practice, though, like I was just saying, I discovered that when I chose UTF 16, my entire application

81
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.540
broke and I'm sure there was a way that I could have gotten that working.

82
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.540
But I don't know what that is because I didn't want to spend much more time on it.

83
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.050
So in general, just use UTF eight unless you really know what you're doing.

84
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.850
All right.

85
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.380
So UTF eight and I'm going to click apply and OK.

86
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:39.290
All right.

87
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.020
And so now we will open up the project pane here, right?

88
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:53.350
And then under the source main resources folder, we can right click on that and choose New and resource

89
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.740
bundle.

90
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.420
Or you could just do command in.

91
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.300
So we want to make what is called a new resource bundle, and then we're going to have to name this

92
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.810
bundle and we're going to have to call it all lowercase messages.

93
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.140
OK?

94
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:12.820
Make sure you call it like that messages, and then we must specify what languages we would like to

95
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.010
provide translations for.

96
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.150
OK, now note Java isn't going to actually translate anything for us.

97
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.680
We have to do that ourselves.

98
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.700
We just need to let it know what locales or languages or countries we are planning to provide the translations

99
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.090
for.

100
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.510
So we do that by clicking on this plus here or command in.

101
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:38.800
And then we can specify some either locale codes or just the two letter language or two letter country

102
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.610
codes separated by commas.

103
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.020
OK.

104
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:47.440
Now, since English will be the default for me, I won't specify that because this plugin will generate

105
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:54.790
a default file anyway, so I would simply specify the additional languages that I plan to provide translations.

106
00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:01.030
For now, I have spent many years studying or dabbling in a number of languages.

107
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:08.230
I am not going to claim fluency in any of them at all, but I will use those languages, for my example.

108
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.920
Here you are free to use whatever languages you would like to.

109
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.140
You could even use made up ones, I suppose.

110
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.800
All right.

111
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.040
So I will attempt translations for French.

112
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:25.660
So that would be F.r and Korean, which is chaos, I think, and Japanese.

113
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.200
OK.

114
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.500
And again, you can provide as many as you want and whatever languages you like.

115
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.710
And then I will hit enter.

116
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.420
Oh, by the way, so one of the things so you could also do something like this.

117
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:43.030
So English underscore U.S. meaning English as it is spoken in the United States, so you could get that

118
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.000
specific with a fully qualified locale.

119
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.510
OK.

120
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:52.660
In my case, as far as I know, French is French everywhere in France, more or less.

121
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.440
Same goes for Korean and same goes for Japanese.

122
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:01.390
However, if there was a region somewhere in the world like India, for example, I know India has lots

123
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.680
and lots of languages.

124
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:09.460
I'm not even sure how you would specify some of those languages, but for example, I know that there's

125
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.080
a language called Telugu.

126
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:16.150
I don't know what the code is for that, but let's pretend like it's tea and then we're talking about

127
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.560
India.

128
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:21.730
So that might be a fully qualified locale for Telugu spoken in India, for example.

129
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.590
So you could do that as well.

130
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:32.150
All right, but I'm going to delete those and I'm going to click OK and then OK again.

131
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:37.580
All right now, I'm being presented with this message that you likely won't get because I am storing

132
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.140
all of my code changes in a code repository called Get.

133
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.160
Well, actually GitHub using a technology called Get to do so.

134
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:52.700
So it's just asking me if I want to add these newly created files to my jet repository, which I do

135
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.230
want to do.

136
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.090
But don't worry if you don't see this message and you probably won't.

137
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:05.900
So that plug in has now created these four additional property files for all of the language translations

138
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.690
and because we now have this plug in installed.

139
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.760
If I double click on this base one here messages that properties, not that it actually matters.

140
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.860
It doesn't really matter which one you click on, but I just prefer to start off with this bass file

141
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.130
here.

142
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.020
Messages that properties.

143
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.360
And then I'm going to close this pain.

144
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:32.330
OK, so now I'm in this empty little editor here and now I can click the plus sign and create a new

145
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:32.930
key.

146
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.740
So basically, the way this works is every part of my page where I would like to provide an alternate

147
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:46.460
translation needs to have a look up key, which is really just the code that I will use to refer to.

148
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:51.650
So for example, if I wanted to provide a translation, an alternative translation for people list,

149
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.640
then I need to create a key that refers to this text here.

150
00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:01.250
Now, the easiest thing I can think to do right now is just to refer to that key as people dot list,

151
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.770
and you can pretty much put anything there.

152
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.690
So that's what I'm going to use for now.

153
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:11.150
I will tell you this if you're doing this for real in a corporate setting or something like that, you

154
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.100
might want to think these through a little bit better.

155
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:18.650
So maybe a better way to do it would be something like the name of the page or the resource of the page,

156
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.970
which in this case is people.

157
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:26.570
And then the section of the page, which is like the table and then the function of the text.

158
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:33.730
So in that case, maybe I would call it something like people die table dot title, right?

159
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.270
Because it's the title of the table on the people page, right?

160
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.940
And then if I were translating the last name, maybe I would say something like people don't table date,

161
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.300
header dot, last name, something like that.

162
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.830
So if I if you want it to be, like, really, really methodical about it.

163
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.040
But I'm not going to do that for now.

164
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.220
I'm just going to do people that list and tour.

165
00:10:59.270 --> 00:10:59.870
OK, now.

166
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:06.880
I think I had mentioned a bit ago that this plug in crashes a lot and it just crashed for me.

167
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.980
I continue to tolerate using it, though, because even with the crashes, I think it's still saving

168
00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.960
me a lot of time and it's pretty easy for me to get back up and running again by just doing a command

169
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.720
eve and then opening back up that same file.

170
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.900
And here I'm back in business and there's the key that I just created.

171
00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:30.310
And now I've got these little text boxes here where I can provide translations, and every time I go

172
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:34.060
from one box to the other, it's probably going to crash again, but again.

173
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.310
But still, that's kind of OK for now.

174
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:41.440
I'm going to leave the default window here alone, and I will come back to it.

175
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:50.260
So let me provide a translation for French, and I don't know if I already stated it, but I would just

176
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:55.670
simply state that I'm certainly no expert at any of these languages whatsoever.

177
00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:01.400
I have a slightly advanced level of of high school French.

178
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:01.800
OK.

179
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.960
That's basically where I am with with my French here.

180
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.320
OK.

181
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:10.510
So my translations that you will see here may serve as comedy for many of you.

182
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.040
And if so, that's great.

183
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.240
I'm here not only to educate, but occasionally to entertain as well.

184
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:26.920
So for the French Translation for people list, I think I'm going to say something like Liste de Jong.

185
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.720
I have no idea if that's even how French people would say that, but that's how I'm going to say it.

186
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.420
I don't even know would they put the air on?

187
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.120
I think they would.

188
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.570
I don't know.

189
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.010
So anyway, that's fine.

190
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:36.940
It's fine.

191
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.490
This is just for illustrative purposes, OK?

192
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.510
And then I'm going to save that and move on to Japanese.

193
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.450
And when I do this, when I click on this, it's probably going to crash.

194
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.620
Yep, there it goes.

195
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:55.560
So let me just reopen that, come back down here to Japanese and let me switch my keyboard over to Japanese.

196
00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.100
So again, I have no idea how Japanese people would even call something like this.

197
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:05.980
So I'm just going to make up something here, and I'm going to call it stall, which means people or

198
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:11.140
person stall Lisa talk like that.

199
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.340
And I don't know if they even if they were to say this, I don't know if they'd say that or maybe stall.

200
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:15.820
No.

201
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.360
I don't know the list of people I don't know.

202
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.370
So it doesn't matter.

203
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:22.090
Four.

204
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:23.770
For my purposes, it doesn't matter.

205
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.170
This is not a commercial website that I am making.

206
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.430
This is just the G2.

207
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.030
All right.

208
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.200
So that's how I would do that.

209
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.640
And then I will say that.

210
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:36.220
And let me switch my language into Korean and let this crash.

211
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.870
There it is.

212
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.350
It crashed and then reopen it and then come down here to the Korean thing.

213
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:52.080
And now for Korean, I guess I will say something like far sort least these to.

214
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.450
The.

215
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.250
So, yeah, maybe something like that.

216
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.610
And let me switch into English, and I'm going to say that.

217
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:03.690
All right.

218
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:08.760
So there's my first set of translations, very bad translations, I'm pretty sure.

219
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:18.420
And now I will switch over to the template file the people that the email template file here and make

220
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.980
use of these translate.

221
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.050
Oh, I'm sorry, I totally forgot to go back up here to the default.

222
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:23.640
Let me.

223
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.610
So for the default, just so that I can see that something is actually actually changing, what I will

224
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:38.670
do for right now is reopen this and I'm going to grab the Japanese and I'm going to paste that up here.

225
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:44.520
But I'm going to put a little hint that this is like for the default or English or whatever, and then

226
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.360
I'm going to save that.

227
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:53.400
OK, now having done that, I will jump over to the people that HTML file, and here is where I can

228
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.660
show you how to actually use these translations.

229
00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.970
So I will find my text, which is this text right here people list.

230
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.790
Now, I don't actually have to change that.

231
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:07.200
Remember, I told you several lessons ago that one of the cool things about the timely templating framework

232
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:16.470
is that you are able to template ties the and HTML page without modifying how it looks if it's not being

233
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.540
interpreted through timely.

234
00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:26.850
OK, so I can actually leave that text alone and my modification will go inside of the H2 tag that houses

235
00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.680
this this text here.

236
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:33.060
So what I will do is simply use the the text tag of timely.

237
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.790
So that is to call and text equals.

238
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.890
And then I will use a special indicator that means that I want to provide a message.

239
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.090
And so that is the hash tag and curly braces.

240
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:52.170
And then all I need to do is to refer to the code that I provided that stands in for this people list.

241
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.860
And that was all lowercase people list like.

242
00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:02.060
So now let's see what happens when actually cause the spring boot application to to reload here.

243
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:05.100
Oh, and the problem is that I'm not actually running.

244
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.680
So let me restart up my my application here.

245
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.620
There we go.

246
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.860
And now I've got my Japanese here.

247
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:18.300
OK, now let me point out something I wish I had had that running before.

248
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.850
What I wanted, wanted to point out and show is that if you're following along with me and you're making

249
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:30.000
these changes, and if your server had already been running, there's a good chance that when you implemented

250
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.710
this change and restarted everything that you would have gotten some kind of messed up like question

251
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:38.330
marks.

252
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:44.730
And then like people that list something like that and maybe even a people list underscore and underscore

253
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.160
us or something like that, and then some more question marks.

254
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.980
So it would have not looked correct.

255
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:54.120
There's a high probability that that's what you would have gotten if you had followed along with me,

256
00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.040
but your application was already running.

257
00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:03.570
If you get that, what you probably need to do is to explicitly just stop the application with the little

258
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:04.590
stop button here, in fact.

259
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.960
I'll go ahead and just click it now.

260
00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.760
So just stop it and then restart it with the Green Play button.

261
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.640
OK, so let that restart and then go back to your browser and refresh the page.

262
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:29.010
And the reason for that, if you ran into that would likely be because if I open up the envelopes,

263
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:35.520
if I come over here and open up the project pane, the reason for that would likely be because these

264
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:42.750
properties file these property files here may not have gotten picked up on the class path.

265
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:48.450
And I know these words might not be meaning a whole lot to you, but they might not have gotten seen

266
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:56.910
essentially by the JVM if the JVM had always already been running at the time when you created and added

267
00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.300
these files to the project, that might happen.

268
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:00.810
OK.

269
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.780
So to ensure that they definitely did get picked up, if you're getting that that issue, at least you

270
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:13.050
can just start the application and then start it up again, in which case these property files the messages,

271
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:20.430
properties files will then get picked up by the class path of your JVM, and you should be OK then.

272
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.200
All right.

273
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.270
So yeah, we've got our first little bit of the translation there.

274
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:30.030
Now here's an issue, though what if you want to test out the other translations?

275
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:37.560
The way that this is currently working is that the browser is sending in each request a little bit of

276
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.880
local information.

277
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.190
I think I showed that to you before every time we send a request.

278
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.830
In fact, I can just show you that again.

279
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.550
Real quick, I will open up the dev tools and go to network.

280
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:53.790
And if I just refresh this page, that'll trigger a request to be sent, and then I can click on the

281
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:58.980
request there and scroll down to request headers.

282
00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:59.970
And there it is right there.

283
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.550
Accept language in hyphen us.

284
00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:10.200
So what's happening is that's getting sent to the application, and the application doesn't know which

285
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:15.780
of my special property files to use to indicate a message here.

286
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:21.660
So it goes to the default one messages that properties, which is why I put this data here so that I

287
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:26.970
would see something really explicit in international, but I put the Ian on there so that I would know

288
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.460
that, OK, this is my little test one, right?

289
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.810
So now what if I wanted to test out these other translations, though?

290
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:40.050
Well, spring makes that relatively easy to do if you provide a little extra configuration.

291
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.940
So now let me show you how to do that.

292
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.490
So first, let me close that.

293
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:51.960
So if I open up the main Java and go to the main application file here, this is the starting class.

294
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.830
Let me minimize that to get some more room and then close this as well.

295
00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:00.960
So we're in the starting file here, the starting class of the entire project, and it's the starting

296
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:07.900
class because it has the public static void main method in it, which actually starts up our application.

297
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.250
OK.

298
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:16.140
So this file can actually also be used to provide additional configuration for a spring boot application.

299
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.060
Now you don't have to use this file to do this.

300
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:24.450
You could create additional classes yourself, which are used purely for configuration, but you don't

301
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:24.810
have to.

302
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:28.380
You could put configuration information here as well.

303
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.240
And that's what we will do now.

304
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:35.820
First thing to note, I forgot to clear this out between recordings when I was trying things out off

305
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.300
camera.

306
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:43.320
So first thing you're going to want to do is to add this little bit of code here to have your application

307
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.470
class implement the Web MVC configuration class.

308
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:47.850
OK.

309
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:52.920
So this is part of just customizing the configuration of spring boot.

310
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:57.240
We'll come back to that in just a moment, but make sure you get that added and then we're going to

311
00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.050
add a couple of configuration bins, if you will.

312
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:05.820
So I'm just and those will be implemented as additional methods on this class.

313
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:06.240
OK.

314
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:11.910
So the first one will be public and it's going to return something of type low cal resolver.

315
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.360
And it can be called anything, so I will just use what the CDC is recommending.

316
00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:26.340
Like so now normally I would have a verb in them, but these methods are purely for configuration purposes,

317
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.900
so I just kind of don't really care.

318
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:33.570
In this particular case, and then in the body of this, I will create an instance of something called

319
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.330
a session low calorie resolver.

320
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:44.490
And I will just name this SLR for short and then I will create that new instance of that guy.

321
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.550
And then I will configure it.

322
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:54.540
SLR set default locale and I can use a local and I will set my default locale to U.S..

323
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:55.200
OK.

324
00:21:55.470 --> 00:22:00.990
Since I'm in the U.S., but you can choose whatever look how you want or you could even do, and this

325
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.490
might actually not be a bad idea.

326
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.300
Get default, in fact.

327
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:12.450
Let's try to get default and then return SLR, and then you'll need to annotate this method so that

328
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:17.820
spring boot will pick it up and register it as a being.

329
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:18.330
OK.

330
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.290
So the way to do that is just to use the annotation at been.

331
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.130
All right, so there's that, then we need to create another Bean as a method.

332
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:38.810
And this one will return an instance of a local change interceptor and then I will again let the A.D.

333
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.560
suggested method name for this.

334
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:45.180
And here I will simply return a new locale change interceptor.

335
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:51.960
And then again, I will annotate this as a bean, and then the final method will be.

336
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:58.950
And overridden method inherited from this interface web in this in this configuration.

337
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.190
So to override that, I can do a control.

338
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:10.050
Oh, and then the method that I want is ad interceptors, and I will erase this little default code

339
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:16.290
here and I will simply refer to the registry object that is being passed into this method registry,

340
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.180
that ad interceptor.

341
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:23.580
And now here I will simply call this low cal change interceptor method.

342
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.740
So I will call that locale change interceptor method and close that off.

343
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:32.280
And no, being annotation or anything like that is needed for this one.

344
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:33.420
All right.

345
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.060
So I know that's three things that needed to be had.

346
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:40.050
That added, that probably don't make a whole lot of sense to you, but I'll try to remember to come

347
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.370
back and explain what these are doing.

348
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:45.750
But the main thing to know is that this is really just kind of boilerplate code anyway.

349
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.400
So you just kind of needed if you want the functionality that I'm about to show you now.

350
00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:51.270
All right.

351
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.800
So let me go ahead and recompiled this class.

352
00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:57.670
All right.

353
00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:07.780
So now that I've done that, I now will have the ability to specify in the browser what locale I want

354
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:15.580
to see translations for and the way that I can do this by default, is to come up here to the URL and

355
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.290
do a question mark.

356
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:24.610
Locale equals and then I can specify one of those two letter codes that we created the message property

357
00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:25.480
files for.

358
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:29.710
So if I want Korean, for example, I think I said that to Kato.

359
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.660
So let's see what happens here.

360
00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:32.560
Yeah, there we go.

361
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.850
So Saddam, this right?

362
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:40.390
And if I want French f.r, there we go.

363
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.500
List de Jong.

364
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:50.640
And back to Japanese, well, now actually the more real Japanese so told no the story.

365
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:57.650
And then if I leave the two letter code off, this should go back to the default.

366
00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.440
Yes, and it does.

367
00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.610
It goes back to the default.

368
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:04.170
And so now let me change that default translation to English.

369
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:09.840
So I will open up the message that properties file and now I will overwrite this and just say, what

370
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.140
was it?

371
00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:17.640
People, people list say that now, I'm not sure.

372
00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.470
Let's see if this actually will get picked up.

373
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.790
I don't.

374
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:20.640
I guess it will.

375
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.500
It probably will.

376
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:28.050
So I will try doing a command shift f nine instead of an F nine a command F9.

377
00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.330
So looks like that didn't get picked up on its own.

378
00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:31.950
Or at least it didn't trigger a refresh.

379
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:33.570
Let's see what happens over here.

380
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.640
Yeah, that doesn't trigger that.

381
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.750
So let's try a command F9 and see if that will trigger.

382
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:40.930
There we go.

383
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:46.410
OK, so command F9 apparently is needed to trigger that kind of a change.

384
00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:47.390
So be careful there.

385
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.030
Maybe just stick to the command F9 for most cases, in fact.

386
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:52.590
All right.

387
00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:56.730
And I don't know just one more time just for just for grins.

388
00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.900
I want to see that change again.

389
00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:58.440
OK, cool.

390
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.040
So now let's just translate a few more things on this page.

391
00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:04.410
OK, so let's see.

392
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.090
What else do I want to translate?

393
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:13.400
Let's translate last name, so I will add another key four.

394
00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:14.720
I will just call it last.

395
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.940
Oops, last name.

396
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.930
And so for English, I will call that last name.

397
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.040
And save and then this is going to crash.

398
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.920
Oh, it didn't crash this time, I don't know why it didn't, but that's cool.

399
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:30.530
All right.

400
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:31.390
For French?

401
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.570
Let's see more.

402
00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.480
The funnier, maybe, I guess?

403
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:37.990
I don't know.

404
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.150
That's what I'm going to call it.

405
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.620
Mole the.

406
00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.620
Funnier.

407
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:51.440
Say that, and for Japanese, I have no idea what they call it, but I'm going to call it pretty much

408
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:58.430
what I called it in French, but in Japanese, so let me switch to Japanese and that should be Kadokawa,

409
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:59.030
I think.

410
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:01.940
So cool.

411
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:07.820
That might be was a puzzle cause or cool that looks about right.

412
00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.880
I recognized the character for like house or whatever.

413
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.870
So I think that's right.

414
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.040
Khazal cool more.

415
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:16.960
Nah, my.

416
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.340
And that is the character from the.

417
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.070
Ah, that is the kanji for in there, mate.

418
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.900
So we've got casual cool.

419
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:24.710
No Marmite.

420
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:30.090
So again, I have no idea if Japanese people would refer to the last name in this way.

421
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.970
Probably not.

422
00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.680
They probably have a shorter way to say that for all I know.

423
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.940
But again, who cares?

424
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.880
It's just for for playing around.

425
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:38.750
All right.

426
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.960
And then let me switch to Korean.

427
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:52.620
And I think I know this one, I think the Koreans would actually call the last name song, so swap song.

428
00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:57.350
I think that's what they call a family name or surname.

429
00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:58.560
All right.

430
00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.330
So I will say that I don't know why this suddenly isn't isn't crashing now.

431
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.860
I don't know.

432
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:08.380
And let's do one more and we'll do.

433
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.490
First name, I guess.

434
00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:17.360
Oops, and I forgot to switch first name.

435
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:23.000
And so up here, we'll call that first name.

436
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.870
And then down here for French, we will.

437
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.760
I think that's primal.

438
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.090
And I think they use an accent, but I don't remember what the accent is.

439
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:41.160
Sorry, French speakers, I'm not real great with with a lot of your language there, but.

440
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.620
Is it it might be painful?

441
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:46.250
That might be it.

442
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:46.910
I don't know.

443
00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:52.090
And for a Japanese, I will just say, no, my.

444
00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.600
My yeah, that's it.

445
00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.750
And for Korean ID..

446
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.580
E!

447
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:08.470
OK.

448
00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:09.320
All right.

449
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.030
And I think that's enough.

450
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:23.060
OK, so now let me go back over to the template here and find those references and just change them

451
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:23.450
out.

452
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.280
So let's see where his last name right there.

453
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.290
It's right there.

454
00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:28.280
So last name.

455
00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.590
So then I will use it.

456
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.920
Oops.

457
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.580
I always forget to switch back to English to colon.

458
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.200
Text equals.

459
00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.410
Last that name.

460
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:45.080
And then we'll do a h context equals.

461
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:48.980
First name.

462
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.410
Like so.

463
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.890
And let's.

464
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.370
We start and I'm going to try again the control shift f nine.

465
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.360
Yeah, that worked.

466
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:01.280
OK, cool.

467
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:01.500
Yeah.

468
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.600
So that that worked in this particular case.

469
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:05.070
All right.

470
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:13.350
So you can see now that since I'm still in Japanese, that now we're getting as Oakamoor Nama and I

471
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.640
might and then we'll switch over to French.

472
00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:20.840
No familiar and more.

473
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:26.280
And we would date of birth be, I think that would be nay, nay.

474
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:32.710
But I don't know if they I don't I don't know that they have a short form for date of birth in French.

475
00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.090
I'm not sure if they do that or not, by the way.

476
00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:41.820
Notice also now, as I switched to French my month here, those are now getting translated as well.

477
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:42.840
So that's kind of cool.

478
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:49.290
And the way that the money is being displayed is also being translated to the way that people in France,

479
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:50.700
I guess, would write numbers.

480
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.160
So instead of a decimal point, they use a comma.

481
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.620
I would never understand that.

482
00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.110
But OK, cool, whatever.

483
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.750
And then what else?

484
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.700
Co for Korea.

485
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.170
So yeah, there we go.

486
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:10.470
And even here, the months get translated to the more common writing for months.

487
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:15.930
So here they are, just using the numbers and then the word LOL, which means month in Korean.

488
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.430
So I think that's kind of cool.

489
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.410
And did we already have Japanese?

490
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:20.340
I think we started off there.

491
00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:26.610
Now, interestingly, I guess the standard in Japan is that they just use the English, or maybe my

492
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:28.590
use of this code is incorrect or something.

493
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.010
I'm not sure what's going on there.

494
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.070
But let me look up real quick.

495
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:36.080
What is the proper low cal code for Japan?

496
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:40.500
Java Low Cal Code for Japan?

497
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.240
Oh, it's J.

498
00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.380
Ah, OK, J.

499
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.580
So what happens if I do this now?

500
00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:48.870
Yeah, there we go.

501
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:51.120
Okay, yeah, I was at it.

502
00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.110
It, it got.

503
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.790
So it's got so something like that.

504
00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.260
I don't remember how they pronounce it.

505
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.640
So okay, I used the wrong code.

506
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.380
I should have used J instead of JP.

507
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.050
So don't follow my lead on that.

508
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:04.200
Like I said, I kind of just winging this a little bit.

509
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:08.040
So, yeah, I should have named my my file, J.

510
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.030
J.

511
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.460
Actually, in fact, you know, let me let me just see what happens if I try to change that now.

512
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.250
So let's change this shift.

513
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:25.590
That's six change that to a refactor that oh, then that fall out of the bundle now.

514
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:27.210
Let's see.

515
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.120
Can I add that back in to the bundle?

516
00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:29.570
So now?

517
00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.120
So let me show you what just happened here, by the way.

518
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:38.390
I just renamed this file, and now it's no longer included in this message bundle.

519
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.520
OK, so that's kind of not good.

520
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.860
So I need to get this file back into the bundle.

521
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:47.000
Let me see if what happens if I try to drag it in there will let me do that.

522
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:49.210
I'm.

523
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.980
Yeah, maybe maybe that worked, so.

524
00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:03.810
So let's see here if I come over to the browser and I reload and I probably need to restart something.

525
00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.990
Yeah, probably.

526
00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:07.380
So let me do a command, F9.

527
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:17.550
There we go, and so now I've got the Japanese text there, plus the date stuff is is rendering correctly

528
00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:18.900
as well.

529
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.820
All right.

530
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:28.590
So I think that should show you pretty decently how you can provide translations for an entire web site

531
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:29.580
or web application.

532
00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:34.770
As you can probably see, though, it can be rather tedious because you've got to sit there and provide

533
00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:41.520
a code for each and every single bit of text that you want to translate, which is why you're not seeing

534
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.220
me show you the entire page translated.

535
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.880
Not to mention the fact that my translation skills are just not that great.

536
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.560
But at least you do get a chance to see, generally speaking, how this can be done.

537
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:58.200
Now I'm going to take a minute here to just tell you a little bit about my background here, just as

538
00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.770
a little light entertainment, so feel free to stop watching right now.

539
00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:06.420
I haven't told you a whole lot about myself, and I still not planning to tell you very much, I guess,

540
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:12.690
but I will let you know that of early in my software development career, I did work for a major credit

541
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:13.710
card company.

542
00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:18.420
If any of you live in North America, you might know who I'm talking about if I say that my experience

543
00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.650
there was priceless.

544
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:26.520
So I worked for that company for a number of years, working as a web application developer on some

545
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:34.050
of their international websites, and I was hired because I had a level of comfort and familiarity with

546
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.960
certain languages, in particular French.

547
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:42.900
Obviously, I've already proven that I'm not like super ultra fluent in French, but I'm comfortable

548
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:52.230
with the language enough as a programmer that when I was given a HTML template pages to to modify for

549
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:59.400
use in our web applications, I at least could understand what I was reading to a to a fair enough degree.

550
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:05.130
You know, when it says, you know, first name and birth and things of that sort, you know?

551
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:11.670
And this was about 20 years ago, by the way, though, I haven't done a whole lot of it in recent years.

552
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.130
But I mean, this is the gist right here.

553
00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:21.180
So I will say this if you do plan to do any of this type of internationalization for oh, and by the

554
00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:28.440
way, internationalization in computing is often referred to as i18n, I guess, because the word internationalization,

555
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.530
I suppose, has 20 letters in it and it starts with an AI and it ends with an RN.

556
00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.120
And so that you've got the other 18 letters in the middle.

557
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:39.990
So it's called internationalization or i18n.

558
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.500
OK.

559
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:49.740
So if you do plan to internationalize any or localize any of your applications along the lines of what

560
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:56.760
I'm showing you here, do yourself a favor and be really careful if you're going to use tools like Google

561
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.720
Translator and stuff like that.

562
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:04.710
Hopefully, since again, more than half of you are at least bilingual because you're listening to me,

563
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:08.820
speak English to you, and you're probably not in a primarily English speaking country.

564
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.840
You probably already understand these concepts as well or better than most.

565
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:20.070
But obviously, like even here, the translations that I am kind of half jokingly providing, you just

566
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.570
need to be a little bit careful.

567
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:28.470
You know, sometimes even something, even a tool as good as Google Translate, maybe it will lack context

568
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.640
of what you're trying to translate.

569
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:34.350
OK, and sometimes those translations just won't make a lot of sense.

570
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:42.150
So do yourself a favor and find a native speaker to confirm or verify or just get proper translations

571
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.520
from.

572
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:48.840
Oh, and and so now let's also take a quick look at what these configuration stuff is doing.

573
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.900
So let me just say this quickly.

574
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:52.890
All right.

575
00:36:52.890 --> 00:37:00.540
So these two beans, basically what they are doing is this so this interceptor here will look for the

576
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.920
presence of this little parameter locale equals blah blah blah.

577
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:09.690
Now that can be configured to not look for the word locale, I could configure that to look for some

578
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:12.360
other word, but by default, it looks for the word locale.

579
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:21.420
And so if that word is present on the on the URL here as a parameter, it will use whatever value is

580
00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.780
set on there as part of the locale key.

581
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:25.290
OK.

582
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.820
And then that will essentially get stored in what is called a session.

583
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.600
Now, I don't think I'm going to be able to take a lot of time to explain session right now.

584
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:40.920
But basically, session is a way to remember information in your web application from one request to

585
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:41.460
the next.

586
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:45.100
Beyond the scope of just one request from the browser.

587
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:52.830
OK, so like if I set a word like, well, if I set locale equals day on the session scope and then

588
00:37:52.830 --> 00:38:00.710
the browser kept sending new requests, that locale equals a would always be remembered for a while

589
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.860
for a good long while.

590
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:07.270
As long as I was kind of in this web application, that's the short description of what session is OK?

591
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.090
Is this a way of remembering things?

592
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:09.760
B.

593
00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:17.060
The scope of just one request, and so actually, if I were to take this locale off and then hit enter,

594
00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:24.110
I will still be in Japanese, OK, because that locale equals, say, a thing is now being remembered

595
00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:27.590
in the session of this application for me.

596
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:33.830
Now, if another person on another browser or to visit this same web page, in fact, let me show you

597
00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:36.380
that I will use a different browser.

598
00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.610
I will use Safari.

599
00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:43.840
Let me bring that over here, and I will go to local host AT&amp;T slash people.

600
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:44.510
There we go.

601
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.120
And now see here this is in English.

602
00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:52.220
So over here I'm in Japanese, and if I refresh, I'm still in Japanese.

603
00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:59.120
But over here in a completely different browser and a completely different session, I'm in English

604
00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.130
and if I refresh, I'm in English now.

605
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:08.450
If I changed this to oops, too low cal equals let's do Korean.

606
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:12.830
So now I'm in Korean over here, and then if I refresh, I will continue to be in Korean.

607
00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:19.430
But if I come over here, I will continue to be in Japanese and I can erase the locale and I will still

608
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:21.830
stay in Korean over here.

609
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:22.310
OK.

610
00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:26.590
So that gives you a little example of what S. does.

611
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:34.130
It just remembers some settings across multiple requests until it times out, or you programmatically

612
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:36.710
kill the session for the given user.

613
00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.160
OK.

614
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:38.030
All right.

615
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:41.360
So with that, I'm going to go ahead and close out this lesson.

616
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:43.970
And I think this was a pretty useful one.

617
00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:49.370
So feel free to go ahead and fully internationalize the entire page, especially for those of you for

618
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:51.080
whom English is not your first language.

619
00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:55.760
You will at least will know how to translate into your own native language better than I can.

620
00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.940
All right, so with that, I will see you in the next one.
