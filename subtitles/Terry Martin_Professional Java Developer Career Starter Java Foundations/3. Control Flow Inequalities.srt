1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,560
All right, there's one more scenario that I want to talk a little bit about.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:13,980
If you'll recall back in the chapter on numbers and things, we had a lesson on equalities and inequalities.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,200
So we've already seen a couple of examples of that here with the equals and the not equals.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:27,360
But just to be a little more thorough, let's also make sure that we recall from that previous lesson.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,640
In fact, they said in that lesson that we revisit equalities when we got to right here where we're

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,680
learning about conditionals and things.

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,170
These are conditionals, by the way, these these if then else type constructs are sometimes referred

8
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,370
to as conditionals.

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,230
So anyway, let's see.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,060
Another thing that we could do is something like, let me see here.

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,150
Let's let's simplify this a lot.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:09,210
So let's say if random number is less than or equal to two else, if random number is greater, greater

13
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,170
than or equal to four.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,370
Then we'll make the color blue.

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,340
Else the color is green.

16
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,590
OK, so.

17
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,630
Let's see what this would would really do then.

18
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:43,930
So what we're saying is one two three four five six seven eight.

19
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,550
All right.

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:53,770
So what we're saying is if the random number is two or less, then the color will be red.

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,370
If the number is four or more than the number will be blue.

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,370
Otherwise, if it's three, then it's going to be green.

23
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,280
That's really what this logic is saying now.

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,210
I just randomly picked some numbers here, so I didn't even consciously think that we were leaving three

25
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,840
as the left over right.

26
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,990
But that's what we're saying.

27
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,340
OK.

28
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,940
Anything two or less?

29
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,760
Anything four or greater.

30
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,710
And then three is on its own.

31
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,670
OK.

32
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,620
So I just wanted to show that we can also use these inequalities.

33
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,190
And of course, you know, you don't have to have equal sign there.

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,990
You could just say if the random number is less than two, which would mean one in this case, right?

35
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:44,740
If it's greater than four, then that would mean five and up and then anything else would mean three

36
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,490
or four.

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,640
So, you know, that's another way of doing some logic.

38
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,690
All right.

39
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,440
Let's see.

40
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:58,960
And then one other thing that I would like to show is you can actually build compound statements within

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,760
the if blocks as well.

42
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,770
So using using logic, and what I mean by that is, let's say.

43
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,140
So we could say something now I'm just making up a really random scenario here.

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,940
If the number is, let's say, greater than four and some other criteria.

45
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,330
So the way that you can say and here is with two ampersand.

46
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:25,900
OK.

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,940
And this comes from logic.

48
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,450
OK.

49
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:37,270
So we can say if the random number is greater than four and let's say it's an even number.

50
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,760
OK, so how could we say an even number?

51
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,940
Can you think of a way to say and random number is an even number?

52
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,170
Give you a moment to think about that.

53
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,580
Why don't you pause the video?

54
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:58,900
OK, so if we wanted to say greater than four and an even number, what we could do is something like

55
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,880
random number.

56
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,240
Now do you know what the key is here modulo?

57
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:13,480
Do you remember that modulo so random num modulo two equals zero?

58
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:21,730
Now I could leave it like this, but personally, there's a kind of a lot going on in here, and I would

59
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,200
prefer I would feel better.

60
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,520
I would sleep better at night if this bit here was grouped in its own parentheses.

61
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,080
And so what I just did there?

62
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,970
Let me do that again.

63
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,650
I was talking while I was doing it, so what I can do or what you can do is you can select all of this

64
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,490
in intelligence.

65
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,710
This may not work in all Ides.

66
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,520
Select all of that.

67
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:50,620
And then if you enter a opening parentheses until a j, modern versions of it will automatically give

68
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:57,610
you the closing parentheses, then assume you're trying to surround that selected text with parentheses.

69
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,880
Now, I don't absolutely have to have that there, but I think that makes it a little more obvious that

70
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:12,040
we're saying if the random number is greater than four and the random number is an even number now,

71
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,050
why would this mean an even number?

72
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,020
Do you recall the reason this means in even numbers?

73
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:26,800
Because if you may recall modulo this operator here returns the remainder of division between this number

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,480
and this number, the number to the left of the modulo in the number to the right of the modulo.

75
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:40,420
So if the number is six, then this will be six divided by two, which would be three with the remainder

76
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,600
of zero, which means that this is an even number.

77
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,230
OK.

78
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,790
Whereas if this were seven, which is, you know, greater than four.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,970
But if this were seven seven divided by two gives a remainder of one.

80
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,510
Right.

81
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,550
And so this would not be true.

82
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:04,090
And so the way that this will evaluate is that this entire thing won't be true because with this and

83
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,200
here, what we're saying is both of these clauses have to be true.

84
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,020
In order for the whole entire thing to be true.

85
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:20,440
So not only does random number have to be greater than four also or and random number modulo two equals

86
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:20,860
zero.

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,650
Basically, this all comes out to say random number has to be an even number.

88
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,160
OK.

89
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,650
That's what this whole thing is saying.

90
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,370
And so you can string together clauses like this and you could put more, although I would not recommend

91
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:43,180
doing it because you don't want the bits that are inside of the if clause to become like a big, huge

92
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,500
monstrosity of code.

93
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,590
I wouldn't usually go to much more than around this in most cases, right?

94
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,770
But you could keep stringing together more stuff if you wanted to.

95
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,500
And then you can also use other logic, though the really, I'd say, probably the only other logic

96
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:06,040
construct that you may see from time to time within an f block like this would be an order clause,

97
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,000
and that would be like this to pipe symbols.

98
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:10,600
OK.

99
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:19,020
So then this would say if random number is greater than four or it is evenly divisible by two or an

100
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:26,350
even number right, then this whole thing will evaluate to true and then we can proceed to the next

101
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,020
line.

102
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,130
So constructs like this really make these conditionals or these f blocks.

103
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:39,250
And if patterns really powerful, obviously now you could put this kind of construct on inside of any

104
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,270
of these f blocks.

105
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,890
By the way, I just randomly chose this middle one here, so which one I put it on doesn't really matter.

106
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,460
All right.

107
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,030
So that's going to wrap this up, and I will see you in the next one.
