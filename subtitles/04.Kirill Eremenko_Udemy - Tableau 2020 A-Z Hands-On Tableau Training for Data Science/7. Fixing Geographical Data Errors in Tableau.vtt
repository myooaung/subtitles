00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.110
Hello and welcome back to the course on tableau.

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.770
And today we're talking about errors that you can get in maps.

3
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.970
And this we're talking about some specific errors which are related to data.

4
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.700
So let's have a look at that.

5
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.750
Here we've got the chart that we carried last time.

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.220
And this is for the number of personal vehicles sold in different regions.

7
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.050
Now we're going to go back to the data source and here you can see that we've got different regions

8
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.250
which are not recognized as a geographical location doesn't have this globe here because they are kind

9
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.640
of selected by us or by the person who was creating this data.

10
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.910
So they're very specific.

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.950
But at the same time the countries are recognized as a geographical location because you can see this

12
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.920
globe here.

13
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.390
So we're going to take advantage of that and create a map.

14
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.730
So let's just create a new worksheet.

15
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.620
Maybe this one will call something like relative

16
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.880
cars sold.

17
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.320
And this one we will call map OK.

18
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.310
We're going take a country and as we're used to we'll just drag it onto our worksheet and right away

19
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.750
we've got a map that came up and what we can do now is we will take vehicles sold and drag it into color.

20
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.650
And so now our map is colored based on number of vehicles.

21
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.990
And let's not forget right away with these time series data when we're working with it we have to remember

22
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.650
that if we're not visualizing the time series we have to filter by it.

23
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.410
So we'll take a year and put it into a filter and maybe I'll just select two thousand five OK and we'll

24
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.210
bring up a filter so show quick filter.

25
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.020
We obviously don't need all anymore and we'll just have a sliding scale so we can only select one year.

26
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.290
OK.

27
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.880
That's great.

28
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.380
But now have a look here at the bottom of the map.

29
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.860
You can see here six unknown.

30
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.060
What does that mean.

31
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.220
What does six unknowns mean.

32
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.370
Well let's click on it.

33
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.260
You can click on it and we'll all come up here it says that there are six values that have unknown geographical

34
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.180
locations what do you want to do.

35
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.130
You can edit locations you can filter the data or you can show data at a default position.

36
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.150
So I don't recommend data at default position filter data.

37
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.900
That just means kind of exclude these values that are not recognized so we'll controls that because

38
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.820
we don't want to exclude them right away.

39
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.440
We want to see if we can fix the error.

40
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.190
So here just go ahead and click edit locations and right away at the top you can see the six locations

41
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.130
that have not been identified.

42
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.410
So let's go ahead and fix them up.

43
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.630
So Burkina why has it not been identified.

44
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.350
Well let's try typing in Burkina and see what tableau has said will help Burkina Faso.

45
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.270
So let's click Burkina Faso and click OK.

46
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.310
And as you can see there somewhere there there Burkina has come up so it wasn't there.

47
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.010
So if I press controls that it's not there because they're recognized now it has come up because tableau

48
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.600
knows where to put it and is displaying the name that we have in the data Burkina.

49
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:18.640
But he knows tableau now knows that this location is actually geo coded to the one we've selected.

50
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.900
All right.

51
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.600
So let's go for the next one.

52
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.850
Let's skip Congo for now.

53
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.480
Let's go to Kazakhstan.

54
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.350
As you can see here it's kind of misspelt.

55
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.500
So it's actually Kazakh stand ups.

56
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.190
So there is an H in there.

57
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.820
So we select that and you will see this bit over here will come up.

58
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.100
So we'll click OK.

59
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.410
And as you can see Kazakhstan has been recognized.

60
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.040
That's great.

61
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:52.150
So as we slowly fixing up our map obviously Switzerland plus ifl should be just Switzerland and Tahiti

62
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.670
in Tableau is French Polynesia

63
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.750
and then Turkmenistan.

64
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.250
There is an R in the word too.

65
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.740
You see these are like data errors that you might not pick up right away in your data preparation phase.

66
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.360
So now you'll see all of these up here.

67
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.190
So there you go this Turkmenistan Switzerland appeared somewhere here.

68
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.840
And French Polynesia I'm not really sure where to find it right now.

69
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.060
But anyway so let's go back to the unknowns here you can see we've got Congo and it's unrecognized.

70
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:37.230
And if we start typing in Congo there's two types of Congo's Brownsville and the other one can shatter

71
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.610
and we like right now.

72
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:46.230
I don't know which Congo this daughter refers to so I can either investigate and find out where which

73
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.860
Congo is the correct one or if you don't have time or you don't really mind not having this element

74
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.250
of dawning realisation you can just cancel that and this one unknown you can filter the data and just

75
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.920
not have it at all so you know you can see that there is no Congo illustrated on the map.

76
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.710
And yeah that's the other way of doing it.

77
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.530
But I do encourage you to first check if you can fix up the data sometimes like we don't have an example

78
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.030
of this right now.

79
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.800
But sometimes you will find that say if you're dealing with cities and just say you're dealing with

80
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.280
cities in one country in the US for instance and you drag them onto the map and you find that nothing

81
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.510
is shown on the map.

82
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.050
Well that's because you need to tell tableau that you are dealing with the US.

83
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:37.770
So if you have a field for us then you just create a hierarchy as we used to do and that way everything

84
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:48.080
we find or if there is no field for the US then in map here you can one winter when you're adding location

85
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.900
you can just specify your actual country so you don't have to.

86
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.160
You'll have you'll see how to do that tableau will actually prompt you here and allow you to specify

87
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.110
the country you're working with.

88
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.500
So you'll if you're working with the U.S. you just specify us and then you'll recognize the cities and

89
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.760
that is because some some cities are duplicated in different countries so there's a Moscow in Russia

90
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.710
and there's a Moscow and in the U.S. and there's a Sydney in Australia.

91
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.220
I think there's another Sydney in the US and or Newcastle there's one in Australia and there's one in

92
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.790
the UK.

93
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.270
So tableau needs to know which country it's dealing with if it can't only go by the city or the States.

94
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.930
So sometimes you have to supply that additional information if it's not in your data and the hierarchy

95
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.380
hasn't been created.

96
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.640
OK.

97
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:39.810
So that's what we've done and what I wanted to show you here is that if you click through these years

98
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:48.840
you can see how the number of cars sold is changing through out our map and it'd be really cool to see

99
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.500
this as a visualization.

100
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.010
So if if you're interested in.

101
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.260
I mean really cool to see this as an animation.

102
00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.020
So I just wanted to give you a heads up.

103
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.060
I do have an advanced course on Tableau so if you're interested in things like animations and more advanced

104
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.420
topics and Tableau make sure to check that out.

105
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:13.590
And that will help you take your tableau skills to a Jedi level but that's all for us for today and

106
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.840
I'll look forward to seeing you next time.

107
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.820
And until then happy analyzing.
