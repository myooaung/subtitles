00:00:00.510  -->  00:00:02.830
Hello and welcome back so of course I'm Tablo.

2

00:00:02.910  -->  00:00:05.350
And Congratulations on completing this course.

3

00:00:05.520  -->  00:00:06.860
And this this is you.

4

00:00:06.870  -->  00:00:08.530
You're a daughter rockstar.

5

00:00:08.640  -->  00:00:12.100
Well Dan if I could send you this last that I totally would.

6

00:00:12.220  -->  00:00:13.460
You have so deserved it.

7

00:00:13.460  -->  00:00:18.510
You have been through all or at least most of the sections have done all these exercises learning these

8

00:00:18.510  -->  00:00:22.120
new techniques and skills and methods of viz..

9

00:00:22.290  -->  00:00:28.490
And I really hope that now you're feeling very confident in your power to work of using Tablo.

10

00:00:28.590  -->  00:00:33.970
And I also hope that you enjoyed the journey along the way that we had in this course and what we're

11

00:00:33.990  -->  00:00:38.970
going to do today is I'm going to jump behind the computer and we will look through a list of topics

12

00:00:38.970  -->  00:00:43.940
that we covered often just refresh on the key takeaways that we have from the different sections.

13

00:00:44.020  -->  00:00:49.570
And then I'll jump right back here and wish you farewell on your journey into the world of data.

14

00:00:49.590  -->  00:00:51.450
So let's get straight into it.

15

00:00:51.470  -->  00:00:56.130
All right back behind the computer here and in front of us we've got the sections of the course listed

16

00:00:56.130  -->  00:00:56.150
.

17

00:00:56.150  -->  00:01:01.930
So sections 2 to 7 and we're going to break them down into these three categories.

18

00:01:01.950  -->  00:01:05.940
So I've actually really analyzed the lectures and I will present you information.

19

00:01:05.960  -->  00:01:11.280
Kind of like a map where you can find which type of information which section so whether or not there

20

00:01:11.280  -->  00:01:18.060
was information relating to Joy joining daughter connecting to daughter creating extracts within a certain

21

00:01:18.060  -->  00:01:18.900
section.

22

00:01:19.110  -->  00:01:24.570
That's the red category blue category conceptual means things like creating calculated fields and how

23

00:01:24.570  -->  00:01:28.810
Tablo works in the background and the fundamentals of Tablo.

24

00:01:28.920  -->  00:01:35.730
And finally the green category is information within a section where you all were we looked at a new

25

00:01:35.880  -->  00:01:42.540
way of visualizing data where there is a bar chart a pie chart or we worked with dashboard so the aspects

26

00:01:42.540  -->  00:01:45.390
of our work that affect the visual representation of data.

27

00:01:45.480  -->  00:01:49.410
So let's have a look at that section to Table of basics.

28

00:01:49.410  -->  00:01:55.980
Your first bar chart here we connect to a CACP file so that's our daughter category in the conceptual

29

00:01:57.060  -->  00:02:02.470
category we've got to calculate feel when she you start right away at the start of the course and then

30

00:02:02.470  -->  00:02:08.040
in visualization we learn to how to do a bar chart how to add colors labels formatting and exporting

31

00:02:08.040  -->  00:02:08.640
.

32

00:02:08.640  -->  00:02:14.120
Next in section 3 we learned how to connect an excel file and we learned how to do.

33

00:02:14.130  -->  00:02:21.390
Data extracts in terms of in terms of conceptual information about Tablo her works we learned how to

34

00:02:21.600  -->  00:02:24.990
visualize a time series as a measure and as a dimension.

35

00:02:24.990  -->  00:02:32.400
So there's two different ways we learned about aggregation and granularity so that granularity of your

36

00:02:32.400  -->  00:02:40.050
view is dependent on the items that you have dragged into that view and aggregation happens at the granularity

37

00:02:40.050  -->  00:02:40.470
of your view.

38

00:02:40.470  -->  00:02:46.440
So a very important section that we learned to add filters and we learned how to operate quick filters

39

00:02:46.440  -->  00:02:46.780
.

40

00:02:47.040  -->  00:02:52.650
Next in the visualization category we've got line charts shapes to show me functionality.

41

00:02:52.740  -->  00:02:59.040
We create an area chart and we learn how to use highlighting to our advantage when we're investigating

42

00:02:59.040  -->  00:03:02.870
data for trends and anomalies and so on.

43

00:03:02.880  -->  00:03:07.420
So that was quite a quite a packed section lots of new information there.

44

00:03:07.440  -->  00:03:13.330
Section number four we learnt daughter joins in the data category in the conceptual Category 1.

45

00:03:13.340  -->  00:03:19.590
Quite a lot because we started working with our first dashboard so we had hierarchy's which is relating

46

00:03:19.650  -->  00:03:25.890
mostly to maps but you can also definitely can and should use hierarchies in other situations when hierarchies

47

00:03:25.920  -->  00:03:32.160
are present in your data will learn how to apply a filter to multiple sheets which is also useful when

48

00:03:32.160  -->  00:03:37.710
creating dashboards and then in terms of dashboards we learn how to add charts or dashboards how to

49

00:03:37.710  -->  00:03:41.150
add a quick filter how to add in action filters.

50

00:03:41.160  -->  00:03:47.270
So making our dashboard interactive and via filtering and also how to make our dashboard interactive

51

00:03:47.280  -->  00:03:52.890
by highlighting I really learned the difference between the filter action the highlight action and how

52

00:03:53.160  -->  00:03:59.980
they differ in the background of tablet while they can produce very different results at time and visualization

53

00:03:59.980  -->  00:04:00.290
.

54

00:04:00.330  -->  00:04:02.060
We learned how to create a map.

55

00:04:02.090  -->  00:04:04.060
We learned how to play circles onto that map.

56

00:04:04.060  -->  00:04:05.720
We learned how to create a scatterplot.

57

00:04:05.910  -->  00:04:14.010
And we also learned about Dashboard layouts how to add different worksheets to a dashboard and how to

58

00:04:14.670  -->  00:04:17.520
operate where they're located on that dashboard.

59

00:04:17.820  -->  00:04:22.410
So that was an interesting section because we introduced dashboards for the first time.

60

00:04:22.650  -->  00:04:28.530
Then we kind of took a step aside and we focused on the data side of things a daughter theory we learned

61

00:04:28.920  -->  00:04:35.820
about the join theory so completely from scratch even if you have no idea about what Joines are in this

62

00:04:35.820  -->  00:04:37.900
section we picked that up.

63

00:04:37.950  -->  00:04:40.710
We learned about blending data and finally the showdown.

64

00:04:40.710  -->  00:04:42.690
We looked adjoining versus blending data.

65

00:04:42.690  -->  00:04:48.590
A very interesting topic which a lot of people underestimate the power of.

66

00:04:48.690  -->  00:04:56.150
So it's always good to get this covered off in terms of your foundation of Tablo in terms of conceptual

67

00:04:56.150  -->  00:05:01.290
will learn how to create calculated fields in a blend that's more of an advance topic which you will

68

00:05:01.290  -->  00:05:04.710
definitely need at some point so whenever you do need it come back.

69

00:05:04.710  -->  00:05:05.810
Review this course.

70

00:05:05.870  -->  00:05:12.120
Watch that lecture because it will really help you out when you're creating Calcott fields and using

71

00:05:12.120  -->  00:05:17.700
two different data sources which have been blended and in terms of visualization we added a new visualization

72

00:05:17.700  -->  00:05:19.790
item a dual axis chart.

73

00:05:20.220  -->  00:05:24.030
It's a very powerful feature of Tablo because it allows you to save space.

74

00:05:24.090  -->  00:05:26.000
You can put one chart behind the other.

75

00:05:26.010  -->  00:05:32.400
It also allows you to compare them visually or their user to compare them visually when they're together

76

00:05:32.490  -->  00:05:32.740
.

77

00:05:32.780  -->  00:05:35.870
And very important as Susie create a dual axis chart.

78

00:05:36.000  -->  00:05:41.930
Don't forget to centralize the axes because that's a lot of a lot of mistakes are made that way in table

79

00:05:41.940  -->  00:05:42.010
.

80

00:05:42.020  -->  00:05:48.420
We also covered that off in this section and then we went onto the heavy artillery.

81

00:05:48.420  -->  00:05:54.080
We talked about advanced Dasch boarding table calculations storytelling in section 6.

82

00:05:54.090  -->  00:06:01.560
So in terms of conceptual we learned about a geographic roles how you can tell Tablo which items in

83

00:06:01.560  -->  00:06:06.780
your data are actually Geographic roles if it doesn't pick them up automatically we'll learn about table

84

00:06:06.780  -->  00:06:07.890
calculations.

85

00:06:07.890  -->  00:06:14.100
A very powerful feature probably because conceivably a lot of manual work it can calculate the percentage

86

00:06:14.100  -->  00:06:21.330
of total running totals all different types of moving averages calculations that have to be done across

87

00:06:21.330  -->  00:06:22.250
your table.

88

00:06:22.260  -->  00:06:23.400
We'll learn about that.

89

00:06:23.400  -->  00:06:28.320
We learn how to create Binz in Tablo and Binz we need them for distributions.

90

00:06:28.440  -->  00:06:34.350
And that is a very easy procedure to create bins and we also learned how to use parameters to our advantage

91

00:06:34.350  -->  00:06:41.040
in Tablo to make our dashboards very easily adjustable and that also helps with the process of data

92

00:06:41.040  -->  00:06:42.410
discovery.

93

00:06:42.480  -->  00:06:49.950
And finally in terms of his position in the section we learned about a field map we learned how to create

94

00:06:49.980  -->  00:06:54.030
a pie chart with Learn how to create distributions and how to create a tree map.

95

00:06:54.090  -->  00:07:00.960
And we talked about storylines and how you can create a storyline to present to your audience.

96

00:07:00.960  -->  00:07:08.370
And finally in Section 7 and section to make sure we cover off all the data preparation steps because

97

00:07:08.430  -->  00:07:16.950
our data operation is indeed a very heavy and intensive part of our work as a scientists might take

98

00:07:16.950  -->  00:07:19.040
up to 70 percent of our time.

99

00:07:19.140  -->  00:07:24.360
And so Tableau can make your daughter preparation much easier if you use the following tools that we

100

00:07:24.360  -->  00:07:25.360
discussed.

101

00:07:25.440  -->  00:07:30.420
These are the daughter interpretor in Tablo which can read your daughter and tell you where it thinks

102

00:07:30.420  -->  00:07:35.820
the headers are and with things her daughter is the pivot which allows you to quickly pivot your daughter

103

00:07:36.180  -->  00:07:39.560
while you're connecting to it in Tablo.

104

00:07:39.630  -->  00:07:45.590
The advantage of a splitting call them so very powerful when you can't manipulate your data set when

105

00:07:45.600  -->  00:07:51.030
is for example coming from a database or somewhere you can split things like name and surname into separate

106

00:07:51.030  -->  00:07:51.960
columns.

107

00:07:51.960  -->  00:07:57.960
The metadata grid which allows you to polish up the presentation of your data change column names and

108

00:07:57.960  -->  00:08:03.650
see where everything's coming from so kind of like a control center for your daughter connection and

109

00:08:03.720  -->  00:08:04.860
fixing up map areas.

110

00:08:04.860  -->  00:08:09.210
We also talked about that what errors can come up and that in maps and how you can easily fix them in

111

00:08:09.210  -->  00:08:10.120
Tablo.

112

00:08:10.620  -->  00:08:10.920
All right.

113

00:08:10.920  -->  00:08:11.850
Hope that was helpful.

114

00:08:11.850  -->  00:08:18.300
You can find this PowerPoint presentation in your course resources and that will help you always to

115

00:08:18.300  -->  00:08:23.310
remember where which topics are covered off and if you need to refresh on something you can always come

116

00:08:23.310  -->  00:08:25.520
back to the right section very quickly.

117

00:08:25.830  -->  00:08:30.660
So those are the topics we covered off and I really hope that you had fun learning in this course and

118

00:08:30.660  -->  00:08:34.070
if it did enjoy my teaching self then this doesn't have to be a goodbye.

119

00:08:34.170  -->  00:08:35.820
You can always take on my other courses.

120

00:08:35.970  -->  00:08:40.710
It's very easy to do you just need to go to my profile and you'll see all the courses I have on offer

121

00:08:40.860  -->  00:08:43.610
and perhaps there's some other skill that you would like to learn.

122

00:08:43.620  -->  00:08:46.650
It would be very exciting to see in my other courses.

123

00:08:46.860  -->  00:08:48.800
And don't forget to leave a review for this course.

124

00:08:48.810  -->  00:08:50.150
I look forward to seeing you next then.

125

00:08:50.160  -->  00:08:51.720
Until then I'd be analyzing
