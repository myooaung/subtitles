Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau.

2
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.580
In the previous tutorial we learned how to combine clusters and trend lines and what powerful insights

3
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.450
we can derive from such analysis.

4
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.110
And I hope that you had a chance to play around with that and really let that knowledge sink in because

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.980
indeed it is a very powerful tool that now you have in your arsenal and it's just going to be very satisfying

6
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.410
when you find situations in your analytics when you'll be able to apply this kind of approach or something

7
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.920
similar.

8
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.860
And today we're going to talk about saving this cluster.

9
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.670
So now I had had these clusters How do I actually save them to perform further analytics with them on

10
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.280
other sheets for example so if I want to create a new sheet how do I carry those clusters onto the sheet

11
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.090
as well.

12
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.800
Well one way of course it would be to recreate the cluster is again and in our new resolution but to

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.480
create the clusters every time is going to be quite tedious.

14
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.130
So there is a faster way.

15
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.250
All we have to do is take clusters from here hold down control and drag them into dimensions.

16
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.430
And so what that creates is it creates a group.

17
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.900
Once again I know we haven't spoken about groups for now it's just a convenient tool for us to have.

18
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.820
You can always learn more about groups if you decide to check out the advanced course but otherwise

19
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.510
religious right click and rename this group and we'll call it clusters all is discord our clusters just

20
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.880
so that we remember that we created this group ourselves and if we go to sheet six let's see how we

21
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.850
can use this group let's say I want to put it into color and then I want to put it into columns and

22
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.460
now I want to look at the average population per cluster.

23
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.140
That'll be interesting something that we were curious about previously.

24
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:54.440
So let's right click drag population into label C average and maybe let's copy that into the rows.

25
00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.560
So here you can see right away what the result looks like orange cluster indeed has the highest average

26
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.150
population.

27
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.050
Blue has medium and red has the lowest average population.

28
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.400
So that's how quickly we can move our clusters to different sheets.

29
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.270
It's a very easy and handy way to save them as groups like that.

30
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:22.670
And another example would be if we plot our cities or this plot our state on the map and then expanded

31
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.210
to cities and here if we want to quickly see which cities are from where we can just take our clusters

32
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.570
and put them into color and then we go right away we can see how these cities where they are located

33
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.270
and you can select so we can gradually increase the size further or we can connect the size to something

34
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.060
else.

35
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.380
For example we can put revenue on size and add some transparency and then you can move around the colors.

36
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.900
So let's say we can put the red ones on top because there that we know that they're small maybe add

37
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.420
a border so that they look nice.

38
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.020
So there we go.

39
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.220
Now we know how to not only create clusters but also use them in our analysis and use them across different

40
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.340
sheets and different visualizations that we're creating.

41
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.310
So hopefully this knowledge will come in useful for you one day and you'll be able to perform a cluster

42
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.520
analytics on your data sets as well as you can see it's a very powerful feature that is integrated into

43
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.570
tableau.

44
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.280
And on that note we're going to complete the sartorial I look forward to see you next time.

45
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.760
And until then happy analyzing.
