00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.130
Hello this is Carol and a warm welcome back to the course on Tableau.

2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.330
Happy to see you here.

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.230
Last time we left off after creating our first calculate field which is total sales and you can see

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.140
it over here on the left I just wanted to mention that creating calculated field is a very important

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.250
aspect of working of Tableau because you will often find that the data that you have does not have the

6
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.480
right level or does not have the right variables for you to work with.

7
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.580
It does have the information there but it's not in the right format it's not aggregated properly or

8
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.450
correctly for your needs or it doesn't have the right level of detail or or other things so you will

9
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.920
be inevitably working a lot of calculated fields.

10
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.350
This was a very simple example of a calculated field where we just multiplied two values but tableau

11
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:07.770
has very vast functionality in this space and allows you to create just insanely helpful calculated

12
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.110
fields and we will be working with them going forward.

13
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.550
So that's why I kind of put it at the beginning of the course.

14
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.870
You get used to it.

15
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.960
As we get it go along.

16
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.220
All right.

17
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.360
So today we're talking about colors.

18
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.390
Colors are important because as you'll probably hear me say quite often data science is not just about

19
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.710
crunching numbers.

20
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.690
It's a form of art.

21
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.340
It's a form of communication.

22
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.840
It's it's a very creative activity or profession.

23
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.850
So get get used to work or colors you will you will need this skill.

24
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.160
OK.

25
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.270
So let's get straight into it.

26
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.790
How can we color this chart.

27
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.530
Imagine that this picture has to go into a presentation for the executives of the company who will be

28
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.950
distributing these bonuses or maybe even this picture will be

29
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.320
hung up somewhere on a wall so that everybody can see so you don't want it to be playing like this you

30
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.990
wanted to be colorful and bright.

31
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.950
So we need to use this color button over here and there are many different ways that we can do it.

32
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.640
First of all what we can do right away is just change the color.

33
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.960
We can change it to red.

34
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.900
We can change to green we can change to basically any color.

35
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.950
And that's kind of the basic thing that you can do here which you can choose more colors and then you

36
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.300
can choose.

37
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.580
You can choose even more colors.

38
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.810
It's all it's all under control here.

39
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.870
What else you can do is you can change the transparency but there's nothing behind it so there's not

40
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.590
much point you can at a border make that border thicker.

41
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.640
Think or make that change the color of the border if you want but we won't be doing that right now as

42
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.300
well.

43
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.900
What we want.

44
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.060
We want kind of the colors to differ from bar to bar so the first thing you can do is you can take your

45
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.090
representative and let's say from here and drag him onto the color button.

46
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.620
And what that will do is we'll give each representative a unique color and we'll give you a code legend

47
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.890
over here.

48
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.240
So as you can see the color legend matches your column names.

49
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.140
So Matthew is blue Matthew's blue here Susan's light blue suit is light here as well.

50
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.140
I wanted to show you a quick tip here as well.

51
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.490
So by the way going forward I'll be showing you quick tips along the way which I will be using just

52
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.020
because they're kind of a habit.

53
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.400
And I think you should get into a habit of using them too so just keep track of when when I give out

54
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.680
these quick tips because they will be very helpful.

55
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.680
So let's take out the representative and instead of taking nervous entered from here and dragging him

56
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.440
onto the color what we can do is take represented from here.

57
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.030
Whole hold him as you know if I just drag him onto the call now then it'll screw up the installation

58
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.430
because now he's no longer.

59
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.590
Or this column or this dimensions the longer in the columns so I'm going to press conference Z now.

60
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.700
What you need to do is you hold him or hold this dimension.

61
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.740
You drag him and you press control and you can see this little plus sign up here under your mouse.

62
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.250
And then when you let go you basically copy that dimension onto this new role.

63
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.790
And it's still in the columns.

64
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.690
So that's an easy way especially when you have like 100 or 100 maybe too much like thirty four dimensions

65
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.990
here might be hard looking for it when you know exactly what you want.

66
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.240
It's already on on your chart.

67
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.690
You just drag it like that.

68
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.650
Control.

69
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.060
OK.

70
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.290
So we've got the representative here.

71
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.160
And now if we're not happy with the colors we can just click colors edit colors and choose a different

72
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.780
color palette.

73
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.030
So tableau has a lot of different color palettes that are really built in right now is using Tableau

74
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.410
20 so you can say how about we go for purple great 12 you click a signed palette announces sign a purple

75
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.550
gray palette that looks pretty cool doesn't it.

76
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.900
Now we can also another good one is color blind.

77
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.400
So just to be cautious of color of people who might be called blind just click a side palette there.

78
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:28.570
It will tell you that your colors are being duplicated because you have less colors than people but

79
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.000
you know what that might be OK for you as long as you want because you do have the names underneath

80
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.680
so it might not be a problem anyway.

81
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.990
I don't think this is the best way to color this chart.

82
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.100
Let's have a look at another one.

83
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.950
So I'm going to I'm going to actually leave representative in color for now and what we'll do is we'll

84
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.530
take some of total sales price control and we'll drag that into color as you can see representative

85
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.290
has been replaced and now some of total sales is dictated to color.

86
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.730
And now it's it's not a discrete color.

87
00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.500
It's a continuous color.

88
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.740
And so the more cells you've had the darker your color the less sales you've had the lighter your color.

89
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.020
Also quite useful but in our case it's not the best because we already see the size of the bar and it

90
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.050
tells us how much sales each person has had.

91
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.970
So maybe maybe a different approach.

92
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:24.940
My favorite one in this particular case will be if I take region and I drag region on color by the way

93
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:31.840
I'll just controls that you will see that I can also drag region control and then replace this current

94
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.810
dimension that's in color or not in dimension.

95
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.340
This is the measure.

96
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.080
So replace that.

97
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:45.220
And now you can see that your bars have been colored by region and I think personally to me this appeals

98
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.500
the most because I can.

99
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:54.730
Right away visually see that these are three distinct regions or three distinct elements and that kind

100
00:06:54.730 --> 00:07:03.880
of also backs the idea behind why there's three bonuses and that these people don't have to be compared

101
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.950
to these people and these people don't have to be compared to the rest of them.

102
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.360
And so personally I would leave it at that.

103
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.440
And that's how you work with colors in tableau.

104
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.160
We will definitely be talking more about colors along the way in this course.

105
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.670
This is just the basics and have a play around with that see what personally appealed to you the most

106
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:30.550
and it's you know it's a very individual preference so fine find your style and I look forward to talking

107
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:38.920
to next time when we'll be discussing labels and formatting making our child look really appealing and

108
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.740
until next time.

109
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.480
Have you analyzed.
