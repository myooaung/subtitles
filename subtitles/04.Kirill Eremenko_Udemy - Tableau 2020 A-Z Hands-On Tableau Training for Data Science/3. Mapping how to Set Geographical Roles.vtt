00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.010
Hello and welcome back to the course on tableau.

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.040
And today we will create a map for our dataset.

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.580
But first things first let's go ahead and save our workbook so we'll just press control s and this one

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.220
is gonna be Section Six.

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:29.280
So as we usually do what we look for where we create a map is that little globe icon that we can drag

6
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.480
on to so the dimension that we can drag on to our tableau workspace.

7
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.240
And that way the map will be great for us.

8
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:43.230
But today we've got a bit of a conundrum we don't have the globe icon were everything here is either

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.360
a numeric value or a text field.

10
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.960
And here as well so we can create a map and on moreover we don't have those latitude and longitude measures

11
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.230
that are usually generated for us.

12
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.400
So how do we create a map in this case.

13
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.560
Well we know that region is our locational variable here and maybe let's try dragging that into the

14
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.940
workbook.

15
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.640
But once we drag it in nothing happens it just creates this table for us.

16
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.080
So how do we create a map in this case.

17
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.500
Well this is a good example of when tableau doesn't automatically recognize geographical roles and you

18
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.040
have to set them for your workbook yourself.

19
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.440
So we're just going to take that out of our worksheet and now what are we what we need to do is we need

20
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.400
to right click on region and we need to set a geographic crawl.

21
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.850
So if we go down here this geographic roll and we can select what geographic roll we want region to

22
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.530
play.

23
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.480
So in this case it's called region in the dataset.

24
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.830
But what tableau recognizes as a region is different.

25
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.780
What we are implying under region in the dataset is actually called state in tableau because it's different

26
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.500
for U.K. tableau deems what we call region in the dataset teams and states.

27
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.920
So we're going to select state and now we have a global icon.

28
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.260
And now we have latitude and longitude generated.

29
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.070
Okay good.

30
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.370
So now we can drag a region into our worksheet and what happens now well we see the whole map of the

31
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.410
world for some reason and we don't see the U.K. We don't see our customer base we don't see anything

32
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.440
like it did and it just built a map of the world for us but then map and put anything onto this map.

33
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.250
So what else we can see here is on the bottom right there's an indicator showing us that there's four

34
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.620
unknown values in this geographic classification.

35
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.240
So let's go ahead and look at that.

36
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.450
If you click on the four unknowns and you click edit locations what you'll find is that England Northern

37
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.880
Ireland Scotland and Wales have not been recognized.

38
00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.240
Well this can easily be fixed if you tell tableau which country there is supposed to be looking in.

39
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.090
The reason is that right now Tableau is looking in Namibia for an unknown unknown reason.

40
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.050
It's just looking in the mirror maybe you have to change that too obviously to the UK.

41
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.300
So tableau knows that these states or provinces are actually located in the UK and that's where it should

42
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.080
be looking.

43
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.700
So we're going to go and find United Kingdom over here click on that.

44
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.530
And right away you can see that tableau has now matched them up and click ok here and there you go right

45
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.110
away were taken to the map of the U.K. And what do we need to do now is we need to changes from automatic

46
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:50.250
to filled map and there you go that's how we created a map of the U.K. So we will talk a bit more about

47
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.490
the errors that can occur when you're creating maps in in the next section of the course in the section

48
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.130
on data preparation.

49
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.430
But for now that was a good intro and now you know how to create your own geographic roles or assign

50
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.310
your own geographic roles in your dataset.

51
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:16.630
What we're going to do now is we want to justice or add some information to this map.

52
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:25.110
Well first of all we'll just assign random colors for now to our four states so we can as we can see

53
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.390
them separately.

54
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.300
So we're just going to take region and we're going to instead of keeping it in detail we just drag it

55
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.710
into color.

56
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:39.540
And now what we're going to do next is we're going to add information we want to see the total number

57
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.090
of customers in each of these regions that we're looking at.

58
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.700
And how do we do that how do we add the total number of customers.

59
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.090
Well we don't have a measure which corresponds to the total number of customers but what we do have

60
00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.390
and what is automatically added to every word we can Tableau is a field a generated field that counts

61
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.580
a number of rows and it's called number of records and that is a very very powerful tool because in

62
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.100
our case we know that the number of rows is exactly the number of customers.

63
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.530
So we can use this generated feel to our advantage.

64
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.090
So we're going to take a number of records and we're going to drag it into label and right away you

65
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.120
can see the total number of customers has appeared on our map.

66
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.260
So all we have to do now is kind of format it a bit.

67
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.700
So let's go.

68
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:39.220
We have twelve and bold and let's just kind of reposition these labels so that they're working well

69
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.440
and we can see them well.

70
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.270
OK.

71
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.990
And now we'll probably prepare our map a little bit for the future.

72
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:55.540
So if your resume when you have to pull down control we want our map to be as compact as possible so

73
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.980
there you go.

74
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.560
And that is pretty much it for the map.

75
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.440
Well let's controls that.

76
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.900
I just wanted to move this label.

77
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.780
That's very much it for the map for now.

78
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.940
So we did assign some random colors and they might not work well if our dashboard when we created so

79
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.430
we'll change those a bit later.

80
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.460
That's all for today.

81
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:20.770
In the next material we will start looking at some charts to complement this map and you'll see how

82
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.860
all this is going to be coming together slowly into one amazing dashboard.

83
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.910
So that's all for today I look forward to seeing you next time.

84
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.750
And until then happy analyzing.
