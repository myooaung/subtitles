00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.010
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau and in the previous sections of this course we created

2
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.910
the dashboard.

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.150
It's all ready to go it's fired up.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.950
Let's have a look at it and analyze how the different regions what's happening in the different regions

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.620
of the U.K. for this bank.

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.080
So to get into it right away.

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.430
This is our customer base line.

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.640
Let's have a look at it.

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.620
We know that most of our customers are in England.

10
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.350
Then second place is Scotland than Wales than Northern Ireland.

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.930
Now if you look at the breakdown by balance you'll see that it's dropping off gradually as first the

12
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.850
first slowly and then quite quickly and that is something that you would expect that the lower the balanced

13
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.490
band the more customers you will have in that band.

14
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:58.890
So of 0 to 10000 10000 to 2020 to 30000 all have about 15 percent of our customers which in total constitute

15
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.690
45 percent of our customers sit under 30 thousand dollars.

16
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.100
Next the distribution by age is also quite interesting here you can see that most of our customers are

17
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.140
in their 30s so early 30s and late 30s and together that's 40 percent.

18
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.410
So if I change this to age group by 10 years you'll see that 40 percent of our customers are in their

19
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.560
30s 2 in their 30s basically.

20
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.810
And now if we go back here you can see the gender breakdown somewhat a bit more males and females but

21
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.380
not that much of a difference.

22
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.300
And job classification mostly white collar so nearly half.

23
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.580
And then a quarter each for blue collar and other.

24
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.900
All right.

25
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.680
So now let's look at the regions and see how when we click on the regions they deviate from the baseline

26
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.220
because that is ultimately what we want to report how each region is different to the overall average.

27
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.130
So if we click on the United Kingdom you can see that distribution by balance doesn't change that much.

28
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.120
Gender change is a little bit but also not that much.

29
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.720
5 percent change distribution by age changes.

30
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:13.350
So here in our overall representation on our baseline you can see that this is a right skewed distribution

31
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.230
meaning that that this is the mean of this.

32
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.460
It looks like a normal distribution which is which is natural.

33
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.800
So here you can see that the mean is sitting at somewhere at about 35 years old and then it's got a

34
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.720
long right sided tale.

35
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.190
So that means that it is a right skewed distribution whereas it when you clicked on England the distribution

36
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.440
is no longer right skewed.

37
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.000
What that is telling us is that the customers that are in their later age groups they are not product

38
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.900
predominantly they're not in England they're somewhere else.

39
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.880
And now where we want to look at is the job classification so here you can see white collar 50 percent

40
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.920
in England it's actually 70 percent so much more white collar workers in England and perhaps that has

41
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:07.970
something to do with London the economic hub of Europe being in this region and therefore perhaps a

42
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.630
lot of the finance workers or workers in the finance industry and decide to bank with Bank.

43
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.840
So they might find attractive and that's something you want to convey to the executives that when they

44
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:28.740
are advertising or working with customers in England perhaps it's a good idea to take due care or special

45
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.940
care of the white collar workers and see how you can tailor the services to their needs in this specific

46
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.240
region.

47
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.100
So that's what we're going to be focusing on in our storyline that England is predominately white collar

48
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.210
workers.

49
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.860
Next we'll move on to Scotland.

50
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.680
Once again we will unclip the map.

51
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.630
So we have the baseline and now when you click on Scotland we can visually compare.

52
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.300
You can see that the balanced distribution changes a bit but not too much.

53
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.740
There's some anomalies but the rest of the charts change quite a lot.

54
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:06.930
So gender breakdown goes from 54 percent male all the way to 72 percent male white collar workers completely

55
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.770
disappear.

56
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.740
Well there's a little bit of them here.

57
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.720
And mostly it's blue collar workers and other and also the demographic age demographic is completely

58
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:24.080
different so now our customers are in their late 40s early 50s which is very very interesting.

59
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.970
So what this is telling us is that if you're going to service this region or when you're servicing this

60
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.270
region and creating promotions and different campaigns for this region you have to aim for a much older

61
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.710
demographic predominately male and more in the blue collar space.

62
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.760
So if I click on blue collar here you'll see that 95 percent of the blue collar workers in this region

63
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.900
are all male.

64
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.350
And if I click on other you'll see that there's a different picture here.

65
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.140
More female.

66
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.930
So if you are going to aim for blue collar workers You want to expand the net or the bank customer base

67
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:06.730
in Scotland in the blue collar worker space then you should be targeting males in their late 40s early

68
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.540
50s.

69
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:14.650
On the other hand if you want to target other kind of professions then you should still take into consideration

70
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:22.790
that there is a large female representation in even in this region where overall there is predominately

71
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.220
a male representation.

72
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.580
So that's what we'll be focusing on in Scotland in our storyline.

73
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.410
Let's move on to Wales.

74
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.610
What can we see in Wales.

75
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.130
Well the first thing that jumps into my attention is the balance so if you look at the overall distribution

76
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.970
balance it gradually falls off in Wales.

77
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.460
It's stagnant for a bit.

78
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:48.580
We can dig into this further by grouping these balance balances not into ten thousand dollar groups

79
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.380
or but into fifteen thousand dollar groups.

80
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.510
And here you can see a different picture so for the overall base you can see it's still gradually falling

81
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.160
off in these balance groups for Wales.

82
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.210
It's actually first going up then it's staying above the original level of about 18 percent and then

83
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.160
it's dropping off.

84
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:12.580
So what that is telling us is that in Wales there's an abnormally large representation of average or

85
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:20.350
not average abnormally large representation of mid sized balances so that balances from zero 4 from

86
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.810
zero to forty five thousand dollars.

87
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.810
It is above average.

88
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.040
It's not consistent with the overall baseline.

89
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.910
And so that's something we want to report.

90
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:38.830
The other elements here they're not as significant Well there is quite a bit of a gender split a different

91
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.380
gender split a job classification changes a bit dispersion by age but probably what is the most interesting

92
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.660
part is this distribution by balance.

93
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.390
And finally for move on to Northern Ireland.

94
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:56.600
Here you can see another completely different demographic again once again.

95
00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:03.190
So I'm going to go back to balance group ten thousand and this is quite consistent with the baseline

96
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.920
a bit of anomalies but does to do with the low sample size.

97
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:16.870
But what we can see here is 74 percent are female and mostly this demographic is a younger demographic.

98
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:24.940
So mostly these people are in their 20s late 20s early 30s as opposed to in the baseline 30 or early

99
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.500
30s to late 30s.

100
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:32.620
So they're a bit younger and they're predominantly female 74 percent which is completely opposite total

101
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.070
baseline where their customers are predominantly male.

102
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.530
And here the main job classification is other workers.

103
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.490
And if you click on that you will see that they're predominately female.

104
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.310
So that is how to analyze a segmentation dashboard.

105
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:54.370
You can definitely add look at additional insights and drill in further so you can go here and then

106
00:07:54.370 --> 00:08:00.520
you could try to analyze what's going on with these specific workers and derive more insights from this

107
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.160
data and that's definitely that you should sign something you should do.

108
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:09.490
But for the storyline that is sufficient for us those are like conversational topics something to get

109
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:15.030
the storyline going and you'll see how this all comes together in a storyline and also you can see now

110
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.840
what's called the segmentation dashboard because it allows us to Sacramento customer base and understand

111
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.250
how to service them better.

112
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.020
I'll give you an example.

113
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:29.980
Let's say you have your bank comes up with an insurance offering or some kind of new product that involves

114
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:30.400
insurance.

115
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:38.680
Well if you're this bank wants to market the insurance offering to your existing customers then you

116
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.800
would approach it differently in different regions for instance in Scotland you know that your customers

117
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:50.320
just by looking at this picture right away you know that your customers are in their late early late

118
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.070
40s and early 50s they're predominantly male and mostly blue collar workers.

119
00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:59.230
So you just keep that thought in mind for a second.

120
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.550
Now let's go to Northern Ireland.

121
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.340
Here you can see a completely different picture.

122
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:08.140
You can see that they're predominantly female in their early 30s late 20s early 30s.

123
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.970
So even if you're marketing the same product you might want to position it differently.

124
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:20.080
So in Northern Ireland you might say that this insurance will allow you to take care of life changing

125
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:28.420
events for example purchasing homes or getting married or having children and so on because that's important

126
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.800
to take care of these events that are changing your life and so on.

127
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:39.100
And in Scotland these people have already had all of those events most of these people so you would

128
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.590
put a position that differently you would say this insurance is important because it will help you protect

129
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:51.010
the people you love it'll help you look after your families and we know you're you're in a high risk

130
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:57.190
profession and you're doing a lot of manual labor so it is important to have this insurance so that

131
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.390
you are covered and the people that you love are protected.

132
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:08.870
And so that way that is how businesses benefit from these type of segmentation dashboards because they

133
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:15.230
not only are able to sell the price they're able to sell their products much more in a much more tailored

134
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:20.870
fashion much more making the offering more relevant to the people they are targeting and there's nothing

135
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:27.050
bad about it's actually a good thing that you're delivering a good customer experience you're showing

136
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:32.480
your customers that you know who they are you know what what they care about and what is important to

137
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:39.020
them and that is very important in today's world where we have lots and lots of data which you can use

138
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:44.240
and you can analyze and you should businesses should take advantage of these of this data to make the

139
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.120
customer experience as great as possible.

140
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.260
I hope you enjoy this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

141
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.890
Until then happy analyzing.
