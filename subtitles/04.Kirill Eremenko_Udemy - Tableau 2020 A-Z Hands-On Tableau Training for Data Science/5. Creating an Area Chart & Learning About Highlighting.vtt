00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.690
Hello and welcome back to course on tableau.

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.180
And in today's editorial we will learn how to create an area chart.

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.140
And also I will show you a cool feature which you can use in your data discovery processes.

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.000
So we'll start off of the feature right away in front of us here we've got the chart that we created

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.480
last night.

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.400
And by no means is this a final product can't go into a new report and it's way too cluttered to present

7
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.250
any insightful information.

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.020
But at the same time you might find yourself with a chart like this or something similar.

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.850
While you're doing your daughter discovery process while you're looking for those anomalies trends and

10
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.510
patterns you sometimes will find yourself a very very cluttered chart which you are trying to interrogate

11
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.820
to find those answers.

12
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.070
So here what we have is the representation of unemployment long term unemployment in the US between

13
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.870
2005 and 2015.

14
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.650
So we've got this timeline here.

15
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.560
It is shown to us by month it is the median of unemployment and the granularity level is gender plus

16
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.920
age.

17
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.130
So that means for every month there is several age groups seven age groups times two genders.

18
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.610
So for every month there is 14 observations that are present on this chart.

19
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.670
And as you can see from the column legend here men are represented in blue circles and women are represented

20
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.320
with orange circles.

21
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.060
So what happens if you want to interrogate one of these genders more specifically and understand exactly

22
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.810
what's happening there.

23
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.540
Well one way is to restructure the chart and just leave that one gender but there is another great approach

24
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.400
which is called highlighting which helps you achieve the same result but much faster and all you have

25
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.970
to do is go to a whole legend and just click on the gender that you're interested in.

26
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.160
So if you're interested in looking at women you just click on women and there you go so that that is

27
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.460
a representation of female unemployment for that same period for those same age groups and also same

28
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.950
thing you can do with male.

29
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.650
Just click on men and you'll see that the circles associated with male unemployment are highlighted

30
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.880
for you right away.

31
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.550
And a lot of people forget or don't even know about this feature and therefore they spend too much time

32
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.920
restructuring their charts.

33
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.040
But in reality if you're just doing data discovery and you just want those answers quickly and you want

34
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.630
to understand exactly what's happening it's a very handy thing to know and to have.

35
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.410
So definitely look into that.

36
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.040
Well I'll just share another example now.

37
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.120
Let's look at age for instance.

38
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.550
We know that we have age in the chart as level of granularity and the way we got it there is we dragged

39
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.450
it into the detail shell.

40
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.020
So it is increasing or making the chart more granular but at the same time it's not represented anywhere

41
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.520
in the chart it's not a color.

42
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.590
It's not a shape it's nowhere.

43
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.940
So if we want to be able to highlight age we need to give it some sort of representation visual representation

44
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.830
or a chart.

45
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.800
And so because colors are used let's drag age into shape right away you can see that now for every single

46
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:19.740
age group that we have we've got a new shape and we would want to highlight say 35 to 44 years old and

47
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.260
we would press here naturally.

48
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.360
But nothing happens.

49
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.410
So as we click around nothing happens nothing's been held.

50
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.030
But that can be easily fixed.

51
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.930
You just have to go to this button over here which says highlights selected items.

52
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.070
And if you click on that now it will allow you to use this legend to highlight the items that you're

53
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.850
interested in.

54
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.660
And as we click through you can see that we're focusing on the different unemployment of different age

55
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.470
groups.

56
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.990
So once again very handy feature to know about and to use in your data discovery.

57
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.670
Definitely take it into your data science arsenal.

58
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.010
All right.

59
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.980
So what are we going to do now is we going to create an area.

60
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.200
Chad let's move back to just our original line charts.

61
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.200
I'm going to take age and gender out.

62
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.670
Gonna Change this to line and the sort of median unemployment we're going to look at the sum of unemployment.

63
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.900
So now we're seeing the total unemployment or long term unemployment for every single month in the US

64
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.040
between 2005 and 2015.

65
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.910
So the child ranges from 0 million to 7 million.

66
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.710
So now what we're going to do is we're going to take age so the age groups and we'll drag it into color

67
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.520
and what that will do is it'll give us many line charts.

68
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.240
Now the child ranges from zero to one point six million and every single line chart or line is here

69
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.450
is independent.

70
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:55.760
And so for instance like here you can see that for 35 to 44 years old people in April 2010 that employer

71
00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.210
was one point thirty eight million and once again we can use the college and to highlight the lines

72
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.140
that we want to look at.

73
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.270
So that's handy.

74
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.730
But at the same time this visual is not very useful.

75
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.310
You can.

76
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.880
It's not easy to understand.

77
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:19.260
And as we discussed it is our job as data scientists to make these visualizations very friendly and

78
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.930
very easy to interrogate for people who are looking at them.

79
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.330
So what we're going to do now is we're going to change this facilitation to a different type and one

80
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.700
way of doing it is just trying to explore in finding out what position is going to work in this particular

81
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.060
case.

82
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.350
So for that you can use the Show-Me function and you can just click around.

83
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.180
So for instance you look at a tree map is a tree map going to work right away.

84
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.290
You can see that even though it looks bright quite hope advertising is not going to work for a report.

85
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.350
It's that you can't really tell much from this exhilaration.

86
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.620
How about a bubble chart.

87
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.040
Once again very beautiful in terms of art.

88
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.400
This is probably a 10 out of 10 but in terms of inside fulness not really can't really tell much from

89
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.910
here.

90
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:16.120
Too much information being thrown at me so you can just click around and find the best one that you

91
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.840
like but the one I suggest going with in this case is an area chart.

92
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.570
So we're going to click on that and right away you can see how this area chart has been created for

93
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.180
us.

94
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:35.230
And it looks pretty incredible and very I think insightful and we'll learn how to make it even better

95
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.890
just now.

96
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.150
But before we do what I'm going to do I'm going to show you how to create it from scratch report this

97
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.070
show me bottom.

98
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.730
So I'm just gonna count because that and I'm just gonna cancel these steps and go back to our line chart.

99
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:56.240
So what you want to do here is if you go to the dropdown here instead of line just go to area and what

100
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:03.490
you'll see is now all of these unemployment rates have been stacked on top of each other.

101
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.190
So look at this axis here.

102
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.170
I'll just go back to the line chart of click here.

103
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.010
You can see here that it's only goes up to one point six million.

104
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.680
And that's because each one of these lines is independent.

105
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.410
Now if I go to area it goes all the way to seven million.

106
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:25.850
Now that's because they're being stacked up and as they're stacked the total increases here as well.

107
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:33.470
So the the actual unemployment for different groups different age groups is given by this pop up over

108
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.960
here so for instance in this case it's one point five six million unemployment in that month for 25

109
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.010
to 54 year olds so that's how you create an area chart.

110
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.920
And once again you can still highlight with color.

111
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.830
So remember about that that's a very powerful feature.

112
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:58.930
And what else we can do here is we probably can add some labels to make it really critical so we're

113
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.450
going to take age press control and we'll drag it into label.

114
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.720
And now you can see that the label has been added and once again we can as we know already we can format

115
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.140
these labels maybe make it bold.

116
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.040
And as you can see this is already starting to look much much better.

117
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.540
There's no label for the top one.

118
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.330
That's because it probably just doesn't fit.

119
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:26.440
But it kind of makes sense they're all in like ascending order going downwards and so that sums it up

120
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.370
for us for today.

121
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:32.990
We learn how to create an area chart and we learned about highlighting in the next material.

122
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.330
I will show you how to create a filter.

123
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:42.670
We will use gender as a filter and I will show you also we'll recap a little bit on a level of detail

124
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:45.220
and granularity and highlighting as well.

125
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.430
So I look forward to seeing you next time and until then happy analyzing.
