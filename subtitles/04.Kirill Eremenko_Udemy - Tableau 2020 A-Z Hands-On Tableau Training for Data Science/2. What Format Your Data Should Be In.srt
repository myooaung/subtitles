00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:05,500

2

00:00:05,500  -->  00:00:06,710
Hello and welcome back to the course on

3

00:00:06,710  -->  00:00:06,720

4

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:08,960
Tableau and in today's tutorial we will

5

00:00:08,960  -->  00:00:08,970

6

00:00:08,970  -->  00:00:10,820
discuss how your data should look

7

00:00:10,820  -->  00:00:10,830

8

00:00:10,830  -->  00:00:12,200
like when you're importing it into

9

00:00:12,200  -->  00:00:12,210

10

00:00:12,210  -->  00:00:14,240
Tableau. Now, we've already touched on

11

00:00:14,240  -->  00:00:14,250

12

00:00:14,250  -->  00:00:16,340
this topic briefly before but i think it

13

00:00:16,340  -->  00:00:16,350

14

00:00:16,350  -->  00:00:18,500
will be a worthwhile exercise for us to

15

00:00:18,500  -->  00:00:18,510

16

00:00:18,510  -->  00:00:21,170
discuss this once again and recap on the

17

00:00:21,170  -->  00:00:21,180

18

00:00:21,180  -->  00:00:22,849
conclusion that we came up with that

19

00:00:22,849  -->  00:00:22,859

20

00:00:22,859  -->  00:00:25,490
time. So to start off with, I'm going to

21

00:00:25,490  -->  00:00:25,500

22

00:00:25,500  -->  00:00:29,000
bring up a spreadsheet with some data. So

23

00:00:29,000  -->  00:00:29,010

24

00:00:29,010  -->  00:00:31,310
here you have a spreadsheet that might

25

00:00:31,310  -->  00:00:31,320

26

00:00:31,320  -->  00:00:34,220
look familiar because we did talk about

27

00:00:34,220  -->  00:00:34,230

28

00:00:34,230  -->  00:00:37,010
it previously in the course, but this is

29

00:00:37,010  -->  00:00:37,020

30

00:00:37,020  -->  00:00:38,900
a spreadsheet that tells us about

31

00:00:38,900  -->  00:00:38,910

32

00:00:38,910  -->  00:00:41,540
unemployment rates or long-term

33

00:00:41,540  -->  00:00:41,550

34

00:00:41,550  -->  00:00:44,389
unemployment rates for different months

35

00:00:44,389  -->  00:00:44,399

36

00:00:44,399  -->  00:00:48,799
of the years. Starting 2005 and so on with

37

00:00:48,799  -->  00:00:48,809

38

00:00:48,809  -->  00:00:51,290
the different genders, so for men and for

39

00:00:51,290  -->  00:00:51,300

40

00:00:51,300  -->  00:00:53,510
women and for the different age groups.

41

00:00:53,510  -->  00:00:53,520

42

00:00:53,520  -->  00:00:56,029
So 16 to 19 years old, 20 to 24 and so on.

43

00:00:56,029  -->  00:00:56,039

44

00:00:56,039  -->  00:00:58,220
And so this data does look like

45

00:00:58,220  -->  00:00:58,230

46

00:00:58,230  -->  00:01:01,340
visually appealing to the human eye and

47

00:01:01,340  -->  00:01:01,350

48

00:01:01,350  -->  00:01:03,979
here we can quickly derive insights if

49

00:01:03,979  -->  00:01:03,989

50

00:01:03,989  -->  00:01:05,630
we need to we can scroll further along

51

00:01:05,630  -->  00:01:05,640

52

00:01:05,640  -->  00:01:08,450
and find the right year that we or your

53

00:01:08,450  -->  00:01:08,460

54

00:01:08,460  -->  00:01:10,280
month that we're looking at and we right

55

00:01:10,280  -->  00:01:10,290

56

00:01:10,290  -->  00:01:11,660
all right we know that the left column

57

00:01:11,660  -->  00:01:11,670

58

00:01:11,670  -->  00:01:13,910
is men, the right column is women and

59

00:01:13,910  -->  00:01:13,920

60

00:01:13,920  -->  00:01:16,940
we know which how to select the right

61

00:01:16,940  -->  00:01:16,950

62

00:01:16,950  -->  00:01:19,070
age group just because they're nicely

63

00:01:19,070  -->  00:01:19,080

64

00:01:19,080  -->  00:01:20,719
highlighted here. Also the inspiration

65

00:01:20,719  -->  00:01:20,729

66

00:01:20,729  -->  00:01:22,999
has some header information up at the

67

00:01:22,999  -->  00:01:23,009

68

00:01:23,009  -->  00:01:25,429
top. It's got some additional information

69

00:01:25,429  -->  00:01:25,439

70

00:01:25,439  -->  00:01:28,130
down the bottom, sometimes you might find

71

00:01:28,130  -->  00:01:28,140

72

00:01:28,140  -->  00:01:30,740
that spreadsheets like this will have totals

73

00:01:30,740  -->  00:01:30,750

74

00:01:30,750  -->  00:01:32,210
at the bottom as well like we can add

75

00:01:32,210  -->  00:01:32,220

76

00:01:32,220  -->  00:01:34,580
that right now. So here you've got the

77

00:01:34,580  -->  00:01:34,590

78

00:01:34,590  -->  00:01:39,890
total and let's just drag that along so

79

00:01:39,890  -->  00:01:39,900

80

00:01:39,900  -->  00:01:43,249
we'll call that total. So this is

81

00:01:43,249  -->  00:01:43,259

82

00:01:43,259  -->  00:01:47,300
not uncommon when there's a total at the

83

00:01:47,300  -->  00:01:47,310

84

00:01:47,310  -->  00:01:48,530
bottom of the spreadsheet might be

85

00:01:48,530  -->  00:01:48,540

86

00:01:48,540  -->  00:01:50,030
highlighted in a different color as well.

87

00:01:50,030  -->  00:01:50,040

88

00:01:50,040  -->  00:01:53,300
So maybe like a blue or something

89

00:01:53,300  -->  00:01:53,310

90

00:01:53,310  -->  00:01:57,859
that, and to as humans we can understand

91

00:01:57,859  -->  00:01:57,869

92

00:01:57,869  -->  00:01:59,510
and comprehend this information quite

93

00:01:59,510  -->  00:01:59,520

94

00:01:59,520  -->  00:02:01,459
easily but on the other side, the other

95

00:02:01,459  -->  00:02:01,469

96

00:02:01,469  -->  00:02:03,649
hand it's not the best format for

97

00:02:03,649  -->  00:02:03,659

98

00:02:03,659  -->  00:02:05,569
machines. So let's have a look at another

99

00:02:05,569  -->  00:02:05,579

100

00:02:05,579  -->  00:02:08,300
format that might be,

101

00:02:08,300  -->  00:02:08,310

102

00:02:08,310  -->  00:02:11,120
that you might be used to. So here is

103

00:02:11,120  -->  00:02:11,130

104

00:02:11,130  -->  00:02:12,290
another spreadsheet with the same

105

00:02:12,290  -->  00:02:12,300

106

00:02:12,300  -->  00:02:14,300
information and it's got the age groups,

107

00:02:14,300  -->  00:02:14,310

108

00:02:14,310  -->  00:02:16,309
the period and here the men and women are

109

00:02:16,309  -->  00:02:16,319

110

00:02:16,319  -->  00:02:19,430
split into two separate columns and so

111

00:02:19,430  -->  00:02:19,440

112

00:02:19,440  -->  00:02:21,229
for that period for that age group you can

113

00:02:21,229  -->  00:02:21,239

114

00:02:21,239  -->  00:02:22,339
understand right away

115

00:02:22,339  -->  00:02:22,349

116

00:02:22,349  -->  00:02:23,720
what does unemployment for men, what does

117

00:02:23,720  -->  00:02:23,730

118

00:02:23,730  -->  00:02:25,610
unemployment for for women and once again they

119

00:02:25,610  -->  00:02:25,620

120

00:02:25,620  -->  00:02:29,720
might be a total here as well. So we'll

121

00:02:29,720  -->  00:02:29,730

122

00:02:29,730  -->  00:02:34,370
just copy that down and as you can see

123

00:02:34,370  -->  00:02:34,380

124

00:02:34,380  -->  00:02:37,130
this information is presented in an

125

00:02:37,130  -->  00:02:37,140

126

00:02:37,140  -->  00:02:40,130
appealing way to the human eye but it is

127

00:02:40,130  -->  00:02:40,140

128

00:02:40,140  -->  00:02:43,280
not what machines are used to. It's not

129

00:02:43,280  -->  00:02:43,290

130

00:02:43,290  -->  00:02:45,289
what Tableau is used to. When you're

131

00:02:45,289  -->  00:02:45,299

132

00:02:45,299  -->  00:02:47,120
importing this information and for

133

00:02:47,120  -->  00:02:47,130

134

00:02:47,130  -->  00:02:48,740
instance this information is best

135

00:02:48,740  -->  00:02:48,750

136

00:02:48,750  -->  00:02:50,690
presented in the following way if you

137

00:02:50,690  -->  00:02:50,700

138

00:02:50,700  -->  00:02:53,960
are to put into Tableau and that format

139

00:02:53,960  -->  00:02:53,970

140

00:02:53,970  -->  00:02:56,390
is this where you've got two separate

141

00:02:56,390  -->  00:02:56,400

142

00:02:56,400  -->  00:03:00,470
columns for every type of dimension that

143

00:03:00,470  -->  00:03:00,480

144

00:03:00,480  -->  00:03:02,930
you have, for instance the age which is

145

00:03:02,930  -->  00:03:02,940

146

00:03:02,940  -->  00:03:05,539
split into certain bands here, the

147

00:03:05,539  -->  00:03:05,549

148

00:03:05,549  -->  00:03:08,240
gender is a separate dimension and then

149

00:03:08,240  -->  00:03:08,250

150

00:03:08,250  -->  00:03:12,860
you've got the period, so period of time the month

151

00:03:12,860  -->  00:03:12,870

152

00:03:12,870  -->  00:03:14,390
that you're looking at and then finally

153

00:03:14,390  -->  00:03:14,400

154

00:03:14,400  -->  00:03:17,720
you've got the measure for which is

155

00:03:17,720  -->  00:03:17,730

156

00:03:17,730  -->  00:03:20,120
aggregated at the lowest level of

157

00:03:20,120  -->  00:03:20,130

158

00:03:20,130  -->  00:03:22,190
granularity that you have. So when you

159

00:03:22,190  -->  00:03:22,200

160

00:03:22,200  -->  00:03:24,349
take the age, the gender and the period into

161

00:03:24,349  -->  00:03:24,359

162

00:03:24,359  -->  00:03:26,360
account. You've got that value over here.

163

00:03:26,360  -->  00:03:26,370

164

00:03:26,370  -->  00:03:29,660
So it's basically just columns of data,

165

00:03:29,660  -->  00:03:29,670

166

00:03:29,670  -->  00:03:33,140
rather than some visually appealing

167

00:03:33,140  -->  00:03:33,150

168

00:03:33,150  -->  00:03:36,110
formatted data which we had here and

169

00:03:36,110  -->  00:03:36,120

170

00:03:36,120  -->  00:03:38,270
here. So what you need to make sure when

171

00:03:38,270  -->  00:03:38,280

172

00:03:38,280  -->  00:03:39,830
you're importing data in Tableau is that

173

00:03:39,830  -->  00:03:39,840

174

00:03:39,840  -->  00:03:42,199
it is formatted as close to this is

175

00:03:42,199  -->  00:03:42,209

176

00:03:42,209  -->  00:03:44,809
possible. Ideally it has to look like this and

177

00:03:44,809  -->  00:03:44,819

178

00:03:44,819  -->  00:03:47,090
that means that you need to take out all

179

00:03:47,090  -->  00:03:47,100

180

00:03:47,100  -->  00:03:49,069
these headers any possible margins that

181

00:03:49,069  -->  00:03:49,079

182

00:03:49,079  -->  00:03:51,559
your data has you have to kind of

183

00:03:51,559  -->  00:03:51,569

184

00:03:51,569  -->  00:03:54,199
unpivot the views and put all of these

185

00:03:54,199  -->  00:03:54,209

186

00:03:54,209  -->  00:03:57,470
these months into a column and give that

187

00:03:57,470  -->  00:03:57,480

188

00:03:57,480  -->  00:04:00,559
column name called month or a time period and

189

00:04:00,559  -->  00:04:00,569

190

00:04:00,569  -->  00:04:03,170
put the genders into a column.

191

00:04:03,170  -->  00:04:03,180

192

00:04:03,180  -->  00:04:05,420
Also, you need going to get rid of the totals

193

00:04:05,420  -->  00:04:05,430

194

00:04:05,430  -->  00:04:07,520
because you don't need the totals in

195

00:04:07,520  -->  00:04:07,530

196

00:04:07,530  -->  00:04:09,289
Tableau. You can get them in Tableau if

197

00:04:09,289  -->  00:04:09,299

198

00:04:09,299  -->  00:04:11,840
you need them and here what they're only,

199

00:04:11,840  -->  00:04:11,850

200

00:04:11,850  -->  00:04:14,300
all they're doing is they're good for

201

00:04:14,300  -->  00:04:14,310

202

00:04:14,310  -->  00:04:17,330
visual analysis but they will confuse

203

00:04:17,330  -->  00:04:17,340

204

00:04:17,340  -->  00:04:19,490
you if you bring them into Tableau that

205

00:04:19,490  -->  00:04:19,500

206

00:04:19,500  -->  00:04:20,440
might

207

00:04:20,440  -->  00:04:20,450

208

00:04:20,450  -->  00:04:22,450
cause discrepancies in your data.

209

00:04:22,450  -->  00:04:22,460

210

00:04:22,460  -->  00:04:24,250
Also sometimes, you might find that

211

00:04:24,250  -->  00:04:24,260

212

00:04:24,260  -->  00:04:26,920
data instruction a way that if

213

00:04:26,920  -->  00:04:26,930

214

00:04:26,930  -->  00:04:29,230
a value in the commons repeated then

215

00:04:29,230  -->  00:04:29,240

216

00:04:29,240  -->  00:04:31,330
there is no value there. So for instance

217

00:04:31,330  -->  00:04:31,340

218

00:04:31,340  -->  00:04:33,670
it could be like this and so that

219

00:04:33,670  -->  00:04:33,680

220

00:04:33,680  -->  00:04:35,560
basically means that all of these are

221

00:04:35,560  -->  00:04:35,570

222

00:04:35,570  -->  00:04:37,630
January, all of these are February and March.

223

00:04:37,630  -->  00:04:37,640

224

00:04:37,640  -->  00:04:39,940
Well for Tableau, to understand this data

225

00:04:39,940  -->  00:04:39,950

226

00:04:39,950  -->  00:04:44,020
you also need to once again fill in the

227

00:04:44,020  -->  00:04:44,030

228

00:04:44,030  -->  00:04:46,390
blank spaces of your data and you

229

00:04:46,390  -->  00:04:46,400

230

00:04:46,400  -->  00:04:48,370
can all do all of this in Excel if you need

231

00:04:48,370  -->  00:04:48,380

232

00:04:48,380  -->  00:04:52,180
to. However the good news is in the

233

00:04:52,180  -->  00:04:52,190

234

00:04:52,190  -->  00:04:55,210
starting from Tableau 9, Tableau has

235

00:04:55,210  -->  00:04:55,220

236

00:04:55,220  -->  00:04:57,970
some advanced features in its data

237

00:04:57,970  -->  00:04:57,980

238

00:04:57,980  -->  00:05:01,660
import functionality which will help you

239

00:05:01,660  -->  00:05:01,670

240

00:05:01,670  -->  00:05:03,700
do a lot of these things in Tableau and

241

00:05:03,700  -->  00:05:03,710

242

00:05:03,710  -->  00:05:05,290
actually it allows you to do a lot of these

243

00:05:05,290  -->  00:05:05,300

244

00:05:05,300  -->  00:05:07,360
automatically and so that's what we'll

245

00:05:07,360  -->  00:05:07,370

246

00:05:07,370  -->  00:05:09,160
be looking at in the next tutorial. We'll

247

00:05:09,160  -->  00:05:09,170

248

00:05:09,170  -->  00:05:10,150
be talking about the data

249

00:05:10,150  -->  00:05:10,160

250

00:05:10,160  -->  00:05:11,770
interpreter and I look forward to seeing

251

00:05:11,770  -->  00:05:11,780

252

00:05:11,780  -->  00:05:12,550
you next time.

253

00:05:12,550  -->  00:05:12,560

254

00:05:12,560  -->  00:05:13,800
Until then, Happy Analyzing!

255

00:05:18,850  -->  00:05:20,850
