Hello and welcome back to the courts on Tableau.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:13,280
In the previous tutorial we imported our personal vehicle sales data into Tableau and we used the DA

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,750
interpreter tool to help us out.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,200
And this is what the data looks like.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,620
So it looks great.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,950
It's it's clean it's it's got all the information that we need.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:32,510
But the problem here is that as we discussed this kind of format is still more oriented at humans because

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:40,100
it's got the years in separate columns whereas in a machine in a raw machine format the years would

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,810
be in their own column and then you would just have the values in another column.

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:52,220
So ideally this dataset should be presented with four columns Region Country year and total sales for

11
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,870
that year rather than this and pivoted view.

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,570
So what we're going to do now is we're going to learn how to pivoted right here in tableau.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,800
And as you can imagine I'll just bring up the spreadsheet here which we worked with before.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,550
As you can imagine to achieve what we want to achieve by adjusting this data it would take us quite

15
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:20,990
some effort to move from this kind of format to a format where we just have a column for year and then

16
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,980
a column for the value.

17
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:30,200
But the beauty of Tableau is that it can do all this for you and it's very simple just observe how quickly

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,860
this can be done.

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,210
We're just going to select the columns that we want to pivot.

20
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,540
We select all of these columns and then you just select or one of the drop downs and you click pivot

21
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,070
and there go it's all done as easy as that.

22
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:52,610
So now you've got Region Country pivot or the year and the value or the total sales total number of

23
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,900
cars sold for that year.

24
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:01,370
So as you can see we can also just just to make sure we can compare to what we see in our spreadsheet.

25
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:10,670
So let's pick a random random row from this new table and we'll say let's say somewhere Europe Europe

26
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,900
Greece 2007 two hundred seventy nine thousand cars.

27
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,370
So now not going to bring up the spreadsheet since I can find it.

28
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,070
Here it is.

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,540
So Europe Greece to sell two thousand seven hundred seventy nine thousand cars.

30
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:26,960
Perfect.

31
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:34,340
So that means it's working and as expected and that is how you pivot data in tableau.

32
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,670
So we'll continue with our data progression in the next term.

33
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,410
And I look forward to see you next time.

34
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,930
Until then happy analyzing.
