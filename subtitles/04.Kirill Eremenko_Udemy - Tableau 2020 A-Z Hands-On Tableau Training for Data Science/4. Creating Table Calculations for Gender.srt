00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,520
Hello and welcome back to the course on tableau.

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:15,380
And today we will start on the demographics segmentation of our member base of the member race of the

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,220
bank.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,690
So what do we mean by that.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:26,360
Well we want to see some visuals representing the gender of the members or the customers of the bank

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,710
the different types of professions there in the different age groups and so on.

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,630
So let's get started with that.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:38,990
First thing we're going to do is we're going to change the name of this worksheet to map.

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,750
And then now we're going to create a new worksheet.

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,560
And let's not forget to constantly save our progress by pressing control S..

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:53,890
So here we're going to just create a very simple visualization which is going to be a pie chart.

12
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:03,110
So let's take gender and drag it into Tableau and number of records which we now know how to use drag

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:10,730
it into table as well as you can see now we have female and male and tells us exactly how many of each

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,100
gender they are in total in the bank.

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,500
And now we're going to change this to a pie chart.

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,070
Probably not the best way to change the pie chart.

17
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,850
Let's try this way.

18
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,230
So there we go.

19
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,970
If you use a show me functionality you get this pretty cheap pie chart.

20
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,030
Now you can make it a bit bigger if you like.

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,460
Maybe change the size.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,880
Now what we're after is some labels here because we can see what's going on.

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:45,380
Well first of all probably change the colors will change the male to blue and female to pink.

24
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,930
So there intuitive.

25
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,170
And now we want some obviously some numbers in here.

26
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:59,780
And what are we going to do is take this some of a number of records and all this just take number of

27
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:06,950
records from the measures and we'll drag them into label and what we can see here is the total number

28
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,390
of males and females that were Bank of our bank.

29
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:19,640
We can change the format here just to see this little bit better and keep it consistent with this part

30
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,200
of the future dashboard.

31
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,070
So if this worksheet where everything is twelve and bold so we'll change that here.

32
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:34,670
But for a pie chart you're not all you're probably interested in the total number of the people or males

33
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,310
and females you want the percentages.

34
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,090
So how do we get percentages.

35
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,600
And this is where we start working we have table calculations.

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,690
It's a very powerful feature in Tableau and this is the first time we're introducing it.

37
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:54,460
So is going to be very helpful going forward for us to add a table calculation.

38
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:01,820
So basically tell us what is this number what percentage is this number of the total of what we see

39
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,520
here.

40
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,480
You can you just need to do one simple step.

41
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,680
You click on.

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,660
In this case the table coefficients going to be added to this field so we want to replace this field

43
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,030
with the table calculation.

44
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,100
So click on this dropdown here.

45
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,330
And so I'll probably move it a bit up.

46
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,800
So yeah we have more space.

47
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,000
So click on the dropdown here and select quick table calculation.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And here from the quick table calculation select percent of total.

49
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,710
And as soon as you select that these numbers have been replaced and you see this little triangle up

50
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,790
here on the actual measure.

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,760
So on the right there's this triangle.

52
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,950
It's indicating to you that there is a table calculation being performed here.

53
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,410
And if you go here you can see quick table calculation it's telling you which one has been selected

54
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,630
and it is percent of total as we selected it.

55
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,310
So now we want to format this again.

56
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,040
So we'll go to format and we'll change it from numbers to percentage and no decimal points.

57
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:03,680
And then you go.

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,230
So now instead of seeing the total number of males and the total number of females females we can see

59
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,380
what percentage they make up of the total of the segmentation that we've select the role in this case

60
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,880
the segmentation that's selected is the whole population of the bank.

61
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:26,570
And that's why we can see that this 54 and 46 percent and you will see what I mean by select segmentation

62
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:34,160
when we move on to creating the dashboard it will become more clear how by selecting different segments

63
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,220
of our bank these percentages will actually change.

64
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,130
So that is how you perform table calculations.

65
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,300
This is the most simple one.

66
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,770
It is called percentage of total you'll be using it quite a lot.

67
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:52,430
It's very handy to quickly change from absolute numbers to relative percentages.

68
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:59,690
And there are more table calculations and we will explore them further on down the track.

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,740
So that's all for today.

70
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,870
I look forward to seeing you next time and will then be analyzing.
