00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,150
Hello and welcome back to the course on tableau.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,730
And today we will be creating a scatter plot.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,810
And we will also learn how to apply filters to multiple worksheets and her.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,450
Finally we're going to create more than one worksheet in our tableau workbook so that's going to be

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:21,720
fun.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,260
Let's get straight at it to start off with.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:34,020
We've got this map here in front of us that we worked with last time and as you remember we have this

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:41,100
filter that we are applying to the maps so we are looking at one specific year rather than aggregating

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,720
across multiple years.

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's just remember that.

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,430
And let's go ahead and create our second worksheet in this workbook.

12
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,310
So to create another worksheet you've got to click this button away here at the bottom which says new

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:53,760
worksheet.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,720
So let's go ahead and do that.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,420
Once you click that it creates a new worksheet and it's a good time now to rename a worksheet.

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:08,910
So you just double click on the worksheet name and he will say map of Europe.

17
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:15,790
And now if we double click on the second one we will say customer scatter plot.

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,590
OK.

19
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,070
So let's get ahead with our customers scatter plot.

20
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:28,620
So as you remember the first thing that we did in the previous tutorial was to make sure we're looking

21
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:37,890
at the right time period of our data because it is important to remember when or know when your daughter

22
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,920
includes multiple years or different time periods that you want to look at individually and because

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,180
that's a common mistake some times people create a dashboard and they forget to add the filter and there

24
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,780
instead of looking at every single year by itself they're looking at the sum for all of the years and

25
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,810
that might not be what they're intending or to see when they're designing the dashboard.

26
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:08,010
So once again what we can do is we can drag all the data into a filter select years and you know do

27
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:13,650
the same thing that we did last time but we're not going to do that because what we want to do is we

28
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,000
want to look at the same year across all of our worksheets and this is where we are.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,190
So if we had many many more worksheets we wanted to look at the same year across all of them.

30
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:30,780
And so this is where we're going to learn how to apply a worksheet across many different or apply a

31
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,670
filter across many different worksheets.

32
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:40,200
So to start off with what we're going to do is we're going to add some data into this worksheet and

33
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,250
then we'll apply the filter and I'll explain in a minute why we're doing it in that order.

34
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:53,700
So let's say we want to look at some of sales and columns and we want to look at the sum of profit in

35
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,810
rows.

36
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,770
And so here what has happened is tableau has aggregated the total sum of sales for all of the years

37
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,590
all of the customers all the regions for everything and the sum of profit as well and now is just showing

38
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,610
one dot.

39
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,370
And as you remember if you want to disaggregated we can either go to analysis and we can uncheck aggregate

40
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,380
measures and then we'll be showing a dot for every single one.

41
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,270
Or let's just leave aggregate measures on.

42
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:28,290
We can just add some information into the detailed schedule granularity of the view and that way tableau

43
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,880
will automatically aggregate at that level of granularity.

44
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:39,560
So how about we add customer name into detail and right away we have a dot for every single customer.

45
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:46,530
So what we're going to do now is we will work with that work to create that filter across multiple worksheets.

46
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,420
So let's go to map of Europe.

47
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,500
And as you remember this filter that we have here on year what we're going to do now is we're going

48
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,920
to right click it and we will say apply to worksheets and we'll say all using this data source.

49
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,770
So that means any worksheet using this data source will automatically have this filter applied to it.

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,150
You can also select worksheets.

51
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:12,180
But I kind of recommend doing all using this data so unless you have a specific case when you need to

52
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,880
select specific worksheets.

53
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,800
So let's go ahead and use it on all the worksheets that are using this data source click that and right

54
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,260
away you can see that a database icon has appeared on the left or the filter meaning that is being applied

55
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,110
at the level of the data source.

56
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,420
So basically anywhere sheet that's using this data source will automatically have this filter applied.

57
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,880
And if we go to customers Caterpillar you will see right away that this filter has been applied here

58
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,850
already.

59
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,520
And if we're right click and we say that we would like to see a quick filter you will see the quick

60
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,300
filter on the left on the right here.

61
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,430
It hasn't been formatted so that's easy to fix customize show all value will just switch that off and

62
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:01,100
then we'll just change to the single value slider just like in the privacy.

63
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,550
So now if I change it if I go from 2014 2012 you'll see that this has changed as well.

64
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,870
Over here is change 2012.

65
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,470
Now if I go to 2011 and go back you will see that the filter has changed here as well.

66
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,990
So this is kind of a filter that's been applied to all worksheets which are using this data source.

67
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,420
Now you will find that if I go to these worksheets the new ones that currently are not using any data

68
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:29,210
source because there's no data on the in the workspace the filter has been applied and that's simply

69
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,380
because tableau doesn't know if this was worksheet is going to be using this data source or not.

70
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,390
Because eventually you might add another data source and I use that one and then that case the filter

71
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,160
won't be applied.

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:46,700
So as soon as you drag anything from this works from this data source onto the worksheet let's say number

73
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:52,670
of records and just drag it here you will see right away that the filter has been applied and that's

74
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,570
how filters across different worksheets work.

75
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:04,790
It's a very very handy feature and actually took me some time to find out about it and I used to just

76
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,080
apply separate work to separate filters through every worksheet and can be a nightmare when you have

77
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:16,280
like 20 or 30 whereas when you have when you use the work this filter is applied across worksheets.

78
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:22,250
It's very easy to make sure you're all of your worksheets are showing the right information for that

79
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,600
specific year or for that specific region or for whatever you're filtering on.

80
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,410
Very good.

81
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,280
In terms of consistency so let's go back to our customers scatter plot and continue creating it.

82
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,840
So what is this scatter plot currently showing us it is showing us the profit profitability of customers.

83
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:46,010
So basically based on the sales that we made to that customer what is the profit that we received in

84
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,340
return from that customer as well.

85
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:56,120
So let's make this scatter plot a little bit prettier because there's a lot of dots here and we can't

86
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:04,160
really country to say anything about the ones that are overlapping.

87
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:11,180
So what are we going to do is we're going to add some color and the color we're going to add is we're

88
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,160
going to look at our profit margin because in essence if you take a profit and divide by sales that

89
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,710
is your profit margin.

90
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:25,370
And so if we take profit margin which we calculate field which we create last time and we take you drag

91
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,770
it onto color you'll see that the shapes have been colored now.

92
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,580
Now we're going to change the type of shape.

93
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:39,660
So we'll just click a shape even though we don't have anything on shape right now.

94
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,920
We don't have a variable that controls a shape.

95
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,530
What we can do is we can change the shape ourselves.

96
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,390
So in this case we want the circles.

97
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,910
And like last time what we're going to do is we're going to change the color to red and blue we'll click

98
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,270
apply.

99
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:05,460
So next what we're going to do is change the size of these bubbles so if we go to size make them a bit

100
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:05,760
bigger.

101
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,990
Well that's obviously too big.

102
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,740
So maybe somewhere there.

103
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,990
Yeah that looks OK.

104
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,240
Maybe we'll also change the color in terms of levels.

105
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:23,160
So we'll go to edit colors and we'll say just like we did in the previous tutorial we'll say minus zero

106
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,910
point five is obese is already bad.

107
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,360
So my zero point five and zero point five is really good.

108
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,290
So apply.

109
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,430
OK.

110
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,710
So that's really looking better.

111
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,200
And now we've got a map of Europe.

112
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,020
We've got profitability of our customers and oh one more thing is because they do overlap here.

113
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,780
What we can do is we can go to color and then change the transparency.

114
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:56,440
So let's set it at 75 percent so now you can see the times when they overlap.

115
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:03,040
And once again this is already quite a good scatter plot that we've created so we can see how the customer

116
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,060
profitability changes from customer to customer.

117
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,010
And if we change the years you can see how the profile changes overall.

118
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:17,590
So here in 2013 you got some very unprofitable customers here you've got a bit of a different profile

119
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,450
more scattered.

120
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:27,460
And also if you need to do some investigations you can just put your mouse over a certain dot here and

121
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:33,400
I'll tell you exactly who that customer is what the profit is what the sales was what the profit margin

122
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,830
for that customer is for that given year.

123
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:41,200
So that is a very handy tool to have right away it can help you like somebody who's analyzing this.

124
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,770
The sales for the shop they can just go and say OK the mall the least profitable customers maybe maybe

125
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:55,030
something needs to be done there some customer service service or maybe those customers are purchasing

126
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,030
the wrong wrong products or something that.

127
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,140
And then you can look at the most profitable customers and maybe they should be included in a loyalty

128
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,280
program or something along those lines.

129
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,380
So that's how we create scatter plots in Tableau and in the next sartorial we will finally create our

130
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,260
very first dashboard and that will be super exciting.

131
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,900
So I look forward to seeing you then.

132
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,830
And until next I'm happy analyzing.
