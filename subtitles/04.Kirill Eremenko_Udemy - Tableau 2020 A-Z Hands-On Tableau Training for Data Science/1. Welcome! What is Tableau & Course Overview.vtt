00:00:02.030  -->  00:00:02.040

3

00:00:02.040  -->  00:00:04.610
Tableau I'm so glad to see inside we're

4

00:00:04.610  -->  00:00:04.620

5

00:00:04.620  -->  00:00:06.200
going to have heaps of fun along the way

6

00:00:06.200  -->  00:00:06.210

7

00:00:06.210  -->  00:00:08.299
and I promise you that you will learn a

8

00:00:08.299  -->  00:00:08.309

9

00:00:08.309  -->  00:00:10.669
ton and in this short tutorial what I

10

00:00:10.669  -->  00:00:10.679

11

00:00:10.679  -->  00:00:12.169
wanted to do is give you a quick

12

00:00:12.169  -->  00:00:12.179

13

00:00:12.179  -->  00:00:14.570
overview of what tablet is and what it's

14

00:00:14.570  -->  00:00:14.580

15

00:00:14.580  -->  00:00:15.440
used for

16

00:00:15.440  -->  00:00:15.450

17

00:00:15.450  -->  00:00:17.540
and then we will go through this section

18

00:00:17.540  -->  00:00:17.550

19

00:00:17.550  -->  00:00:19.220
of the course and i will show you what

20

00:00:19.220  -->  00:00:19.230

21

00:00:19.230  -->  00:00:21.080
to expect in each section so you can

22

00:00:21.080  -->  00:00:21.090

23

00:00:21.090  -->  00:00:22.790
navigate your way through the course

24

00:00:22.790  -->  00:00:22.800

25

00:00:22.800  -->  00:00:24.859
much easier so let's jump straight into

26

00:00:24.859  -->  00:00:24.869

27

00:00:24.869  -->  00:00:25.700
it

28

00:00:25.700  -->  00:00:25.710

29

00:00:25.710  -->  00:00:27.740
Tableau is a very simple yet powerful

30

00:00:27.740  -->  00:00:27.750

31

00:00:27.750  -->  00:00:30.620
tool for everything to do with data the

32

00:00:30.620  -->  00:00:30.630

33

00:00:30.630  -->  00:00:32.780
company's mission is to help people see

34

00:00:32.780  -->  00:00:32.790

35

00:00:32.790  -->  00:00:35.569
and understand data and as you can see

36

00:00:35.569  -->  00:00:35.579

37

00:00:35.579  -->  00:00:36.200
here

38

00:00:36.200  -->  00:00:36.210

39

00:00:36.210  -->  00:00:38.180
Tableau is a completely drag-and-drop

40

00:00:38.180  -->  00:00:38.190

41

00:00:38.190  -->  00:00:41.209
software and using Tableau you can

42

00:00:41.209  -->  00:00:41.219

43

00:00:41.219  -->  00:00:43.880
create visuals sometimes 10 times faster

44

00:00:43.880  -->  00:00:43.890

45

00:00:43.890  -->  00:00:45.200
than you would have created them in

46

00:00:45.200  -->  00:00:45.210

47

00:00:45.210  -->  00:00:48.170
other programs and overall Tableau is a

48

00:00:48.170  -->  00:00:48.180

49

00:00:48.180  -->  00:00:50.299
new and innovative approach to business

50

00:00:50.299  -->  00:00:50.309

51

00:00:50.309  -->  00:00:53.420
intelligence. In terms of structure the

52

00:00:53.420  -->  00:00:53.430

53

00:00:53.430  -->  00:00:55.549
course has a spiral structure and what

54

00:00:55.549  -->  00:00:55.559

55

00:00:55.559  -->  00:00:56.930
that means is that with every new

56

00:00:56.930  -->  00:00:56.940

57

00:00:56.940  -->  00:00:58.760
section you move up a level in the

58

00:00:58.760  -->  00:00:58.770

59

00:00:58.770  -->  00:01:00.619
spiral learning new skills and

60

00:01:00.619  -->  00:01:00.629

61

00:01:00.629  -->  00:01:02.930
techniques while still repeating and

62

00:01:02.930  -->  00:01:02.940

63

00:01:02.940  -->  00:01:05.030
cementing in the older ones that you

64

00:01:05.030  -->  00:01:05.040

65

00:01:05.040  -->  00:01:06.980
picked up earlier and so let's have a

66

00:01:06.980  -->  00:01:06.990

67

00:01:06.990  -->  00:01:09.350
look and see what we have here. In the

68

00:01:09.350  -->  00:01:09.360

69

00:01:09.360  -->  00:01:10.730
first section that's the one we're in

70

00:01:10.730  -->  00:01:10.740

71

00:01:10.740  -->  00:01:12.740
right now you will install Tableau and

72

00:01:12.740  -->  00:01:12.750

73

00:01:12.750  -->  00:01:14.899
then already in lecture three you will see

74

00:01:14.899  -->  00:01:14.909

75

00:01:14.909  -->  00:01:17.749
how you can create a powerful visual and

76

00:01:17.749  -->  00:01:17.760

77

00:01:17.760  -->  00:01:19.820
moreover you will created in under five

78

00:01:19.820  -->  00:01:19.830

79

00:01:19.830  -->  00:01:22.730
minutes and it's the same visual would

80

00:01:22.730  -->  00:01:22.740

81

00:01:22.740  -->  00:01:24.679
have taken hours to create using other

82

00:01:24.679  -->  00:01:24.689

83

00:01:24.689  -->  00:01:28.310
tools then in section 2 we will talk

84

00:01:28.310  -->  00:01:28.320

85

00:01:28.320  -->  00:01:29.870
about the basics of Tableau so I will show

86

00:01:29.870  -->  00:01:29.880

87

00:01:29.880  -->  00:01:31.399
you how to connect to different data

88

00:01:31.399  -->  00:01:31.409

89

00:01:31.409  -->  00:01:34.550
sources we will navigate Tableau we will

90

00:01:34.550  -->  00:01:34.560

91

00:01:34.560  -->  00:01:36.319
learn how to create calculated field so

92

00:01:36.319  -->  00:01:36.329

93

00:01:36.329  -->  00:01:37.999
it's an important topic and I

94

00:01:37.999  -->  00:01:38.009

95

00:01:38.009  -->  00:01:39.962
specifically included it early on in the

96

00:01:39.980  -->  00:01:39.990

97

00:01:39.990  -->  00:01:42.140
course so that we can play around of

98

00:01:42.140  -->  00:01:42.150

99

00:01:42.150  -->  00:01:44.539
calculated fields along the way as we

100

00:01:44.539  -->  00:01:44.549

101

00:01:44.549  -->  00:01:47.179
learn new techniques will talk about

102

00:01:47.179  -->  00:01:47.189

103

00:01:47.189  -->  00:01:49.550
colors formatting and exporting your

104

00:01:49.550  -->  00:01:49.560

105

00:01:49.560  -->  00:01:52.160
results so all the basics will be

106

00:01:52.160  -->  00:01:52.170

107

00:01:52.170  -->  00:01:53.719
covered off in this first section after

108

00:01:53.719  -->  00:01:53.729

109

00:01:53.729  -->  00:01:55.700
that you can already start applying

110

00:01:55.700  -->  00:01:55.710

111

00:01:55.710  -->  00:01:58.100
Tableau start applying the basic level

112

00:01:58.100  -->  00:01:58.110

113

00:01:58.110  -->  00:02:00.440
of Tableau in your work if you require

114

00:02:00.440  -->  00:02:00.450

115

00:02:00.450  -->  00:02:05.240
to do so. Then in section 3 we will go

116

00:02:05.240  -->  00:02:05.250

117

00:02:05.250  -->  00:02:07.370
into a bit more depth will start talking

118

00:02:07.370  -->  00:02:07.380

119

00:02:07.380  -->  00:02:09.080
about time series which is an important

120

00:02:09.080  -->  00:02:09.090

121

00:02:09.090  -->  00:02:11.180
part of working with Tableau so

122

00:02:11.180  -->  00:02:11.190

123

00:02:11.190  -->  00:02:12.410
visualizing trends

124

00:02:12.410  -->  00:02:12.420

125

00:02:12.420  -->  00:02:14.839
and how things change over time we will

126

00:02:14.839  -->  00:02:14.849

127

00:02:14.849  -->  00:02:16.970
talk about filters but most important in

128

00:02:16.970  -->  00:02:16.980

129

00:02:16.980  -->  00:02:18.530
this section we will talk about

130

00:02:18.530  -->  00:02:18.540

131

00:02:18.540  -->  00:02:20.839
aggregation. Aggregation and granularity

132

00:02:20.839  -->  00:02:20.849

133

00:02:20.849  -->  00:02:23.059
so it's this lecture over here and

134

00:02:23.059  -->  00:02:23.069

135

00:02:23.069  -->  00:02:26.089
there you will see how Tableau operates

136

00:02:26.089  -->  00:02:26.099

137

00:02:26.099  -->  00:02:29.240
and what concepts are behind the tool

138

00:02:29.240  -->  00:02:29.250

139

00:02:29.250  -->  00:02:30.530
what's happening in the background when

140

00:02:30.530  -->  00:02:30.540

141

00:02:30.540  -->  00:02:32.510
you're dragging and dropping things into

142

00:02:32.510  -->  00:02:32.520

143

00:02:32.520  -->  00:02:33.830
the charts it's important lecture

144

00:02:33.830  -->  00:02:33.840

145

00:02:33.840  -->  00:02:35.270
because it's important to understand how

146

00:02:35.270  -->  00:02:35.280

147

00:02:35.280  -->  00:02:37.490
the tool works to take full advantage of

148

00:02:37.490  -->  00:02:37.500

149

00:02:37.500  -->  00:02:40.820
it going forward. Next in section 4 you

150

00:02:40.820  -->  00:02:40.830

151

00:02:40.830  -->  00:02:42.800
will already create your first dashboard

152

00:02:42.800  -->  00:02:42.810

153

00:02:42.810  -->  00:02:44.900
that is how quickly we will get our first

154

00:02:44.900  -->  00:02:44.910

155

00:02:44.910  -->  00:02:47.840
dashboard. So we will create maps a map

156

00:02:47.840  -->  00:02:47.850

157

00:02:47.850  -->  00:02:49.729
will create a scatter plot and then we

158

00:02:49.729  -->  00:02:49.739

159

00:02:49.739  -->  00:02:51.710
will combine them into a powerful

160

00:02:51.710  -->  00:02:51.720

161

00:02:51.720  -->  00:02:55.400
dashboard depicting sales of a certain

162

00:02:55.400  -->  00:02:55.410

163

00:02:55.410  -->  00:02:58.370
store and also we will add interaction

164

00:02:58.370  -->  00:02:58.380

165

00:02:58.380  -->  00:03:00.650
interactivity to our dashboard so we'll

166

00:03:00.650  -->  00:03:00.660

167

00:03:00.660  -->  00:03:02.360
add an action which the filter and

168

00:03:02.360  -->  00:03:02.370

169

00:03:02.370  -->  00:03:04.580
highlighting and you will also see the

170

00:03:04.580  -->  00:03:04.590

171

00:03:04.590  -->  00:03:05.990
difference between filtering and

172

00:03:05.990  -->  00:03:06.000

173

00:03:06.000  -->  00:03:09.259
highlighting. Then in section 5 we will

174

00:03:09.259  -->  00:03:09.269

175

00:03:09.269  -->  00:03:12.350
kind of take a step to the side and we

176

00:03:12.350  -->  00:03:12.360

177

00:03:12.360  -->  00:03:14.630
will talk about joining and blending so

178

00:03:14.630  -->  00:03:14.640

179

00:03:14.640  -->  00:03:17.330
I will give you a full introduction into

180

00:03:17.330  -->  00:03:17.340

181

00:03:17.340  -->  00:03:20.599
what joining is so left, right, inner,

182

00:03:20.599  -->  00:03:20.609

183

00:03:20.609  -->  00:03:22.460
outer joins what happens when joins would have

184

00:03:22.460  -->  00:03:22.470

185

00:03:22.470  -->  00:03:24.380
duplicate values and what happens when

186

00:03:24.380  -->  00:03:24.390

187

00:03:24.390  -->  00:03:26.449
you're joining in multiple field so I do

188

00:03:26.449  -->  00:03:26.459

189

00:03:26.459  -->  00:03:29.000
understand that perhaps you are not

190

00:03:29.000  -->  00:03:29.010

191

00:03:29.010  -->  00:03:30.740
coming from an SQL background you might

192

00:03:30.740  -->  00:03:30.750

193

00:03:30.750  -->  00:03:33.170
not know everything about joins so

194

00:03:33.170  -->  00:03:33.180

195

00:03:33.180  -->  00:03:34.849
that's why we covered off in the first

196

00:03:34.849  -->  00:03:34.859

197

00:03:34.859  -->  00:03:37.460
three lectures and then now we will talk

198

00:03:37.460  -->  00:03:37.470

199

00:03:37.470  -->  00:03:39.349
about data blending in Tableau and

200

00:03:39.349  -->  00:03:39.359

201

00:03:39.359  -->  00:03:43.310
finally a lot of people are after this

202

00:03:43.310  -->  00:03:43.320

203

00:03:43.320  -->  00:03:44.630
topic what is the difference between

204

00:03:44.630  -->  00:03:44.640

205

00:03:44.640  -->  00:03:46.789
joining and blending data and went to

206

00:03:46.789  -->  00:03:46.799

207

00:03:46.799  -->  00:03:49.400
use what we will definitely cover that

208

00:03:49.400  -->  00:03:49.410

209

00:03:49.410  -->  00:03:52.580
off so you are a pro in knowing when to

210

00:03:52.580  -->  00:03:52.590

211

00:03:52.590  -->  00:03:54.979
use a join and when to use a blend. Also in this

212

00:03:54.979  -->  00:03:54.989

213

00:03:54.989  -->  00:03:56.690
section we'll cover of a dual-axis

214

00:03:56.690  -->  00:03:56.700

215

00:03:56.700  -->  00:03:59.300
chart which is important and will have

216

00:03:59.300  -->  00:03:59.310

217

00:03:59.310  -->  00:04:01.220
an advanced topic here creating

218

00:04:01.220  -->  00:04:01.230

219

00:04:01.230  -->  00:04:02.599
calculated fields in a blend so I've

220

00:04:02.599  -->  00:04:02.609

221

00:04:02.609  -->  00:04:05.210
included it here you don't have to do it

222

00:04:05.210  -->  00:04:05.220

223

00:04:05.220  -->  00:04:08.270
if you feel that you're not ready you

224

00:04:08.270  -->  00:04:08.280

225

00:04:08.280  -->  00:04:10.220
don't really need this information but

226

00:04:10.220  -->  00:04:10.230

227

00:04:10.230  -->  00:04:12.590
whenever you do see that you need this

228

00:04:12.590  -->  00:04:12.600

229

00:04:12.600  -->  00:04:15.800
specific skill in Tableau you can always

230

00:04:15.800  -->  00:04:15.810

231

00:04:15.810  -->  00:04:17.509
come back to the course and watch this

232

00:04:17.509  -->  00:04:17.519

233

00:04:17.519  -->  00:04:21.259
lecture again. Then after that we move on

234

00:04:21.259  -->  00:04:21.269

235

00:04:21.269  -->  00:04:24.320
to the big guns we're talking here about

236

00:04:24.320  -->  00:04:24.330

237

00:04:24.330  -->  00:04:25.490
creating

238

00:04:25.490  -->  00:04:25.500

239

00:04:25.500  -->  00:04:28.490
a customer segmentation dashboard where

240

00:04:28.490  -->  00:04:28.500

241

00:04:28.500  -->  00:04:30.140
introducing lots of new skills like

242

00:04:30.140  -->  00:04:30.150

243

00:04:30.150  -->  00:04:32.330
table calculations, creating beans, using

244

00:04:32.330  -->  00:04:32.340

245

00:04:32.340  -->  00:04:34.490
parameters, set in

246

00:04:34.490  -->  00:04:34.500

247

00:04:34.500  -->  00:04:35.990
geographical roles at the same time

248

00:04:35.990  -->  00:04:36.000

249

00:04:36.000  -->  00:04:37.580
we're creating lots and lots of new

250

00:04:37.580  -->  00:04:37.590

251

00:04:37.590  -->  00:04:38.900
charts and then we're putting them all

252

00:04:38.900  -->  00:04:38.910

253

00:04:38.910  -->  00:04:41.150
into a segmentation dashboard which will

254

00:04:41.150  -->  00:04:41.160

255

00:04:41.160  -->  00:04:45.110
be very powerful then we will analyze

256

00:04:45.110  -->  00:04:45.120

257

00:04:45.120  -->  00:04:46.640
this dashboard and you'll see how

258

00:04:46.640  -->  00:04:46.650

259

00:04:46.650  -->  00:04:49.610
businesses can take advantage of this

260

00:04:49.610  -->  00:04:49.620

261

00:04:49.620  -->  00:04:51.740
and service the customers better by

262

00:04:51.740  -->  00:04:51.750

263

00:04:51.750  -->  00:04:53.840
looking at data and then we will create

264

00:04:53.840  -->  00:04:53.850

265

00:04:53.850  -->  00:04:55.850
a storyline so storylines a new feature

266

00:04:55.850  -->  00:04:55.860

267

00:04:55.860  -->  00:04:58.700
that was introduced in tableau 8.2 and

268

00:04:58.700  -->  00:04:58.710

269

00:04:58.710  -->  00:05:00.740
here you will learn how to take full

270

00:05:00.740  -->  00:05:00.750

271

00:05:00.750  -->  00:05:03.350
advantage of it and present to your audience

272

00:05:03.350  -->  00:05:03.360

273

00:05:03.360  -->  00:05:05.360
in the best possible way. And finally at

274

00:05:05.360  -->  00:05:05.370

275

00:05:05.370  -->  00:05:06.650
the end of the course we will talk about

276

00:05:06.650  -->  00:05:06.660

277

00:05:06.660  -->  00:05:08.300
advanced data preparations this is

278

00:05:08.300  -->  00:05:08.310

279

00:05:08.310  -->  00:05:10.040
kind of a bonus section that I've thrown

280

00:05:10.040  -->  00:05:10.050

281

00:05:10.050  -->  00:05:11.840
into this course because data

282

00:05:11.840  -->  00:05:11.850

283

00:05:11.850  -->  00:05:14.060
preparation is important and in Tableau 9

284

00:05:14.060  -->  00:05:14.070

285

00:05:14.070  -->  00:05:16.310
there were a lot of new features

286

00:05:16.310  -->  00:05:16.320

287

00:05:16.320  -->  00:05:17.900
were introduced that allow you to

288

00:05:17.900  -->  00:05:17.910

289

00:05:17.910  -->  00:05:20.900
simplify the process of data cleaning

290

00:05:20.900  -->  00:05:20.910

291

00:05:20.910  -->  00:05:23.780
and preparation for your analysis.

292

00:05:23.780  -->  00:05:23.790

293

00:05:23.790  -->  00:05:25.909
So definitely an advanced section or

294

00:05:25.909  -->  00:05:25.919

295

00:05:25.919  -->  00:05:29.240
moreover important section because this

296

00:05:29.240  -->  00:05:29.250

297

00:05:29.250  -->  00:05:31.430
is something that has to be done every

298

00:05:31.430  -->  00:05:31.440

299

00:05:31.440  -->  00:05:34.969
single time but it will get you going

300

00:05:34.969  -->  00:05:34.979

301

00:05:34.979  -->  00:05:37.490
through your analysis much faster and

302

00:05:37.490  -->  00:05:37.500

303

00:05:37.500  -->  00:05:39.110
then in section 8 we will talk about the

304

00:05:39.110  -->  00:05:39.120

305

00:05:39.120  -->  00:05:41.900
new additions in Tableau 10 so here

306

00:05:41.900  -->  00:05:41.910

307

00:05:41.910  -->  00:05:43.490
we're going to have a brand new

308

00:05:43.490  -->  00:05:43.500

309

00:05:43.500  -->  00:05:44.870
challenge is going to be a start-up

310

00:05:44.870  -->  00:05:44.880

311

00:05:44.880  -->  00:05:47.240
expansion analytics challenge where

312

00:05:47.240  -->  00:05:47.250

313

00:05:47.250  -->  00:05:49.550
we're going to be helping a startup

314

00:05:49.550  -->  00:05:49.560

315

00:05:49.560  -->  00:05:52.159
company solve some analytics problems that

316

00:05:52.159  -->  00:05:52.169

317

00:05:52.169  -->  00:05:54.890
they're facing. Then we will learn

318

00:05:54.890  -->  00:05:54.900

319

00:05:54.900  -->  00:05:58.070
the three main new additions in Tableau 10

320

00:05:58.070  -->  00:05:58.080

321

00:05:58.080  -->  00:06:00.500
and that is the custom territories,

322

00:06:00.500  -->  00:06:00.510

323

00:06:00.510  -->  00:06:03.320
the clustering analytics in Tableau and

324

00:06:03.320  -->  00:06:03.330

325

00:06:03.330  -->  00:06:06.530
a cross database join. So we will learn

326

00:06:06.530  -->  00:06:06.540

327

00:06:06.540  -->  00:06:09.440
two ways to perform custom territories and

328

00:06:09.440  -->  00:06:09.450

329

00:06:09.450  -->  00:06:11.240
that's why groups and why geographic

330

00:06:11.240  -->  00:06:11.250

331

00:06:11.250  -->  00:06:13.610
roles and then we will talk more about

332

00:06:13.610  -->  00:06:13.620

333

00:06:13.620  -->  00:06:15.740
these two new features and specifically

334

00:06:15.740  -->  00:06:15.750

335

00:06:15.750  -->  00:06:17.930
will devote a lot of time and attention

336

00:06:17.930  -->  00:06:17.940

337

00:06:17.940  -->  00:06:20.180
to clustering in Tableau because that is a

338

00:06:20.180  -->  00:06:20.190

339

00:06:20.190  -->  00:06:22.940
ultra powerful feature that was

340

00:06:22.940  -->  00:06:22.950

341

00:06:22.950  -->  00:06:25.070
introduced in Tableau 10. Also we will

342

00:06:25.070  -->  00:06:25.080

343

00:06:25.080  -->  00:06:26.719
talk about other features that were

344

00:06:26.719  -->  00:06:26.729

345

00:06:26.729  -->  00:06:29.630
introduced such as a highlighter then

346

00:06:29.630  -->  00:06:29.640

347

00:06:29.640  -->  00:06:31.610
the some new design features and some

348

00:06:31.610  -->  00:06:31.620

349

00:06:31.620  -->  00:06:34.040
new mobile features and all in all in

350

00:06:34.040  -->  00:06:34.050

351

00:06:34.050  -->  00:06:36.350
this section we'll solve a very fun and

352

00:06:36.350  -->  00:06:36.360

353

00:06:36.360  -->  00:06:36.990
exciting

354

00:06:36.990  -->  00:06:37.000

355

00:06:37.000  -->  00:06:41.100
business challenge for this startup. So

356

00:06:41.100  -->  00:06:41.110

357

00:06:41.110  -->  00:06:43.050
that's how the course is structured hope

358

00:06:43.050  -->  00:06:43.060

359

00:06:43.060  -->  00:06:45.030
you're excited and I look forward to

360

00:06:45.030  -->  00:06:45.040

361

00:06:45.040  -->  00:06:46.020
seeing you next time

362

00:06:46.020  -->  00:06:46.030

363

00:06:46.030  -->  00:06:52.710
until then happy analyzing.
