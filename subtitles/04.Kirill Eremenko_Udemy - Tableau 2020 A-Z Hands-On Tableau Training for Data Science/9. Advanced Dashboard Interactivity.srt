00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,910
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau and in the period tutorial we created this dashboard

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,580
and what we're going to do today is we'll make it interactive and fix it up a little bit.

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,790
The make sure that the colors look great.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,060
OK.

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,260
So now if I click around on the dashboard nothing happens which makes sense because it's not interactive

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,540
the only thing we can interact here with is the balance groups.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,500
And that's because we created our parameters and one of the previous tutorials.

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:38,780
Well very quickly let's make it interactive we really know that we have a fast and efficient shortcut

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:46,970
to doing that if we click on the dropdown here and we click users filter right away in our dashboard

10
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,960
actions a filter has been generated a select filter.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,940
And if we click Edit it's using the map to affect all of the other elements of our dashboard.

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,470
So let's go back and see how this works so if I click on Scotland now you can see the rest of the dashboard

13
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,550
adjusts united.

14
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,860
So England Wales Northern Ireland.

15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,410
You can see that the dashboard is adjusting and we can really gather insights.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:23,330
For instance in Scotland our gender split is much more very different to our overall split in the U.K.

17
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:30,530
72 percent of male and in Northern Ireland 74 percent of our customers are actually female.

18
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,790
Very interesting stuff.

19
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,310
OK.

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:39,960
So now let's do the same for the rest of them users filter users filter.

21
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,680
If you don't want to use something as filter then just don't use.

22
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,520
Don't do this for that element of dashboard burnout case.

23
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,190
We're gonna use all of those filters and now we can click on anything saying that we want to look at

24
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,850
all of the female customers of the bank we just click on that.

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,280
And now we can see all of them or we want to look at all the male customers or we want to look at all

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,180
of the white collar workers that would bankrupt us and we will also want to overlay white collar workers

27
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,280
with males.

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,140
Let's have a look where where they're situated.

29
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,940
You can see right away they're mostly in the UK.

30
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,200
What about males and blue collar workers.

31
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:17,600
Aha.

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,180
So most of them are actually in Scotland.

33
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:28,180
Very powerful stuff and same thing with balances if you want to have a look at the highest balances

34
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,370
say everybody above one hundred thousands who just select these and there you go.

35
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,210
You can see their age where exactly they're located and so on.

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,770
And to uncheck under a filter you just click somewhere and undone what else you can see right away.

37
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,280
Is this little annoying pop up.

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,770
Sometimes it's useful but in this particular case not really because we can see everything from the

39
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:58,780
dashboard we don't need to have this pop up following our mouse all the time and it can get in the way

40
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,460
so if I'm looking at these charts now this pop up is covering up my parameter control some other of

41
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,660
the some other bars and so on if I put my mouse here it's covering up the the number.

42
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,250
So let's go ahead and get rid of these pop up.

43
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:19,490
So you need to go to each of the worksheets and switch it off so go to let's start with map.

44
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,810
And here if you go to worksheet show tooltip and then just uncheck show tooltip.

45
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

46
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,640
And if you go back to the dashboard this you know more tooltip still here and you have to for the other

47
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,090
ones as well.

48
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:38,480
But instead of going to the sheet you can just click on it go to worksheet here tooltip and check this

49
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,520
same thing worksheet tooltip uncheck.

50
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,640
No there's none here so worksheet tool to uncheck.

51
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,530
And the last one worksheet tool to uncheck voila.

52
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,690
So now whenever I put my mouse over something I don't see any tool tips which is great.

53
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,270
All that happens is I can select.

54
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,840
So that's how dashboard ready in the next tutorial we'll do some analysis.

55
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,470
And then in the tutorial after that we will start putting everything into a storyline.

56
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,690
I look forward to seeing you next time.

57
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,380
And until then happy analyzing.
