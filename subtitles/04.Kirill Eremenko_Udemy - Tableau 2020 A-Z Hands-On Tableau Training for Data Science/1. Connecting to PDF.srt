00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,410
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tumblr in today's tutorial.

2
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,040
We'll look at how to connect to PDF documents from within Tablo.

3
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,220
I know the previous lectures were a lot of talking, but today we actually get to doing and I'm super

4
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,300
excited about this topic because now we are able to connect to PDF documents.

5
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:09,200
And this has been personally one of my challenges in the past where it's provided a PDF document and

6
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,310
also to analyze it.

7
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:10,860
All right.

8
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,790
But let's jump into Tablo and have a look at how this works.

9
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,100
Now, you'll notice the PDF file connection under the normal connection options.

10
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:25,160
So we'll click that and we'll use our NYC Wasseypur Crime Stats PDF file.

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,480
Not immediately.

12
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,590
You'll notice something different as when we connected to our previous files.

13
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,900
It provides it opens up with a page picture.

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,500
Now, this page allows us to specify other which single pages we want to use or a range of pages.

15
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,910
And in our case we'll be using all.

16
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,350
But this is super handy.

17
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:48,200
If you remember the example we had of when a table was on a specific table, then we can specify that

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,670
over there.

19
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,020
It's also very important to note that when we're working with page numbers in PDF and I'll just open

20
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,550
up a paedophile, is that Tablo uses the absolute page, no reference.

21
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,660
And that's what you'll find here in your PDF reader.

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,610
Do you be careful when using the page number on the sheet as that might differ from the actual absolute

23
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,090
page?

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,860
No reference over there because sometimes in reports you will find that the first few pages are just

25
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,300
an introduction or some images and the actual report only starts on later pages.

26
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,850
So do be careful and only focus on that.

27
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,440
This will save you a lot of time and problems going forward.

28
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,350
Trust me, but back to Tablo.

29
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,630
So we will just be collecting all of the pages because all of our data is located on all pages.

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,620
And immediately you'll see that Tableau has interpreted the PDF file and created a whole number of different

31
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,100
tables.

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,750
But let's unpack that quickly.

33
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,950
We can see that we've got for each page one or two different tables and we'll have a closer look.

34
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:52,190
But that's just to indicate that Tableau has interpreted the data on the table or the data on the page,

35
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,840
rather, into different possible format.

36
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,210
Let's take page one, table one and have a look what that looks like.

37
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,190
And as you can see, this looks familiar to what we had with Excel files earlier where some of the data

38
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,420
is not properly written.

39
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,730
It's also erasing some of the header information and therefore quite a bit messy at the moment.

40
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,040
But just like we clean our Excel files, we are able to use the data interpretor to clean the PDF document

41
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,910
or a little tableau, apply some logic to see if it can clean this file for us.

42
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,620
So let's use that.

43
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:28,610
Let's take the used data interpretor and as magic and as we've seen this for Excel files, Tableau is

44
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:34,070
able to identify it correctly and put the right names into the right columns with the right correct

45
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,560
data.

46
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,510
Now what we'll see.

47
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,830
We've got all the parks running down.

48
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,760
We've got 49 records and this does look complete.

49
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,300
But let's look at what is in table two then.

50
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,800
So if we go to table, if we have a look at table two and still using the data interpreter, you will

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,450
see that we have much less records.

52
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,450
So tablas only identified nine records to be read in.

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,640
And we know for a fact when we look at our actual PDF file, there's more than nine lines.

54
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,810
They are actually forty nine.

55
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,070
So you can count them, by the way.

56
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,460
But Tablo has been saying or is then saying that in this method, number two, it's only to find nine

57
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:07,670
lines.

58
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,710
So that definitely does not look correct.

59
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,290
And we won't be using the second interpretation.

60
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,580
Let's add back the first one and we're always using that interpreter.

61
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,510
It's good to check your data quality or you integrate your data is complete.

62
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,180
So let's click on the review results just to make sure there aren't any funny's that happened when Tablo

63
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,190
was in was interpreting this.

64
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,130
Now, we've worked with this before, so we'll skip that first part.

65
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,620
But what we can see is that Tableau is correct, identified the header in rate and all of the lines

66
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,220
correctly.

67
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,440
And you'll see there's nothing at the bottom.

68
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,630
So it's connected to all the lines.

69
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,630
And as I mentioned to you, there are basically 49 different lines in our data.

70
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,330
Perfect.

71
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,450
So we know that is complete and correct.

72
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,150
But obviously, we don't only want the first page, we want all of the remaining pages as well.

73
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:01,570
So to do that, we'll just hold down the control button and click on the first table only of each page.

74
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,010
So ignoring page two, because we know that the first method of importing the data is correct.

75
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,350
And what you might want to do in the data interpreter is also just to confirm that I have actually already

76
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,560
checked.

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,850
That's on no, that is complete.

78
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,370
But yes, we want to add these different tables from these pages.

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,990
So how do we do that?

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,350
We don't want to join them.

81
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,160
So if we drag them straight into our area over there, it would join them.

82
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,150
We actually just want to open them or rather union them.

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,730
So how you do that is once it's all selected, you just drag it over into this pen and you hold it close

84
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,670
to the page one table one that's already there.

85
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,180
You'll see it opens up a and the drop area for us, an area to basically drag the tables to union.

86
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,580
And make sure that it turns orange so that it is actually dropping it in there and not next to it,

87
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,470
so once you drop it in there, tabla will do a few calculations and it will actually add the number

88
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:55,800
of records.

89
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,390
You can see we've got 1000 there.

90
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,210
We can just make it a bit more, make the limit a bit more by just adding a few zeros.

91
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,650
And now we end up with one thousand one hundred and fifty five rows.

92
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,560
So we're thinking that this is all of the records.

93
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,430
But we will check that.

94
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,480
What also has happened is that Tablo has added and if one field.

95
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,610
Yeah, and that might seem strange because we know we don't we didn't have that in the first page at

96
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,270
first table.

97
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:24,690
But if we scroll down and have a look, we can see that this is simply the park name, where in some

98
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,800
cases it didn't incorrectly or it didn't correctly identify that.

99
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,540
So we can fix that.

100
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,160
Quite simply, we just click on talk.

101
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,260
Well, while holding control down, click on EF1 and from the dropdown select merge mismatched fields

102
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:47,160
so it would throw the nulls away and populate them with the correct value that was actually used.

103
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,100
So you can see if we scroll through now, all of the parks have names and if one has disappeared and

104
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,830
was merged in there, I am actually just going to change this.

105
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,710
I just want to call it pork and then clean up the file a little bit because we don't want some of these

106
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:01,990
fields.

107
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,660
So, for instance, size we can hide.

108
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,600
We don't want any of these fields because we only work with the total so we can just hide them as well.

109
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,610
And I don't care about the table name.

110
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,520
And let's give this a proper name.

111
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,180
Let's call this incidence.

112
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,700
That's where the number of incidents reported so end up with three fields nicely cleaned file.

113
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,530
However, we did see that we've got 1155 records and as we don't have a record count, let me just get

114
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,640
to the PDF once again.

115
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,620
If the fact that we don't have the number of records in our file, but we do know we've got a total

116
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,890
loss, so we can it back to the total line.

117
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:47,520
So back to to our Tablo, we could just open up a sheet and simply drag in the incidents into our area

118
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,940
over there.

119
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,430
And we can see that now to at least two hundred and eighteen, which does not seem correct at all.

120
00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:01,320
So if you go back to our data source, we know that Tablo might interpret this total, but actually

121
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,270
also as a record.

122
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,150
So let's see if it has done that right at the bottom.

123
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,430
You can see Tablo has seen that as a normal record.

124
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,720
And we know that is not a bug.

125
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,650
That's just a total.

126
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:17,160
So we can add a data source filter to remove that so we can just click add by the filters, add another

127
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,570
one and go to pork's.

128
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:26,070
So we want to basically filter the total line of the line with the total input.

129
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:33,270
So we will just basically say we will look up for the word total, we will select that and say exclude.

130
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,600
This is just if we do refresh our data with new information that we add, new box are being added that

131
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,210
we don't include total or we don't specify specific box, but we just exclude any totals from there.

132
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,380
So we can it's OK.

133
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:46,880
It's OK.

134
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,550
Once again, we can see our number of rows obviously changed one list.

135
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:56,130
And now if we go into our sheet, we'll see that we've got one hundred and nine records, which is or

136
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,670
rather 109 incidents, which is correct, as we know from our PDF.

137
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:06,330
So as you can see, a bit of cleanup is required and a bit of quality checks also in working with paedophiles,

138
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,690
but actually quite an easy way to connect to paedophiles.

139
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,970
And this is for me, excellent.

140
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:19,050
Then to patches some up, it's important to note that each PDF document that you'll work with will have

141
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,490
different clean up procedures.

142
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,080
So they might be additional steps required or even less taped.

143
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,750
It's all about how that the data is interpreted by Tablo.

144
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,290
Also important to note that the blow will have issues, important hierarchies and headers.

145
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:40,920
Subtitles multiple rows of content that should be interpreted as one or any colour and shading on your

146
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,070
PDF document can affect how Tablo interprets the data.

147
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,020
So do be careful with that.

148
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,500
In the next material will be looking at another fault up which we are able to connect to in Tablo now

149
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,910
with a new Tablo Connector.

150
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,300
Also a very exciting one in my opinion, in any case.

151
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,630
But we will have a look at the file type and how we can best make use of them in Tableau.

152
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,560
I look forward to seeing you next time.

153
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,420
Until then, happy analysing.
