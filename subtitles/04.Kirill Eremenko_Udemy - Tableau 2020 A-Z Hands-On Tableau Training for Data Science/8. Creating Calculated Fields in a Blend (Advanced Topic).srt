00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,750
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,530
In the previous tutorial we created this beautiful visualization in front of us which allows us to compare

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,360
the actual sales of the different departments of a store to their target sales.

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,160
And today we will finish up with blending and what we will do is we will talk about how to create a

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,380
calculated field within a blend and what that means is how do we create a calculated field that requires

6
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,510
starter elements from both of the tables which are being blended.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,210
Now I feel that this is an important topic that I should share with you because you will be creating

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,200
a lot of calculated fields along the way.

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,460
When you work with Tableau and when it comes to creating calculate fields within a blend it's a bit

10
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:49,850
different.

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,440
There are certain specifics that you need to be aware of.

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,400
So I just wanted to make sure we cover off this topic so that you're not in for any surprises along

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,070
the way when you are working with Tableau in your role.

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,800
So let's get ahead.

15
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,140
Let's go ahead and get straight to it.

16
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:11,780
Here we've got our charts and what we will be looking to do is for each one of the departments we will

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,000
want to look at the difference between the actual sales and the target sale.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,490
So we want to create a chart which will be taking every single bar and subtracting the target and seeing

19
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,700
whether basically the bar.

20
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:30,260
The remainder of the bar is above zero or below zero and that will allow us to very quickly see how

21
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:36,960
the departments are performing now because adding another chart will increase the size of this worksheet.

22
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:43,070
We might want to consider taking these departments and looking them at looking at them separately so

23
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,560
that it's not too cluttered because we already have.

24
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,480
Basically right now we have six charts on this worksheet.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,170
We've got the targets which are in gray in the background and we have the actual sales which are these

26
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,380
bars in the front.

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,660
So if we add another chart for every single one of the departments I'll take it to nine charts that

28
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,060
might be a bit overwhelming for the user.

29
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,130
So we want to take care of the user and that's why we're going to kind of simplify this chart a little

30
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:14,110
bit and we can very easily do that by taking the category out of rows and putting it into a filter.

31
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,220
So that's we're going to do we're going to take category and drag it from rose to filter and right away

32
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,110
we've got this filter settings that come up we're going to click Okay.

33
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,730
And what that gives us is quite a crazy chart right away because we are looking at everything at the

34
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,580
same time.

35
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,110
What we will do is we will take this and we'll click show quick filter.

36
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,570
Now I'm going to reduce the size of the chart a little bit so I can zoom in and so that you can see

37
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,650
the filter at the same time.

38
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,910
And we're going to reduce the size of the bar so that's just for for us.

39
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,720
Okay.

40
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,330
So that's what our chart looks like.

41
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,790
Of course we don't want to see everything at the same time we're trying to get away from that.

42
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:02,570
So first of all we're going to customize or change this filter to a single value list and then we'll

43
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:08,370
take out that all our value so we'll take we'll go customize show all value take it off.

44
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,910
And now we can simply click through our departments and we'll see the chart for each one of them which

45
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,690
is great.

46
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:21,170
Now at this point which you might be seeing is something different and not a worry I'll be able to help

47
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:28,850
out right away so perhaps what you're seeing looks something like this for it after you've taken category

48
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:34,680
out of the rolls and you put into filter what's happened is now when you click over from the different

49
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,210
three different departments you see the total target for all of the departments of the individual target

50
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,610
and that can happen.

51
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:50,180
That just means that what you did by taking category out of rows is it's just a filter now so it's no

52
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:57,260
longer a level of granularity of The View and Tableau no longer aggregates the data at that level.

53
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:04,070
It ignores that level of granularity when it's doing this blend and why that happen is because perhaps

54
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:10,280
in your some of target in this control window when you in the previous tutorial when you removed a category

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,030
from color to make the target Grey you didn't put it into detail but you rather just removed it completely.

56
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:23,480
So right now what's happening is for this chart this great chart in the background here if you look

57
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:31,130
at the look at the worksheet right now you will see that category is nowhere to be seen as a level of

58
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,120
granularity.

59
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,970
Ignore it as a filter because a filter just filters data but you target your categories not in columns

60
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,050
it's not in rows it's nowhere to be seen in this control panel.

61
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:48,800
And what that means is right away tableau no longer knows or no longer regards category as a level of

62
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,260
detail and will not aggregate at that level it will ignore it you can fix that once again by taking

63
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,130
category back into the rows right away as you can see now the categories correct.

64
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,940
And you can click through but we didn't want to do that.

65
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,280
We wanted to keep category just as a level of granularity but were fired actually been in our chart.

66
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,340
So we'll take category out of here and we'll just drag category into the detail just make sure it's

67
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:14,720
there.

68
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,050
It might be there if you if you'll put it there in the previous to term might be ready there and that's

69
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,390
where you're seeing everything correct.

70
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:28,920
So just make sure that that's the case because this kind of shows that when tableau aggregates the two

71
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:36,330
separate data sources it only looks at what is and what fields are in the view for that specific data

72
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,750
source and you can check that for through this control panel or here so for sales or for Target and

73
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,520
so on.

74
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,310
So that's how we get our chart to be filtering bull by the different department which is good.

75
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,540
And once again we have to make sure that the access is synchronized which which is a great thing.

76
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,290
So we can visually see right away what's happening and now we're going to create our calculated field

77
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,810
which will be working across the two data sources in the blend.

78
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,170
So we're going to go to the primary data source.

79
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:13,650
We're going to find our field that we're going to use which is sales will right click that and we will

80
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,070
choose create calculated field.

81
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,560
So here we want to take sales and we want to subtract the actual target to see whether the sales are

82
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,010
above or below the target.

83
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:33,710
So we'll call this a calculated field what should we call it meets or to excess of target.

84
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,950
Let's try that size of target.

85
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,340
And now we will go to sales targets so the new the other data source the second one and it will take

86
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,770
target here and we will subtract.

87
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,600
So we will actually first of all we'll put a minus sign because I want to subtract and I will take target

88
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,390
and we'll drag it into a calculated field right away.

89
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,470
You can see two things happen.

90
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:03,120
First of all the sales targets the target has this prefix before it which indicates a data source.

91
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,210
So it's telling us that this field is coming from there and it's basically just the way for tablets

92
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,310
to know which secondary data source this field is coming from and for you also to be able to tell that

93
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,780
very quickly when you look at the calculation next.

94
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,280
You can also see that there is a sum here.

95
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,500
So why there's some appeared.

96
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:30,360
Well that is quite it should be intuitive by now because you know that or we know that this blend is

97
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,320
happening when by tableau aggregating the data first so as we discussed tableau sends separate queries

98
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:43,530
to these data sources it aggregates the data to the correct level of granularity then it brings it back

99
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,510
and it joins or plans it here in tableau.

100
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,690
So that basically basically means that there will already be an aggregation when this calculated field

101
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,360
is being performed or being derived.

102
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:03,330
So that is why this summer's here on this here you can see the calculation contains errors and that

103
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:09,450
is because you're trying to or we're trying to subtract an aggregated field from a non aggregated field

104
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,760
that is easily that can be easily resolved.

105
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,150
We're just going to put a sum around sales here as well.

106
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,750
Woops There we go.

107
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,850
So some sales minus the some of the target another field is valid and we click OK which is great.

108
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,970
Now we can start using it.

109
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:34,560
So let's go ahead and drag excessive target onto our Rose right away you can see a new field appear

110
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,740
excess of target.

111
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:45,510
Now if we go to the control for exits of target as you can see here in this whole view for this new

112
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,950
field there is no category where whatsoever except for in the filter.

113
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:56,760
And that means that category is not being considered as a level of granularity for this specific chart.

114
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,570
The one at the bottom.

115
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,790
So we need to fix that and we're going to do that by taking category and just dragging it into detail

116
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,660
right away.

117
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,620
You can see that the chart has been corrected.

118
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:12,120
And now if you click through it is actually showing you the difference between the charts the bar chart

119
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,350
and the area chart in the background which is correct or exact.

120
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,240
It's exactly what we wanted to see.

121
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,050
So now we'll just make it look pretty.

122
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:26,940
All we have to do is color it properly and we'll just take excess of Target and drag it into color so

123
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,960
by holding down control and right away you can see Tableau is smart.

124
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,670
It's selected the colors for us.

125
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,670
So anything above is blue.

126
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,010
Anything below is orange.

127
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,790
And now we can really start doing some analysis around this perhaps before you start doing a loss.

128
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:47,490
You might want to formatted a little bit so you go into format you change the worksheet to say a 10

129
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,870
or maybe a twelve depending on how much space you have.

130
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,890
You make it bold as you can see all everything has been adjusted.

131
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:01,530
And once again this is a personal preference you might want to color it a bit differently.

132
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,550
So there we go we've got we've got the chart pretty much prepared.

133
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:12,540
Now we can do a bit of analysis so I'll just make this a bit bigger so we can see a bit more the filter

134
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:18,270
here for instance is being cut off a little bit perhaps maybe let's make it a 10.

135
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,220
Yeah that looks better.

136
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,560
So what we want to do is we want to just see how the departments are performing right away.

137
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,960
You can see that the what is this furniture department had a few quite a lot of bad months.

138
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,250
If we move to office supplies you can see that they have much less bad months only one two three four

139
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:46,050
five six seven eight nine ten eleven months below target in the one two three four years and the technology

140
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,250
department has quite a few bad months but recently they've been doing a bit better.

141
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:58,290
So based on that information you can really start making some assumptions or preliminary conclusions

142
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,930
you might say that the furniture department the way they say is set their targets might not be the best

143
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,490
way because they're the they're constantly underperforming and not meeting their targets.

144
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,500
Perhaps this department manager should revisit the way they're setting the target.

145
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,180
So far it's been just constantly increasing month to month over the past four years.

146
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:25,650
Perhaps it's time for a change technology department is setting a targets once per year and that is

147
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:32,310
met perhaps they're not accounting for some seasonality effects as you can see there's some orange bars

148
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:38,550
clustered together so and here like some 0 bars as well so that basically means maybe there is a seasonality

149
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:43,590
effect that they're not taking into account and maybe throughout the year the target should change based

150
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:52,320
on how their customers are purchasing or how their stock is being adjusted and the behavioral patterns

151
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,490
that they're observing and looking at the office supplies department you can see that they have the

152
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,300
least months when they've not met their targets.

153
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,010
And basically means that their way of setting the targets for the months which are reviewed.

154
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:12,840
So these targets are reviewed quarterly seems to be the best approach currently and perhaps that manager

155
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,670
can explain to other managers how he is doing it and what his secret sources.

156
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,390
So that's awesome.

157
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,610
One more thing that you might want to do is perhaps because these two axes are aligned you might just

158
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:33,120
want to right click here and just unsure header so get rid of it and that will save you some space because

159
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,160
pretty much it's the same axis.

160
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,610
And here you can just rename it so added axis and just call it sales slash target apply.

161
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,520
Okay.

162
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:49,140
And that way you're saving space on the right which was not really being used for anything important.

163
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,590
So that's how we create calculated fields across blends.

164
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,890
A very important topic because you will find yourself in situations when you will need it.

165
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,240
And now you're totally prepared for it.

166
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,220
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

167
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,780
Until then happy analyzing.
