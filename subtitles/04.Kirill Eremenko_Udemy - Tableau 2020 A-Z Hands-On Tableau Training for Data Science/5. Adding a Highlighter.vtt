00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.400
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tableau.

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.620
Today we're going to start slowly moving into the second part of the challenge which is to understand

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.620
are those 10 new cities into which the company should start investing heavily in terms of marketing

4
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.540
where the return on that investment will be the highest.

5
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.800
And secondly we're going to talk about highlighting so the highly inefficient tableau which will help

6
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.130
us slowly transition into this part of the challenge.

7
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.120
Going to be quite an interesting tutorial.

8
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.120
So let's get straight into it.

9
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.400
All right.

10
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.160
So I'm going to create a new worksheet and here I'm going to create yet another map.

11
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.410
And right off the bat here's a quick quiz for you.

12
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.490
What happens if I just drag city into the map.

13
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.010
Do I have all 150 cities here.

14
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.100
Is this the correct way to visualize the cities of this company where the company operates.

15
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.150
Just pause this video.

16
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.590
Have a think about it for a second.

17
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.820
If you're following along then look around and look for hints.

18
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.310
And in three two one.

19
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.820
Now we're going to have a look at the answer.

20
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.550
The answer is no because over here at the bottom you can see unknown values if we click here you'll

21
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.270
see that there are ambiguous locations for example a good star Aurora and so on because there are actually

22
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.680
a few of these cities in the US.

23
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.580
So all of these cities are ambiguous and Tableau doesn't know which one to pick out of all of them.

24
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.990
So there we go.

25
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.000
That is not the proper approach to visualize these cities.

26
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.790
The proper approach is to seek this out and will drag state into here or it will drag state into the

27
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.420
map.

28
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.150
And now if we click the plus now we expand.

29
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.570
So we have both state and city in the geographies.

30
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.610
And now you can see that there is no unknowns or there are no unknowns.

31
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:58.540
That is because now tableau knows exactly which city to pick in case if there is in the US a city with

32
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.770
the same name in several locations it will just look at the state and then pick the city in that state.

33
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.040
So that was a quick fun quiz.

34
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.720
And now what we're going to do is we're going to adjust it up a little bit.

35
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:15.900
So we're going to add revenue as the size then we're going to add revenue as a color as well.

36
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.270
And as you can see already here we are seeing some of these cities pop up.

37
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.930
So what else we can do to make this more aesthetic transparency may be set at 80 something percent.

38
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.300
Just a little transparency.

39
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.590
Give it a border.

40
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.950
So now we can really see where the city is located so low smaller cities have brought less revenue.

41
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.110
Larger cities bring more revenue.

42
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.300
And the question is Where are our ten new cities.

43
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.830
How do I identify them here.

44
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.610
Well the quickest way is to take our parameter which is new expansion and just drag it onto color.

45
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.580
So that way we can see right away whether in ten new cities are located.

46
00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:03.460
So there is a rock forward there is Patterson Joliet Chattanooga didn't even know these cities were

47
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.740
in the US college station.

48
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.820
So there we go.

49
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.810
So if you're from one of these cities and a big a huge shout out to you you're a part of our reservation.

50
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.330
All right.

51
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.240
But the the thing here is that now we've lost that wonderful information where the color was also linked

52
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.720
to revenue so this is indeed one of the ways to visualize this series and then you can click here to

53
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.680
highlight them like that as we've read discussed.

54
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.020
But now how do we do the same.

55
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.880
But at the same time don't use this color as the way we're identifying these cities is they're all a

56
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.020
different way to do it.

57
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.340
And there is a way it's called the highlighting feature.

58
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.810
So let's controls at that and return back to the previous version.

59
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.250
Now what we can do is we can take the new expansion parameter and put it into detail instead of color

60
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.890
and now it's in detail.

61
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.000
And it's not really doing anything it is affecting aggregation but it's not adding much because we already

62
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.060
have the city which is unique for our aggregation and we could even put store I.D. into here it won't

63
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.680
do anything new because there is no two cities with the same name in our data set.

64
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.930
That's why store I.D. and a new expansion don't really change aggregation but they are now being taken

65
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.770
into account.

66
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.130
But how do we know use this new expansion in order to quickly identify the new 10 stores.

67
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.010
Well if you click dropdown here and you select show highlighter and not show filter but show high later

68
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.810
then a high letter will appear here.

69
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.500
So I'm actually going to move it over here and what I can do now is I can just select if I click here

70
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.750
you can either type it up or because we only have two categories here.

71
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.390
It's very simple you can just like new.

72
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.650
As you can see it highlights those because like old it highlights all the old cities and you can actually

73
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.640
just click and that way you've highlighted all of the new cities.

74
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.610
Very easy like that so that you can see one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 cities we've

75
00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.750
highlighted very easy and very non-intrusive so it's not actually using up any of our other features

76
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.760
possession like color or shape or size.

77
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.990
We're not using them we just want to subtly highlight something and then just drag it into detail and

78
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:18.700
then use the highlighter option very powerful tool for data exploration so you can very quickly identify

79
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.130
those objects that you want to pinpoint.

80
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.730
So there you go.

81
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:27.460
Hopefully this will be another new tool in your arsenal when you're working with Tableau and I can't

82
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.670
wait to see on the next tutorial where we will dive more into the analysis and understand what's the

83
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.620
difference between the cities and what kind of trends are going on there.

84
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.720
Can't wait to see you there.

85
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.640
Until next time.

86
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.350
Happy analyzing.
