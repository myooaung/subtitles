1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:05,000

2

00:00:05,000  -->  00:00:07,010
Hello and welcome back to the course on

3

00:00:07,010  -->  00:00:07,020

4

00:00:07,020  -->  00:00:09,860
Tableau and finally Tableau 10 is out

5

00:00:09,860  -->  00:00:09,870

6

00:00:09,870  -->  00:00:12,950
and today we're looking at the features

7

00:00:12,950  -->  00:00:12,960

8

00:00:12,960  -->  00:00:14,270
are in this whole section. We're looking

9

00:00:14,270  -->  00:00:14,280

10

00:00:14,280  -->  00:00:16,640
at the new features of Tableau 10, now

11

00:00:16,640  -->  00:00:16,650

12

00:00:16,650  -->  00:00:19,429
Tableau 10 has lots of great and

13

00:00:19,429  -->  00:00:19,439

14

00:00:19,439  -->  00:00:20,870
outstanding features of change the

15

00:00:20,870  -->  00:00:20,880

16

00:00:20,880  -->  00:00:23,450
colors, of added font, so you can optimize

17

00:00:23,450  -->  00:00:23,460

18

00:00:23,460  -->  00:00:25,730
your dashboards to different devices,

19

00:00:25,730  -->  00:00:25,740

20

00:00:25,740  -->  00:00:28,429
there's support for android devices. Lots

21

00:00:28,429  -->  00:00:28,439

22

00:00:28,439  -->  00:00:31,009
of new features and powerful techniques

23

00:00:31,009  -->  00:00:31,019

24

00:00:31,019  -->  00:00:32,209
have been introduced.

25

00:00:32,209  -->  00:00:32,219

26

00:00:32,219  -->  00:00:34,760
However, in my view they are three main

27

00:00:34,760  -->  00:00:34,770

28

00:00:34,770  -->  00:00:37,790
new features that are super ultra

29

00:00:37,790  -->  00:00:37,800

30

00:00:37,800  -->  00:00:39,740
powerful and those three others are

31

00:00:39,740  -->  00:00:39,750

32

00:00:39,750  -->  00:00:41,930
going to focus on inside this section of

33

00:00:41,930  -->  00:00:41,940

34

00:00:41,940  -->  00:00:43,400
course we're going to talk about many

35

00:00:43,400  -->  00:00:43,410

36

00:00:43,410  -->  00:00:45,619
more but these three other ones that I

37

00:00:45,619  -->  00:00:45,629

38

00:00:45,629  -->  00:00:48,470
would like to make sure that your

39

00:00:48,470  -->  00:00:48,480

40

00:00:48,480  -->  00:00:50,060
hundred-percent comfortable with and

41

00:00:50,060  -->  00:00:50,070

42

00:00:50,070  -->  00:00:51,709
that after completing this section you

43

00:00:51,709  -->  00:00:51,719

44

00:00:51,719  -->  00:00:54,200
can honestly put them into your data

45

00:00:54,200  -->  00:00:54,210

46

00:00:54,210  -->  00:00:56,150
sets Arsenal because those are the

47

00:00:56,150  -->  00:00:56,160

48

00:00:56,160  -->  00:00:57,709
three that will make the difference that

49

00:00:57,709  -->  00:00:57,719

50

00:00:57,719  -->  00:00:58,880
will put you ahead of the competition,

51

00:00:58,880  -->  00:00:58,890

52

00:00:58,890  -->  00:01:03,740
that will make you shine make you more

53

00:01:03,740  -->  00:01:03,750

54

00:01:03,750  -->  00:01:06,469
valuable than somebody else who also

55

00:01:06,469  -->  00:01:06,479

56

00:01:06,479  -->  00:01:08,030
knows Tableau because you're going to be

57

00:01:08,030  -->  00:01:08,040

58

00:01:08,040  -->  00:01:10,250
ahead of the game, you are going to know

59

00:01:10,250  -->  00:01:10,260

60

00:01:10,260  -->  00:01:12,560
how to use these features very well and

61

00:01:12,560  -->  00:01:12,570

62

00:01:12,570  -->  00:01:14,330
also you, this whole challenge that we're

63

00:01:14,330  -->  00:01:14,340

64

00:01:14,340  -->  00:01:15,560
doing in this section is going to be

65

00:01:15,560  -->  00:01:15,570

66

00:01:15,570  -->  00:01:17,270
based on these features. We're going to be

67

00:01:17,270  -->  00:01:17,280

68

00:01:17,280  -->  00:01:19,340
using these three features to solve the

69

00:01:19,340  -->  00:01:19,350

70

00:01:19,350  -->  00:01:21,230
challenge along with the other features.

71

00:01:21,230  -->  00:01:21,240

72

00:01:21,240  -->  00:01:23,120
Alright so let's talk about them; What

73

00:01:23,120  -->  00:01:23,130

74

00:01:23,130  -->  00:01:25,310
are the three main features? Number one,

75

00:01:25,310  -->  00:01:25,320

76

00:01:25,320  -->  00:01:27,230
you can build your own custom

77

00:01:27,230  -->  00:01:27,240

78

00:01:27,240  -->  00:01:30,440
territories in Tableau 10, very very

79

00:01:30,440  -->  00:01:30,450

80

00:01:30,450  -->  00:01:32,300
incredibly powerful if you worked with

81

00:01:32,300  -->  00:01:32,310

82

00:01:32,310  -->  00:01:34,910
massive maps in Tableau 10 and kind of

83

00:01:34,910  -->  00:01:34,920

84

00:01:34,920  -->  00:01:37,550
like odd type of weird maps, then you

85

00:01:37,550  -->  00:01:37,560

86

00:01:37,560  -->  00:01:39,649
will know exactly I'm talking about previously,

87

00:01:39,649  -->  00:01:39,659

88

00:01:39,659  -->  00:01:42,080
you'd have to do some geo hacking, I had

89

00:01:42,080  -->  00:01:42,090

90

00:01:42,090  -->  00:01:44,990
to do that once it will it's not fun

91

00:01:44,990  -->  00:01:45,000

92

00:01:45,000  -->  00:01:47,480
you have to actually go and play around with

93

00:01:47,480  -->  00:01:47,490

94

00:01:47,490  -->  00:01:50,270
certain files and create these joke

95

00:01:50,270  -->  00:01:50,280

96

00:01:50,280  -->  00:01:52,219
customers, joke coded files, upload them

97

00:01:52,219  -->  00:01:52,229

98

00:01:52,229  -->  00:01:55,340
into Tableau and literally hack Tableau.

99

00:01:55,340  -->  00:01:55,350

100

00:01:55,350  -->  00:01:57,920
You had to hack Tableau, to get these

101

00:01:57,920  -->  00:01:57,930

102

00:01:57,930  -->  00:01:59,690
maps in there so that you could create

103

00:01:59,690  -->  00:01:59,700

104

00:01:59,700  -->  00:02:02,359
things like this different regions like

105

00:02:02,359  -->  00:02:02,369

106

00:02:02,369  -->  00:02:05,510
this that don't actually exist, that are

107

00:02:05,510  -->  00:02:05,520

108

00:02:05,520  -->  00:02:07,459
only specific to your challenge.

109

00:02:07,459  -->  00:02:07,469

110

00:02:07,469  -->  00:02:10,219
Previously was very very painful and

111

00:02:10,219  -->  00:02:10,229

112

00:02:10,229  -->  00:02:12,180
tedious, now this

113

00:02:12,180  -->  00:02:12,190

114

00:02:12,190  -->  00:02:15,090
this is not right, now it's much easier

115

00:02:15,090  -->  00:02:15,100

116

00:02:15,100  -->  00:02:18,690
to do and we will find out in this

117

00:02:18,690  -->  00:02:18,700

118

00:02:18,700  -->  00:02:20,850
section of course how to. I hope you're

119

00:02:20,850  -->  00:02:20,860

120

00:02:20,860  -->  00:02:22,680
excited about that it will be a great

121

00:02:22,680  -->  00:02:22,690

122

00:02:22,690  -->  00:02:24,240
tool to have,

123

00:02:24,240  -->  00:02:24,250

124

00:02:24,250  -->  00:02:26,610
moreover we will look at two separate

125

00:02:26,610  -->  00:02:26,620

126

00:02:26,620  -->  00:02:29,190
methods of creating custom maps custom

127

00:02:29,190  -->  00:02:29,200

128

00:02:29,200  -->  00:02:31,080
territories in Tableau. Yeah, that's right

129

00:02:31,080  -->  00:02:31,090

130

00:02:31,090  -->  00:02:33,600
we'll look at two methods so, I just want

131

00:02:33,600  -->  00:02:33,610

132

00:02:33,610  -->  00:02:35,700
two different methods how to create

133

00:02:35,700  -->  00:02:35,710

134

00:02:35,710  -->  00:02:38,670
custom territories in Tableau 10, very very

135

00:02:38,670  -->  00:02:38,680

136

00:02:38,680  -->  00:02:41,070
powerful feature, will definitely come in

137

00:02:41,070  -->  00:02:41,080

138

00:02:41,080  -->  00:02:43,200
handy if you work with maps and Tableau.

139

00:02:43,200  -->  00:02:45,900
Alright feature number two, uncover

140

00:02:45,900  -->  00:02:45,910

141

00:02:45,910  -->  00:02:48,240
patterns in your data with Tableau

142

00:02:48,240  -->  00:02:48,250

143

00:02:48,250  -->  00:02:51,660
10's clustering feature. So another

144

00:02:51,660  -->  00:02:51,670

145

00:02:51,670  -->  00:02:55,380
ultra useful technique, so this we've got

146

00:02:55,380  -->  00:02:55,390

147

00:02:55,390  -->  00:02:57,750
some examples here they're just creating

148

00:02:57,750  -->  00:02:57,760

149

00:02:57,760  -->  00:02:59,550
some clusters over there, that's clusters

150

00:02:59,550  -->  00:02:59,560

151

00:02:59,560  -->  00:03:02,130
on a map then there's just some clusters

152

00:03:02,130  -->  00:03:02,140

153

00:03:02,140  -->  00:03:05,520
inside on scatter plots combined with the

154

00:03:05,520  -->  00:03:05,530

155

00:03:05,530  -->  00:03:08,850
maps. So it's a powerful technique. It

156

00:03:08,850  -->  00:03:08,860

157

00:03:08,860  -->  00:03:11,250
allows you to understand how your

158

00:03:11,250  -->  00:03:11,260

159

00:03:11,260  -->  00:03:13,830
data is grouped and identify groups

160

00:03:13,830  -->  00:03:13,840

161

00:03:13,840  -->  00:03:15,270
in your data that aren't just

162

00:03:15,270  -->  00:03:15,280

163

00:03:15,280  -->  00:03:17,460
visually evidence. So we'll see that in

164

00:03:17,460  -->  00:03:17,470

165

00:03:17,470  -->  00:03:19,260
this section, we'll see when we can

166

00:03:19,260  -->  00:03:19,270

167

00:03:19,270  -->  00:03:20,820
visually identify a group and then

168

00:03:20,820  -->  00:03:20,830

169

00:03:20,830  -->  00:03:22,920
Tableau will confirm that for us and then

170

00:03:22,920  -->  00:03:22,930

171

00:03:22,930  -->  00:03:26,490
we'll refine our clustering and we will

172

00:03:26,490  -->  00:03:26,500

173

00:03:26,500  -->  00:03:28,800
challenge Tableau to create clusters from

174

00:03:28,800  -->  00:03:28,810

175

00:03:28,810  -->  00:03:31,110
more data than we can see and it will

176

00:03:31,110  -->  00:03:31,120

177

00:03:31,120  -->  00:03:32,790
do that for us and you will see some

178

00:03:32,790  -->  00:03:32,800

179

00:03:32,800  -->  00:03:35,520
very powerful insights from that very

180

00:03:35,520  -->  00:03:35,530

181

00:03:35,530  -->  00:03:38,940
good technique to have at you're just

182

00:03:38,940  -->  00:03:38,950

183

00:03:38,950  -->  00:03:40,710
by your side to use at any point time

184

00:03:40,710  -->  00:03:40,720

185

00:03:40,720  -->  00:03:42,630
because it's a great advantage because

186

00:03:42,630  -->  00:03:42,640

187

00:03:42,640  -->  00:03:45,150
previously to in order to run clustering

188

00:03:45,150  -->  00:03:45,160

189

00:03:45,160  -->  00:03:48,300
analysis or create clusters you would

190

00:03:48,300  -->  00:03:48,310

191

00:03:48,310  -->  00:03:51,270
have to attach tools like r2 analysis or

192

00:03:51,270  -->  00:03:51,280

193

00:03:51,280  -->  00:03:52,770
maybe create the clusters elsewhere and

194

00:03:52,770  -->  00:03:52,780

195

00:03:52,780  -->  00:03:54,630
then import them into Tableau. Now

196

00:03:54,630  -->  00:03:54,640

197

00:03:54,640  -->  00:03:56,790
they've incorporated this methodology

198

00:03:56,790  -->  00:03:56,800

199

00:03:56,800  -->  00:03:59,640
inside Tableau, so it's as easy as

200

00:03:59,640  -->  00:03:59,650

201

00:03:59,650  -->  00:04:01,500
everything else just drag-and-drop and

202

00:04:01,500  -->  00:04:01,510

203

00:04:01,510  -->  00:04:05,490
you have a ultra-sophisticated tool that

204

00:04:05,490  -->  00:04:05,500

205

00:04:05,500  -->  00:04:07,530
is working for you in the background and

206

00:04:07,530  -->  00:04:07,540

207

00:04:07,540  -->  00:04:09,600
it's just giving you the results which you

208

00:04:09,600  -->  00:04:09,610

209

00:04:09,610  -->  00:04:11,610
can use right away in your analysis. We'll

210

00:04:11,610  -->  00:04:11,620

211

00:04:11,620  -->  00:04:13,680
see how powerful that is inside this

212

00:04:13,680  -->  00:04:13,690

213

00:04:13,690  -->  00:04:14,940
section as well.

214

00:04:14,940  -->  00:04:14,950

215

00:04:14,950  -->  00:04:16,680
Alright, so I hope you're very excited

216

00:04:16,680  -->  00:04:16,690

217

00:04:16,690  -->  00:04:18,960
about that already so we've got two super

218

00:04:18,960  -->  00:04:18,970

219

00:04:18,970  -->  00:04:21,630
powerful tools. We've looked at maps and

220

00:04:21,630  -->  00:04:21,640

221

00:04:21,640  -->  00:04:23,730
now we've looked at clustering and now

222

00:04:23,730  -->  00:04:23,740

223

00:04:23,740  -->  00:04:26,400
we've got another tool in the third

224

00:04:26,400  -->  00:04:26,410

225

00:04:26,410  -->  00:04:30,390
realm in the space of data connections,

226

00:04:30,390  -->  00:04:30,400

227

00:04:30,400  -->  00:04:32,250
integrate your data with cross-

228

00:04:32,250  -->  00:04:32,260

229

00:04:32,260  -->  00:04:35,550
database joins in Tableau 10. Yes, we can

230

00:04:35,550  -->  00:04:35,560

231

00:04:35,560  -->  00:04:36,900
finally do it.

232

00:04:36,900  -->  00:04:36,910

233

00:04:36,910  -->  00:04:39,779
Remember back in the day, well back in

234

00:04:39,779  -->  00:04:39,789

235

00:04:39,789  -->  00:04:42,330
the day before Tableau 10, you couldn't

236

00:04:42,330  -->  00:04:42,340

237

00:04:42,340  -->  00:04:45,750
connect a data sets from different

238

00:04:45,750  -->  00:04:45,760

239

00:04:45,760  -->  00:04:47,100
sources. So for instance, if you had a

240

00:04:47,100  -->  00:04:47,110

241

00:04:47,110  -->  00:04:51,570
data set from a excel file and a SQL

242

00:04:51,570  -->  00:04:51,580

243

00:04:51,580  -->  00:04:53,760
database, the only way to combine them

244

00:04:53,760  -->  00:04:53,770

245

00:04:53,770  -->  00:04:56,340
would be to create a blend and same

246

00:04:56,340  -->  00:04:56,350

247

00:04:56,350  -->  00:04:59,219
thing goes for excel and csv for example

248

00:04:59,219  -->  00:04:59,229

249

00:04:59,229  -->  00:05:00,750
and lots of examples. Here they've got

250

00:05:00,750  -->  00:05:00,760

251

00:05:00,760  -->  00:05:04,230
SQL and MySQL and before you'd have to

252

00:05:04,230  -->  00:05:04,240

253

00:05:04,240  -->  00:05:06,029
create a blend in order to combine those

254

00:05:06,029  -->  00:05:06,039

255

00:05:06,039  -->  00:05:09,240
data sets and now they've changed it now

256

00:05:09,240  -->  00:05:09,250

257

00:05:09,250  -->  00:05:12,270
you can actually combine data sets from

258

00:05:12,270  -->  00:05:12,280

259

00:05:12,280  -->  00:05:15,300
different data sources no problem, of

260

00:05:15,300  -->  00:05:15,310

261

00:05:15,310  -->  00:05:16,680
course there's still some restrictions

262

00:05:16,680  -->  00:05:16,690

263

00:05:16,690  -->  00:05:19,080
but they're very specific. They are only

264

00:05:19,080  -->  00:05:19,090

265

00:05:19,090  -->  00:05:20,820
some data's basis that you can

266

00:05:20,820  -->  00:05:20,830

267

00:05:20,830  -->  00:05:23,550
connect with but for most applications

268

00:05:23,550  -->  00:05:23,560

269

00:05:23,560  -->  00:05:26,880
we there is now a connection that you

270

00:05:26,880  -->  00:05:26,890

271

00:05:26,890  -->  00:05:29,520
can create joins, not just blend. You can

272

00:05:29,520  -->  00:05:29,530

273

00:05:29,530  -->  00:05:31,800
create joins it before you start your

274

00:05:31,800  -->  00:05:31,810

275

00:05:31,810  -->  00:05:34,290
analysis even if your data is coming

276

00:05:34,290  -->  00:05:34,300

277

00:05:34,300  -->  00:05:36,839
from different data sources. If you've

278

00:05:36,839  -->  00:05:36,849

279

00:05:36,849  -->  00:05:39,600
worked on some projects, where data does

280

00:05:39,600  -->  00:05:39,610

281

00:05:39,610  -->  00:05:40,980
come from different sources, you will

282

00:05:40,980  -->  00:05:40,990

283

00:05:40,990  -->  00:05:44,460
know and appreciate how useful this new

284

00:05:44,460  -->  00:05:44,470

285

00:05:44,470  -->  00:05:46,740
feature will be to you. So I'm

286

00:05:46,740  -->  00:05:46,750

287

00:05:46,750  -->  00:05:48,180
super-excited about this one as well.

288

00:05:48,180  -->  00:05:48,190

289

00:05:48,190  -->  00:05:51,480
It's a big step forward for Tableau, it

290

00:05:51,480  -->  00:05:51,490

291

00:05:51,490  -->  00:05:53,640
has been a long time coming and it's

292

00:05:53,640  -->  00:05:53,650

293

00:05:53,650  -->  00:05:55,920
finally here. We can create cross

294

00:05:55,920  -->  00:05:55,930

295

00:05:55,930  -->  00:05:58,440
database joins. So, there we go those are

296

00:05:58,440  -->  00:05:58,450

297

00:05:58,450  -->  00:06:00,089
the three main features that will be

298

00:06:00,089  -->  00:06:00,099

299

00:06:00,099  -->  00:06:01,710
focusing on, those are the three most

300

00:06:01,710  -->  00:06:01,720

301

00:06:01,720  -->  00:06:04,469
powerful features that you have to know

302

00:06:04,469  -->  00:06:04,479

303

00:06:04,479  -->  00:06:06,150
about to leverage the full power of

304

00:06:06,150  -->  00:06:06,160

305

00:06:06,160  -->  00:06:08,130
Tableau 10 and we will cover them off

306

00:06:08,130  -->  00:06:08,140

307

00:06:08,140  -->  00:06:11,490
very thoroughly inside this section of

308

00:06:11,490  -->  00:06:11,500

309

00:06:11,500  -->  00:06:13,110
the course and you'll be entirely

310

00:06:13,110  -->  00:06:13,120

311

00:06:13,120  -->  00:06:14,820
comfortable by the end of it and

312

00:06:14,820  -->  00:06:14,830

313

00:06:14,830  -->  00:06:18,600
moreover we will solve a real business

314

00:06:18,600  -->  00:06:18,610

315

00:06:18,610  -->  00:06:21,630
challenge for a start-up inside this

316

00:06:21,630  -->  00:06:21,640

317

00:06:21,640  -->  00:06:22,950
section of the course using these

318

00:06:22,950  -->  00:06:22,960

319

00:06:22,960  -->  00:06:24,719
techniques and some other ones of

320

00:06:24,719  -->  00:06:24,729

321

00:06:24,729  -->  00:06:27,330
Tableau 10. Super excited about this. It's

322

00:06:27,330  -->  00:06:27,340

323

00:06:27,340  -->  00:06:29,610
going to be fun, can't wait to see you on

324

00:06:29,610  -->  00:06:29,620

325

00:06:29,620  -->  00:06:31,620
the first tutorial and until next time,

326

00:06:31,620  -->  00:06:31,630

327

00:06:31,630  -->  00:06:37,800
happy analyzing.
