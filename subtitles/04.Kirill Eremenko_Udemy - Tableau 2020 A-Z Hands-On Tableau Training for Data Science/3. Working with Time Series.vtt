00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.430
Hello and welcome back to the course and Tablo.

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.050
In today's tutorial, we will learn how to work with Time series data.

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.470
But first things first, let's go ahead and save a workbook.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.780
We've already connected the datasource and saving a workbook will prevent from loss of any progress

5
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.480
that we make along the way in this section.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.510
So let's click save as and give our name.

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.580
In this case, it will be section three for me.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.310
Click save and now it's saved.

9
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.900
And all we have to do when we make changes is just press control on the keyboard and that will save

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.500
our progress.

11
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.510
All right.

12
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.410
So now we're trying to visualize typesetters.

13
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.410
Let's have a look at our data first and understand what we're working with.

14
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.980
So if we're right, click on the datasource, click Udara.

15
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.620
Um, you'll see that, as we discussed, we've got age, gender.

16
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.530
So two categories then we've got period and we've got an unemployment value for each row.

17
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.390
And that's exactly what we want to visualize.

18
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.290
We want to see how unemployment is changing as period changes.

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.300
So we scroll down, we can see that we have many months, we've got a month for every single year or

20
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.800
we've got twelve months for every single year.

21
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.600
And we can see how unemployment is changing.

22
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.830
So we want to visualize that.

23
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.010
So let's go ahead and do that.

24
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.980
What are we going to do is which is going to double click on unemployed and then we're going to double

25
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.150
click on period?

26
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:33.320
And you see how Tableau is very smart there, it's automatically put unemployed into rows and it's summed

27
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.770
it up and it's put year or is put period into columns and it's taken the year of the period.

28
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.840
So what's going on here is there's some aggregation and we'll talk about aggregation more in the next

29
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.240
Atauro.

30
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.410
But it kind of makes sense already.

31
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:57.090
What is happening is Tableau is taking all of the data that it can see, say, for 2007 and and it's

32
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.890
setting it up.

33
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:06.020
All of the values in all of the rows that have twenty seven in them, irrespective of month of gender,

34
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.130
of age, is just summing up and coming up of one single value for 2007, then the same thing for 2008,

35
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.000
2009 and so on.

36
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.910
So that all make sense.

37
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.600
But now we've kind of got a bit of a question here.

38
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.480
We know that our data has much is much more granular than that.

39
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.640
We know that we have Yero months in every year and we have information for that.

40
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.280
Where how do we get to that level of granularity?

41
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.560
Well, let's go ahead and explore that.

42
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.790
If we go to the, um, the dropdown here, which you can see for this dimension and we click it, you'll

43
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.480
see that there's two sections which are responsible for time.

44
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.320
There's this section which has your quarter, month, day, and then there's this section which also

45
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.870
has your month, week, number and day.

46
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.930
What's the difference between the two?

47
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.140
Well, two, to find that out, let's click on month in the first section.

48
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.250
And right away you can see how we no longer have years at the bottom.

49
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.930
Instead of that, we have.

50
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.370
Instead of that, we have months and what happened there?

51
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:21.800
Well, the other thing that we can also see is that we have only one January and only one February and

52
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.970
only one June.

53
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.830
We know that in our data we have many Jeunes and many Februaries.

54
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.810
We have one.

55
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.610
In fact, we have one for every single year.

56
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.470
But in this case, we were only presented with one of each month.

57
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.530
So we only have 12 points on this chart.

58
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.950
And what is going on?

59
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:48.770
Well, what is happening is Tablo is taking all of the data from our data source, which has, let's

60
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:56.750
say, for instance, May four in any role that has May in it, it will take it and aggregate it to this

61
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.290
value.

62
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.910
So it will add them up irrespective of age, gender and even year.

63
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.090
And for that, for us, that doesn't make any sense.

64
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.750
What's the point of adding up unemployment for 2005, 2006, 2007 and so on come out one number.

65
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.770
That number has no meaning to us as a why is that happening?

66
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.960
Well, the reason is, is because in this case, Tablo is recognizing, recognizing month as a dimension.

67
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.400
And how can we tell that?

68
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.500
Well, Tablo is giving us a hint up here.

69
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.540
You can see that month of period is being highlighted in blue.

70
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.230
So Tablo always highlights dimension's and blue and measures and green.

71
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.360
And so that tells us that Tableau is recognizing this new variable because in essence, it is a new

72
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.810
variable.

73
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.700
Our variable in the data source is called period.

74
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.740
We don't have a we don't have a variable that is called month, but tablas creating a calculation here

75
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.610
and you can double click on it and see what the formula is.

76
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.010
So Tablo is creating a calculation which is month of period.

77
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.870
And in essence, that's the new variable.

78
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.830
And Tablo is recognizing this new variable as a dimension.

79
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.880
And that means it will treat it just as it would treat age stories, just as it would treat gender or

80
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.920
in our case, age, because we have age groups.

81
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.840
But let's let's think of it as in gender.

82
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.980
So tabbouleh is treating this new variable as a categorical variable.

83
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.620
It only has 12 categories and it's putting the data into those categories.

84
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.560
Well, obviously, in this case, we don't want that.

85
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.920
We don't want different categories of months.

86
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.230
We actually want a timeline over here at the bottom.

87
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.150
So how do we get that?

88
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.640
Well, instead of this month, let's go ahead and select the second month over here in this dropdown.

89
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.930
And right away, you can see that our chart changed and also you can see that now.

90
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.610
Month of period is green, so this variable this time is being recognized as a measure.

91
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.460
So if it were a calculated variable, it would be sitting over here.

92
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:51.000
And what then happens now is that we have a timeline at the bottom and we have all of the months with

93
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.370
all of the data that we are looking for.

94
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.870
And this is exactly what we wanted.

95
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:02.340
So just to see the difference, let's click again and we'll select a year instead of month.

96
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.750
So here you can see a similar chart to what we had before.

97
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.920
So I'll just bring that one up here.

98
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.390
You can see very similar line, but here you've got categories of years.

99
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.730
But if we click this year at the bottom here, then here you've got these sort of categories of years.

100
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.110
You've got a timeline.

101
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.840
And only difference with the month timeline is that there's less dots on this timeline.

102
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.910
And in fact, you can see the dots if you in line, if you click on color and you select this option,

103
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.300
you'll actually see the dots here.

104
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.770
So you have less dots on this timeline.

105
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:44.040
And all we're doing by changing this level here is we're changing the granularity of this specific timeline.

106
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.370
So we just saying we want more dots on the timeline.

107
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.820
We're not changing the category that we're grouping our observations into.

108
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.490
We're changing the granularity of our timeline or the number of ticks on the timeline.

109
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.000
And if we change month, there we go.

110
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:04.280
So we're also once again, we're changing the granular granularity of our timeline.

111
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.470
So just changes back to normal.

112
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.880
And that's exactly what we want.

113
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.830
So you have to be careful of that.

114
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:15.570
And that's an important part of working part time series data that you need to understand what you want

115
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:22.800
from your time data, whether you want it to be a dimension or a category or whether you want it to

116
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.660
be a measure.

117
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.870
In this case, we wanted obviously to be a measure so we can plot a timeline like this.

118
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.860
And so that's pretty much it for today.

119
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.690
But before we go, what I wanted to do is I wanted to show you how you can validate this chart.

120
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:41.640
So this is unemployment data for the US and obviously it's publicly available.

121
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:47.550
So you can just go to Google and look for unemployment.

122
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.320
And the twenty seven weeks is long term unemployment.

123
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.670
We're looking at long term unemployment.

124
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.720
Twenty seven weeks and then just type in.

125
00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.520
Fred, Fred Fred stands for Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

126
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:10.440
So if you go here, you'll see a very similar chart and well, here I can change it to 2005.

127
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.740
So you can see that looks a lot like our chart.

128
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:21.390
The only question we've got, we can just look at the tip here and see six thousand eight hundred.

129
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.780
And in our chart, it's seven thousand one hundred or seven million one hundred thousand.

130
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:32.970
So it's of course, you'll have a bit of a discrepancy if you have data from different data sources.

131
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.000
In this case, it's about three hundred thousand.

132
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:43.860
But the way like I look at it, if it's statistical data, so it's three hundred thousand and you divided

133
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.750
over six thousand eight hundred.

134
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.910
So that's less than five percent difference.

135
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:54.000
And for what we're doing for our purposes, that'll be sufficient level of precision.

136
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.080
And you can see that the charts are quite similar.

137
00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:01.110
So we are working with actual unemployment data in the US for this period of time.

138
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.050
OK, so that's us for today.

139
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:10.550
And next time we will be talking about aggregation, granularity and level of detail.

140
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.230
So I'll look forward to seeing you in the next.

141
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.020
Litoria will be a very important one and until then, happy analyzing.
