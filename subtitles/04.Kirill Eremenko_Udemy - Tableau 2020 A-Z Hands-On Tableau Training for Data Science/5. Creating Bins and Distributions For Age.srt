00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,630
Hello and welcome back to the course on tableau.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:15,040
And today we will continue with the analysis of the demographics segmentation of our member base or

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,570
customer base for this bank.

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,310
So here we've got the gender chart that we created previously.

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,090
It's a pie chart.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:29,800
And by the way with pie charts people don't really like them in an in analytics in possessions and that

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,830
is the case when you have like more than three or four elements to a part pie chart gets very clever.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,790
In this case we only have two male and female.

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,730
So I think it's okay to create a pie chart but it's up to you.

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,480
You're more than welcome to substitute with this.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,390
This will for different viz. if you think that pie chart a pie chart is not the best way to go here.

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,850
So we're going to change the name here to gender and we're going to create a new tab.

13
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,800
And this time we're looking at age.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,880
So this is going to be interesting because we have age here and we want we want to see how many people

15
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:10,330
the age of how our member base is distributed across this age across the different ages.

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:16,510
So if we take age and graph drag it into columns and you see take some of age right away.

17
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:23,010
But if we change this from a measure to a dimension so it's not an attribute dimension.

18
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,370
So basically disaggregated and take a number of records and drag it into rows.

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,160
You'll see this curved line here.

20
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:37,180
So it's basically telling us how many people they are in for each individual age.

21
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:43,700
So for 35 years old there's 163 people for 36 years old hundred 183 people and so on.

22
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:48,940
But this is not exactly what we want and even if we change to a basket not really what we're looking

23
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:58,270
for we don't want every single age demonstrated here imagine if our ages weren't given in integers so

24
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:05,050
in whole numbers what if they were given in floats or doubles so basically if we had in our database

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,180
in our data sets or if I'll just go here told us that if in our data set we didn't have twenty one but

26
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:16,450
twenty one point five and thirty four point three and thirty point four and so on this it wouldn't work

27
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,440
if this doesn't look as good but it wouldn't work even as good as that.

28
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:28,000
So we need to do something about it and this is where we talk about creating bins and basically breaking

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,130
up our ages into different groups so five ways let's say for instance five year bands from 15 to 20

30
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:42,040
from 20 to 25 and so on and seen how our membership is distributed across those bands.

31
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:50,070
So let's go ahead and do that very it's very simple to create bins or groups for a variable in tableau.

32
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,700
So as long as it's a measure it basically it's a numerical variable.

33
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,410
All you have to do is you have to right click on the variable that you want to create bins for and then

34
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,660
you go to create and you create bins.

35
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,820
Simple as that.

36
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:10,360
And size of bins in our case is going to be five because we want five year bands and we'll leave it

37
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,660
as age bin click OK.

38
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:20,350
And as you can imagine age bin goes into dimensions because now it's no longer a numerical variable

39
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,800
it is a categorical variable we've broken up our data into categories and now we take age bin and drag

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:34,270
it into columns and we take total number of records or no records and drag it into rows we get a beautiful

41
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,390
distribution which tells us how a member base is distributed across five year bands.

42
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,360
So in 15 to 20.

43
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,650
So 15 is inclusive 20 is not inclusive in 15 to 20.

44
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,600
There is 54 EC of 54 records meaning 54 customers 20 to 25.

45
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,990
There is 108 to customers than 400 two in a new one and so on.

46
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:05,560
If you want you can add the if you press and hold control and you drag some number Records label you'll

47
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,080
get the number at the top.

48
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,500
But we don't want the number at the top right now.

49
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:18,280
What we want is we want to change this to a table calculation and it is useful sometimes in a distribution

50
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,570
to know the total.

51
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:27,820
So how many in total people there were in a certain age band but what we want right now is we want a

52
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,250
percentage and why we want a percentage why do we not curious about the total is because this chart

53
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,590
is going to work together we've found map in a dashboard and our map already has the totals so our map

54
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,410
already has the absolute number and that's why we changed gender to a percentage and that's why we're

55
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,720
going to change this to a percentage as well because we don't really need to know the total twice we

56
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,080
don't need to know it in the map and in the breakdown it's more useful here to know the percentage.

57
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,850
So we're going to click this dropdown as we did previously.

58
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:05,380
Quick table calculations and here will do percentage of total and void.

59
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,370
Right away.

60
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,840
It has changed from a absolute figure to the percentage of total.

61
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,440
So what we want now is we want to hide this label at the top edge.

62
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,340
We don't need this.

63
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:31,290
We want to change the name of the chart to age distribution or distribution by age probably better by

64
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:38,980
age and now in our worksheet we want to format it so if we write.

65
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,670
Oh actually first we're going to change this.

66
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:50,560
Edit access and here percentage of total number records percentage of customers.

67
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,240
And now we want to right click on anywhere in the chart click format and we will change this to keep

68
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:05,730
it consistent 12 and black or dark bold and to finish off what we're going to do is we will take some

69
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,090
number of records which is a percentage and drag it into color.

70
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,750
So now we can see the dark blue.

71
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,260
And there you go we've got a beautiful distribution here ready to go into our dashboard which will create

72
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,100
very very soon.

73
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,920
That's all for today.

74
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,960
I look forward to seeing you next time when we will continue with our analysis of the segmentation.

75
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,370
And until next time happy analyzing.
