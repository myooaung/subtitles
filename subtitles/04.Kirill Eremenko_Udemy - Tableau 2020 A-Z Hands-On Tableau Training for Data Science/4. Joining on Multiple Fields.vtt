00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.680
Hello and welcome back. Today we'll be

2

00:00:06.680  -->  00:00:06.690

3

00:00:06.690  -->  00:00:08.600
talking about joining on multiple fields.

4

00:00:08.600  -->  00:00:08.610

5

00:00:08.610  -->  00:00:10.730
To start off with this tutorial, I will

6

00:00:10.730  -->  00:00:10.740

7

00:00:10.740  -->  00:00:13.190
show you an example when it is necessary

8

00:00:13.190  -->  00:00:13.200

9

00:00:13.200  -->  00:00:16.070
to join on multiple fields and I will

10

00:00:16.070  -->  00:00:16.080

11

00:00:16.080  -->  00:00:17.810
show you what happens when you

12

00:00:17.810  -->  00:00:17.820

13

00:00:17.820  -->  00:00:19.400
accidentally forget about joining on

14

00:00:19.400  -->  00:00:19.410

15

00:00:19.410  -->  00:00:21.439
multiple fields and finally we will look

16

00:00:21.439  -->  00:00:21.449

17

00:00:21.449  -->  00:00:23.509
at how we can rectify the situation and

18

00:00:23.509  -->  00:00:23.519

19

00:00:23.519  -->  00:00:26.570
actually in fact join on several fields

20

00:00:26.570  -->  00:00:26.580

21

00:00:26.580  -->  00:00:30.019
to get the right result. So let's get

22

00:00:30.019  -->  00:00:30.029

23

00:00:30.029  -->  00:00:32.359
straight into it. Here we've got two

24

00:00:32.359  -->  00:00:32.369

25

00:00:32.369  -->  00:00:35.810
tables, table A and table B. Table A lists

26

00:00:35.810  -->  00:00:35.820

27

00:00:35.820  -->  00:00:37.850
the orders that were conducted in our

28

00:00:37.850  -->  00:00:37.860

29

00:00:37.860  -->  00:00:40.340
two stores which are north and south as

30

00:00:40.340  -->  00:00:40.350

31

00:00:40.350  -->  00:00:41.900
you can see, we had two orders in the

32

00:00:41.900  -->  00:00:41.910

33

00:00:41.910  -->  00:00:44.330
north store, order number one and order

34

00:00:44.330  -->  00:00:44.340

35

00:00:44.340  -->  00:00:47.420
number two and in the South store we had

36

00:00:47.420  -->  00:00:47.430

37

00:00:47.430  -->  00:00:50.690
only order number one and also list the

38

00:00:50.690  -->  00:00:50.700

39

00:00:50.700  -->  00:00:53.569
customers Mike, Jack and Susan. Table B a

40

00:00:53.569  -->  00:00:53.579

41

00:00:53.579  -->  00:00:56.540
lists the itemized description of those

42

00:00:56.540  -->  00:00:56.550

43

00:00:56.550  -->  00:00:58.670
orders. So we've also got the store

44

00:00:58.670  -->  00:00:58.680

45

00:00:58.680  -->  00:01:02.479
location, we've got the order number and

46

00:01:02.479  -->  00:01:02.489

47

00:01:02.489  -->  00:01:04.100
we've got item within their order and

48

00:01:04.100  -->  00:01:04.110

49

00:01:04.110  -->  00:01:06.950
the sale made on that item. So here you

50

00:01:06.950  -->  00:01:06.960

51

00:01:06.960  -->  00:01:09.350
can see right away that order number one

52

00:01:09.350  -->  00:01:09.360

53

00:01:09.360  -->  00:01:11.600
in the northern store had two items

54

00:01:11.600  -->  00:01:11.610

55

00:01:11.610  -->  00:01:14.330
sold, a laptop and a mouse or number two

56

00:01:14.330  -->  00:01:14.340

57

00:01:14.340  -->  00:01:16.580
had one item which was the monitor and

58

00:01:16.580  -->  00:01:16.590

59

00:01:16.590  -->  00:01:18.469
order number one in the southern store

60

00:01:18.469  -->  00:01:18.479

61

00:01:18.479  -->  00:01:22.490
had only one item which was a camera. So

62

00:01:22.490  -->  00:01:22.500

63

00:01:22.500  -->  00:01:25.850
now we want to connect the two tables and

64

00:01:25.850  -->  00:01:25.860

65

00:01:25.860  -->  00:01:28.700
basically what we're after is we want to

66

00:01:28.700  -->  00:01:28.710

67

00:01:28.710  -->  00:01:32.060
see how the sales that were made for

68

00:01:32.060  -->  00:01:32.070

69

00:01:32.070  -->  00:01:33.740
each of the customers the total sales

70

00:01:33.740  -->  00:01:33.750

71

00:01:33.750  -->  00:01:35.539
for each of the customers. So visually

72

00:01:35.539  -->  00:01:35.549

73

00:01:35.549  -->  00:01:37.069
you can see right away how that works,

74

00:01:37.069  -->  00:01:37.079

75

00:01:37.079  -->  00:01:38.600
but let's see how we can do it through

76

00:01:38.600  -->  00:01:38.610

77

00:01:38.610  -->  00:01:41.240
join. So if we were to go ahead and do a

78

00:01:41.240  -->  00:01:41.250

79

00:01:41.250  -->  00:01:42.920
left join so basically we want to

80

00:01:42.920  -->  00:01:42.930

81

00:01:42.930  -->  00:01:44.660
attach the table on the right, the table

82

00:01:44.660  -->  00:01:44.670

83

00:01:44.670  -->  00:01:49.460
the left and if we were to just do a

84

00:01:49.460  -->  00:01:49.470

85

00:01:49.470  -->  00:01:51.620
normal left join using one field we

86

00:01:51.620  -->  00:01:51.630

87

00:01:51.630  -->  00:01:54.050
would try to join on order number. So

88

00:01:54.050  -->  00:01:54.060

89

00:01:54.060  -->  00:01:56.660
here if we want to match order number in

90

00:01:56.660  -->  00:01:56.670

91

00:01:56.670  -->  00:01:58.580
the left table to the right table, it

92

00:01:58.580  -->  00:01:58.590

93

00:01:58.590  -->  00:01:59.539
will look something like this.

94

00:01:59.539  -->  00:01:59.549

95

00:01:59.549  -->  00:02:01.310
Order number one will be matched to

96

00:02:01.310  -->  00:02:01.320

97

00:02:01.320  -->  00:02:03.800
order number one in the first row of the

98

00:02:03.800  -->  00:02:03.810

99

00:02:03.810  -->  00:02:05.539
right table in the second row and in the

100

00:02:05.539  -->  00:02:05.549

101

00:02:05.549  -->  00:02:07.580
fourth row and as we can see that's

102

00:02:07.580  -->  00:02:07.590

103

00:02:07.590  -->  00:02:11.029
already incorrect because we're matching

104

00:02:11.029  -->  00:02:11.039

105

00:02:11.039  -->  00:02:12.490
order number one from the northern

106

00:02:12.490  -->  00:02:12.500

107

00:02:12.500  -->  00:02:14.710
store to order number one from the

108

00:02:14.710  -->  00:02:14.720

109

00:02:14.720  -->  00:02:18.070
southern store, you via this third match.

110

00:02:18.070  -->  00:02:18.080

111

00:02:18.080  -->  00:02:20.410
But let's let's see what happens

112

00:02:20.410  -->  00:02:20.420

113

00:02:20.420  -->  00:02:23.680
further down, so now if now order number

114

00:02:23.680  -->  00:02:23.690

115

00:02:23.690  -->  00:02:26.350
2 from the northern store will be matched

116

00:02:26.350  -->  00:02:26.360

117

00:02:26.360  -->  00:02:27.820
or number two that's because there's

118

00:02:27.820  -->  00:02:27.830

119

00:02:27.830  -->  00:02:30.880
only one or number two in both of these

120

00:02:30.880  -->  00:02:30.890

121

00:02:30.890  -->  00:02:33.250
tables and then order number one from

122

00:02:33.250  -->  00:02:33.260

123

00:02:33.260  -->  00:02:34.720
the southern store will actually be

124

00:02:34.720  -->  00:02:34.730

125

00:02:34.730  -->  00:02:37.540
matched to three rows in the second

126

00:02:37.540  -->  00:02:37.550

127

00:02:37.550  -->  00:02:40.000
table which are order number one,

128

00:02:40.000  -->  00:02:40.010

129

00:02:40.010  -->  00:02:42.670
or from the northern store then

130

00:02:42.670  -->  00:02:42.680

131

00:02:42.680  -->  00:02:44.560
the second item from order number one in

132

00:02:44.560  -->  00:02:44.570

133

00:02:44.570  -->  00:02:46.600
northern store and funny,

134

00:02:46.600  -->  00:02:46.610

135

00:02:46.610  -->  00:02:49.479
the only item from order number one in

136

00:02:49.479  -->  00:02:49.489

137

00:02:49.489  -->  00:02:52.090
the southern store. So in total the

138

00:02:52.090  -->  00:02:52.100

139

00:02:52.100  -->  00:02:54.699
results in table will look like this. We

140

00:02:54.699  -->  00:02:54.709

141

00:02:54.709  -->  00:02:58.960
will have three rows for North order

142

00:02:58.960  -->  00:02:58.970

143

00:02:58.970  -->  00:03:01.630
number 1, one row for North order number

144

00:03:01.630  -->  00:03:01.640

145

00:03:01.640  -->  00:03:04.150
two and three rows for South order

146

00:03:04.150  -->  00:03:04.160

147

00:03:04.160  -->  00:03:07.150
number one and as you can see this is a

148

00:03:07.150  -->  00:03:07.160

149

00:03:07.160  -->  00:03:08.920
mistake. There's an error because this

150

00:03:08.920  -->  00:03:08.930

151

00:03:08.930  -->  00:03:11.979
highly inflate our sales. It looks like

152

00:03:11.979  -->  00:03:11.989

153

00:03:11.989  -->  00:03:13.720
we've sold two laptops. It looks like

154

00:03:13.720  -->  00:03:13.730

155

00:03:13.730  -->  00:03:16.900
we've sold two mice and two cameras whereas

156

00:03:16.900  -->  00:03:16.910

157

00:03:16.910  -->  00:03:20.560
in fact that's not true. So joining on a

158

00:03:20.560  -->  00:03:20.570

159

00:03:20.570  -->  00:03:24.070
single field here can lead to incorrect

160

00:03:24.070  -->  00:03:24.080

161

00:03:24.080  -->  00:03:25.840
results. So let's see how we can fix that.

162

00:03:25.840  -->  00:03:25.850

163

00:03:25.850  -->  00:03:28.930
What we need to do and this you can see

164

00:03:28.930  -->  00:03:28.940

165

00:03:28.940  -->  00:03:32.020
naturally from these tables is we have to

166

00:03:32.020  -->  00:03:32.030

167

00:03:32.030  -->  00:03:34.180
include information about the store in

168

00:03:34.180  -->  00:03:34.190

169

00:03:34.190  -->  00:03:38.140
our join. So we know that the order

170

00:03:38.140  -->  00:03:38.150

171

00:03:38.150  -->  00:03:41.020
numbers are unique for each store and so

172

00:03:41.020  -->  00:03:41.030

173

00:03:41.030  -->  00:03:43.030
therefore if we include the store now

174

00:03:43.030  -->  00:03:43.040

175

00:03:43.040  -->  00:03:45.250
join then we will avoid this whole

176

00:03:45.250  -->  00:03:45.260

177

00:03:45.260  -->  00:03:47.140
problem. So let's see how that works at

178

00:03:47.140  -->  00:03:47.150

179

00:03:47.150  -->  00:03:49.330
the, on the top left here  encircled in

180

00:03:49.330  -->  00:03:49.340

181

00:03:49.340  -->  00:03:50.680
red you can see that we're joining on

182

00:03:50.680  -->  00:03:50.690

183

00:03:50.690  -->  00:03:53.199
order number from table A equals order

184

00:03:53.199  -->  00:03:53.209

185

00:03:53.209  -->  00:03:56.680
number from table B and store from table

186

00:03:56.680  -->  00:03:56.690

187

00:03:56.690  -->  00:03:59.289
A equals storefront table B. Let's see how

188

00:03:59.289  -->  00:03:59.299

189

00:03:59.299  -->  00:04:04.479
this works in fact. Here we've got the

190

00:04:04.479  -->  00:04:04.489

191

00:04:04.489  -->  00:04:07.660
North order number one being matched to

192

00:04:07.660  -->  00:04:07.670

193

00:04:07.670  -->  00:04:10.960
two rows in the second table so North

194

00:04:10.960  -->  00:04:10.970

195

00:04:10.970  -->  00:04:12.699
order number one which is the laptop and

196

00:04:12.699  -->  00:04:12.709

197

00:04:12.709  -->  00:04:14.530
North order number one which is the mouse

198

00:04:14.530  -->  00:04:14.540

199

00:04:14.540  -->  00:04:17.979
and that's correct. Next, order

200

00:04:17.979  -->  00:04:17.989

201

00:04:17.989  -->  00:04:19.960
number two from the northern store is

202

00:04:19.960  -->  00:04:19.970

203

00:04:19.970  -->  00:04:22.480
matched to only one row in the second

204

00:04:22.480  -->  00:04:22.490

205

00:04:22.490  -->  00:04:25.570
table which is the monitor for the

206

00:04:25.570  -->  00:04:25.580

207

00:04:25.580  -->  00:04:27.460
northern order number two which is also

208

00:04:27.460  -->  00:04:27.470

209

00:04:27.470  -->  00:04:30.820
correct and finally the southern number

210

00:04:30.820  -->  00:04:30.830

211

00:04:30.830  -->  00:04:33.309
one order is matched to only one row in

212

00:04:33.309  -->  00:04:33.319

213

00:04:33.319  -->  00:04:34.570
the second table because there's only

214

00:04:34.570  -->  00:04:34.580

215

00:04:34.580  -->  00:04:36.939
one row that contains both the word south

216

00:04:36.939  -->  00:04:36.949

217

00:04:36.949  -->  00:04:39.430
and the number one for the order

218

00:04:39.430  -->  00:04:39.440

219

00:04:39.440  -->  00:04:41.980
and that is the camera that Susan

220

00:04:41.980  -->  00:04:41.990

221

00:04:41.990  -->  00:04:42.670
want.

222

00:04:42.670  -->  00:04:42.680

223

00:04:42.680  -->  00:04:45.850
So now if we perform that join then the

224

00:04:45.850  -->  00:04:45.860

225

00:04:45.860  -->  00:04:48.219
final resulting table will look like

226

00:04:48.219  -->  00:04:48.229

227

00:04:48.229  -->  00:04:52.629
this and as you can see here the one row

228

00:04:52.629  -->  00:04:52.639

229

00:04:52.639  -->  00:04:54.610
in the table on the left was duplicated

230

00:04:54.610  -->  00:04:54.620

231

00:04:54.620  -->  00:04:57.760
to match the quantity of items which was

232

00:04:57.760  -->  00:04:57.770

233

00:04:57.770  -->  00:05:01.870
two items bought by Mike and so in total

234

00:05:01.870  -->  00:05:01.880

235

00:05:01.880  -->  00:05:03.939
you can see that this time we've got the

236

00:05:03.939  -->  00:05:03.949

237

00:05:03.949  -->  00:05:07.420
correct result. We can also assess how

238

00:05:07.420  -->  00:05:07.430

239

00:05:07.430  -->  00:05:09.760
much each customer has bought and there

240

00:05:09.760  -->  00:05:09.770

241

00:05:09.770  -->  00:05:12.760
are no mistakes because of an incorrect join

242

00:05:12.760  -->  00:05:12.770

243

00:05:12.770  -->  00:05:16.059
and so that was a good example of how to

244

00:05:16.059  -->  00:05:16.069

245

00:05:16.069  -->  00:05:18.969
use join and multiple fields and more

246

00:05:18.969  -->  00:05:18.979

247

00:05:18.979  -->  00:05:20.770
importantly why you need to do that in

248

00:05:20.770  -->  00:05:20.780

249

00:05:20.780  -->  00:05:23.439
certain cases to avoid errors. I hope you

250

00:05:23.439  -->  00:05:23.449

251

00:05:23.449  -->  00:05:24.879
enjoy today's tutorial and I look

252

00:05:24.879  -->  00:05:24.889

253

00:05:24.889  -->  00:05:30.940
forward to seeing you next time.
