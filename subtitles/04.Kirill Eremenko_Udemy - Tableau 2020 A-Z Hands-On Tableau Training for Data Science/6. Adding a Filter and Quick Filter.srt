00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,900
Hello and welcome back to the course on tableau.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,290
And today we're looking at filters important lecture today.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,470
But before we get to it I wanted to ask you for a favor.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,690
So we're no we're not finished of the course yet but I would really appreciate if you could leave a

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,030
review for this course.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,800
We're we've done a few modules so far.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,640
And if you like the materials please go ahead and click the button at the top.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,200
The course which looks like this and just choose the number of stars that you think the course deserves

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,100
and leave a review if you like if you if you don't want to write anything just choose a number of stars

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,890
and click submit.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,310
The reason I'm asking now is because a lot of students don't finish the course to the end for whatever

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,870
reason.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,400
And I definitely hope it hurts.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,060
You're not going to be that student.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,180
I hope you get to the end.

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,930
But at the same time I would really appreciate a review because it helps me understand whether you like

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,810
the course or not.

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,290
And also it helps other students who are considering taking this course understand whether it's worth

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:58,680
their while.

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,770
So I would be very happy if you could do that for me today.

21
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,270
And now let's get back to the show.

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,870
So we're talking about filters today.

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,680
We've got this area chart that we created last time which if you ask me looks pretty amazing already.

24
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,420
We're just going to add a bit of formatting to it.

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,870
At the end of this lecture.

26
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,220
But how can we add a filter.

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,150
So what information is missing currently on this chart.

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,950
The information that's missing is gender.

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,080
We've got the age groups and we've got unemployment rates split by months but we can't see gender here.

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,840
So one way to add gender is by putting gender into a filter.

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,590
And that's exactly it.

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,090
We're going to do.

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,100
So to do that you have to take gender or the variable that you want to add as a filter and put it into

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,750
the filter shelf and it's as simple as that.

35
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,320
There we go.

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:59,510
So now you've got this filter made you pop up and you can specify the kind of settings or set up your

37
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,230
filter.

38
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,740
So here we're going to select few.

39
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,930
We we're allowing this filter to work by selecting from a list and there's only two values men and women

40
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,270
custom value lists.

41
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,920
I don't normally use that you could add like your own types of values use all.

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,520
So normally you stick with this select from list and this is for like dimensions.

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,240
We'll see.

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,140
We'll look at a filter for measures in a in a second.

45
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:31,730
So wildcard usually I don't use any of these is a more advanced kind of things that you use in very

46
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,600
specific cases.

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,650
So we won't stop on them right now because if you really need them you can understand them.

48
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,480
But to be honest with you I very rarely I don't think I've ever used the wildcards in my filters.

49
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,390
That's when you have like huge lists that you're filtering from.

50
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,310
So we'll just stick with general and for now we'll just select all and the other thing that you need

51
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,170
to know here is you can select exclude and what that will do is it will allow you to filter what you

52
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,660
don't want to see.

53
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:04,070
So if you had like 10 values then you could click exclude and that will allow you to cancel out a few

54
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,450
values.

55
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,150
But right now we're just going to select what we do want to see.

56
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,070
So we'll click all will click OK and now you can see the chart and change because we select both genders.

57
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,200
But now we have gender as a filter.

58
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,330
And so if I want to change the filter I click filter and say I want to see the chart only for men.

59
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,840
Then I click OK.

60
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:27,470
Then you can see the chart did change because now it's only unemployment for men and the access is much

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,400
the top value or the maximum value next is much more because there is less unemployed people because

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,240
men only look at a subset now for it to change it for women you uncheck that and check that you click

63
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,350
apply to the charts changing in the back there.

64
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,920
So that's all great but that is quite tedious don't you find that you have to click the filter every

65
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,070
time and then change it and then close it again.

66
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:58,670
So that's why in tableau there is a solution as a quick filter and we're going to learn that right now

67
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,300
as well.

68
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:07,310
So in order to bring up a quick filter you need to right click on the filter and select show quick filter

69
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,890
and just click that and you will see this quick filter pop up over here so it's quite far away.

70
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,290
How about I just put it there.

71
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,000
So I'll put it there for now but usually you keep him on the left.

72
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:26,090
I'll put it there just for our convenience so I can zoom in a bit and so here if I uncheck men you can

73
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,910
see the char is changing right away and check women charts changing so I can take all of them out the

74
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:38,870
chart disappears very handy thing to have this quick filter because it helps you quickly analyze your

75
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:48,300
data you can change it to type of quick filter you want to see and you can look at you can see these

76
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,250
different types so can be a dropdown single slide or so what we're going to do is we're going to actually

77
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,300
put this one back here and now I'll bring up a quick filter so actually what I'll do is I'll make my

78
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,370
tableau workbook smaller so we can zoom in like that there we go.

79
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:12,990
So now what we're going to do is we're going to add a filter for H because there's a lot more values

80
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,800
we have an edge and that'll be a bit handy.

81
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,860
So let's just do that.

82
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:23,570
We'll put age into filter we'll select all four now apply and we'll also create a quick filter for age.

83
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,150
There we go so that's our quick filter for age.

84
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,080
And now you can see how we can customize this filter.

85
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:36,380
So first of all we can uncheck certain values and as you can see they all disappear from the chart.

86
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:43,670
So this is not the best thing to have for this chart because we do want all groups of ages in unemployment

87
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,840
in this chart but we're just looking at it like this for now because it's a good example.

88
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,850
So you see we can uncheck the values we don't want to see and the chart changes right away dynamically

89
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,540
right in front of us.

90
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,230
So then we can just select separate ones.

91
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,320
But once again there's that option to highlight.

92
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,460
So you wouldn't need to do that ever if you have this highlighting option and then next.

93
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,710
What we're going to do is we're going to look at the types of filters you can have.

94
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:15,520
So say you can have a single valueless if you only want to see one at a time then you can just do these

95
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,180
radio boxes and also have this all option.

96
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,120
Also it filters you have the option to remove this all value.

97
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:30,430
So I can uncheck and then there's no old value so you have to select an option from the list.

98
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,400
But in our case we actually need the old value.

99
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,990
So how about we.

100
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,140
We can also have like a single value dropdown.

101
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,930
So it's like a radio box but it's a dropdown it's a bit more convenient.

102
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:47,920
What else you can do like multiple values drop down so you can check them.

103
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:56,280
So it just kind of makes compact you can do a wildcard match where you type in 20 to 24.

104
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,770
Let's see that and I'll pick up the value that you're looking for.

105
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,760
So there's a lot of different options for filters and a more for convenience.

106
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:11,050
So that's that's pretty much that's I'm just gonna get rid of this one because we don't need age as

107
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,810
a filter.

108
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:20,270
The other one I want to show you is we'll probably have a look more at measures as filters in the next

109
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,400
section because it'll be more relevant there.

110
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,040
So we'll definitely have we'll definitely look at that and a bit more detail but just so that you know

111
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,800
you can add filters and they're very easy to use.

112
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,260
So in this case if somebody wants to analyze only men or women he can select from here so actually I

113
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,890
was going to change this to single value from list and that makes more sense so you either looking at

114
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,600
everybody looking at just men or just women.

115
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,770
And the chart adjusts dynamically and you can just look at exactly what you want to see.

116
00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:01,430
So as promised we're just gonna quickly fix up the formatting here so we'll just go format and make

117
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:08,660
it like a twelve and a B an employed and then we'll change format here as well.

118
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:14,970
Make it a 12:00 and a B and make this a bit bigger.

119
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,770
So there you go.

120
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,780
There's a chart it's ready for export.

121
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:24,120
If you really want you can add some text over here just to replace this label that's missing.

122
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,140
But otherwise I think it looks quite good.

123
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,470
And yeah.

124
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,800
So that's all for the section.

125
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,620
Hope you enjoyed creating this chart.

126
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,360
We learned quite a lot of new things and make sure to do the quiz because that will help you solidify

127
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,010
your knowledge and to finish off.

128
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,530
I just wanted to remind you I would really appreciate if you could leave a review.

129
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,550
That would mean so much to me.

130
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,050
Thanks a lot for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next section.

131
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,260
Until next time happy analyzing.
