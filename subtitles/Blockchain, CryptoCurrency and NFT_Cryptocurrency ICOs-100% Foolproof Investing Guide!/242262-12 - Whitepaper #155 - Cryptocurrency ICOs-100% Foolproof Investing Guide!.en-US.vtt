00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
Hello,

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:00.960
guys.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.150
Welcome again.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.470
In this lecture,

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.150
we would be talking about white papers off issue.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.320
So in this lecture,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.050
you will learn how to tell the difference between an excellent white paper and a bad one.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.850
Why have I been harping on about the white paper?

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.010
Simply put,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.440
a white paper is similar to a business plan.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.450
It shows you step by step.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.180
What other developers are planning to do and how well it is written and thought out gives

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.620
an indication off how much planning has gone into making this idea a reality.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.900
The white paper can make or break a company if the white paper is big or glosses over

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.930
potentially shoes without addressing them adequately.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.740
It is an indication that the writer does not know what is going on,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.350
and it's probably unsure of how to continue.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.240
Ah,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.600
white paper that has been written on the fly and that contains typos or look like it has

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.350
been rushed through is also a bad sign.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.530
This is often the only Charles that the business had to impress potential investor.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.190
If they cannot be bothered to make an effort here,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.640
how diligent will they be when it comes to overcoming problem in development.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.050
Men are creating the product that is glitch free.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.210
Are the serious about the company?

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.590
It all?

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.390
How diligent have they bean in the research?

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.350
If the lead typos slipped through the crack,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.160
why haven't they deemed it necessary to hire someone to write the paper for them?

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.150
If they don't want to invest the time and effort and producing a professional by paper,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.280
why would you want to invest with them at all?

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.200
So these are some of the questions we should,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.930
you know,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.030
a pop up in the mind.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.020
An excellent white paper,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.950
on the other hand,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.190
addresses all the technical and commercial aspects off the project.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.200
It is thoughtfully written based on fact,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.630
not supposition,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.150
and gives you all the information that you need to know.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.350
It deals with how the product will be develop,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.450
marketed and sold,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.450
and also deal with the issue that might be encountered.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.000
It should tell the investor work is unique in value for this product and how they will

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.830
stand out from the competitors.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.210
Why this product made this way and at this time,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.390
why will it be sexes and most importantly,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.700
violet work in the market As it stands.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.450
Now,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.650
let's talk about what actually should be the components of a worldwide paper.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.550
Number one excellent excutive summary now,

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.190
good white paper tend to be longer document they are not talk meant that,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.610
do you?

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.930
Ah,

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.310
you know,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.200
diving toe.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.780
When you a few minutes to spare the excutive,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.110
somebody will go over the mean point covered in a very Saxon in form.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.450
It's there to wet your appetite and to encourage you to read further.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.780
Now,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.710
if this is the first ice your white paper you're looking at you will no doubt have set

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.950
aside some time to read.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.080
The excutive summary won't seem quite as important initially,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.290
but you have to also consider other investors.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.750
You don't want to be the only one investing.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.880
Is there somebody compelling?

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.160
Does it make you want to read more about the project?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.150
Arctic action?

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:35.250
Would it stand out of There were 10 others White papers in front of us win.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.200
So a valued and excutive somebody should hook the readers and make them want to read the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.550
rest of the document.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.960
Okay.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.290
It should contain a thorough description of the problem.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.280
What problem will this product help to solve it is a compelling problem.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.320
Is it something that most people would be looking for?

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.450
A solution for when reading this,

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.150
keep your thinking cap on focus on the issue itself and how much of a problem it is.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.710
Also,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.960
it should.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.050
It should contain solution.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.520
How is the product going to solve the problem?

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.760
How are people dealing with the situation at the moment?

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.790
How much will you need to charge?

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.850
And is that something that they would be willing to pay?

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.460
Would they be willing to spend money on that solution,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.930
or could they get by as there?

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.450
Now,

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.510
are there other ways to get around the problem or better solution for the problem?

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.100
When it comes to that,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.850
what are the things do they have to consider when buying the solution?

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.060
For example,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.250
of budgeting up with all the bells and visuals?

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.650
Might be nice to have and can make it easier to manage expenses,

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.490
however,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.450
notebook and a pen or an Excel spreadsheet could do the same for a lot less money,

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.350
which would be easier for the potential plan.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.450
What are they used to doing now?

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.470
Maybe solving this problem is not as high on the list off priorities.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.020
On the other hand,

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.960
the product and the cycle details should also be there.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.460
What is a product that they're proposing?

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.540
What different milestones are the putting in place for the development of the product?

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.420
How will they know if things are on track or not?

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.450
How advances the development of the product doesn't require new technology,

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:36.850
So the team is also a very important part of this.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.250
You know who is doing what roles and responsibility,

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.220
who are the key players and what are their rules?

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.890
Vier.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.610
They're the best people for the job.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.330
What are the credentials or experience?

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.840
What do the bring to the table and how will they assist in the sex is off the company.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.290
So these are some of the questions that should be well thought off,

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.880
you know,

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.680
And she should be ported in legs.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.550
Could have summary.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.090
Now the market and competition,

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.110
environmental scenarios,

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.680
you know,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.830
What market will they be working in?

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.440
Who will they sell toe?

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.070
How big is the market?

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:19.230
What protector out there already who is a competition bore direct and indirect and border

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.350
their offerings?

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.960
It should also can contain the token market.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.350
What are you going to be able to do with the tokens outside of the company?

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.090
Will you be able to buy,

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.180
sell or trade them if the company goes bust?

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.940
If there's another application for the token,

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.410
how the proceeds are going to be used?

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.850
The company should have worked out some sort of budget and so should be able to lay.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.080
Okay.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.380
Most important,

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.410
it should also have terms and conditions.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.220
You know,

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.900
uh,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.120
if you buy a token,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.310
what are your rights?

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.550
Do you have voting rights?

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.550
A tall Has there already been a pre sale where investors have been able to purchase token

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.650
at a lower value?

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:10.900
Now how many tokens are to be sure this is something that is a serious effect on the value

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.150
of the token going forward,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.210
for example,

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.800
let's take Bitcoin.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.740
You know the number of Bitcoin is finite,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.400
you know,

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.980
one stunt,

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.390
even millions have been issued.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.410
No new Bitcoins will be available.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.400
Around about 3/4 of this figure have already been mine.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.290
And that is why people have been losing their minds.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.830
When it comes to Bitcoin investment,

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.350
they are seen as a commodity that is getting really,

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.370
by the way.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.600
On the other hand,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.980
if Bitcoin were limitless in supplier,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.350
they would have developed very quickly because they would flood the market.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.360
Okay.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.730
Next point,

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.570
you know,

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.590
is the intrinsic value.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.350
Some coins that merely Cryptocurrency that can be bought,

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.130
sold and traded.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:05.080
Some coins have a more practical function in that they allow you to pay for using the

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.050
product or services from the company.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.230
What will your coin enable you to Do you know,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.950
eater,

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.780
for example,

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.550
was not explicitly developed as a Cryptocurrency,

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:21.230
but rather is the way for developers and users of the you know it stadium network people

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.350
services used.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.400
So if you want to set up a smart contract,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.260
for example,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.890
you need to pain eater.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:33.480
You need to know exactly when it is that you're buying so that summarize it.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.940
If we have to summarize the post point comes,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.360
you know,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.920
excellent by paper is detailed eyes detail and shows the amount off tarred that the

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.710
development have put into the project.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.050
Ah,

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:48.200
white paper is similar in nature toe a business plan and should give you all the

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.450
information you need.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.560
The veteran car for the team and the environment,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.550
the plan and things like this.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.690
You know,

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.230
the white paper is the company's best chance of getting invested.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.120
Interested?

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.500
If the white paper does not impress you,

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.840
it is not likely to impress others either.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.420
The team should spend time perfecting the white paper before releasing it,

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.020
because it gives a clear signal about how seriously the project is being taken.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.140
So these are a couple of things you know,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.780
we discussed in this lecture in the next lecture.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.470
We will be talking about few more interesting aspects.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.210
Till then,

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.470
I'm taking a pause.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.570
Thank you very much,

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.090
guys.
