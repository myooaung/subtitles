00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
Hey,

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.250
guys will come again.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.280
So in this lecture,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:10.350
we will learn why the team behind the issue is so he sanction and how to make sure that the

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.050
team that you are presented with are the right people for the job.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.070
So starting and managing any companies difficult.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.450
That's especially true when it comes to issues you have there,

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.170
right teams for the job,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.970
right job,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.950
a team that has the necessary skills and that is ableto work well with one another.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.830
Without experience and cohesion,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.050
the team starts out at a disadvantage.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.220
So how to get more information about the team is the question which always comes in mind to

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.770
evaluate,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.370
thinks start job by looking at the ice,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.150
your website and in the white paper for details about the team.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.050
If they have no details and either players look for a different guys here to invest in.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.330
If they don't have enough details,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.280
you can ask the company to provide them.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.350
Most businesses will be more than happy to comply with reasonable request like this one.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.620
Now,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.550
how do you see?

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.550
Is the team any good?

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.660
Now you need to prepare yourself to do a little legwork it is essential to properly

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.530
evaluate the team on,

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.410
make sure that they can deliver on the promises.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.270
It doesn't matter how wonderful the idea is.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.890
If it is poorly executed,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.150
it will not succeed.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.220
In fact,

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.590
it may just serve as an inspiration for a complete ER who has the team to execute a better

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.180
version,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.600
leaving your investment in that.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.250
So to evaluate the team,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.890
you must do the following number one Google.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.130
Each of the team members is an information about them.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.040
The experience.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.040
Background,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.100
you know,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.850
Are you a quick experiment and Google your Google Ah name?

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.250
There's a surprising amount of information that you can find this way.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.450
If you cannot find any info on the team man member,

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.840
this should be a red flag.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.530
Believe a lot off over word or lanes.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.120
Someone might may not have a Facebook profile,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.670
but they're bound to be in some kind of social media are leading to some sort of project

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.450
somewhere.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.090
Second important thing is to check on Lincoln as I've already taken,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.650
you know,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.790
sometime out saying we have to do profiles matching on the Lincoln.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.630
Um,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.650
you know what other experience?

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.400
What they have what they have done have the being published.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.470
Do they look like the photos displayed on Ligon and other social media?

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.290
Are they who they claim to be?

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.540
Third,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.830
What kind of reputation do they have?

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.240
Someone who strikes out on their own to start an icy Who is risking the reputation if

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.380
things go wrong?

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.380
If they have a good reputation already,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.390
they're less likely to Rusk to spoil ruining or running it.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.870
So by getting in world with the dodgy project.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.470
So that's one of the,

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.160
you know,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.430
way you can know.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.920
Ah,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.250
about the team.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.510
That's no guarantee that the project is a good one,

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.650
but it should help the case for the project.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.140
The other thing you have toe,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.460
you know,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.300
find out is what is the background and what grinches practical experience do they have.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.560
Ah,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.220
you know,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.090
and think about what you would be looking for.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.130
If you had to set up your own team for the project,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.440
you would want people some with some recent experience in the field,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.610
think offered this way.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.130
Would you go and look at a bunch of accountants if you wanted to start a professional

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.020
baseball team?

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.550
No,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.240
so you would look for pairs.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.360
The same applies here.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.130
Some experience in the field is required for at least a few of the team members.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.870
Considering the nature off this market,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.250
it's also crucial that they are up to date with their skills and experiences.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.810
Someone who got a big green couple of science a decade ago and has not kept up with

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.750
advances in the field is not going to have the skills to work on the Trump net for.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.790
For example,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.220
Next thing is the team ministry have their work with one another before how well they work

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.260
as a team together.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.170
Generally speaking,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.640
it is better to have a team you know whose members have hard some work experience with one

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.220
another,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.680
any association that we each member know what to expect,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.280
you know from the other.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.820
And there is less charge of chance of falling out over small misunderstanding.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.220
In a stressful environment,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.840
you need to be able to work with the members of your team is quite common for nerves to

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.730
become frayed,

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.900
so you know you don't want one of the team members to walk out when the project is nearing

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.860
completion next point at the top of my you know notes is Do they have experience with

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.990
Blockchain in this game saying something like,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.930
We'll get the funding and then find the talent can be fitted.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.720
The Blockchain is something that is still very new and there are only a certain number of

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.890
experts out there.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.970
The team should include,

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.360
at least is one member who understands the working off ah Blockchain technology and that

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.170
some experience working with it.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.050
Next point is,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.000
are the advice is credible and do they have in port,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.960
you know,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.850
check the list of adviser and see how much influence they actually have.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.420
So there is a big difference between having an adviser looking over the initial plan once

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.510
Onda give pointers and someone was actually on board and helping to make the project a

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.330
success,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.050
you know?

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.050
Ah,

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.560
in whatever you know,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:05.250
whatever they have done by providing advise on a more regular basis is both people would be

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.300
called advisers,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.550
but the later had much Ah,

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.090
more hands on role.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.890
Okay,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.630
so coming on toe Quick summary off this lecture,

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.390
you know?

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.070
Ah,

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.860
In this lecture we have learned that good teamwork is essential to the success of the

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.850
project that you need to read the team working on the ice here properly.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.350
We're checking on light sources on confirming that word they have claimed is true.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.210
Experience in the field is both an asset and essential to success.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.350
That the advisers ongoing rule is also essential.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.450
Yeah,

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.740
so this complete this lecture and I'm taking a pause here.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.300
You know,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.890
a lot of thanks for participating in the next lecture.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.550
We would be talking about a few more aspects related to why CEOs,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.250
thank you very much.
