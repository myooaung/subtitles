00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
Hey,

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.020
guys,

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.070
let's talk a bit more about ice use.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.840
So an initial coin offering,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.860
or I seo,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.350
as I already covered,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.180
is a way that companies used to raise funds toe a development or to get the project off the

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.750
ground.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.880
So they're sweeping the Cryptocurrency for the waterboard Cryptocurrency the investor is

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.420
using.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.730
An initial coin offering is run while the project is still in there.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.310
Ah,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.780
it's development stages on,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.550
so the tokens are not going to be worth much at the time.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.890
The investors are betting that the company will be successful and looking to make a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.250
significant return on investment.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.400
So the best way to think off this is a crowdfunding exercise rather than an outright sale

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.250
off stock,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.100
so you can trade them on ah,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.970
coin exchange like Politiques if they have been listed.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.150
But not all companies give token holders working grapes,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:08.740
so these are classified as high risk investment because there is usually no working model

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.530
or asserts when you invest,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.850
it is a lot like venture capital investment.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.890
Now let's discuss a few facts about by CEOs and,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.400
ah,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.310
to start with the 1st 1 I CEOs have raise more start up capital for companies using

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.600
Blockchain technology than venture capitalists have actually at the date off,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.850
you know,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.360
you know,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.280
off writing this lecture more than $2 billion has been raised in the manner not too shabby

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.320
for the new kid on the block,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.880
is it?

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.750
You know,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.940
So it Terry,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.450
um,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.360
you know,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.780
ice,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.780
you can be classified as a starting point for I CEOs in general.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.010
It was the first time that companies had raised money this way,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.950
and the software developer made it possible for other businesses to do the same.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.690
So it atrium was forward thinking they gave use a small reasons to use the network.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.120
Aside from just transferring assets or mining for coin well,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.900
the reason is most ice years are based on tokens issued on the Italian Blockchain because

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.210
it area makes it easy to create your own token.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.450
And Cryptocurrency,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.260
looking assured in this way are known as e r.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:33.250
C 20 No Auger gholam on melon port are all example off DRC 20 token.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:41.510
Next point is there be a or raised over 1 $50 million on it stadium Still the record for

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.890
the most money raised.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.280
Unfortunately,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.750
it ended up being a failure because this app got hag due to security flaw in the smart

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.650
contracted set up.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.350
And this allowed some of the money raised to be stolen.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.870
It was because of this heart that you now have both a Terry,

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.020
um,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.300
and Italian classic.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.540
The majority of users decided to start a new chain that branched off from the regional just

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.890
before the hack occurred,

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.670
so that it was like the foreign was never stolen.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.330
So this branch is still call it a very,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.680
um,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.060
the few purist on the side felt that they should continue as is,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.280
despite the money that was lost and didn't change over to the new branch.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.440
So this is known as Ethereum Classic for this book were working,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.290
um,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.720
on dietary.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.940
Um,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.150
when buying eater,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.550
make sure it is for it.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.650
Tedium and not ethereum Classic.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.220
It's on Lee startups that can use this form of funding.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.020
The established companies kick also entered the arena,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.750
so a way of raising more working capital.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.750
So let's discuss types off ice use.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.000
Now.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.410
The first type is currency ice use.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.470
This is where a new form of Cryptocurrency is developed.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.360
The company benefit because they receive fund that they can used during the development

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.050
stage.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.610
The investor benefit because they get getting out of the ground level.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.410
If the project becomes popular,

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.010
that token will increase in value.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.210
So Bitcoin is an excellent example of this type.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.240
When it comes to a token that is solely a Cryptocurrency,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.950
you need to be careful.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.570
For starters,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.500
it may be viewed as a security rather than a digital product product,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.660
and so will be prone to stricter regulation.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.550
Secondly,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.050
it is simple to make a Cryptocurrency off your own it atrium.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.630
Even Freud's a Templar to do so.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.050
That means that there are a lot out there that are entirely worthless.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.150
Next Project I CEOs,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.840
a project I see,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.640
is a token that will allow you to have certain rights within the program.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.850
They should be in the form of voting rights like with anger,

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.390
or it should be payment for using the program or features within.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.400
It either was initially created toe pay for using the network,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.660
but has also involved into a robber's crypto currency in its own right now,

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.650
coming onto dynamic or static funding for I CEOs.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.650
No,

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.030
let's talk about first dynamic funding.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.390
Now,

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.620
in this instance,

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.060
that token are not issued with a predetermined mind value,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.660
and so the more that are sold,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.540
the higher the price becomes started.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.040
Funding.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.530
This is where the developers have a specific fern Ingle and create tokens that have a value

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.460
that this pre determine the value is not going to change while the I.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.660
C.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.820
U.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.970
Is running.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:08.020
It is also possible for companies to create a new token was another has been sold,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:15.410
but they will usually have a predetermined limit for how many times they are able to do so

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.410
.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.230
Now let's talk about investment value off ice CEOs.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.300
There has been a lot of buzz about Cryptocurrency investment,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.750
and I sue investment as well.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:33.930
One particular market segment that has shown a lot of interest here is a venture capitalist

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.750
investor.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.940
This type of investing is perfect for them.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.460
You get in at the ground level and leave the day to day running off the company and product

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.380
development to someone else and stand to make a fortune.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.940
If the company becomes highly successful now.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.270
Four.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.590
Standard Investor.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.450
However,

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.280
it is this if that becomes a large part off the problem.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.260
The industry is largely under regulated,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.350
and this is another thing that can make investors nervous.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.190
Also,

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:13.810
some investor feel that the ice ears are or valued under the bubble is bound to bust.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.540
It can,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.390
however,

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.090
be very lucrative.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.360
Who here wishes that they had gotten in on the icy off Ethereum,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.630
where you could pick up Peter for a few cents?

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.400
Ethereum is more than $80 million during the I.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.610
C.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.230
O face,

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.650
and so was a perfect example of how popular this kind off investment is,

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:43.950
considering that they are now trading at between 7 $50.1100 dollars.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.040
Prior token,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.360
you have some idea off how good the investment written could be.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:49.890
Now,

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:54.090
before you rush off and buy any eye so you can find,

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:58.450
I need to warn you this is still a height of high risk investment.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:05.400
If you rush into it blind and let yourself be blown away by great advertising or fleshy

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.540
website without checking into it any further,

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.400
you could lose everything.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.710
It is not all doom and gloom,

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.130
though.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.300
If you do your due diligence on the ice,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.550
you before investing,

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.050
you could stand to make a tidy sum off money.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:30.650
Now let's talk about those all points on what all to look for before investing.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:36.210
Now we are going to go through this in more detail at leader stage.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.260
But for now,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.450
here are some basics to consider.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.650
Number one.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:46.920
Ignore the fleshy website and claims ever being the best thing to ever hit the Blockchain

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.550
market.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.320
Every company will make claims like this.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.570
It might be true,

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.800
but it also might be a marketing ploy.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.610
Also,

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.870
even if the idea is fantastic,

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.800
there is no guarantee that they are going to get it right.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.180
Ah,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.690
popular story that can be applied here is that of Thomas Edison and the light bulb.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.450
It was a brilliant idea,

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.150
but took 100 off price before he actually got it right.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:19.220
Is the company you are looking into goingto be a persistent look at the team itself?

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.690
What history do they have?

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.290
What experience do they have?

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:27.010
Does it make sense for this group of people to be working together when you consider what

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:32.610
the project team strategy the name itself can make or break the project if they don't have

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.210
the right expertise?

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.200
The project is dead in the water.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.090
They also have to believe in the project and wander toe succeed.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.990
Look at the project itself.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.330
What are the goals here?

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.260
What are they setting out to do?

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:52.050
Does that big sense or so like something there would be a market for?

00:09:52.050 --> 00:10:00.940
The project usually starts with an idea that seven feels will work have their done adequate

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.480
research to ensure that it is good an idea as the thought and things like that.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.370
So what?

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.420
The other thing you can ask is what other bus can't you find about the project?

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.910
What is everyone is saying about it on your project might not have generated a lot of buzz

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.380
here,

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:22.140
but there are many industy expert that monitor new development and talk about exciting

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:22.910
newcomers.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.850
It might take a little while toe build up the bus.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.480
But if the project is a little older and they're still no bus,

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:35.750
it might be an indication that it is something that the market is not really interested in

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.750
.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.100
The other question you can ask is,

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.860
has the development team heart success in the past?

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.880
Has the team delivered in the past?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.530
Do they work well together.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.350
How many successes and failures have they heard?

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.900
Is it a bad luck or just that the team cannot deliver?

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.510
Do they have experience in the business world as well?

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:59.060
So homework is the absolute key off getting this right.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.680
There is no way that I can stress that enough for you.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.080
Ah,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.520
lot of people compare.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.310
I see you investing toe having a gold mine.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.900
Sure,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.170
there is good chance for great Rainer return with a gold mine.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:17.550
But you have to know where to dig and actually do the hard work to get the gold out.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.320
Okay,

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:19.690
guys.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.680
So with that,

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.140
I'm taking a pause on in the next lecture,

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.180
we will dug out a few a few more details related to the topic,

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.650
so thank you very much.
