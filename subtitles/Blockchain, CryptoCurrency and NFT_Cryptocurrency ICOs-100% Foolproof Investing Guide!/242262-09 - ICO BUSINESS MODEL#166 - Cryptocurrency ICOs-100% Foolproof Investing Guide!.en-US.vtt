00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
Hey,

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:00.890
guys,

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.190
let's talk about evaluating the business model.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.850
So in this lecture,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.510
you will learn how to find out whether or not the ice here is following a good business

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.000
model.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.880
What means they might use when it comes to token sales and how to see what is happening to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.780
the money that you invest.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.600
Let's come to the business model,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.540
so you need to start out by asking the right question when it comes to the business model

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.660
that the issue has presented.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.310
And here is what you need to know of first and foremost,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.150
what is the underlying system,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.700
and does it make sense here?

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.450
Does it make sense for the company toe want an extensive network,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.990
or are they just looking for a way to access funding?

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.220
For example,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.850
the local undertaker would not really need a wide network off people from other cities

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.650
would day.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.170
If the underlying system does not make sense for the business,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.560
it's time to look at another ice.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.860
You second question,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.500
which we should be clear off,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.370
is a decentralized network appropriate?

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.180
Will moving the company onto the Blockchain network have real benefit for the company,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.850
or will it just be a waste of time.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.920
Third question.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.990
Why have the guard tokens?

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.260
How will the tokens be used?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.880
Is there a specific pope purpose within the company?

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.350
Or are the purely speculative?

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.950
Does the business model actually require them to sell tokens?

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.450
While most companies do look for cash injection from time to time,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.420
you need to know why they're doing so now.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.590
Do the plan to expand our do.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.390
They need money because they're battling.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.030
If they haven't laid out what they plan to use the investment money for.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.670
Be very,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.350
very.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.610
Next question,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.300
which comes and should be,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.550
we should be clear off is what economic model do they follow?

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.250
This is key because it tells you how they intend to create value for the investor.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.540
Is this project going to be a one hit wonder?

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.250
Are do the plan to expand it if successful?

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.760
Is there any outside application for the token?

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.260
If the project goes bust,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.890
will there be an any other races to use a token?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.450
Can it be used for other products within the company or with a partner?

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.940
Let's talk about the objective off a token sale,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.500
a token sale could be held for a number of different reasons.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.520
Sure,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.240
the company wants to raise money,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.750
but how they're handling the sale will tell you a lot about what these reasons are.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.750
One of the reason can be to reach a certain minimum in sales.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.410
This is common and involved the team,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.130
you know,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.800
um,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.850
creating a target and sales based on how much money they need to operate.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.630
It shows that they have done some homework and are not just trying to raise as much as

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.250
possible.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.280
When they hit that minimum,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.080
they are likely to stop issuing coins.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.010
It pays to remember that the coins can become a commodity in themselves,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.650
and the team member will probably also get some.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.000
If they're serious about the business,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.150
they will want to sell just enough to meet the needs,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
but not so much that they flood the market.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.900
Second thing is placing a cap on the amount rays so the company will accept sales figure

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.630
below this,

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.690
but will stop selling the truck token when they have raised as much money as they need.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.250
Third can be issue a set number off token.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.250
This is essential.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.180
When a Bitcoin did basically they did the same thing.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.880
They're not going to issue more.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.900
Been more Bitcoin One start,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.060
even millions have bean assured the benefit for the investor is that the scarce,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.040
scarcer the commodity is,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.010
the more that talking will become.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.850
What if the company takes off?

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.060
Next thing is,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.310
they want white skill adoption.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.030
This means that they're going to sell as many tokens toe as many people as possible.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.210
The company might do something like this if this if they require business model,

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.950
you know you have an extensive network,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.950
something like Ethereum,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.950
for example.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.540
Eso watch out here,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.520
though if you cannot find a good business reason for this kind of scaling,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.450
it could also indicate a scam that we covered the only a chapter.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.350
So another point which we should keep in mind,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.160
is ah,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.820
they could sell the tokens for the market value.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.400
Here,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.710
they're looking for investor and are willing to roll the dice that they will get enough

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.840
investor Ah,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.000
The other thing can be they could ensure that every bar get some talkin.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.600
This means I mean,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.920
issuing as many tokens as were bored.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.300
Instead of limiting the supply up front,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.380
they could make sure that every buyer gets some percentage of the tokens issues issued.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.620
This works well where they want to limit supply.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.430
But they ensured that all the buyer do get something companies will need to decide which

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.250
objective suit them best before the sale.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.430
There is no way that any company can run,

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.880
you know,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.650
with all these objective at once.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.530
Well,

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.440
let's let's quickly talk about you know,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.550
the types off token sales.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.610
The objective that the company has will deter my in vote type of tokens Hill their offer.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.190
There are a lot of different models to choose from.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.550
Here we're concentrating on the top five common ones.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.070
Number one is cab sales First come for.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:03.030
So this will usually mean that a set number of tokens is a sure the prices off each token

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.250
will be the same and will only change once all the tokens have bean sword.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.500
They couldn't Steve place a cap on the overall value of sales,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.850
but the outcome will be the same.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.500
When the goal is reached,

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.200
no more tokens will be sure.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.850
Team members will be assured our tokens and predetermined quantities.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.250
Second,

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.650
uncapped sales.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.360
In this case,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.630
the company will run the sale over a set period of time on tokens will be sure without any

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.080
limits.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.720
So the company could sell,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.290
say,

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.340
100 tokens are they could sell,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.960
you know,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.680
100,000 tokens.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.090
This option allows the buyer to buy any amount they wish.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.580
Team members receive a set number of tokens in this case as well.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.750
Next time Cubs is comes is cab auction.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.760
This works slightly differently.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.620
Buyers will bid on tokens.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.160
The bed very determined the value of the token.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.570
The token will be sold until a particular cash value has been raised.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.250
And so the numbers of number of talk and insured will change.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.610
Team members will receive available number of tokens.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.100
Business.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.770
How many have been sold?

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.100
Unq abduction.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.800
This is just like the option above,

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.330
you know,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.000
which is capped out auction.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.910
Except that there are no limits in terms of cash.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.400
Raised the number of tokens.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.620
Howard will be limited.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.150
The prices part ocon will very depending on the bed amount,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.350
the team members will receive a percentage of the overall number off tokens,

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.780
then comes capped and then re distributed.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.260
This is another auction,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.010
but this time the buyers bid on them out.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:51.060
That they would like to pay the distribution off token will depend on how many were sold

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.850
and which prizes were more favorable.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.170
With this kind of auction,

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:02.540
you might see the company refunding some of the investor who's bids they didn't want to

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.250
accept.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.610
Okay,

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.110
so,

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.650
uh,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.230
let's move to use off proceeds.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.890
Now that we understand the basic off how the sale will work,

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:18.000
we need to look at one of the most important aspect to look at.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.500
How the money will you buy You pay for?

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:27.090
Token will be sure by the company alleged mate and forward thinking company will have

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.950
created a budget and will know exactly what the financial goals are.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.850
They will have a plan on how they're going to spend that money and should be willing to

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.150
share that plan with you.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.180
It's the same as any startup company.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.300
If they weren't funding,

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:47.210
they have to prove to potentially investor what they're planning to Russo with the money.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.160
It is also something that SEC would be very interested in.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.050
So it is important that the I c E o has a solid plan.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:00.450
They should have milestone and place for each state off stage of the process.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:00.910
Ideally,

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.750
you want to break down along the lines off,

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.160
you know,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.480
say ah,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.210
segregating the whole thing section to spend money in and what percentage to use and we can

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.690
segregated in tow,

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:14.420
you know,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.190
like product development,

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.180
marketing,

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.180
legal costs,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:18.940
operations,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.530
cars,

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.550
reserves,

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.350
etcetera.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.160
You want a nice You know,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.640
where the focuses mainly on development without adequate resource dedicated to developing a

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.590
great product,

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.000
the process will be delayed.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.390
We'll look at it this way.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.400
The sooner the productive produced,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.820
the sooner you can start getting a return on your investment.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:46.180
So finally the company lays out its plans in this matter in the white paper.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.640
Then it comes very close to being a ah contractual obligation,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.250
even though it is not an agreement.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:58.720
And if you wanted to see what a later stage on the ground that they missed represented the

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.380
investment,

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.050
you would have a reasonable case.
