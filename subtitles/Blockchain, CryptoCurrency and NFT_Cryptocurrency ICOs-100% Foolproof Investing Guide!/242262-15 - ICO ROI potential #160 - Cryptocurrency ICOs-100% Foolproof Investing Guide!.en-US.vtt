00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
Hello,

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.140
guys.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.940
So in this lecture,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.480
let's understand the our way written off investment potential through the low icy oh market

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.090
caps.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.050
So the primal incentive for an investor is to generate return on his or her investment,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.950
making the coin distribution structure one of the first thing to consider.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.840
It depends on your investor profile,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.750
but low market cap projects come with a greater early profit potential.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.650
There is a downside as well.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.690
Low market cap projects could be manipulated by the whales and other bad actors.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.340
Manipulation possibility comes down to demand trading volume.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.120
But as we are considering ice hole I see owes,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.210
then trading volume as an indicator is not an option.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.960
So what can we do?

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.660
OK,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.680
let's come to this.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.540
So the best thing here is to get the protection from the ice,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.550
your team themselves individual cap,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.250
and if this is inevitable,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.820
you should learn vayan.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.130
Adjust your approach.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.610
This doesn't mean that the risk off manipulation is now gone.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.200
As once it gets listed on an exchange,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.750
anything can happen.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.350
No,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.050
let's talk a few things more before starting that lets cow cover a few terms.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.810
Number one circulating supply So circulating supply is a number of coins available at the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.700
present time and circulating in the market.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.760
Total supply is coins that are in circulation,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.050
plus coins held by the project plus total additional emission.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.830
So,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.050
in other words,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.670
the number of coins that will ever exist for that particular Cryptocurrency is the total

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.250
supply.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.320
Okay,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.400
now coming onto big small supply and bluish hard cap,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.130
probably the highest our way.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.410
Written off investment on Investment.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:13.230
Potential Scenario If the coin price on I Sophie's is reasonable in comparison with the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.070
market,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:21.210
it should really emphasize on the word potential as it could drop to zero in a heartbeat.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.890
This is where we need to be careful.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.010
Don't get tangled in the potential without considering other factors.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.350
It is possible that nobody cares about the project on they have absolutely nothing to offer

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.060
smaller forces.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.430
Bigger Total supply is not a major factor to consider.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.850
It's neither good nor bad.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.750
All that should matter is how the coins are distributed,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.480
team remind etcetera.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.920
The bigger the total supply,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.980
the less perceptive the price becomes,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.580
and this could create unnecessary confusion.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.400
There are many who think that bigger supply or smaller price equals garbage,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.990
but that's pretty much all there is.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.310
Okay,

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.750
so no hard cap means that the project has a good chance toe pick up post ice you.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:25.160
This is also an indication that the team has an idea off how to use the funding and that

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.770
David,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.170
on a fishing trip,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.400
for example,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.660
syndicator ah promising hybrid intelligence project has a healthy approach.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:46.460
Their hard cap is 1.5 $50 million price per one I seal coin is zero points 001 In fact,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:53.090
it's $1 which means that the total supply will be two billion cries,

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.490
including admissions.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:01.550
So let's find similar total supply project on coin market cap dot com.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.700
Okay,

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.150
first iota.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:12.580
Total supply is close to 2.7 27 billion currently training at 0.45 U.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.790
S.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.450
Dollars.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.050
It was close to $1 not long ago.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.480
The other example is big shares.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.250
Total supply is around pretty six billion,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:30.950
currently trading at $0.5 that there is a next E total supplies 998 million,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.820
currently trading at 0.64 U.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.020
S.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.650
Dollars.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.980
So yes,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:44.580
there are example of project that are now trading below $001 with similar total supply.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.750
Most of them,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.890
in my opinion,

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.960
does not deserve to be mentioned.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.350
In contrary,

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.160
there are also garbage coins that are trading higher than 0.1 U.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.830
S dollar.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.050
And that's where your investor profile comes to play.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.620
Thinking about the relation between 15 million U.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.770
S.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.360
Dollars low heart gap and the possibility off manipulation?

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.270
Absolutely.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.450
And they should be definitely considered.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.440
So in the syndicated example,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.030
they have opposed the issue with a very reasonable individual cap system,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.570
which is their case means that the coins are distributed in four tiers.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:32.760
Those kind of structure Alum eight eliminate veils and other speculators at the early stage

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.760
.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.060
And this is what you want to see in the icy oh,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.750
structure.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.030
Okay,

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.670
so of it that I'm taking a pause here in the next lecture,

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.890
we would be talking a bit more about,

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.590
you know,

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.980
a market gap.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.510
Small,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.600
big supply and related things are tell them thank you very much.
