00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.340
Hello,

00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.750
guys.

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.720
Welcome again.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.910
Sorry I couldn't compete The last lecture.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.620
You know,

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.080
Um,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.850
so I'm just continuing from where I dropped in the last lecture.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.100
Ah,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.830
so since the time is typically a massive number,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.150
the choice off saturation percentage has a large impact on the model.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.480
One could argue that the vending protocol off these digital resources will become global

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.200
standards.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.980
And global standards are typically Venner big small scenarios.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.580
So I have chosen to percent here to be conservative.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.590
Your choice off,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.150
take over time predicted the steepness off the esco as shown in the graph.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.860
For example,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.540
a takeover time off 20 years with the ever import deals the following s scope.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.100
As you can see in the screen right now,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.010
I'm sharing it.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.410
Okay.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.160
Meanwhile,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.630
if the take over time is shifted to 10 years,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.290
the S curve steepens considerably.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.350
No,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.350
the best way would be moderating it.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.820
Takeover timeto fit.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:20.010
How difficult you believe it will be to get the mainstream to such from the centralized

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.910
provider toe these decentralized networks.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.390
Now that we have P and Q,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.320
we can multiply them together to see the GBP off.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.030
I n e t.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.820
In any given year,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.550
which you can see in Row 24 above.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:46.750
So in 2018 I an E T J GDP would be roughly approximately 43.2 million.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.720
So,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.070
as I said in 2018 I n e.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.330
T.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.960
Is GDP would be roughly 43.2 million being on the conservative side.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.240
Now,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.120
this number seems a bit low,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.130
considering Bitcoin does Stan X that on change transaction volume in a single day.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.450
But then again,

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:18.110
it is also approximately 10 x the age off i n e t launches in 2018 to get the monetary base

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.740
m necessary.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.450
To support this GDP we need to bring in velocity Velocity is an assumption listed in the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.030
import table and column 26 and the most important exemption in the entire model for I m.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.160
E.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.450
D.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.090
I have chosen a velocity of 20 which is about three in tow.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.950
Bitcoin 2016 velocity off 6.5.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.850
However,

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.350
Bitcoin velocity off 6.5 was hybrid velocity,

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.210
which lumped together the holder Hodler's with people using Bitcoin as a means of exchange

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.210
.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.050
My velocity off 20 only references the velocity off the tokens in the floor that is,

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.260
you know,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.550
means of exchange velocity because I have pulled the holders out of consideration.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.020
Visual factor back in shortly.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.350
So I did use the means of exchange velocity off 20.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.550
From whatever knowledge I help,

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:28.540
I did with wine based on how these users interact with Bitcoin.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.970
As you can see here now,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:41.940
we can see 2016 that 54% off coin base Users approached Bitcoin strictly as an investment

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.710
meaning they huddled with velocity off zero.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.250
The remaining 46% actually used Bitcoin as a transactional medium,

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.950
resulting in some velocity that we have to infer.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.540
Fortunately,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:05.940
we have the hybrid velocity off Bitcoin in 2016 at 6.5 and does can solve for its

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.750
constitutions using a weighted average formula.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.300
Now the formula is hybrid.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.610
Velocity is equal toe percentage talking for use one in tow.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.060
We won plus percentage token for usedto into V two.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.050
And if you use this formula,

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.790
then we got we get veto as 14.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.090
Now,

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.750
as for the input for I n ity,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.390
I've used a velocity of 20 which is about 40% higher than Bitcoin means of exchange

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.150
velocity.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.580
Ah,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.640
that is because,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.350
you know,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.450
as but a thought.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.240
You know,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.710
crypto commodities like bandwidth coins will have higher velocities than crypto currencies

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.450
that are used as a currency on a macro basis.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.100
Now we can divide peak you by veto,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.500
get em using the formula V earlier stated.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:15.520
Now recall that pick you in 2018 is $43.2 million on the velocity of 20.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:23.310
That means only 2.2 million dollars is necessary in the monetary base to serve this economy

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.430
now,

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:31.660
one step that remains that remains to get the current utility value per token on that is to

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:38.630
divide the required monetary base by the number of tokens in the floor from Roy 11.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:50.310
We have 15.8 million tokens in the floor in 2018 and so $2.2 million slash 15.8 million

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.510
gives $0.14 current utility value.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.050
Per i N e d took him.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.180
No,

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.520
This doesn't include the tokens that are bonded or huddled in my calculation off current

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.750
utility value,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.510
because in any given ear they are not in circulation and does are unavailable.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.150
Toe the crypto economy.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:23.290
They're not flowing back and forth as a means of exchange for the digital resource and has

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.420
not part off every physical toe.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.980
Pick your calculation.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.960
No,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.710
there is something else to be done because current utility value does not equal the market

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.420
price off.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.350
Crypto asset.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:44.500
The market price off Crypto Asset is based on prediction off the future size of crypto

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:53.410
economy and the utility value each talking in the floor it will require to support that

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.050
economy in the future.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:02.510
Such pricing is done in the off chain liquidity pool that we call exchanges performed by,

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.400
you know,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.450
by our speculators,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.880
which takes us to section B off the model,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.450
discounting future utility value back to the present.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:20.830
Now what point to note is a set surprise based on future expectation on to reduce the

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.760
present value from future expectation?

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.250
One needs discounting.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:32.050
So if you're not sure what discounting is in the context of valuation,

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.170
you know we need to do it,

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.270
do a lot of things off flying.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.400
We can have a separate chapter on the same.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:44.100
But typically discounting is used to determine what the future cash flow is worth today.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.010
But remember,

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.200
Crypto asserts,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.650
don't have cash flows in stays beer.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.170
Instead,

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:56.780
we're discounting back a single future utility value toe the prison using a discount rate

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.070
suit able to account for the risk off an early stage network.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:06.140
Since you use a crypto us at once and then it sends someone as his hand.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.980
This discounting methodology is not a community over each year,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.600
the way it is with D.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.350
C f.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.350
Okay,

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.770
guys.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.430
So you know,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.720
with that I'm quickly,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.370
you know.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:22.930
Ah,

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.350
bypassing a bit.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.060
You know,

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.940
based on the above exemption.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:33.460
If I wanted to earn a return off 40% for the next 10 years,

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.630
which will clearly 30 x my money,

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:42.960
then I don't want to buy this assert for over $0.26.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.730
In traditional finance,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:49.500
people would say that anything over 0.26 is overvalued.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.350
Anything zero anything under 0.26 is undervalued.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.880
The discount Reedus commonly referred,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:06.880
do as the expected rate of return as it shows what you expect to be compensated for holding

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.150
this risky assert over time.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:15.250
If you decrease your expected rate off return because you deem the asset less risky,

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.570
and there's needs to be compensated less than you are.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:18.960
Okay.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.660
Buying the asset for slightly higher price.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.050
For example,

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.730
using a discount rate off 30%.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.560
Yield a relational market.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.110
Praise off 0.54 dollars.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:43.310
Now a global What this model doesn't account for that is in 2028 the marketplace off this a

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.810
set will likely not be $7.45.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.030
Instead,

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:56.590
just as with 2018 the racial market prize in 20 to 8 will be based on future expectation.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.320
Looking out from so zero,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.640
tow it so overall,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.650
you know Ah ah,

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.550
while some people are quick toe,

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.480
you know,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.900
pejoratively point out that a large percentage of these surprises are based on future

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.060
expectation,

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.300
which can be thought off a speculative value.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:25.920
This phenomena is not all that different from how stock trade about their book value.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.170
Due to future expectation in energy scares,

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:35.380
the asset market value is supported by 53% current utility value,

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:42.150
which is significantly better than most crypto asserts in the market right now.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.540
So with that,

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.410
I'm taking a pause here on you know,

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.790
we will talk more.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.460
We will discuss more in the next lecture.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.050
Thank you.
