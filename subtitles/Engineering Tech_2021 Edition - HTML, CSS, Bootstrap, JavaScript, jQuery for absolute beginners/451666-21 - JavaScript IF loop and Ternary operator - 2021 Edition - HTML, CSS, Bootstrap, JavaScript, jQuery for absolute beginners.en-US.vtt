00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
Let's now look at the blue whale rating.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:11.010
If look always use triple equals M equals ten, console.log.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.000
Yes.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.415
Console.log.

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:21.450
No. You can see a yes is getting printed.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.310
Let's try to compare ten M-Pesa with ten strings.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.090
We can see noise getting printed.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.650
So when we compare an integer with the ten strings, get Gibbs No.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.210
But if you have w equal,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.500
we get yes, converts the integer to string and then compares.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.800
If under strictly compare values with type,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.230
then always use triple equal.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.140
Similarly, we have not equal.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.405
Not equal, use two equal signs along with exclamation sign.

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:03.080
We can see is getting printed in the console.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.070
This is correct.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.385
This means ten number is not equal to ten string,

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:12.350
but if you have a single equal sign, you get no.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.395
So again, in nautical also,

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:21.410
always ensure your two equals sine m one exclamation mark and you use triple equal.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.100
While chicken give two sites are same or not.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.880
There is a ternary operator in JavaScript.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.550
The way it works is like this.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.020
Instead of a flue,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.575
you can write a condition.

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:39.530
Let's say ten is greater than five.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.014
Question mark, then lose some operation.

00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:47.720
Let's print something to the log else.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.565
So you do that by a colon,

00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:55.320
sign and read something else to the console.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.765
So question mark and a colon.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:01.565
If the condition is true,

00:02:01.565 --> 00:02:05.550
this should get executed outweighs the other one would get executed.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.180
Change this and check that the other block is getting executed.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.590
In a single line.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.065
You can check a condition.

00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:18.440
And based on that, execute some code,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.375
you can invoke a method here.

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:25.670
Articles have the entire expression later to a variable.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.760
Jvc will have this value.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.870
And we can do a console.log.
