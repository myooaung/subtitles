00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
Let's now understand how navigation to the beach.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.850
Before navigation lets

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.960
beach

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.350
contact human.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.710
Babies. German, select HTML5.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.705
With the basic structure of the page.

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:48.000
We live simple text here.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.950
Let's check out this beach.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.645
So now we have two betas.

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:07.610
Let's see how we can link the two pages.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.250
Having a header navigation,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.305
genetic and navigation is really easy using Visual Studio Code.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:21.440
Dave header. And let's say we weren't done nav.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.745
And we want a 100 list with two links,

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:30.100
data and hit enter.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.155
And you can see on the right-hand side,

00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:35.950
MIT's prompting you the structure and you

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.640
just hit enter here and you'll get the basic navigation structure.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.460
We would also have and can link.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.190
As you can see now, we do list items with encodings.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.560
And we'll say this one is for home.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.810
And this one is word. Contact Us.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.255
And here it will point to abc dot HTML, which is our home.

00:02:04.255 --> 00:02:10.090
And here it would point to contact dot HTML.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.090
And let's add the navigation to the contact dot HTML page also.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.930
Now let's go to the page and ticket out.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.280
Okay, as you can see here, we have two navigation element,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.155
home takes to the homepage and contact us sticks to the contact us page.

00:02:32.155 --> 00:02:35.710
And we're going to pick on home and come back to the homepage.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.580
Should this is how you can create a separate section for the header.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.990
And you can generate header quickly with Visual Studio Code and give links.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.405
Typically will give link to the pages within your website nor to the external states.

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:52.715
Because the search engine looks at Herder and

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:55.670
sees what are the pages that are available on the website?

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.040
Let's now RDF footer to the page and report that typically

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.680
you would divide the page into 3-6 and header man,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.570
where you have the main content.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.625
And we'll move this here, will have a header,

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:16.760
will have the main section where we let domain content

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.760
for the page. Then we'll create a footer.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.780
And we have footer navigation list.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.015
And let's say list like header and a.

00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:45.540
And we'll just copy paste disrupt the header section will have the same pitch.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.750
And for the main page also will have a main section.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:08.610
And we'll move disclosing tag today and just before the footer element.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.350
In Visual Studio or other editors,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.185
you can easily collapse and expand elements and see where the data properly or not.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:32.560
Now, cuz you can notice here we have a herder,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.630
We were men and we will put our section.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.810
And that would be the basic structure of the page.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.250
And then we didn't man, we keep adding content to build out page.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.780
Let's check out our base now is you can see we have a header navigation,

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.339
we have put a navigation,

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:59.720
and we're men body section in each apart pitch.
