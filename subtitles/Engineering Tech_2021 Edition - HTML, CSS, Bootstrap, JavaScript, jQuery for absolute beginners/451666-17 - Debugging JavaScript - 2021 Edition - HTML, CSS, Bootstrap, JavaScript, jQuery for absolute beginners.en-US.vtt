00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.860
We now understand how to debug JavaScript.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.170
Let's go back to contact ODS Kimmel,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.315
where we had written some JavaScript code and will introduce an error here.

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:15.450
Instead of R5 will survive a prefab.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.130
And let's see what happens.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.120
Opened with live server.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.470
Reload the page.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.220
Let's inspect the element and as soon as we loaded the page,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.590
we see an error and we click on that.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.900
And we know where they're at is.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.780
It says uncaught error that 55 is not defined.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.015
We can go to the Sources tab and go to Contact dot HTML.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:50.570
And we can see the line where we're getting there.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.155
Let's click here. And that would introduce a big point.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:57.935
So next time when we load the page,

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:00.260
YouTube comment, stop pre-written,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.940
not load the complete page.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.570
Then we can step over to the next function.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.570
And when we hover over different variables,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.190
we can see also that values.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.760
This should help us in debugging getter where we think

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.270
that something is wrong with our function execution.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.835
Are there the mother errors which we want to figure out?

00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:22.055
So by just hovering over the variables,

00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:24.755
we can see that value and we can not just see them here.

00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:27.860
And the variables that are undefined,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.290
those have not been faded with

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.470
values because you have not reached that point with the code.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.295
So we can step over and then see the output.

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:39.980
Now we know that viral 45 doesn't exist,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.450
so we can change the value.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.030
Now let's change the rate of R5.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.600
And we'll refresh the page.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.470
Now there is gone,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.120
but the breakpoint is still there.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.520
So we can continue and the program will get executed, die as expected.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.555
You can look at step out and step into different functions,

00:02:08.555 --> 00:02:11.960
and then you can be at pivot breakpoints by clicking on this.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.740
This is how you can debug JavaScript and this is very useful,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.510
especially when your basis is big and you can easily figure out what the problem is.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.460
Using this sources tab.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.570
You can put the points and then see what's going on in your page.
