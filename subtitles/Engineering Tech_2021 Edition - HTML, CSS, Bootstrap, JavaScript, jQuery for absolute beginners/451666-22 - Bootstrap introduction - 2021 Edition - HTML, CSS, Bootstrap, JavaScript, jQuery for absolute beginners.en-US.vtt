00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Next we'll understand Bootstrap and how we can style the page and make it responsive.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.340
Before looking at what Bootstrap is and how it works,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.955
let's try to load the page on a mobile device.

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:19.770
We've opened this abc dot HTML on a desktop browser.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.320
You don't need an actual device to know how the page would look like on a mobile phone.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.135
All browsers, including Chrome,

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:31.845
have features to show you how a page would look like on a mobile device.

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:36.165
When you inspect, you can see there is a device toolbar.

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:42.260
You can click on it. And you can see different options on the top here.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.350
So when you click on this toggle device,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.170
but you can see how the page is going to look like in a different layout.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.060
You can change this value,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.060
or you can simply click on this and try to

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.125
rotate how the page is going to look like in different orientation.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.930
You can select different mobile devices and

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.485
see how the page would look like on those devices.

00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:07.465
Let me select iPhone.

00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:10.030
And you can see that it would look like this,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.950
which is not that great.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.395
On an iPad, the page would look like this.

00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:16.195
This is not really responsive.

00:01:16.195 --> 00:01:19.975
Let's understand how we can make the space responsive.

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:23.410
Many websites that you see there was similar structure.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.795
They will navigation there.

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:26.555
Two or three column layout.

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.340
If you have to make a responsive page,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.650
would do not need to do everything from scratch.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.080
There is a framework available called Bootstrap,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.850
using which you can quickly and rapidly build responsive pages.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.670
So what exactly is Bootstrap?

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.990
You can visit getbootstrap.com to learn more about it.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.615
It's an open source framework using which you can build responsive layouts, rapidly.

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:53.210
Responsive mobile-first sites.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.570
Mobile first means the site is first designed for mobile,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.670
and then it is optimized for other devices such as desktop.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.515
And there are many sites in the real world which are built using Bootstrap.

00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:09.860
With Bootstrap, you can quickly build websites.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.750
So let's see that in action mixed.
