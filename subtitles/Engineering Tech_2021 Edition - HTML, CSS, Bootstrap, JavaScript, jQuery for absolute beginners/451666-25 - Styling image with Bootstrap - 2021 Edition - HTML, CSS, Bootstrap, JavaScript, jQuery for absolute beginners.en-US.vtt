00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.565
Next we'll understand how to apply Bootstrap on images.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.640
Will replace this image with another image with

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.800
slightly darker background so that we can see effect of different styling.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.670
There is a desktop dot PNG in the project folder.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.405
Will use that image for this demo.

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:26.775
Instead of Hadoop dot PNG will have desktop dot PNG.

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:28.665
Let's see how that looks.

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:30.540
So it has a heightened width.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:38.440
Let's remove that will change the order to desktop also.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.725
Now we can see the images taking.

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:45.650
And when we resize,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.740
eBay's doesn't get resized.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.230
It gets cut from the side.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.980
Bootstrap has lot of glasses for images using

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.745
which you can easily apply different responsive styling.

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:04.264
Let's see some examples.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.695
First, styling we replace,

00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:12.390
make the image surrounded, classical, rounded.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.060
To know more about the round date the class,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.780
you can go to the Bootstrap CSS file and search for our data.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.410
Border radius to give a rounded effect.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.315
Now let's see how it looks.

00:01:31.315 --> 00:01:34.120
You can see that the image is now little grounded in

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.245
the Cotner will also our little margin here.

00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:46.390
Um, does three will

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.380
add a class IMG desk fluid to make the image responsive.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.170
Now this is how the image looks with a full weight.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.770
And when we resize the pace,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.454
the image gets automatically resized.

00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:06.085
It doesn't get cut. And you can also check the effect on different devices.

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:13.280
Iphone, iPad, the image gets adjusted based on the width of the device.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.465
So this is how we can apply styling to images using Bootstrap and make them responsive.

00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:22.760
This is not everything about the images,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.750
but hopefully you got an idea about how to leverage Bootstrap

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.980
to quickly apply styling and make your website looks great.
