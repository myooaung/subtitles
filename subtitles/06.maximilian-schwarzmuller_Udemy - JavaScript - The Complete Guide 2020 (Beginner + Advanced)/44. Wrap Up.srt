1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:11,080
So that was a really long module, a long course section because control structures are such a key feature

2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,330
in any programming language and therefore of course also in Javascript.

3
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:23,530
You learned a lot about if and else if, about these logical operators - equal, triple equal, smaller than,

4
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,920
smaller or equal, greater than and so on.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,920
You learned how to combine conditions with and and also with or of course which we had here

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:40,120
for example. You also learned about the special behaviors of and and or which you can use to assign default

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:47,090
values or to assign certain values if some other condition is true. You learned about booleans - true and

8
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:53,870
false and also about falsy and truthy values and that Javascript, if no logical operator is given,

9
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:01,250
tries to coerce a value that is not a boolean to a boolean value and you learned about some of the rules,

10
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:07,880
like zero being treated as false, any other number including negative numbers being treated as true and

11
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,840
so on,

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,380
that's also important of course. You learned about the ternary expression which allows you to write in

13
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,220
line if statement so to say, which you can do with normally if statements

14
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:25,160
but if you just need a value and you have a relatively short condition and a relatively short code

15
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:31,250
to get that value, then this can be an alternative to writing a more verbose if statement where you assign

16
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:37,010
values to variables and you also learned a lot about loops, about the different loops that exist in

17
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:43,220
Javascript, how they generally work, how you work with them, how you configure them and there of course,

18
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,650
you also should play around with these to get a feeling for how they behave, how you can configure

19
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,690
them and how you can use them and it's needless to say that throughout this course, we will heavily work

20
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:59,630
with if and with loops of course, these are core constructs of any programming language and therefore

21
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,670
also of Javascript.

22
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,030
We also had a look at error handling in this module, another crucial concept which will be important

23
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,190
in more complex programs you're going to write which will also be important later down in the course and

24
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,580
which also is a control structure because it allows you to control code that might fail and then act

25
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,530
upon an error and do some fallback logic, show an error message to the user,

26
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:31,040
things like that. And besides this little project we worked on where I can only encourage you to dive

27
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,670
into the code, tweak certain things and fully understand how it works and what we did there,

28
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:43,100
besides that, I do encourage you to play around with these things on your own, also of course use

29
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,540
the resources you find in this module, like the attached slides

30
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,260
and if this is very much right now, which it certainly is, don't feel overwhelmed,

31
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,390
these are core constructs and therefore we will use them throughout the entire rest of the course.

32
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,970
So if you're not entirely sure yet when you would use which loop, you will get a lot of practice just

33
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,310
by continuing with the course of course because we will use loops there, we will use if statements there,

34
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,700
we will use many logical operators there and therefore all these concepts here will come to life over and

35
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,590
over again throughout this course.
