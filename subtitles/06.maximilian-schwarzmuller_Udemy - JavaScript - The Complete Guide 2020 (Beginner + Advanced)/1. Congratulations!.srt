00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,280
Congratulations, you completed this course,

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,930
you learned a lot about Javascript, the many ways of using it, all its core features,

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,860
how to use it in a browser and do amazing things there, how to use it in a different environment with Node.js

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,980
and so much more.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,960
So what now,

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,870
how do you continue? Well you finished the course,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,770
your journey does not end here

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:30,940
though. There's always more to learn not just because Javascript is an evolving language and browsers

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,100
are evolving and adding more and more browser APIs all the time

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,400
but in general because there are always more pattern to find and more things to learn.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,420
Use this course as a resource and reference,

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,300
it's not just a course where you should go through once and be done with it.

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,600
You have all these sections which focus on different topics,

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:00,790
you can always revisit the sections if something isn't 100% clear or you forgot something or it's

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,230
a very important concept and you just want to make sure you got that right.

16
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:13,720
So use this course as a go-back reference and not just as a use once resource. Also dive in to examples

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,200
you find on the Internet via Google and so on,

18
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:24,280
also build dummy projects, for example clone simplified workings of popular web applications or

19
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:29,360
add certain features driven by Javascript to your existing web page.

20
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,690
So practice the things you learned,

21
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,710
also dive into things which we haven't covered in exactly that way in this course

22
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:43,300
so that you can apply the knowledge you did get and combine that with other things you find via Google,

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,110
other snippets you find and then really build the web applications you want to build. And also last

24
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:56,480
but not least, build a portfolio, dive deeper into Javascript and into all the browser APIs.

25
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,900
As I said, things are evolving and you want to stay up-to-date,

26
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:07,750
you can dive into a progressive web apps for example which is a pretty interesting set of features exposed

27
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:13,810
by browsers that builds up on Javascript, that uses Javascript but allows you to build applications that

28
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:20,530
work without an internet connection for example. Dive into on the edge APIs which might only be supported

29
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:26,530
by one browser, not by all but still support might get better in the future and maybe you can build

30
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:33,100
something cool in that one browser where it is supported. Explore single page applications, also called

31
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:41,710
SPAs which can be developed with frameworks like Angular or Vue or React and its ecosystem, so

32
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:48,160
that you can build web applications driven entirely by Javascript. For all of that, you will need the

33
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:55,000
knowledge you gained in this course and you should never stop learning and growing because the web never

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,580
stops growing and evolving, Javascript evolves, so do browsers, so build up on the knowledge you gained here,

35
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:11,200
practice, dive deeper and dive into different ways of applying that knowledge. Now of course the question

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,690
is, where can you learn more?

37
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,520
Well of course you have this course as a reference as I said, where you can go back into and dive into

38
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,480
certain sections, revisit concepts from time to time and so on

39
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,390
but this is not all and

40
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,210
it does not cover all browser APIs

41
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,620
for example, it does not cover everything you can do in a browser because it's a Javascript course, not

42
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,000
a browser API course I guess

43
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,460
and because that's also evolving and changing all the time,

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,910
instead for that you have resources like MDN, which is a huge documentation about basically anything related

45
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,420
to Javascript and browser APIs,

46
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:54,370
so you start to learn more about what you can do in browsers or learn more about a certain Javascript

47
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,340
features and all the ways of configuring something there,

48
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,230
all the niche cases which we might not have discussed in this course,

49
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,890
so that is a great resource

50
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:10,150
you should check out. Also have a look at Stack Overflow, Stack Overflow is a great discussion board

51
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,190
where you can find interesting discussions, a lot of solutions for common problems

52
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,870
and of course also dive into discussions to help others,

53
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,450
this allows you to grow and get an idea of how other developers are solving certain problems or are doing

54
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,140
certain things.

55
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,270
We also have another documentation which I haven't used too much in this course but that would be the

56
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,090
Google Developers documentation.

57
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,720
It offers a lot of great articles on Javascript basics and also more advanced topics and you will

58
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,330
also often find that if you simply just google because that ultimately is the solution to everything

59
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,120
right,

60
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:54,130
no seriously googling for problems you want to solve with Javascript, for error messages you might get

61
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:02,140
and so on will give you a lot of interesting blog posts, tutorials, documentation articles and much more

62
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,230
which allows you to solve the specific problem

63
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:12,550
you might be facing well and ultimately of course check out other courses, not so much other Javascript

64
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,430
courses, you can do that of course but this is the most comprehensive course you find here on Udemy

65
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:25,090
but instead other courses on niche or specialized topics. For example I do have courses on Angular,

66
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,370
React, on Vue, on Progressive Web Apps and much much more

67
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,890
and you can simply check out all my courses to learn more about these things here and learn more about

68
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,330
these technologies.

69
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,390
So explore other courses, of course not necessarily just my courses though I'd be more than happy to welcome

70
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,700
you there, to dive into different ways of applying Javascript and using it.

71
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,770
And with that you're well-prepared to become an amazing Javascript developer and I wish you all the

72
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,620
best for your future career,

73
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:01,690
definitely share anything you build with me here in the Q & A section or as a private message,

74
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,090
I can't wait to see what you're building and I hope that you got a lot out of this course.
