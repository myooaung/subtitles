1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,770
Now let me also make clear what output result really does here,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,870
this does something which is called call a function, which I'll dive into later so we can ignore this

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,650
for now,

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,220
in the end it triggers some code which I defined here in vendor.js and this code uses two pieces

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,960
of information which I kind of forward to it.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,990
Again we'll figure out the details of what this is and how we use it later because we'll write our

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:35,560
own functions then but in the end, I push this data to this thing in vendor.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,150
What this does is it takes these two pieces of information it gets and writes them into my HTML

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,630
code

10
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:48,760
you could say because ultimately what that code does, without diving into the details which we'll also

11
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:56,490
cover later in the course because it's a bit more advanced, what this code does is it targets two places,

12
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,190
two pieces of our HTML code,

13
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,690
these two lines essentially and overwrites the data which is hardcoded in there with a dynamically derived

14
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,320
data

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,580
with the data you are forwarding here,

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,170
so with your result and with this empty string, that's what's happening here.
