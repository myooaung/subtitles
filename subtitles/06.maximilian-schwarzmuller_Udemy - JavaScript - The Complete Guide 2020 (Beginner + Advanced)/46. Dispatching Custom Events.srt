1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:09,970
So now that we can close and open our mobile Let's dispatch our own events now how do we do that.

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:17,020
Well for that let me first of all except on the canceled event the event object we get this automatically

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,290
we get this automatically because we used this click event listener here and JavaScript just works in

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:29,500
a way that the method which gets triggered for does event automatically receives an object with some

5
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,100
metadata about the event that was created by javascript.

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,250
So about that built in event.

7
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,750
Now we don't need that event to dispatch our own once.

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,260
We will not copy it or anything like that.

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:48,220
But on this event with event target I get access to the target that is responsible for this event.

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:56,620
So in my case the button and this button just like every other age criminal element is capable of dispatching

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:05,310
a new event with the dispatch event method the dispatch event method takes a new event.

12
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,350
So a totally new event not this event we receive here a new event as an argument.

13
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,500
So you're all named as cancel events.

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,860
The name is totally up to you.

15
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,730
And I created with the new keyword which we use in javascript to create new objects based on constructor

16
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,590
functions or classes and I'll use the built in event object.

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:33,040
So this is built into javascript just SDH html element is so now I can create a new event here and we

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,520
give this event our own name by passing it in the constructor here between quotation marks.

19
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,180
So as a string and here I'll name this cancel.

20
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,490
And this is exactly the name to which we will be able to listen to from outside later.

21
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:55,390
So here I am listening to the cancel event in my integrated email file and this should work later because

22
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,990
I'm dispatching an event named cancel here.

23
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,060
So now I have has this cancel event to my dispatch event function.

24
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,790
And with that let's see if that works.

25
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:12,240
Let's go back and reload here click that and click cancel.

26
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:18,490
And we don't see canceled here in the console even though we should be logging that here when we listen

27
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,930
to the canceled event.

28
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:27,830
So somehow our own event doesn't really seem to be dispatched on our component and indeed it isn't.

29
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:33,380
It is dispatched on the button because and that is the only reason why I accept the Devens argument

30
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,150
here.

31
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,130
We're dispatching it on the event target of the cancel event or off key cancelled event handler I should

32
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,910
say.

33
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,550
And that event handler is used on the click event of the cancel button.

34
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,900
So the event target of that event is to cancel button.

35
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,660
So we're using dad H Tim Al element to dispatch the event here and therefore the only place where we

36
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,090
can listen to that well is that button.

37
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:04,910
So if I would add an event listener here and I would listen for the cancel event here and there I just

38
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:12,210
use an anonymous Erol function to quickly output cancel inside the component.

39
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,450
Then we should see that log once we click the cancel button because now we're listening to the same

40
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,540
element where we dispatched us and indeed here we see cancel inside the component.

41
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,890
So the good thing is dispatching our customer event works.

42
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,390
The bad thing is it is only available on our button.

43
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,060
It doesn't leave our component and that is not ideal.

44
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,040
Let's work on that and I'll comment this out here.

45
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,210
Let's work on this in the next lecture.
