00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.920
So being able to write custom H TO MAIL elements is pretty cool.

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.830
I did mention though that web components is actually a broad term for a couple of specifications that

3
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.370
are built into modern browsers that make up that web components term custom HD hymnal elements is just

4
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.180
one part of that set of specifications.

5
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.790
It's one specification.

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.010
It's arguably the most important one because this defines a couple of features modern browsers exposed

7
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.700
to you and you can use these features in JavaScript then and you will also learn how to make it work

8
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.040
in older browsers and of course so you get this set of features that allows you to register your own

9
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.290
age HTML tags and define some basic logic behind that.

10
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.710
However this alone will not give you great web components and no important specification that makes

11
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.820
up the web components turn is the shadow Dom specification.

12
00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.900
The shadow Dom is all about having a separate Dom a tree of Dom nodes behind your custom element that

13
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.360
is separated from the normal Dom.

14
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.820
This helps you for example with scoping your styles to a custom element so that styling is set up for

15
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.830
your custom element doesn't interfere with other parts of your application.

16
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.180
Really really useful templates and slots is another important part of the specification.

17
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.530
Your Custom element will in the end just be a combination of default H HTML elements because in the

18
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.680
end the browser only knows how to handle this but you can compose them and add styling and add javascript

19
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.690
logic to create more powerful widgets like the modal you saw and you will learn how it works throughout

20
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.800
the course.

21
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.280
Templates and slots are another important specification here because here you define this core structure

22
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.960
behind your element.

23
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.260
So you basically defined a template which is then rendered as a shadow Dom and slots are helpful for

24
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.150
exposing certain entry points like that title we use.

25
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.840
The last lecture does h1 tag.

26
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:07.150
We passed two slot title that allows us to pass dynamic content into our web component so that developers

27
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.190
using our Web components can use them in the set of features that are baked in.

28
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.130
And still if our components once that pass extra content into the component and you will learn all about

29
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.220
that throughout the course as well.

30
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.170
Now last but not least there's no specification you sometimes hear about when hearing about web components

31
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.660
and that is the H HTML imports specification that was meant to be a feature which allows you to import

32
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.560
H2 Mal files into h him l files so that you can define these templates for your components in H2 metal

33
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.020
fans that are dead import dynamically.

34
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.170
Now this is not continued anymore because the industry moved in a direction where we use javascript

35
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.770
for all of that and where we use modern build tools and JavaScript modules to import and export inside

36
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.650
of our JavaScript files and import the h t mail templates as string stair as well.

37
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.160
And this is also the approach you will see in this course and I will explain and show it there.

38
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.900
So it's just important to be aware of these three core features custom elements shadow DRM templates

39
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.180
and slots and we will dive deeply into them and learn all about them and how we use them for the course

40
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.830
of course.
