00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:09,830
Before we now dive deeper into other Javascript topics and there are many other topics left, I think

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,520
it's time to practice programming with classes, with this object oriented approach again,

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,220
though I will say this module is entirely optional,

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,110
if you're not interested in this or if you want to practice a little bit later, you can just skip this

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,560
module and continue to the next one.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:33,770
Now in the next module, we'll actually use the result, the little application we work on from this module

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,800
but of course you'll find the finished app,

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,160
the finished project attached at the beginning of next module, so if you skip this one, you'll not see

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,470
the process, how we got there but you'll get the result and the result will only contain things you already

10
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,070
learned.

11
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:54,500
So skipping this module is possible but if you feel like practicing, I would definitely recommend that

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,160
you dive into it right now with me. In this module, we'll work on this little application, this little demo

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:07,430
here and you will find this starting project attached to this in the next lecture and in the end what

14
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:13,580
you'll find there is what we always worked with, an HTML file with some content in there, some styles and an empty

15
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,710
script file and we'll work on this script file, we'll populate it with some life and we'll make sure that

16
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:25,490
we can click the finished button or the activate button and move items around from box A, from the active

17
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,740
projects box to the finished projects box and the other way around.

18
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,790
So nothing too fancy but plenty of opportunities to practice a lot of the things we learned thus far.
