1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,840
So we want to be able to show that modal and for Dad need a way to control the visibility of the backdrop

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,010
and the modal.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,800
Now there are various ways of doing so.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,980
In CSX we can set the opacity.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,390
We can set the display property.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,330
Anything like that.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,760
What we will need in the end is some way to pass in the information whether it is should be visible

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,500
or not from outside.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,810
So from our main document because one possible way would be to set let's say a open attribute even a

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:41,840
set this to true or as you also see it on some built in elements just open for example the built in

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:50,000
button element has a disabled attribute which you also add just like this so when open or opened maybe

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,300
is added let's say then we want to show the modal if it's not added We don't want to show it.

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,550
And now I'll add a script tag here and you could outsource this into a different file to of course where

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,440
I want to do something when this button is clicked and I want to add this opened attribute when we click

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,520
it.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,110
So I will now get access to my confirmed button here maybe by using document queries selector and I

17
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:21,980
can selector select a button here because a no advantage of the shadow Dom we will just fetch this button

18
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:29,360
because the buttons in our model are part of the shadow Dom and therefore we are in no danger of accidentally

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,650
selecting these from outside.

20
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,020
So that's another advantage of the shadow Dom here.

21
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,470
When we select something in our main document we only select buttons in that main document.

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,230
And in this case we only have one button so I can use this query selector and then I'll add my event

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:56,820
listener here for the Click event and here I want to add the opened attribute to my you see modal element

24
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,640
for this all get access to my modal with document queries selector and now we can simply use U.S. modal

25
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,630
as a selector because this is a valid tag by which we can select it and then we could say modal set

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:21,340
attribute opened and now we need to assign a value here and I'll set this to an empty string now in

27
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,610
order to be able to see that effect we have to make sure that we're not showing the model by default

28
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:34,450
which we currently are and especially its backdrop is blocking us from clicking anything so to hide

29
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:43,810
it by default we got a couple of possible ways of solving this one way of making sure we can show and

30
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:52,200
hide this is to set the opacity to 0 by default which will hide this but then we'll face a problem actually

31
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,140
because now if I reload this it is hidden but we still can't click this because even though it's invisible

32
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:06,330
it's fully opaque it's still in front of us now we could changed a set index but we can also set the

33
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,210
pointer events here to non and this will not accept any clicks on the backdrop but let them through

34
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,200
instead we do the same on the modal and we just have to change this later when we show it.

35
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,740
So did we then really block clicks through it but here we want to allow them.

36
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,890
So now have a reload I can click this and if you watched you saw opened was added here on the right.

37
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:34,170
Let me show this again for reload this model here doesn't have to open attribute but if I click this

38
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,790
button watch it here on the right here it is there it opened.

39
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,580
So this is working and now in the next lecture we can work on doing something in our component.

40
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,860
When this opened attribute is added.
