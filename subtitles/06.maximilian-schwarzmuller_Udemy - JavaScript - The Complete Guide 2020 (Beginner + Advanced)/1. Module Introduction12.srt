00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,090
So let's dive right into Javascript, into its core syntax and some core features which you'll need in

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,200
any Javascript program you're going to write, specifically in this course module,

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,600
we'll have a look at the core syntax, so how you write

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,520
valid Javascript code. We'll explore variables and understand what we use them for, how we create them,

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,830
how we use them in our program and with which kind of data we can work in our program.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,090
We'll have a look at operators,

7
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:42,270
so how we can actually run calculations and execute some code by combining values and by doing something

8
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,360
useful

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:51,060
and we'll also explore and use functions, an important language construct which you'll find in actually

10
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,240
pretty much any programming language you can work with

11
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,500
and therefore it's also part of Javascript and

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,400
here we'll have a look at what functions are, why we use them and how we use them and we'll do all

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,110
of that,

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,690
all these things in the context of a basic application we're working on where we can also see something

15
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:14,970
on the screen and where we see these things come together in a real life example.
