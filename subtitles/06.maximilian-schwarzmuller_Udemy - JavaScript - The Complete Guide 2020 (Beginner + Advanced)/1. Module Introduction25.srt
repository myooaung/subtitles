00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,740
In this course we wrote a lot of code and we tested a lot of code of course.

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:12,380
We always tested it manually by simply clicking around in our web application.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,400
In this module here, we'll dive into automated testing,

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,870
that means we'll write code which will actually test our code,

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,930
so code that runs to run other code and evaluate the results.

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,190
This is indeed what this module will be about,

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,690
we'll dive into what exactly testing is and why we use it,

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:38,060
we'll have a look at different kinds of tests namely unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests

9
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:45,080
and we'll also explore how we can test both synchronous and asynchronous code and in general, get a thorough

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,300
introduction into the world of testing.
