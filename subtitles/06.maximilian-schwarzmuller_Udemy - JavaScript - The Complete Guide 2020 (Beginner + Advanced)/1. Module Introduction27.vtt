00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.240
This is now an import and a bit more advanced module for all this course you learn a lot about JavaScript

2
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.140
and a lot about the important things that make up the language.

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.770
Now if you want to be a developer no matter if it's JavaScript or something else you also need to be

4
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:26.750
able to solve more or less complex problems and therefore you need to be able to work out algorithms

5
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.180
and work with data structures.

6
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.170
Or as I also like to put it you need to be able to think logically and also to find the best solution

7
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.010
for a given problem.

8
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.300
This is what this module is about and you could easily create an entire course about data structures

9
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.350
and algorithms.

10
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.550
As it turns out and does of course is not the goal here but this will be a introductory module where

11
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.210
we dive into this topic quite deeply.

12
00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.390
So did you know how to get started and build upon this to learn all you need to learn about that topic.

13
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.230
Now what specifically is inside this module though.

14
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.940
We'll have a look at the what and why.

15
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.260
What exactly are algorithms and data structures and why do we need them.

16
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.850
But then of course we'll all learn about them learn some example algorithms and also explore how we

17
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.100
can compare different solutions against each other.

18
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.660
For Dad we'll dive into something which is called time complexity and the Big O notation does will help

19
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.050
us measure the performance you could say of an algorithm and will help us make the decision on the best

20
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.480
algorithm the best solution for a given problem.

21
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.190
Well and of course we'll have a look at a couple of examples.

22
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.170
We'll build a couple of algorithms to gather from scratch.

23
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.600
So did you get a feeling for how it is works and how you should think about us to solve common problems

24
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.530
stair well.

25
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.170
With that.

26
00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.200
Let's dive right in and understand what exact the algorithms and data structures are and why we need

27
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.470
them.
