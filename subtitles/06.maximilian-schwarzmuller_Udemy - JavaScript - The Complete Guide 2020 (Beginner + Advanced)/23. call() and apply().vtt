00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.750
Back to the code we worked on before.

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.910
Bind is a really useful function or method to be precise which you will use quite often as a Javascript

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.490
developer to prepare your to-be-called functions which you don't call yourselves.

4
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.340
Now, there are similar functions which you often find when you research the bind method and that is

5
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.760
the call and the apply method.

6
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:32.560
Now essentially, they also allow you to specify what should be passed in as parameters but they also

7
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.120
immediately execute the function and that's of course not what bind does, this prepares the function.

8
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.860
Apply and call immediately execute the function and there also is a difference between apply and call

9
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.270
but since also this part with immediate the executing a function isn't really helpful to us right

10
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.320
now because we can always call a function like this if we want to immediately execute it, we'll ignore

11
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.730
apply and call for now and dive into them later when we actually understand what their use is, there's

12
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.780
not much sense in doing this right now.

13
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.460
Just wanted to already throw their names in there so that you are aware of them

14
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.170
if you research on your own and you stumble over them. Bind is really useful for us right now and of

15
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.950
the three, the one which you will use the most often because being able to prepare functions is really

16
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.330
really valuable.
