00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.430
So of course this was just a start,

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.510
we got more dependencies, we got more files. Tooltip does have no other dependency as far as I can tell

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.410
but project item for example has tooltip as a dependency.

4
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.300
Now we can still work with multiple imports as we currently do but actually, I really want to switch

5
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.750
to a module-only setup. So I'll comment out

6
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.800
all these imports here, also the DOM helper and I'll only leave the app.js import here as our root

7
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.540
entry point.

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.540
Now that of course breaks everything

9
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.450
and now we therefore have to switch to modules entirely.

10
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.800
So let's start our way from the bottom up,

11
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.160
let's start in app.js because that's our entry file,

12
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.990
this will be the file that is loaded first.

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.710
What do we have in there?

14
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.330
We're using project list here,

15
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.940
so project list is a dependency of this app class in the app.js file.

16
00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.140
So we should go to the project list Javascript file and export project list here.

17
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.140
Now with that, we can go back to app.js and here, simply import this.

18
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:13.570
So we add an import of project list between curly braces from the app folder and there from projectlist.js.

19
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.990
Now with that, we make project list, we make this class available in this app.js file and

20
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.210
therefore this line works again.

21
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.380
So if we now save that, we'll see that we'll get a different error,

22
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.700
now project item is not defined.

23
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.780
This error is stemming from project list and that makes sense,

24
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.030
we're able to get the project list into the app file

25
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.320
so now the Javascript code execution moves on to project list and tries to run all that code, set up

26
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.730
this class and it of course will see that project item is simply not known to this file because this

27
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.010
is a dependency of project list which we're not stating yet.

28
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.440
So let's go to project item and as before, export project item and then go to project list again and

29
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.470
import it, import project item from

30
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.830
and now it's in the same folder,

31
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.510
so just ./projectitem.js

32
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:16.720
If we do this and we save that, we get a different error, project item doesn't find the DOM helper.

33
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.860
So let's go to project item,

34
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.080
make sure we import the DOM helper by first of all going to the DOM helper,

35
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:32.830
exporting it and then here, let's go back to project item and in this file, import from, go up one level,

36
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.980
go into the utility folder, then DOM helper

37
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.150
and here I want to import the DOM helper class, so that this is available in project item.

38
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.880
I also already know that I'll need the tooltip,

39
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.000
so let's go to tooltip.js and actually export the tooltip and you can have an import in a file and an

40
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.630
export at the same time as well,

41
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.230
we already did this in project list, this is of course

42
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.810
absolutely

43
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.450
OK

44
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.950
and here I'm exporting the tooltip. Now in project item, we can therefore not just import DOM helper but

45
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.240
simply in a new line, add another import from another file.

46
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.160
So here import from the tooltip.js

47
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.260
this tooltip class here

48
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.000
and if we do that and we save this and we then reload, we just got an error regarding the DOM helper,

49
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.610
yes because I forgot to 

50
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.060
.js here, let's fix this in this import,

51
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.880
let's now retry and now this works again

52
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.080
but if I drag and drop, I still get an error that in project list I also use the DOM helper.

53
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.810
So forgot to import it there,

54
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.000
so let's switch over to projectlist.js, this by the way also shows the advantage of having multiple

55
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.580
files,

56
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.300
it's super easy to find the failing part

57
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:53.750
and here we can also import DOM helper from the utility folder and then DOMhelper.js.

58
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.460
So let's save that,

59
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.540
make sure all files are saved and then reload again, try switching this and it works.

60
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.420
So this is now how we can use modules,

61
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.290
now there are more features related to them but this is the starting point. It's super important of course

62
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:19.510
because this really allows us to structure our code in a more readable way and every file defines its

63
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.910
dependencies on its own, so that you don't have to micromanage imports here.
