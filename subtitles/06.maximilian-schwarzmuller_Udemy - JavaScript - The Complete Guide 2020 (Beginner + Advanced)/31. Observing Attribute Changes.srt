1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,800
So with the styling cleaned up a little bit.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,530
Let's come back to some key functionalities we can add inside of our web components.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,390
And there is one thing which we haven't done at all thus far thus far.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:21,420
The text for our tooltip always was set statically which means we assigned it through this attribute

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:21,840
here.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,490
But there was no way of changing that at runtime.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,510
Now I do want to change it and for that I of course need some logic that allows me to change it.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,320
I'll simply do it in the developer tools for now because there you have to keep in mind that I can of

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,050
course click into that text here.

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,420
Double click on it and I can set this to some new text but if I do so in a hover over it as we still

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,380
see the old text because it changes to attributes are not picked up inside of the web component.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,380
And I want to highlight here that when I change this manually into developer tools this is no different

13
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,600
to this being changed through some javascript code for example and that of course would be the more

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,020
realistic use case for your application where you for example listen to some user input and the text

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,050
entered by the user should end up here India attribute and I'm just not doing that here because it requires

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,770
some extra boilerplate code that has nothing to do with web components.

17
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,960
So we'll just do that through manual editing you're in the developer tools.

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,020
The problem is that right now our changes don't get picked up and that is what I want to change for

19
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,970
changing this.

20
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,410
I'll have to go back to my tooltip jazz file

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,600
and there I can add a new lifecycle hook which I did mentioned earlier in this course.

22
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:57,080
Do you remember which one that was it was the attribute change callback this executes when an observed

23
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:04,310
attribute is updated and that observed part is going to become important by the way so let's add this

24
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:13,630
year let's add the attribute changed callback method here and this method actually receives free arguments.

25
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,830
The name of the attribute which changed the old value of that attribute.

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,760
And now the new value now in there for now to keep it simple it's simply output this so all console

27
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,610
log to name the old value and the new value.

28
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,110
And if I do that the expectation would be that when I reload this page and I come in here and change

29
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:43,080
that text to something you if we didn't go to our console we see output there but this is actually empty.

30
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:50,540
And the reason for that is that on the slide I deliberately wrote observed attributes trigger this and

31
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,200
we're not observing any attributes right now.

32
00:02:53,270 --> 00:03:00,380
This is simply a performance optimization javascript forces us to implement it does not by default watch

33
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,930
all the attributes of this element because there might be a lot of elements which can change which you

34
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,910
don't care about in your component.

35
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,980
Let's say you're changing a class which you only use in the light Dom you're not interested in that

36
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,870
class instead of the component then.

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,360
So why would you watch for changes or maybe you are interested in the class instead of the component

38
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,080
but only because you use it the styles here.

39
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,040
Well that will be picked up automatically then but if you don't want to run any logic in JavaScript

40
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,440
there's no need to trigger this.

41
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:37,700
So to get something into this callback or to trigger this call like where a specific attribute you have

42
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,700
to tell javascript that you're watching it and you do inform javascript that you do care about a certain

43
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:49,010
attribute by adding a special property to your class here.

44
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:57,260
You do this by adding the static keyword static simply means that it is property or in this case it

45
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:04,910
will be a getter function that can be called from outside without creating this class or an object based

46
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,160
on the class first.

47
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,640
You don't have to care about that though because you will not be creating it.

48
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:15,260
Then you add to get keyword which simply means this is now a function that will return you a value but

49
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:22,420
you can't reassign a value to the property of this class which is hidden behind that getter and then

50
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,720
the name has to be observed attributes.

51
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,400
And this is now written as a normal function or method here.

52
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,640
Now again might look a bit strange if you've never heard about getters and setters and if you're brand

53
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:40,580
new to object oriented programming in general the idea here is that this is like a property of this

54
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,360
class.

55
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,860
So like something we initialized with this in here.

56
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,980
But it's not.

57
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,810
It is accessible from outside.

58
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,900
And more importantly it's not suitable from outside.

59
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,960
You can only get the value here.

60
00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:01,340
So this is like a locked down property and in there you return an array with all the attribute names

61
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,960
you want to listen to changes.

62
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:12,260
So here I simply add text I and I add texture as a string because I have my text attribute here.

63
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:19,290
It could of course also add class if it wanted to listen to changes to the class attribute or whichever

64
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,050
other attributes you might have but you should only add to your what you really care about.

65
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:32,250
And now with this added I can save doesn't go back to my application if I reload now and edit this text

66
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:41,610
again to something new and I go to the console now we see output here we actually see too because when

67
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,690
I first clicked into it and deleted the content it registered this as a change too.

68
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:52,200
This is the change we just applied and there we see the name of the attribute because remember I am

69
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,490
simply logging the name and then the old value and then the new value.

70
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,040
So here we see the name of the attribute that changed.

71
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,590
That was the text attribute we see the old value that was this text and we see the new value which I

72
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:11,160
entered this one and now with that we finally have a way of adjusting the code or the text we see here

73
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,280
when we hover over this and we'll do that in the next lecture.
