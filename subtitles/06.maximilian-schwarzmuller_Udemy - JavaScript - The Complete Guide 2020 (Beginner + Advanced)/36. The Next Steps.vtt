00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.290
With all the core basics out of the way let's dive into building more complex components or one more

2
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.900
complex component in this module we'll build a modal component.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.870
So like a did this pop up this overlay inside of a page with a nice backdrop behind it where we can

4
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.310
pass our own content into it and which we can all configure.

5
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.630
For example where we can control from outside where it's shown or not.

6
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.740
We'll also learn how we can dispatch our own events from inside our web component so that we can react

7
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.590
to these custom events outside of it and we'll see a lot of the features you already learn about in

8
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.680
the last modules in action too.

9
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.200
So a great practice as well as many exciting new features.

10
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.000
Let's dive in.
