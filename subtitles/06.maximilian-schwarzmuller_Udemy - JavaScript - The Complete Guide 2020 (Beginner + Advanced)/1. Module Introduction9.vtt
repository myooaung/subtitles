00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.110
This will be a super important module,

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:11.230
well obviously all modules are important but this module will be about asynchronous code and that's

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.890
a really important concept in programming in general

4
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:22.030
but of course therefore also in Javascript. Thus far, almost all the code we worked with was so-called

5
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.410
synchronous code and I'll come back to what that exactly is in this module.

6
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.590
We also sometimes already worked with asynchronous code without really recognizing it

7
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.230
and in this module we'll take a closer look at that. In detail, we'll find what exactly asynchronous or

8
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.750
async code is and how it differs from synchronous code and what that would be

9
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.270
and we'll have a look at how we can deal with asynchronous code with the help of callbacks, something

10
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.320
we learned about already and something we already did use, with the help of promises,

11
00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.640
something we have not learned about yet which we'll dive into this module and how we can utilize another

12
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.940
syntax using two special keywords - async and await which we also haven't worked with yet.

13
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.750
So plenty of new knowledge,

14
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.940
let's dive right in.
