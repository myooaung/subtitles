00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.870
Now being able to add elements is of course nice,

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.790
sometimes you also want to remove them.

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.870
Now with replace with, we are able to remove them

4
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.910
but of course only to replace an element with a brand new one. To just get rid of it,

5
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.930
we of course also have ways. Now for that, I reloaded this document and here, let's say we want to get rid of

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.910
that entire list.

7
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.410
So I'll again select it with document query selector ul, ul as a string

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.150
and now to get rid of it, there are two ways.

9
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.640
One is to use list.remove

10
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.180
and this will just do what it sounds like,

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.210
it removes the list from the DOM,

12
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.870
so from the rendered page. Now good old MDN,

13
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.370
if we check the remove method there shows us however that Internet Explorer again is not too fond of

14
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.940
this method

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.610
so if you want to ensure that this works there as well, you can't really use remove there. All other

16
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.700
browsers have great support so you can definitely use it there

17
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.480
but if you need to support this like this in Internet Explorer, then another way of making this work is

18
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.640
to select the item you want to delete and then you reach out to the parent element,

19
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.590
so the element node above the item you want to delete and there you have a remove child method and to

20
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.770
that, you pass the item which you want to delete, list in this case and it will also work. Remove child

21
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.320
is supported in all browsers, just like append child and therefore, this is the safest way of removing

22
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.230
an element, reaching out to its parent and then remove child and then passing the item you want to remove

23
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.000
but again, remove also has pretty good support.

24
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.330
If Internet Explorer support doesn't matter for you, then just remove on the item you want to remove

25
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.900
just like this is of course the shorter and the recommended way.
