00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.280
And with that

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.080
that's it for this module.

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.690
We learned a lot about browsers support, what it is, how we can plan our application for it, how we should

4
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.080
analyze the market and which resources you can use to find out which feature is supported by which browser

5
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.600
and which market share that feature has.

6
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.280
You then learned about different techniques like feature detection with fallback code,

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.340
you learned about polyfills which you can add manually or combined with transpilation, another cool

8
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.180
feature you learn about can be done automatically,

9
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.590
how Babel loader which transpiles your code so that modern Javascript code can be written and still

10
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.470
works in older browsers and that it does not just compile that code but also automatically add polyfills

11
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.220
for features you might need.

12
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.940
And with all of that, you of course have a couple of things to watch out for, to keep in mind

13
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.120
but that is just what web development is all about,

14
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.840
it is about writing good code, code that also works on older browsers

15
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.670
If you need to support that audience and you therefore have all the tools now you need to really write

16
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.360
Javascript applications where you can leverage modern features and still ensure that everything works

17
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.500
in one way or the other in older browsers as well.
