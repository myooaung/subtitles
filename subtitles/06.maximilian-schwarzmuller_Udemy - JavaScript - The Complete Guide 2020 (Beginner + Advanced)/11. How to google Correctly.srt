1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,310
Now what if you don't remember the exact name of something and you still want to learn more about it?

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,830
Well let's say we don't know that it's called parseInt,

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:17,510
then googling this correctly would be that you type Javascript, to kind of narrow down what you're interested

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,690
in,

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,610
in this case the Javascript language and then convert string to number

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:29,440
and if we do that, then here automatically even Google gives us a hint that parseInt probably is helpful

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,120
but we also find more. If we scroll down here, we got parseInt already,

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,400
we also will find something on Stack Overflow which is the kind of official development forum where

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,880
you find a lot of discussions.

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,140
You can also ask questions on your own here

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,990
but many problems have already been solved and can be found here

12
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,640
and therefore you can find solutions here by just googling correctly.

13
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,260
Here you find one suggestion with this number thing which we haven't seen

14
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:02,120
but then here you also find parseInt again or this plus operator which already showed you in this

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,570
course as well.

16
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,410
So that's really helpful and this is what I mean with Googling correctly, first put Javascript so that

17
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:15,980
Google only shows you results that are kind of related to that and then try to describe the problem

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:23,150
you're having with only a couple of keywords. Don't write sentences here which you would speak

19
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:29,210
to another human but instead use keywords, important keywords that narrow down your issue and this

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,910
normally helps you find discussions where that problem has been discussed or it give you a link to MDN

21
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,840
or comparable sites right away.

22
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,680
So this is also how you should think about solving problems here and about finding help.
