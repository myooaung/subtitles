00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:09.620
So now we had a detailed look at how we can create autonomous web components by extending a simple element.

2
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.030
Let me also show you that alternative way which I mentioned where you can create web components by basing

3
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.540
them on specific built in components or H2 male elements I should say.

4
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:31.030
And for that I will create a new mode and all created in a new JavaScript file which I'll name confirm

5
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.470
link J.S. now in there.

6
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.790
I will create a new class and I'll name this confirmed link as well.

7
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.430
And here I want to extend the H team l anchor tech element.

8
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.870
Now the HCM male anchor tag element belongs to d a HD female element.

9
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.620
So to this age wrath here.

10
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.960
Now here we could be forwarding the user to Google dot com Google.

11
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:11.160
And obviously if we were Lotus and we click this link we are forwarded to that page.

12
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.010
Now the idea is that we wrap this in our own Web component or that we create a web component based on

13
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.180
that anchor tag which still has all the functionalities of the built in anchor tag so which still takes

14
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:35.300
the ref attribute and forwards us but which in addition asks us if we really want to go there before

15
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.730
redirecting us.

16
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.870
And this is a use case you could certainly have on a Web page where you want to have links leading to

17
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:49.550
external resources where you want to ask the user before really well forwarding the user.

18
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:57.260
Now for that here in confirmed link all ads D connected callback right away don't need to constructor

19
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.780
review right now.

20
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.540
Just once you have the callback and they are a want to register a click listener on this element.

21
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.120
So on the anchor tag which I am INDY end Extending here we could set up a shadow Dom here and that is

22
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.970
really important.

23
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.800
I'm not doing it here because I don't need it but when extending a specific element you can use all

24
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.660
the same features we used here in the tooltip so you can attach a shadow root.

25
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.640
You can add your own template.

26
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.970
You can do all these things here to here.

27
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.450
I just happen to not need anything off that I want to keep all the default look and behavior and all

28
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.130
of that.

29
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.200
I just want to add an extra click listener and I do that here and a connected callback by adding an

30
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.790
event listener and by adding it's directly to the this keyword I added to my custom element which extends

31
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.080
this built in element and I add my click listener here.

32
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.650
And when this click happens then I will execute a function.

33
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.620
And here I will use e as six arrow function which takes an argument.

34
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.060
The default event object which will be created by the JavaScript engine by the browser so to say.

35
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.460
And then here I have that function body which gets executed.

36
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.390
Now we could also assign some method of this clause which you create here.

37
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.390
But here I want to keep it really simple.

38
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.960
I just have this function which gets executed upon a click.

39
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:38.600
And what I want to do here is I want to check is confirm confirm is a method or a function built into

40
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.180
javascript it's a globally available function where I ask Do you really want to leave.

41
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:54.230
And if this is yes then confirm or if the user clicks Yes then this will return true if this is not

42
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.290
the case and hence I add exclamation mark.

43
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.760
So if the user clicks cancel or doesn't confirm this then I want to stop the default behavior.

44
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.430
I don't want to forward the user and therefore on the incoming event object I can call prevent default

45
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.510
to suppress the default behavior which would be to well basically redirect the user to the target of

46
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.600
the link which would be the default behavior of an anchor tag now with that created we just need to

47
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.510
define it.

48
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.040
So again we'll use custom elements and there to define method and justice before we now choose our own

49
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.490
selector our own tag for that element.

50
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:44.610
And just as for the tooltip we still should use a name which has a dash in it and which also has some

51
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.290
unique prefix.

52
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.850
So you're all again use you see and then confirmed link.

53
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:59.130
For example the second argument then is are a confirmed link class here which extends to h t male anchor

54
00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.640
element.

55
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:08.340
So just as before but now since we don't extend H to male element but is specific H2 male element the

56
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:15.060
anchor element and dead would be the case no matter if we extend the anchor or a paragraph or an image

57
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:22.890
or whatever this whenever we extend a specific element and not the generic H to male element.

58
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.080
So when ever we have such a specific element we need to parse third arguments here which is an object

59
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.890
where I set extends to the tag off the element we extend in this case it's an anchor element.

60
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.620
So we have to use the A tack here.

61
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:48.990
So our custom element extends deep bolt in anger tag D A element and now with that we can go to the

62
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.600
index h t metal file and in there I first of all want to import this.

63
00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:01.050
So I will copy that import and added import to confirm link J.S. and now at the bottom here instead

64
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.050
of my anchor tag like this I want to use my custom element.

65
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:12.240
Now when extending a built in element you don't use your custom element as you did before by placing

66
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.970
your own tag here.

67
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:22.440
Instead you keep the original tag so the anchor tag to a tag but you add and you attribute the is attribute

68
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.700
and the value of that attribute now is your custom selector here.

69
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.340
So that is how you use web component or a custom element based on a built in element like the anchor

70
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.030
of this case.

71
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.140
So now I say is you see confirmed link on the anchor tag.

72
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:46.710
And with that if I now safeties and I reload that when I click this link I get asked if I really want

73
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:54.390
to leave if I click cancel then I stay here because if I click cancel we basically execute this code

74
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.770
and we prevent default.

75
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.360
Hence the navigation is cancelled if I click ok instead.

76
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.560
Then we proceed as before and that is pretty cool.

77
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:14.610
This is a cool example for how you could extend a built in element keep all its style and all its functionality.

78
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.000
Though as I mentioned you could replace for example the look by adding your own shadow Dom and your

79
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.010
own template.

80
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:28.190
But here I'm just adding a little bit of functionality to all of a sudden have a brand new element based

81
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.830
on that original built in element.
