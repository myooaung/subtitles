00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.330
You learned a lot about the Javascript syntax, the core Javascript features and how to write amazing

2
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.250
Javascript driven applications, both on the frontend

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.660
so in the browser, as well as with Node.js on the server side.

4
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.480
Now one topic we haven't really touched on thus far or haven't read talked too much about is security

5
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.110
and of course security matters. In this module,

6
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.250
I want to highlight what you should watch out for when writing Javascript code and some common pitfalls

7
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.940
or some important things you need to keep in mind

8
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.780
to ensure that your code is secure and you're not exposing security relevant data or anything like that

9
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.500
in your scripts and so on. Specifically, we'll have a look at potential security holes and things to watch

10
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.620
out for when writing Javascript code, I'll of course also let you know how you can protect your code

11
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.440
or which steps you can take to ensure your code is protected.

12
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.780
We'll have a look at some common attack patterns or security concepts like CORS which I already talked

13
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.810
about but which I will repeat here,

14
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.260
CSRF and most importantly XSS which stands for cross site scripting attacks and I'll also have

15
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.670
a look at npm packages or third-party libraries in general again because these as it turns out can also

16
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.710
lead to security issues.

17
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.480
So now let's not waste any time and

18
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.380
let's have a look at what you should be aware of and how you can secure your code.
