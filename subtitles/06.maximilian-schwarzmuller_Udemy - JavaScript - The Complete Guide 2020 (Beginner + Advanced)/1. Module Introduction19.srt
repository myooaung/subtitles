1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,290
This will be an interesting module,

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:12,600
it's about meta programming or to be precise, it's about symbols, iterator and generators, the reflect

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,200
API and the proxy API

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:21,210
and these are all very niche and advanced Javascript features which you will,

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,820
to be honest, not use that often.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,420
I would say they are most interesting to library authors,

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,920
so if you're building a Javascript package what you plan on sharing with other people, either by sharing

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,820
it on npm or even if it's just an internal, a company internal package, then some of these features might

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:49,470
come in handy because all these features basically have in common that you can make life easier for

10
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,430
other developers.

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,370
So these are Javascript features but they're not like adding a click listener to a button which does something

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,600
which your end users will in the end have something from, right,

13
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,170
because they can click on a button and something happens,

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,690
no these are features which the end allow you to change the way certain parts of the code behave or

15
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:18,390
work and they allow you to improve code safety, not from a security standpoint but from an API standpoint

16
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,710
where you can for example make sure that the objects or the functions you expose to other developers are

17
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,300
used properly.

18
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,840
These are basically the things these features help you with,

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,210
so we'll have a look at them in this module so that you heard about them, that you get the general idea

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,960
but you will probably not use them every day in all your projects.

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,290
Still, if you encounter them or if you are building some third-party library or you're working in a very

22
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,620
advanced projects, then these features might come in handy.
