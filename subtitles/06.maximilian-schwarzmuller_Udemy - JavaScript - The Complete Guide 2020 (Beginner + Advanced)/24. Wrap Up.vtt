1
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.700
So that's it for functions, quite a lot of content, quite a lot of different ways of creating and configuring

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.200
and using functions.

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.140
You learned about the function expression syntax, with the function keyword or with the arrow function.

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:22.440
You learned how arrow functions work and the different ways of using them, different ways of shortening

5
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.080
the code which is always nice. You learned about default arguments which can be quite handy,

6
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.020
same is true for rest parameters which allows you to merge parameters together into an array which you

7
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.920
then can use and both default arguments and rest parameters or rest arguments are really great features

8
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.820
for allowing you to write more reusable or more flexible functions that can be used in different ways.

9
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.190
You also learned about bind which is super important for preparing functions, which you're not executing

10
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.570
on your own but which will be executed on your behalf,

11
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.510
like for example with an event listener or as here in your own function where do you use this callback

12
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.050
function pattern, where you receive a function as an argument which you then call from inside that function.

13
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.690
We also touched on functions being created inside of functions, something which you can do which you

14
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.330
don't need to do that often right now and which we'll dive deeper into later, also dive into performance

15
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.780
implications and so on

16
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.500
once we're a little bit more advanced with Javascript. For now I'd say that's more than enough, a lot

17
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.180
of function features covered which you'll of course see throughout the course here and then and which

18
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.370
you will also probably need in some of your projects and see in other project you might be participating

19
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.970
in or you're analyzing.

20
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:48.240
So with that, more core features learned, let's go ahead and dive deeper into Javascript and actually

21
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.160
leave the pure syntax part here because we're already pretty good on that and instead now

22
00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.980
also have a look at how we can actually interact with the webpage, something I previously always provided

23
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.660
to you,

24
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.250
I always gave you that connection,

25
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.220
now it's time for us to learn how that actually works.
