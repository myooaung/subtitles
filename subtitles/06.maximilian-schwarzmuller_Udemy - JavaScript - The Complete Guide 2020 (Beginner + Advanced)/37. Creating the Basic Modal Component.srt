1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,390
So let's start building that modal component.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:13,280
And for that I have a brand new project just an eight file with that basic HMO five skeleton no script

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,570
files nothing there I will now add my modal jazz file where I want to create that code for that modal

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,010
web component.

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,410
Now throughout this module always feel free to post a video and try something on your own.

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,300
If we're working on a certain feature where you feel like hey I can do that on my own.

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,010
Definitely pause and tried on your own.

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:41,180
Otherwise just code along and you will see many of the things we covered in the last lectures and modules

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:48,740
and this module should therefore also help with really understanding all these pieces and see how they

10
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,020
come together.

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:57,140
So in modal jazz I will start by creating a new component class with the class keyword and I will name

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:05,210
it modal and I will extend the H html element so not extend an existing H Tim l element like a div or

13
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,330
anything like that.

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:15,020
I'll start from scratch here now before I add any content here any logic I will also register this with

15
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:24,130
custom elements define all name and you see modal that will be my tag and I point at this modal class.

16
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,920
Now with that added I'll go to the index H Tim I'll file and there as before at these script import

17
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:39,800
to the modal jazz file and thereafter we can added here you see modal as our own H Tim Al tag in the

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,290
body off this template and later we'll also add some logic so that we have to click a button to show

19
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,040
it and hide it but that will all come later.

20
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:54,680
For now let's start adding some content to this modal and I'll start with the constructor where we always

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,500
have to call super first.

22
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,150
Now in a year I will set up this general template for this modal and for dad as you learned.

23
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,290
We want to create a shadow Dom.

24
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,440
Now as you also learned this is of course not a hard requirement.

25
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:17,660
We can create custom elements without the shadow Dom but the shadow Dom gives us many advantages and

26
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,140
therefore I definitely want to use is here.

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:27,470
So I will call this attach shadow and set the demoed to open as always.

28
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:34,910
And now we can use the shadow route to start setting our inner H Tim L so the template so to say the

29
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,680
H team L code office custom component that is hidden away from the light Dom.

30
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:47,530
Now I want to create a modal and this will actually consist of two major parts.

31
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:55,640
For one I will have a death with a C S as class of backdrop could also be an ideal backdrop if you prefer

32
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,210
that.

33
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:03,110
And this will be the part behind the modal which will grey out the rest of the page whilst a modal is

34
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:11,140
in the foreground and the other part D for is of course the modal itself and again here I'm using a

35
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,790
class of a modal.

36
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:19,030
Actually let's use the I.D. because we can be that specific here and selecting an idea is actually a

37
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,490
bit faster than selecting a class.

38
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,190
So from a CSX perspective it is a bit better.

39
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:31,570
And now let me also add style tags here so that we can style all the components or all the elements

40
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,640
we'll have in the modal and I will start with some rough styling and with the rough layout and later

41
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,390
we'll add more and more feature to that model like different slot areas and so on.

42
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,390
Something we haven't covered yet we'll learn it in this module.

43
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,480
So let's start building that model.

44
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,810
And first of all here I'll select the backdrop and I'll set a style for that backdrop.

45
00:03:52,810 --> 00:04:00,670
Now the style for this backdrop will be that it has a position of fixed from the top of the page and

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,890
the way this is positioned in the index H2 mouthful fall directly in the body.

47
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,580
This will refer to the overall document to the overall page as a container.

48
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,000
So from the top I want to have a distance of zero from the left as well.

49
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,640
And then this backdrop should cover the entire page.

50
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:23,560
So I'll give it a width of one hundred percent and for the height this would not work unless we all

51
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,810
just sets the height of our body and D.H. Kim Il tak to 100 percent.

52
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:35,560
But here we can use 100 we H which stands for a viewport height and also is about the entire height

53
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,520
of our window basically.

54
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:50,180
Now I'll give it a background of RGA and then transparent black color maybe 75 percent opacity so 25

55
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,980
percent transparency here and with that we should have a backdrop in place now since we already import

56
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,330
this.

57
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,120
And we use our tag here.

58
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:08,450
We should be able to reload this page and indeed we now have a grey background and that is the modal

59
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,590
based background.

60
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,040
It's not obvious here but we can confirm this if we simply inspect indie developer tools.

61
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,070
It's this background this Dev.

62
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,910
Your dad is responsible for that.

63
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,020
If I uncheck the background it's gone.

64
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,160
So we see the modal background here.

65
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,380
That's great.

66
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:32,990
And if we had our content on this page and I will add something here please confirm your choice and

67
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:40,560
then we have a button which maybe says show details and confirm whatever you want.

68
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,450
For now reload.

69
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,680
This is hidden behind the modal or behind that backdrop.

70
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,550
So that is working.

71
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,780
Now just one tiny thing so that it's a little bit less ugly.

72
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,030
Let me again set some general styles here.

73
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,950
All set the box sizing of border box for all the elements.

74
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,680
That includes my custom elements by the way.

75
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,070
And for the body I was at a margin of zero.

76
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,020
And I'll set a fun family of sans serif here because I simply prefer that.

77
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,880
And now this looks a bit nicer.

78
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,750
I'll get rid of the margin actually.

79
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:22,520
Let's give this a margin of 2 REM instead so that we have a little bit of margin on the body.

80
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:22,690
Yeah.

81
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,360
Okay.

82
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,250
So this is the general styling the backdrop is in place.

83
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,980
Now let's also add the modal style itself in the next lecture.
