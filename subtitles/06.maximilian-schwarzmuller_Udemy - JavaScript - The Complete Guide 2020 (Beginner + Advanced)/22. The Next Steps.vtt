them.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.020
How we can get started building them.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.420
Now did we did that.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.130
I want to dive into some more advanced features or into well the advanced basics you could call it.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.090
So basically into the other things the next steps you need to know about building web components.

7

We'll have a detailed look at how we can work with these slots.

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.560
We already started working with how we can react to changes in our attributes and how we can all do
