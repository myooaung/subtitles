00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,760
This is a groundbreaking course section,

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,650
we'll have a look at Javascript modules and knowing about Javascript modules will

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,020
and this is really no exaggeration,

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,490
change the way you write your Javascript code or your Javascript projects.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,590
It is a super important feature,

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,910
it's natively supported by modern browsers and in the next module, you'll also learn how to build up

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,200
on that and make it work in all browsers

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,530
but let's first of all learn about it,

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:38,250
I'm talking about Javascript modules, a key concept that helps you organize your scripts and writing

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,840
multi-file code. In this module you'll learn what exactly I mean with modules and how that works and

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,010
why we use that

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,310
and of course then you will learn how to use it with many examples showing the different syntaxes you

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,000
can use there.
