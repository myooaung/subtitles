1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,680
So here's our skeleton our HTML page and right now of course no interaction is possible.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,380
Now the first thing that would be great if it worked would be that if I click Add movie we actually

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,770
display and overlay a so-called modal here which is like a pop up but not this alert which is controlled

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,420
by the browser.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:28,270
But a pop up which we create visually in our web page which allows us to enter some movie data and India

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,970
e-mail code.

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,310
We actually already got everything for that.

8
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:38,410
This Dave here this one here this in the end is such a modal has some see us as classes to look nice

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,830
has an I.D. add modal which might come in handy for selecting it later and there.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,190
I also already added a couple of inputs which allow us to add a movie title image URL and a rating which

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,020
we didn't enter a year and then some buttons to either cancel adding that movie which I also want to

12
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:02,320
support or for completing adding that movie would should then added both to a Javascript array but of

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,080
course also output it on the page.

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,600
If he's still down there I have an unordered list with no entries at the moment I want to populate that

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,990
list once we add movies.

16
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,940
So the goal is to show this div.

17
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,830
And of course therefore an important question is why is it not showing at the moment.

18
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,160
Well actually because if we have a look at the as this code in there I added a style to this modal class

19
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,780
which is the class I'm applying here to to stave which sets display to non.

20
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:37,600
Which basically means it's not added to the document flow it's not visible it's not clickable it's like

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,890
it wasn't there.

22
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,070
It's actually part of the DOM as you can tell if you go to the elements tab there you find that modal

23
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,020
but you don't see it anywhere on the screen if I hover over it here if I select that it's also not selected

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,410
on the left because it's well set to display non it's not part of the document flow just off the DOM.

25
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,570
That's important difference because that means we will be able to selected from Javascript and then

26
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:07,100
we can toggle this display style to show it actually there even is an easier way.

27
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,940
There is this visible class which we can add to a modal which will set display to block and also play

28
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,720
a nice little animation to faded it and to slide it in.

29
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,400
So actually our goal will be to make sure that when we click to add movie button we reach out to distaff

30
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,630
here with the idea add modal and we then add this visible class.

31
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:34,090
These are all things we of course learn so here already is a great place to pause and try this on your

32
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,720
own.

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:42,350
But of course after this short pause which I give you two pause to video we'll do it together so let's

34
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,240
try it together.

35
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,890
And we got two steps with which we should start.

36
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:53,720
We need to get access to this add modal diff and we can do this with the I.D. We could also try to do

37
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,140
it with a class selector though you should be careful because we also got a number modal here a number

38
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,390
div with the exact same classes.

39
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,650
So since is the first thing with these classes we would be able to use Carberry selector to select by

40
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,870
class because Clarice lecturer selects the first matching element but later when we need to access the

41
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,750
second modal for example we'll definitely need to use the I.D. or come up with some arbitrary unique

42
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,830
selection criteria.

43
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:26,720
So here I will actually go for the I.D. and selected by that and you also mustn't forget that we all

44
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,240
need to get access to this button so that we can add an event listener and for this if we scroll down

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:38,480
we can have a look here's the header and there is this ad movie button so we all probably want to select

46
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,840
this now we'll have to see how we can select it because this button has no idea or anything like that.

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,880
Now of course we can always add an idea and it might be a good idea give us some unique ideas which

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:55,270
we have used anywhere else on the page but also to practice the different ways of selecting stuff.

49
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,960
I will also use a different approach of selecting this button.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,860
Now let's start with the modal though and let's go to app yes and then they're all at a constant because

51
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:11,450
I'll never assign a new value and I'll give it a name of ad movie modal the name of course is fully

52
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,430
up to you but it should describe what you store in this constant it here.

53
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,550
I mean you end storing a reference too.

54
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:24,230
Well my modal so to this overlay which you can add and it is the modal for adding a movie so I will

55
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,320
name it ad movie model seems like a fitting name to me.

56
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:35,030
Now we can elected with document and now we can use get element by I.D. because our model here has an

57
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,700
idea add modal.

58
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:43,080
So that is probably the most reasonable way of selecting it as an alternative to that just to all to

59
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,080
show this we could all use Kaveri selector and then we just have to add a hash here because a query

60
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,450
selector wants to see as a selector here.

61
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,610
This would work as well would all the selected this tends to have a bit better performance though for

62
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:01,130
disappeared really won't matter for most apps you'll probably not feel it but it's a little bit better

63
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,360
to use get element by Aidid than to use it for his selector if you really just want to get access to

64
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,370
an element by ID.

65
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,130
So that's just a side note.

66
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,670
And another way of getting access of course all that would have been to use our techniques.

67
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:19,610
For example we could dive into the body and then have a look at all its children so all the child element

68
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,770
notes and then pick the second child because the first child is this strange backdrop thing which will

69
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,880
become important later.

70
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,530
Second child would be that.

71
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:35,610
So another way of selecting this would have been to use document body and then their children and then

72
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,520
there the element that indicate one which is the second element.

73
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,480
All these approaches select as movie modal just to prove it all quickly.

74
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,760
Output it here.

75
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,960
Comment out the first two steps so that we don't get errors because I'm using the same constant over

76
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,070
and over again.

77
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,480
And now with that just go to the console here reload.

78
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:01,830
Now we see that select that does modal and that's also true if I um comments and comments back in and

79
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,440
then reload at the same modal here and also for completeness sake and this is the approach which I will

80
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,440
use if we use get element by I.D. we all locked at mode here.

81
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,960
So these are just some ideas of course there are more ways of selecting it.

82
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,590
Just to give you an idea for that but I will go with this approach because if you have an idea you typically

83
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,860
should strongly consider using that idea at least does all the will be very fast from performance perspective.

84
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,980
So there is little that speaks against using this.

85
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,230
So with that we select a d movie modal.

86
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,330
Now as I said we also need to get access to this button here to add movie button and for that I'll add

87
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:48,990
another constant here add movie button we're actually I'll name it start add movie button I'll name

88
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:54,320
it start add movie button because later I will also have a button instead of that ad movie modal so

89
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,070
interrupt that modal which we just selected there we also have a add button and I want to give this

90
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:04,030
to ad movie button named later because this will be the button when we press it.

91
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,050
That really adds a movie to our app.

92
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:12,690
The button in the header starts this whole addition process which is why I will call it start at movie

93
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,710
button.

94
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,420
Now how can we select that.

95
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,590
Of course there are different ways of selecting it.

96
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:25,740
We could for example say document query selector and then reach out into the header and then to the

97
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,220
button.

98
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,190
So here I am using TAC selectors because I only have one header on this entire page it's this header

99
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:39,270
here and then this is a normal see as a selector we select a button inside of a header element so we

100
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,800
only have one header element we select the first matching button which in this case also is the only

101
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,530
button in this header and therefore this would give us access.

102
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,200
So that's one way of doing it and no way of course.

103
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,370
And I will not always show all alternatives.

104
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:52,830
No worries.

105
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,450
But here I do want to show ID.

106
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:00,300
So in no way would be to use Cary selector header and then for example last element child because if

107
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,640
we have a look at our header here we see the button is the last element child instead of the header.

108
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,590
So that would be a no way of selecting it.

109
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,410
The downside of using this just as before with using document body children one for the movie model

110
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:19,010
is that whenever we change something in the structure whenever we add something in the header some of

111
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,140
content here often a button some some other title or anything like that then this way of selecting it

112
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,480
here will not work anymore because it always selects the last element child and if we change that in

113
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,260
the HTML code our Javascript code will select a wrong element.

114
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,680
So therefore you should be careful with using this selection technique in places where the HTML content

115
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,780
might change where you as a developer might change it later.

116
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,200
So they offer.

117
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,030
I actually prefer this approach as I mentioned earlier and alternative would have been to add an I.D.

118
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,850
to this button but also to mix things up.

119
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,200
Let's use discrete selector.
