00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.320
Let's add some content in the modal so inside of my modal div there.

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.230
I actually want to have three sections.

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.830
I want to have a header in there which holds a title.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.350
And for now I'll simply have a dummy titled there h1 tag please confirm

5
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.480
below the header here.

6
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.350
I want to have a section

7
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.760
maybe with the I.D. main whatever you want and in there I'll have a slot because I want to be able to

8
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.960
pass the content that is displayed as a message into this modal from outside.

9
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.460
And actually you're of course not limited to passing in Some text here.

10
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.140
You can pass on anything here you can pass on an image buttons form inputs whatever you want.

11
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.750
So I read a service slot here and then below that slot I'll have a number a section and this should

12
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.040
be the section where I have my my button or my two buttons I want to have two buttons in here.

13
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:14.090
I'll give the section an idea of actions and the first button will be cancel the second button will

14
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.410
be confirm or OK or whatever you want.

15
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.040
And of course you could also create this in a more generic way.

16
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.490
We have to draw a border at some point here.

17
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.950
So I will go for the hard coded buttons here.

18
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.410
You could definitely find a solution where this can be passed in through slots too.

19
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.430
And I will show you how to have different slot parts in your template here in a second we'll see that

20
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.510
later in this module.

21
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.970
So now I have these buttons in here.

22
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.000
Now we can style that a little bit.

23
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.680
I'll select actions with the I.D. selector gift as a border to the top of one pixel solid and a light

24
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.410
grey look let's say if I now reload this.

25
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.080
This is how it looks like.

26
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.500
I definitely want have a different layout here.

27
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.430
I want to distribute all these pieces across the available space.

28
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.280
So for the entire modal here I'll actually set the display to flex using flex box.

29
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.120
And if that's something you don't know attached to this video you'll find some helpful resources for

30
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.670
learning flex box.

31
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.990
It's a way of managing the layout and CSX or managing boxes elements in C as s and distributing them.

32
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:34.760
I'll set the Flex direction to come here and I said justify content to space between here and this should

33
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.570
ensure that if I now reload does all the buttons are at the end here and now I just want to go to my

34
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.880
actions give us a padding of let's say one REM and also select my actions but elements here and give

35
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.450
them a margin left and right of one return and with that we have our buttons in here.

36
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.790
Actually I want to have that differently when I give them zero dot to five REM two left and right margin

37
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:14.450
and in my actions here I'll settle this debate display to flex two and I'll set justify content here

38
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.630
to flex and so now I have my buttons here at the bottom.

39
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.580
And now of course you could style these buttons differently for example make the cancel button red or

40
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.460
yellow ish and make your K button green.

41
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.910
I will keep them as they are because I don't want to lose too much time on all that styling.

42
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:41.710
Me quickly styled that title up there though so the header will add the header selector here and there.

43
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:48.970
I'll set up padding of one rim just as I have it here for the actions and I'll then also add a header

44
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.420
age 1 selector to select that age 1 tag.

45
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.850
We haven't a header and set the font size to 1 dot to 5 rem maybe.

46
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:58.440
Let's see.

47
00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.960
Yeah.

48
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.720
And now we can pass on any content we want.

49
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.370
Now I will also get rid of that height.

50
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.480
I set up there.

51
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.060
That was only sets temporarily to have some height when we had no content but now it should be as high

52
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.630
as the content we pass in requires this to be and we can pass in any content we want since I have a

53
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.170
slot we can go between the opening and closing tax of our motel and for example add a paragraph and

54
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:35.180
then add any message we would want to show here with your confirmation you agree to pay the full amount

55
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.760
whatever your app might be showing here and now with this paragraph added between the opening and closing

56
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.300
tag off our model.

57
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.210
If I reload the page we see it here and now again time for some styling.

58
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.170
Let's go back to the model.

59
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:56.150
Keep in mind that the slot is inside of the main section so all styled as main section here selected

60
00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.880
by the I.D. selector Main and give it a padding of 1 Ram 2.

61
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.350
And if you would want to stall the paragraph itself you can use the techniques you learned in the last

62
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.950
lectures with the slot at pseudo selector for example.

63
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.330
Here.

64
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.960
I got no need to do that so I will leave it as it is here.

65
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.330
With that we got a nice looking modal in my opinion.

66
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.930
Let's now ensure that we can also open and close it and we want to open it when there's show details

67
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.230
and confirm and button here is pressed.

68
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.980
So that will be our next task.

69
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.520
And if you have an idea for that definitely try it on your own first.
