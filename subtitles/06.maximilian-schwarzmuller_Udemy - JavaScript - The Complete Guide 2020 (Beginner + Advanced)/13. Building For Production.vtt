00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.710
So with the development part out of the way, let's now build for production. Now for production simply

2
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.100
means that we want to spit out optimized code,

3
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.070
that we don't want to have such a detailed source mapping so that

4
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.540
finding our original code is harder but that's not the main reason because people will always be able

5
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.520
to read our code if they really want to

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.290
but instead we just want to speed up that process and we want to make sure that the output files are

7
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.620
as small as possible.

8
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.890
Now for that, to make that happen, we need a different config file for production, so I'll add another 

9
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.450
webpack.config file,

10
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:50.170
however I will name it .config.prod.js and this will be our config file for production.

11
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.250
Now we can copy the code of our other config file and move it into this prod file but there, switch mode

12
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:05.130
to production, leave entry and output, that's the same but change the dev tool here to a production ready

13
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.160
one which we can find on the table here,

14
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.480
there we see for production, we can either set this to none, to an empty string or omit this setting or use

15
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.730
something like cheap source map which is what I will use to have some source mapping because sometimes

16
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.060
you also want to debug your production code

17
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.400
if you detect a bug on the running web page but with that setting, we have a bit worse

18
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.790
source maps, debugging will not be on the same level as before but at least we can look into our code

19
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.480
to a certain level. So let's save that

20
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.010
and with that, we're generally ready for production or for building for production here.

21
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.180
Now we can add a new script here in package.json, maybe build: prod and there,

22
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.760
I don't want to start the dev server because I don't want to run this on a server all the time, typically

23
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.430
you don't want to test your production code that much, you test during development after all but instead

24
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.350
I just want to generate my output assets. For that we can use webpack again but now we need to tell webpack

25
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.060
which config file to use. For that, you just add --config after webpack and then

26
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.040
point at the config file that should be taken into account. By default it will always look for 

27
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.290
webpack.config.js but we can change this by pointing at webpack.config.prod.js

28
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.240
and therefore of course you could have used any file name as long as you point it at it. If we

29
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.800
now run npm run build: prod here, it will build our code or our project for production and

30
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.480
output that here in the assets scripts folder.

31
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.440
So now this is what we get there, our optimized code as you can tell.

32
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.510
Now let's still test if that works

33
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.140
however by running serve now, our other development server

34
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.850
and therefore let's visit localhost:5000 and this is still looking good,

35
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.630
looks like the entire application works as it should,

36
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.790
now with our production ready code as you can see if you go to the network tab and you inspect one of

37
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.090
these files. This is actually reformatted by Chrome to be more readable,

38
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.310
the original code looked like this and this certainly is our production code.

39
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.580
So now we also build for production and therefore we have two workflows now; one with this build dev

40
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.890
script which spins up to development server which we use all the time whilst we're writing code and

41
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.290
one which we use right before we're ready to deploy our scripts, to use our scripts on our page

42
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.700
and we typically run this build: prod command whenever we have a new change, finished a new version, finished

43
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.750
and we now want to build that, output it and push it to our servers.
