WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.120
So you're able to work with the IDE in an efficient way,

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.860
now you also need to understand where to find help, where to dive deeper in cases where the IDE doesn't

3
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.540
provide sufficient support

4
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:22.140
and there we got one amazing resource for web development in general but also specifically for Javascript

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.330
and that's MDN.

6
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.940
I'll come back to MDN in a second, it's a web page,

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.460
it's like the official Javascript documentation if there were one.

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.400
There you find everything about Javascript,

9
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.150
it's extremely detailed,

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.390
you find information about basically every built-in function and object and thing you can do and

11
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.290
it's an amazing reference. It can be overwhelming if you first dive into it

12
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.280
but I'll show you how to work with it

13
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.570
in this module.

14
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.710
Now in addition, you need to learn how to google, seriously

15
00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.010
it's astonishing to see how many developers are not able to google. Often in development,

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.760
you don't know the solution yet or you just know I want to do this,

17
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.510
maybe I can do it like that but I'm not sure

18
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.860
and then why don't you just google it?

19
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.300
But of course you need to know how to google and I'll show you in this module, to find discussions where

20
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.650
other people discussed this same issue

21
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.570
and where are you then maybe find some ideas on how to think about the problem or how to solve it. Also,

22
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.120
learn how to ask proper questions,

23
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.940
no matter if you're doing that here in the Q & A section or in public forums like Stack Overflow which

24
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.960
is a great developer forum. There, you can ask for help but you need to ask in a way that allows others

25
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.580
to help, which means you need to describe your problem,

26
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.050
if you are getting an error, you need to copy and paste in the error message,

27
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.030
you really need to ask proper questions to get proper responses and also help others,

28
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.960
don't just ask,

29
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.940
also help others, be friendly,

30
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.090
dive into the community because that will allow you to grow as a developer.

31
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.800
And last but not least, no matter how seasoned you are as a developer, you will always have a lot of trial

32
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.770
and error.

33
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.100
Sometimes you know how you want to solve something, you know that it should work the way you're writing

34
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.320
your code but it just doesn't work. Well don't give up then, just keep on trying, tweak your code,

35
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.540
google, come back, change something and find a fix, find a solution. Of course here.

36
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.320
I'm not talking about syntax errors, simple errors where you misspelled something but where you just

37
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.660
can't get the logic right for something, where you want to calculate a random number between 1 and 10

38
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.570
and you always get one between 0 and 1 let's say,

39
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.050
well this is all about trial and error, tweaking your code, trying out if it works

40
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.310
and that is also an important part of development.

41
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.260
So let's dive a bit deeper into all of this and let's start with MDN.

42
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.540
You can just google for MDN

43
00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.060
and here we are already getting started with the googling and you should find the MDN web docs.

44
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.420
Now in case you're wondering, MDN stands for Mozilla Developer Network

45
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.120
but this site evolved over time and now it's not just a site maintained by Mozilla but instead, a lot

46
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.920
of developers are working on it to make it the kind of pseudo official web development reference and

47
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.400
guide collection.

48
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.680
Now on this page here, you can dive into different technologies, for example Javascript and there, you'll

49
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.990
also find a couple of tutorials which I really can only recommend that you also dive into.

50
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.550
They won't replace this course here because these are all written tutorials,

51
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.030
so you'll find no video tutorials in there,

52
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.440
it's more about reading here and it can be overwhelming if you're brand new

53
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.830
in my experience but it's a great additional resource, also to go through at the same time whilst you're

54
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.660
going through this course or after going through this course.

55
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.090
So this is really amazing, there you can learn a lot about Javascript,

56
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.680
its core features, its core functions that are built in, all the syntax and so on.

57
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.420
And then you also get the references and the guides and there, you also find more tutorials

58
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.230
but for example under references, you find detailed references for HTML, CSS and Javascript

59
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.600
and if we explore the Javascript one here by clicking on reference, what we actually can find there are

60
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.960
complete references of all built-in objects and you see there are a lot, no worries, we'll learn about

61
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.150
all the important ones throughout this course.

62
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.450
You can find more about expressions and operators which are built in, all about functions, how to write

63
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.620
them, how to configure them and so on.

64
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.080
So you really find a lot of stuff in there which will help you work with Javascript and write good code.

65
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.490
So this is a great resource to come back to

66
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.870
and often it's easiest to work with it by not just searching on their site but let's say you want to

67
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.000
learn more about the parseInt method,

68
00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.930
well you can always search for MDN and and then the thing you want to learn more about, for example parseInt

69
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:07.560
and if you do that you should find the parseInt article on MDN as I do here and there, you see

70
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.530
a short snippet for it,

71
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.680
a short description, you can even run that short snippet. You then find the detailed syntax description

72
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.170
below,

73
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.200
the arguments, the parameters this takes and what needs to be parsed in there.

74
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.080
You find a more detailed description,

75
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.550
more examples,

76
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.970
so that's really really amazing.

77
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.660
And by the way if you dive into this right now, it can be overwhelming because there you also see some

78
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.970
features covered which we haven't covered yet in this course but still, to look things up especially

79
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.650
if you're a bit further into Javascript development, that can be really helpful

80
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.600
and that's what I meant with

81
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.680
don't learn it by heart.

82
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.880
It's all written down there,

83
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.550
you just need to remember that there was some parseInt function and you can search for it and find it

84
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.850
here.
