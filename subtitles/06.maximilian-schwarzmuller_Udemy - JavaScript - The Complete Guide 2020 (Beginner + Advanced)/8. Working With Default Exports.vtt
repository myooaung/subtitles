00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.750
Now one last important feature regarding the export import syntax we saw here,

2
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:15.290
if you have one core element which is exported in a file or maybe the only element which is exported,

3
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.070
like here component is the only exported thing in component.js, then you can absolutely export it

4
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.820
like this but you can also name it

5
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.470
the default export of this file by adding default here, this keyword.

6
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.190
You can then even omit the name here because you'll now not import it by name but by just pointing

7
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.650
at that file and then automatically the default export will be picked and I'll show you how that pointing

8
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.420
works in a second.

9
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:54.410
Now you can still have named exports along that, so here if I had the doSomething function here, so export

10
00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.340
function doSomething which actually does nothing here, then I could do that, we could import this by

11
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.090
name and this as a default which now just leaves the question, how do we import something as a default?

12
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:14.360
We'll, we're using component in tooltip after all and this import would now fail. If I save everything and I

13
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.640
reload, we would get an error because as the error message says, component.js does not have an export named component

14
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.520
because I removed that name

15
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.300
and even if I would add it by the way and I reload, it would still fail because we export this as a default

16
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.150
in which case Javascript will ignore the name.

17
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.700
So how do we now tell tooltip that we're interested in the default export of components.js?

18
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.420
Very simple, you just use a syntax you already saw before, you just say import anything,

19
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.700
any name of your choice like cmp for of course also component but doesn't have to be the exported

20
00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.320
name or the file name, can be any name from file and then here we could use cmp instead of component.

21
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.130
This tells Javascript that since you don't wrap this in curly braces, this should be the default export

22
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.900
of that file and of course therefore this syntax only works if a file has a default export,

23
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.420
otherwise it will fail.

24
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.730
So now with this line, we import the default export of this file, which in this case is this class, under

25
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.140
that name which is totally up to you.

26
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.050
You can use this feature,

27
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.560
it has the tiny disadvantage that since you have to rename it when you import it,

28
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.850
if you're working in a team,

29
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.520
every team member might have his or her own naming convention and you might end up with code which uses

30
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.930
different naming conventions and therefore, using named exports where you're all forced to

31
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.590
settle on some name might be better.

32
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.590
Nonetheless it is a feature which you can use

33
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.740
and if you now would want to import that named doSomething export, you would do that by simply combining

34
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.300
this with a comma, with a curly brace list of named imports,

35
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.700
so here I could import doSomething.

36
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.680
So you can have a default and non-default, also called named export side-by-side and therefore of course

37
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.210
you can also have them imported at the same time.

38
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.820
This is the default export

39
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.870
and here you list all named exports, so all the things where you just added export in front of them without

40
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.670
the default keyword.

41
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.430
Also of course important, should be self-explanatory though, you can only have one default export per

42
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.870
file,

43
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.110
you can't have more than one.
