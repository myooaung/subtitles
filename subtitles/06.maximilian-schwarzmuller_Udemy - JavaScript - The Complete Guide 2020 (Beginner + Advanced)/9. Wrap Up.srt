1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,220
This is it for this practice module.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,650
We worked a bit more with classes, with this object oriented approach.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,790
Hopefully again, that was a useful practice for getting a feeling regarding how you think about object

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,900
oriented programming and how you structure your app there.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,760
We worked a bit with the DOM, we moved elements around, we worked with event listeners.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,820
I also showed you this new callback pattern,

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,860
we learned about that before but now you saw it in practice where we passed functions to other instances

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,830
and to other functions so that from inside there, they could be called upon certain events

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,300
and with that we build this little application where we can move items around and this application will

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,300
be important, we'll also use it in the next course module

11
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,750
and with that finished, you're well-prepared for this module and you hopefully also got some additional

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,780
practice with classes and object oriented programming.
