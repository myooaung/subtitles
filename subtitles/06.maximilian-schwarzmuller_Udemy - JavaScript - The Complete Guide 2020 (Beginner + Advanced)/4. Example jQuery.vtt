00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.630
Now Lodash is just one library, a very popular one but absolutely not the only one,

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:15.220
there are thousands of available Javascript utility libraries, for Javascript in the browser but also

3
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.180
for Javascript on Node.js

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.630
and as I said this concept exists not just for Javascript but for all programming languages you could

5
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.370
say.

6
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.670
In addition, the complexity of the library differs,

7
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.890
it can be something like Lodash which offers a bunch of utility functions,

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.860
it can be something else which allows you to write Javascript in a brand new way.

9
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.120
There also are Javascript frameworks which are basically very large libraries, like Vue.js

10
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.660
React or Angular, due to their complexity we'll have a look at those in a separate module though but we'll

11
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.910
also cover this,

12
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.520
these would be very big libraries. Typically when you say library, you mean something a bit smaller which

13
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.610
focuses on one core task,

14
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.810
in the case of Lodash it focuses on giving you a bunch of utility features and it is really good

15
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.510
at that typically.

16
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.570
Another popular Javascript library for example would be JQuery.

17
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.170
It was very popular around 2010, 11, 12 and it still is heavily used but it was more important

18
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.210
in the past because JQuery actually made working with the DOM, adding elements, querying elements

19
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.890
way easier. Now since then, since the early days of JQuery, Javascript has come a long way and nowadays

20
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.460
it's really easy to work with the DOM, traverse the DOM, work with CSS classes there and so on with

21
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.050
native DOM APIs

22
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.840
which is why you don't really need JQuery as often these days but you still might encounter it in a

23
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.380
lot of tutorials and threads on the Internet you find and therefore you should be aware of it.

24
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.720
It's a Javascript library which you add to your project basically as you added Lodash by downloading

25
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:08.120
it or by using a CDN, as you see down there and then JQuery is not about giving you utility functions

26
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.830
like getting the difference of two arrays but it gives you a lot of functions that help you work with

27
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.400
the DOM and that can also be interesting

28
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.670
but again as I said, basically all of that can nowadays also be done with the core Javascript APIs you

29
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.020
learned about in this course.

30
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.740
So you might not need that but you should be aware of it.
