00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,920
Welcome to this course.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,870
I'm super excited to have you onboard and to start this journey together with you,

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,960
my name is Max and I'll be your instructor in this course.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,570
I'm a freelance web developer and I've worked with Javascript for years and ages. Now by the end of this

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,140
course,

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:23,130
you will also be an advanced Javascript developer capable of applying for Javascript jobs, working on your

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,930
own project or simply dive deeper into the Javascript landscape and ecosystem and explore all the very

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,360
advanced and niche features Javascript offers.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,660
Now this course is for everyone,

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,830
we start at the very basics, no prior knowledge is assumed but we'll also then build up knowledge and

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,250
explore the more advanced and also experts topics.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,790
So no matter if you already have some Javascript knowledge or if you're just getting started,

13
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,600
this course is for you.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,770
Now I'll not bore you with entire overview of what's in the course in this lecture because for that,

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,480
I'll have a separate lecture later in this module.

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,930
There, you will also learn about different entry points you can use based on your level of knowledge

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,790
because this is not just a complete guide,

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,620
it's also a complete reference in the end.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,610
This course also is not a theoretical course,

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,520
of course we have all the theory but it's a practice-oriented course,

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,440
there are plenty of opportunities for you to apply what you learned.

22
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,620
There are quizzes and assignments and a lot of exercises and demo projects because I strongly believe

23
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,550
that you'll learn the most if you can apply things in real world scenarios.

24
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,780
You're also not alone, in this course,

25
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,500
I'll always be there and I'll do my very best to ensure that you get out of the course

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,860
what you want to get out of it.

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,850
And with that I'd say let's not waste any time,

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,580
let's dive into the most important question right away and let's find out what exactly Javascript is.
