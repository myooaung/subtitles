00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:11,340
After covering variables, operators and all these core basics that you need to know in Javascript and

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:18,370
actually in most programming languages, there is another important block or set of features which you

3
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:24,070
will also need in basically any programming language you are going to learn, Javascript included,

4
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,560
and that would be control structures.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,530
Now that's kind of a strange term,

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,540
what does control structures mean?

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:38,110
It means that when you're writing code, you don't always want to execute exactly the same code

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:46,630
top to bottom. Sometimes you have some condition that should be met for some code to be executed and

9
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:53,950
execute some other code if the condition is not met or you need to repeat some code execution and instead

10
00:00:53,950 --> 00:01:02,800
of writing every cycle on your own, you can use some built-in features built into Javascript to run through

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,710
a code snippet multiple times until some condition is met or until some data is exhausted,

12
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,650
so that's exactly what we'll have a look at in this module. To be precise, we'll have a look at conditional

13
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,020
statements, if statements,

14
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,950
you might have heard about if statements

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,070
if you worked with some other programming language in the past and we'll also have look at conditional

16
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:30,400
expressions. We'll therefore also have a look at another very important related topic and that would

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,090
be boolean values and operators that help you generate boolean values, which turn out to be rather important

18
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,170
in if statements and conditional expressions

19
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:47,170
and we'll also have a look at loops and how you can run the same code with different data maybe multiple

20
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,090
times with help of the many loops that are available in Javascript.

21
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:58,120
Last but not least, after having a look at loops, we'll also dive into error handling and that will

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,300
be different from what you learned in the debugging section as you will learn,

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,060
here I'm talking about errors which you can't avoid, that might happen in your program as it executes

24
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,680
and how you can then react to them and what you can do to still fail gracefully,

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,170
maybe show an error message to the user or even fall back and make sure that your program works even

26
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,740
though an error occurred.

27
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,800
So these are all very important control structures and with that, let's dive right into them.
