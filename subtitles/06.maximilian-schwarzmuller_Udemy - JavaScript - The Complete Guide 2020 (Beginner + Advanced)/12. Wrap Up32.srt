1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,810
So in this module, we had a thorough look at Javascript's

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,960
different versions, its past and its present, at var and let, block scope versus function and global scope,

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,560
the implications of that. Strange behaviors you could implement especially when using var and strict

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,710
mode to avoid that, though as I mentioned using let and const already prohibits a lot of these strange

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,360
behaviors

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,340
and in general the syntax and the patterns I show you in this course will use none of these strange and

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,530
actually to be avoided patterns and behaviors.

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,960
And besides all these language specific things, you also learned a lot about how the browser actually handles

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,160
your code, how it interprets and compiles it. You learned how your code executes with the help of the stack,

10
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,290
the heap and what the Javascript engine does with these things. You learned about primitive and reference

11
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,630
values, important concepts which can lead to a lot of confusion if you don't understand them

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,710
which is why I covered them with great detail in this module and we also finish this up with a look

13
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,630
at garbage collection and how to avoid memory leaks, though as I mentioned, we'll have a whole module

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:16,500
later where we dive into performance optimization and avoiding memory leaks in Javascript programs.

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,050
So that is a look behind the scenes of Javascript,

16
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,790
a look into its past, into its weaknesses and potential fixes for it, like the modern syntax, strict

17
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,710
mode and so on and what the browser actually does with our code and how it works internally.

18
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,600
That is super important to know if you want to be a Javascript developer because you need to know your

19
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,940
language, you need to know what it does and you need to know how to write proper code. For all of this,

20
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,150
this module hopefully was very helpful. With that,

21
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:51,900
let's go back from the theoretical side here, back into more code and into more language features which

22
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,490
we can use in our scripts.
