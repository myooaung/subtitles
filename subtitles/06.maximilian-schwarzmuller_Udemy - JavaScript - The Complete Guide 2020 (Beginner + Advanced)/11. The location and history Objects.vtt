00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.610
Besides timers, the browser also has a couple of other nice objects or features it exposes to us in

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.310
Javascript, for example and I'll show you this in the console here,

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.650
there is the location object, it's on window.location and therefore as you learned, you can just access

4
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.270
it like this and if we have a look into it, we see that's an object with a couple of properties and methods

5
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:33.220
and they're all related to our URL and the page we're on. Location can be used to also navigate the

6
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:40.210
user away, for example by setting location ref equal to a new URL, something like academind.com

7
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.270
for example which is my own page,

8
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.590
if you now hit enter, you see we switch to that page.

9
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.360
You can also navigate with replace,

10
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.480
this is a method which you execute to which you pass a URL, the difference to setting ref is simply

11
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.850
that you can't go back because it will replace this page in that browser history which is in the end stored,

12
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.870
so the back button won't be able to go back to this page after you used replace. Another alternative

13
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.310
would be the assign method,

14
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.380
that's pretty much the same as setting the ref property and you can use both interchangeably depending

15
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.360
on whether you rather navigate by setting a property or by calling a method

16
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.780
and of course you got a couple of other properties and methods in there as well,

17
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.290
for example you got host which tells you on which host this page is running, since we serve this locally

18
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.930
from the files, we got no host there

19
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.730
but if you are on some other page, like academind.com for example, then you will see that host actually

20
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:44.110
gives you the domain here. You also got origin which is the full domain including the protocol which

21
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.970
was used, also the pathname which is the part after the domain

22
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.890
and here I'm just on slash nothing.

23
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.120
If I were on a list of all my courses and I would execute this, you would see that now I get this part

24
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.930
after the domain being logged here and this can be useful to find out where you are on the page in Javascript

25
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.110
for example,

26
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.430
a nice feature especially for more complex Javascript driven browser side applications where you might

27
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.890
want to render different content based on the path that was entered up there and you might want to control

28
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.200
the entire navigation through Javascript, something which is actually possible but beyond the scope of

29
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.590
this course and typically done with the help of Javascript frameworks,

30
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.450
something we'll always have a look at throughout this course. So that's the location object,

31
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.530
you also have window.history or just history

32
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.010
therefore. Now location and history kind of work together, location allows you to edit the browser history

33
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.600
by navigating around or by replacing the page, history then allows you to interact with that history,

34
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.260
for example you can call the back method to go back. So I could say location ref and set this equal to

35
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.350
academind.com and then there, we could call history back and be taken back to the page where we

36
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.270
came from.

37
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.310
So this for example allows you to move the user back to the page where he came from, a feature you might

38
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.320
have seen on some web pages where you are asked if you are old enough to visit the content,

39
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.080
don't know which pages could ask for something like this and then if you answer no I'm too young because

40
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.030
well, does anyone ever answer this?

41
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.820
I don't know but you click that no button, then the page might want to move you back where you came from,

42
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.940
you could do this with history back.

43
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.240
You also have history forward to go to the page you came from if you navigated back there and

44
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.760
you can also inspect the length of the history to find out how many steps the user did in this tab

45
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.380
of the browser, so how often

46
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.080
you went forward to a new page essentially, so how often you could go back therefore because you

47
00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.650
also got history go to go back five steps in it history and take the user to the page he was on five

48
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.920
navigations ago so to say. So definitely feel free to play around with location history to get

49
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.370
a feeling for how you can move your users around. Be aware of course that moving users around is not

50
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.020
always giving them the best user experience though, so you want to do this with care.
