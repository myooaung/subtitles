00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.380
In this course you'll learn a lot about JavaScript.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.520
Now what if I were to tell you that there is no programming language closely related to JavaScript which

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.260
is all the worth knowing.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.800
And that is typescript.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.820
Now don't worry it's not a brand new language you have to learn instead typescript is a language which

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.930
does not run in browsers which does not run a node J.S..

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.110
So it's not like Javascript when it comes to that but instead it's a language which builds up on javascript

8
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.560
which has to be compiled down to java script with help of a tool which we're going to install and which

9
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:45.390
adds new features to javascript to make javascript development easier maybe more fun but definitely

10
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.320
also cleaner and helps you write cleaner code.

11
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.770
So in this module we'll have a look at what exactly typescript is and how it works how you can use it

12
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.980
and how it looks like and you will then also see why you might want to use it how to write typescript

13
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.000
code that it's not that different compared to JavaScript and how you can utilize it for your projects.
