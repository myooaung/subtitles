1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:09,310
We're getting more and more advanced and now that we have an understanding of HttpRequests and also 

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,790
third-party libraries,

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,490
we're well-prepared for this module where we'll talk about browser storage.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:21,880
Now this is a general Javascript course but as it was the case already throughout this course, of course

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:28,570
the focus lies on the browser because that's the first place where you typically work with Javascript.

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:35,440
Now in the HTTP module, we had a look at how you can store data and also fetch data from inside

7
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,070
Javascript to and from a server,

8
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:44,200
so how you can basically attach your user interface to some backend, to some server which then might

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,120
also talk to a database where the data gets stored and retrieved.

10
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:55,660
Now some data however can also be stored in the browser, so directly where your user is, not all data

11
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:01,540
is suitable for this storage and we'll explore what browser storage is and for which kind of data we

12
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,730
might want to use it in this module.
