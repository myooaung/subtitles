1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:09,240
Now to practice all that if statement stuff and the related concepts a bit better, let's work on a new

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,300
little application, a new little project, a little website here,

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,200
as before, fully driven by a browser side Javascript so that we can experiment with the things we learned

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,210
and get a nice visual output for that.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,530
Now this is the website, I load it,

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,910
you'll find it attached, of course again it's made up of an index.html file and of an assets folder,

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,670
the assets folder holds a scripts folder with an empty app.js file and a vendor.js file which

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,950
is kind of a black box to us right now,

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,910
it basically establishes a communication channel you could say between our HTML code and Javascript

10
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,220
so that we can manipulate the document we see there, something we will of course learn in great detail

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,460
later in the course, we're just not entirely there yet so

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:59,820
for now we just treat this as a black box that yields us some global variables we can use to listen

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,250
to button clicks and so on.

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,690
The app.js file is where we will write our code and of course we also got some styles here in the app.css

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,710
file,

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:14,040
side note all these styles are optimized for Chrome because I recommend following along with Chrome

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,390
here, not because Javascript wouldn't work in other browsers but simply especially for the styles now,

18
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,900
so that we all always have the same thing on the screen. Now

19
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,710
this is what we do have on the screen and what we're building is a little monster killer application.

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,280
We got the health of a monster and we got the health of a player,

21
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,640
we also got a bonus life, in case our health drops to zero we'll be able to recover

22
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:45,960
one time only. We got four buttons which we can press to attack the monster, to launch a strong attack

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,890
against the monster, to heal ourselves and also to output some log information about the past rounds.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,920
Now that's what we'll work on, right now nothing works because all the logic is of course something we will

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,750
need to write and maybe you can already see some of

26
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:09,390
the if checks we probably will perform, maybe some related to the buttons, whether we launch a normal or

27
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:16,020
a strong attack but also definitely we'll need to check after each round whether we won or not,

28
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,500
so whether the health of the monster and/or the player is below zero and we therefore need to quit the

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,590
game or stop the game. So that will be some if checks and actually, there will be a couple of other if

30
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,040
checks as well because we'll also add a functionality where when we load this page, we actually asked

31
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:43,720
the player how much health monster and player should have, 100 health points, 50, 1000 and we'll

32
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,220
need to check whether the value the user entered is a valid value and so on. So there'll be a couple of

33
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,440
places where we need if checks and therefore a couple of places where we can practice the things we learned,

34
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,050
so let's dive right in.
