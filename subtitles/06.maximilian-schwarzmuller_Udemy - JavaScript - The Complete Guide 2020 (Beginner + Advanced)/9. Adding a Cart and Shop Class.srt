1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,070
So time for another class,

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,160
let's add a cart or a shopping cart

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,050
class here, up to you how you want to name it and in there

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,170
I want to have an items field which initially is empty

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,070
and I also want to have a render method here which renders something to the screen and that something

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:28,730
should simply be let's say the total amount and a button that allows us to order the items.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,630
You could of course also go more fancy than that and also render all items

8
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:38,850
but to keep this module short or relatively short, I'll just render the total.

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,300
So in here, I'll create my cart element with document create element

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:54,110
and here I'll go for let's say a section element, section tag and then set cart el innerHTML equal to

11
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:02,390
some HTML code, again written across multiple lines to make it easier to read, where I want to have

12
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:09,310
a h2 tag which will output the total amount, then I want to output a dollar sign here so we have to

13
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,480
escape it with a backslash and then we can interpolate the total amount.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,450
For now I'll just output zero here,

15
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:22,470
this will soon refer to something dynamic and then also a button where we could say order

16
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:34,820
now, like that. Now I'l also assign a class here to get some proper styling with a class name and set it equal

17
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,220
to cart,

18
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:44,550
that's another style you find in app.css and that should be a semicolon and of course later I'll also

19
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:53,060
add an event listener here but for the moment, I'll just return cart el here in the render method so that

20
00:01:53,150 --> 00:02:00,740
wherever we create that shopping cart, we can append it to the DOM.

21
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:07,000
Now where is that place where I want to use the shopping cart though? Well that should probably be a

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,830
new class which kind of combines product list in cart because the cart item, the cart HTML content

23
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,020
is certainly not part of the product list,

24
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,670
so rendering it here would be incorrect but that is the thing which we rendered to the screen initially.

25
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:30,130
So we probably add a new class which you could name app or shop or page or whatever you want to name

26
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,220
it,

27
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:36,130
I'll name it shop and in there, I'll now also add a render method

28
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,750
and here I want to combine cart and product list.

29
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:49,260
So now in the end, I'll grab this code here, create my product list in the render method and also create

30
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:59,380
my cart here with new shopping cart and then call cart.render here. Now

31
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:06,260
product list right now always renders itself into that app place here of index.html, into that

32
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,420
div here, we now need to change that and kind of cut the render hook from the render method of product

33
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,940
list and move that into shop which is now the new place where we render everything to the screen

34
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:23,990
and now we need to make sure that instead the render method in product list returns that prod list, so

35
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:30,860
also cut this code and instead return prod list here just as we do it in the other classes and

36
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:37,370
then here in the shop component, we just need to store these returned elements. So here we got the cart

37
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,500
element and here, we got the prod list element

38
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:53,320
and then here in render hook, we append the cart and thereafter, we append the prod list element and here

39
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,210
of course the cart element.

40
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:03,740
Now we just have to create our shop here with new shop below all these class definitions and then call

41
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:09,080
shop render and this will then render the individual parts and the result should be that if we save

42
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,040
that and reload, indeed we now have that cart area here at the top.

43
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,560
Now for the moment of course nothing changes when I click Add to Cart though or we only see that output

44
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:24,110
but that does not change the number here and it can't because we haven't added any logic to do so.

45
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,900
So that's the next step

46
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:32,060
we should do and that will also force us to make sure that we can communicate between our different

47
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,810
classes,

48
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,760
something we haven't really done before.
