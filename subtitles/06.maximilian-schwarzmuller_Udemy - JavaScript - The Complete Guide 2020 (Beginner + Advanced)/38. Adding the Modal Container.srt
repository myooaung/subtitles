1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:08,330
So with the backdrop added let's work on mobile so hashtag mobile selects the element with the idea

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:14,840
mobile and just to reiterate on that because we're in the shadow Dom this only affects elements with

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,040
the idea modal that are inside of our template here.

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,350
So basically only.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:27,410
Well this element here and for the modal I want to have that in the foreground so I'll actually give

6
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,920
my backdrop a SET index of let's say 10 and modal.

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,710
WE'LL HAVE A SET index of 100.

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:40,490
Because it should have a higher set index so that the backdrop is in the background of the model.

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:48,030
I'll also give a positional fixed to position it in a fixed way in our viewport in our document from

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,450
the top.

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,920
Let's say we have a distance of 15 feet V H

12
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:04,950
and from the left we have a distance of let's say 25 percent and then we have a width of 50 percent

13
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:10,680
because we have 25 distance from the left then a width of 50 percent and then also 25 percent from the

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,020
right which is the left over space.

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,620
Therefore this should be nicely centered and you can set different styles optimized as for mobile.

16
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:24,120
I'm not carrying so much about the styling here I just want to focus on the general functionality and

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,710
not drive a ton of styles.

18
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,540
You could add media queries in here whatever you need for the right styling.

19
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,500
I'll go with this styling and I'll give it a background of white and to ensure that we can see something

20
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:37,820
for now.

21
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:44,160
I'll give it a height of let's say 30 REM and we might be able to get rid of this later once we have

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,330
some content in there.

23
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:54,510
I also want to have a border radius of let's say three pixels and I'll give it a box shadow of 0 2 pixels

24
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,790
8 pixels.

25
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,120
And then let's say this style here some transparent box shadow drop shadow.

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,610
And with all of that in place let's head over and reload this page and here's our model.

27
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,710
And obviously this is missing all the content but we're getting there.

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,280
Now we have the modal container.

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,260
We have the backdrop behind it.

30
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,000
Now we want to populate that modal with some content of course.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,580
And I want to have some static content in there and I also want to have some slot content in there.

32
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,810
So let's add that next.
