00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.590
Now that we had a closer look at arrays, a super important data structure in Javascript,

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.700
let's have a look at objects as well because objects are an even more important data structure in Javascript,

3
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.470
actually

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.560
arrays are just objects in the end and with objects, we can do a lot in Javascript. They're super important

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.610
for grouping data,

6
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.980
for also grouping functionality, something we haven't really done yet but which we'll also dive deeper

7
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.860
and deeper into in this module and the subsequent modules and a lot of things in Javascript are objects.

8
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.460
For example when we work with the DOM, where we add a movie here with this form, if we have a look at

9
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.430
that code there, of course our movie which we add is a Javascript object which we use to save the data

10
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.530
about a movie in our code so that we can work with it

11
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.120
but every DOM node to which we get access with get element by ID or any other selection method or

12
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.410
any DOM node we create with create element,

13
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:08.310
all these things are in the end just objects, just Javascript objects, sometimes created by us as in the

14
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.060
case of new movie where we use this curly brace syntax and in other times, created by the browser for

15
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.300
us where we then just get access to these created objects,

16
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.440
for example with such selection methods. So objects are everywhere in Javascript, they're super important

17
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.860
and there's so much you can do with them.

18
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.680
So in this module, we will have a closer look at objects,

19
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.790
what we can do with them, which different syntax features we have to work with them and much more.
