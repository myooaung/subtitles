00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:08,200
It's time for a little bit of behind the scenes theory about Javascript code and how we call things

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,110
there.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,650
You might have heard me say things like statement or expression,

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,130
well there actually is a difference,

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,370
this here is an expression. Basically in Javascript,

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:27,040
an expression is something that yields a value you could store in a constant or a variable or return

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,910
in a function, something like this,

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,680
that's an expression.

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,420
Now every expression also is a statement,

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:41,620
this here for example is also a statement but an if statement on the other hand is just a statement, not an

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,920
expression because you can't use it in the places where you for example just need a value as you just

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,050
learned, you can't do that,

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,890
instead an if statement here can only be used in code like this, you can't use it on the right side of the

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,370
equals sign basically

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,560
and therefore this is a statement but not an expression.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,270
So you could kind of memorize that an expression is basically something which would work if you use

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,090
it on the right side of an equal sign.

18
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,670
It's not super important for you to learn it by heart,

19
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:20,670
I just want to clarify what I mean when I say expression or statement and as you see, most things in

20
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,890
Javascript are expressions but something like the if statement would be a statement.

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,770
We will also see other statements later when we dive into loops because these also are statements then

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,710
but for now, the if statement is the important statement which is not an expression which we learned about

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,250
thus far.
