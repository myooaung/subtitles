00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:10,390
Let's take a step back from the web page, from working with the DOM into more Javascript theory or into

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,100
important data structures you have in Javascript.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,860
To be precise, let's have a closer look at arrays and iterables

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,760
in this module. Now of course, we already worked with arrays but always in the very basic way,

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,630
turns out there are many interesting things you can do with arrays,

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,680
many things you can know and therefore,

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,130
that's exactly what we'll have a look at in this module. In detail,

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,410
we'll have a look at different ways of creating arrays, we'll have a look at how to work with arrays,

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,870
how to manipulate them, how to add or remove items,

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,620
what's special about them and how they behave.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,080
We'll have a look at a lot of important array methods which exist on arrays in Javascript, that help

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:53,160
us transform array data, summarize array data, sort arrays and all kinds of stuff

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:59,560
and we'll also have a look at other important iterables which you'll find in Javascript, namely maps

14
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,430
and sets

15
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,850
and I will also clarify what iterable actually mean.

16
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,870
Well let's start with that right away.
