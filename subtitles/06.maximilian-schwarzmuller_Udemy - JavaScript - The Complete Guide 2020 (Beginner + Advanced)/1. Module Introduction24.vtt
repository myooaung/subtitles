00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.100
So you learned a lot about the Javascript syntax and how to write Javascript code and obviously that's

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.530
what this course is about.

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.150
Now in this module, we'll also dive in an important related topic

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.790
and that would be performance optimizations because of course it's nice that we're able to write Javascript

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.180
code but we want to write good Javascript code and most importantly, you should be able to find out whether

6
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.710
you wrote code that offers a good performance to your end users or whether there are things you can

7
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.480
improve or you might need to fix to avoid a bad user experience.

8
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.530
Specifically in this module, we'll have a look at what exactly performance is because it turns out that

9
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.240
is rather a broad term and it can be a lot of different things.

10
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.270
We'll also have a look at some tools or approaches of measuring and analyzing performance and finding

11
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.540
out how our application behaves.

12
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.950
We'll also dive into some potential optimization ideas on how you could improve your code and what you

13
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.480
should watch out for

14
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.950
and I will also guide you to some additional resources because the whole topic of optimizing performance

15
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.950
does not stop at Javascript,

16
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.300
wWhat this course of course is about but actually includes a broad variety of things

17
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.930
and even for Javascript, it turns out there are a lot of different use cases.

18
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.250
So in this module, I want to get you started,

19
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.100
we'll dive deeply into all the important concepts but thereafter I'll also give you the tools so that

20
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.220
you can build up on this and analyze and optimize any part of your web site, of your web application.

21
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.280
So let's dive right in.
