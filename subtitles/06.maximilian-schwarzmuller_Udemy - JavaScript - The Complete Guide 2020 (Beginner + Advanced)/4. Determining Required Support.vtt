00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.070
So now we know how we can check browser support,

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.990
now with that, the naive thought might be that

3
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.900
you simply check all these resources and then you need to find a way to make the feature you want to

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.400
use

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:23.050
work in all possible browsers across all browser versions and here, the clear answer is don't do this. For

6
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.740
one,

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.530
this will never be entirely possible,

8
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.280
there are super older versions of Internet Explorer that don't support anything,

9
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.120
you will never be able to make your application with all its features work there.

10
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.570
You would just cut so many features that just to support a small fraction of the user base, you pass

11
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.020
on some awesome features and awesome improvements you could offer to the vast majority of the user base.

12
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.000
So you definitely have a tradeoff there and you want to be careful regarding your decision.

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.500
Don't build an application for the smallest possible denominator, instead analyze your market, get an

14
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.550
idea of who your users will be and then build your application

15
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.650
for those users and use the features or make the features you plan on using work for these users and their

16
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.200
browsers, not for the global user base.

17
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.600
Here are some ideas,

18
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.890
let's say you're building some internal tool or application, so something that runs in the internal

19
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.990
company network and only employees of the company will be able to use that.

20
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.310
It's a common use case,

21
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.600
all companies have their own internal systems which often also are just web applications.

22
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.640
Now there, the company browser might be clearly defined, maybe as a policy in your company,

23
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.720
everyone has to use Chrome or Chrome or Firefox or everyone has to use Internet Explorer 11, then

24
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.270
you know exactly what your user base is, you know exactly for which browser you need to build and you

25
00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.780
certainly don't need to support any other browser or let's say you are building some web page that targets

26
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.480
tech savvy users,

27
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.870
some blog about technology,

28
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.170
some online learning site, anything like that.

29
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.630
Well there, it's very likely that you have users who are using cutting edge or modern browsers and versions

30
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.930
of these browsers by default because they're interested in technology,

31
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.900
they keep their system up-to-date and of course they're using the latest browsers because they want

32
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.290
to use all these rich web applications,

33
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.690
then you might not need to support very old legacy browsers because only a very small fraction of your

34
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.540
users visits your site with these browsers and it might be fine to pass up on these users,

35
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.970
you can't satisfy everyone,

36
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.900
maybe you want to show some message to these users who won't be able to use your site

37
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.710
but that's all.

38
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.840
Or you're building a site that targets older people or is simply a non-tech savvy audience,

39
00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.520
so then of course these people might be more likely to use slightly older browsers and therefore you

40
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.000
want to make sure that you support these people and their browsers.

41
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.870
You might not be able to rely on your audience to use cutting edge browsers and maybe therefore you

42
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.850
need to be more cautious regarding which features you use and how you test your code on older browsers

43
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.660
and that's one other thing by the way.

44
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.270
You of course also want to test your application in a broad variety of browsers, reflecting the browsers

45
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.980
you would expect your users to have.
