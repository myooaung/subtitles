WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.120
Now hopefully, you're now excited to get started and so am I. Before we get started, we just have to make

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.290
sure that we have a proper development environment,

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.800
so a good environment where we can write code and dive into Javascript because writing code in a

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.180
system text editor as we did it earlier in this module is really too cumbersome, not really a great experience.

5
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.470
If we have a look at that,

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.780
well this is really hard to read and if we write a lot of code there, that's not fun at all.

7
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.570
So we need a better code editor which makes working on our code easier, which takes some work off us

8
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.270
and makes it more pleasant in general

9
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.780
and we also need an environment where we can test our web page and our code.

10
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.710
Now for the editor, I strongly recommend using Visual Studio Code,

11
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.900
this is not the only code editor or IDE, for integrated development environment, which you can use

12
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.010
but it is free and it's really really great.

13
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.500
It's super fast, very modern, under active development, really extensible and customizable,

14
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.260
it's my strong recommendation to use Visual Studio Code and we'll install it together in just a second.

15
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.080
You can combine it with a lot of extensions which you can install from inside Visual Studio Code and

16
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.930
you can configure it to suit your needs

17
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.150
and I have a module where we'll dive deeper into that but I'll also show you a basic setup which I use

18
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.970
right in this lecture. Now for testing and seeing our code in action,

19
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.790
we also need a browser and there,

20
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.740
I recommend using Google Chrome.

21
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.220
Of course we will write code that runs in all browsers

22
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.210
we want to support, more on that in the browser support module but for development, Chrome is really amazing,

23
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.340
It has a lot of features that make development easier

24
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.530
and my strong recommendation therefore is to use Chrome for development even if you normally use a different

25
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.060
browser.

26
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.590
Really use Chrome to have the same result as I do here and to follow along smoothly. Again,

27
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.880
later you will learn how to make sure that the code runs in all browsers where it needs to run.

28
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.320
Now in Chrome, we will also use the developer tools which are built into Chrome, to have a look at our code,

29
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.740
debug it and so on and I'll also have a look at that

30
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.340
in the development and debugging section later in the course.

31
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.610
But with that, let's get started with the code editor, with the IDE, with Visual Studio Code. For that, you

32
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.560
can simply google for Visual Studio Code and you should find this page, code.visualstudio.com,

33
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.950
there you can learn more about this code editor and you can always check out the docs if you're interested

34
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.200
in diving deeper and of course you can also download an installer. Here it should already pick the right one

35
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.170
for your operating system, otherwise choose one from the dropdown, Visual Studio Code is available for

36
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.920
Mac, for Windows, for Linux. Simply download the installer from this page where you then also see some

37
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.540
getting started instructions and run through the installation process once you did so. It's a straightforward

38
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.090
installation process, nothing fancy about that, you can just go through the download and installer and install

39
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.220
Visual Studio Code on your system. Once you did that, you can open the editor and it should look something

40
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.240
like this.

41
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.390
Now if it doesn't have this dark mode look here, you can change the theme by going to your options here,

42
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:27.010
preferences and then color theme or using the shortcuts you see there, under windows you will find the

43
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.590
preferences under file. When you choose color theme, you can pick a theme and you see a bunch of themes

44
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.890
available. You can simply cycle through these themes with the arrow keys and check out which theme you

45
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.600
want to use.

46
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.760
Now I like this dark plus theme but of course you can go with the theme you like. You also see a

47
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.490
bunch of elements here at the start,

48
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.200
you can also customize this under view, appearance and there for example, you could get rid of that status

49
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.710
bar at the bottom if you wanted to.

50
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.700
Now I will add it back but you can tweak this to your likings to make sure that you see the information

51
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.950
you want to see.

52
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.610
Now as you see, we don't see our code here, so we can click open folder here or choose file open and then

53
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.720
choose the folder you do want to open

54
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.170
and here, I chose the folder with the starting code we saw earlier in this course, you'll find it

55
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.740
attached to this lecture again. Simply open the whole folder and now this will load this project into

56
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.940
Visual Studio Code here.

57
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.480
Now the colors of these files might look different,

58
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.360
that has something to do with version control,

59
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.890
something we don't have to worry about right now but you should see these files and folders here.

60
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.880
Again you won't see the gitignore and vscode file here,

61
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.030
these are folders and files only I have here for my configuration,

62
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.750
you should see the assets, info and index.html folders and file though.

63
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.080
Now what might also be different for you however is the icons you see here.

64
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.460
Now that's coming from a so-called extension I added, extensions are plugins you can add into your editor

65
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.370
to change it and tweak it to your likings.

66
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.060
You can add plugins and extensions by going here to these extensions part,

67
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.040
you can also get there by clicking on view extensions

68
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.890
and that's actually how I will navigate and I will remove that activity bar here on the left and just

69
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.540
navigate around with view

70
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.900
and then here, these shortcuts or these options

71
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.780
and now we're on the extensions part.

72
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.230
Now I already got a bunch of extensions installed, most of them are not required here for this development

73
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.610
but there are some which I do recommend using and one is the material

74
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.020
icon extension. You can just search for material icon and you should find the material

75
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.490
icon theme package.

76
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.010
Now this is totally optional but you can install it, you will have an install button here to get the same

77
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.420
file icons as I do,

78
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:51.040
so you can install it and then load the extension with the buttons you see here too add the same icons.

79
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.000
Another extension

80
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.090
I recommend using is prettier.

81
00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.680
You can search for prettier, written like this and install and enable this extension,

82
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.600
this is an extension which helps us with code formatting.

83
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.390
Now code formatting allows us to write clean and well-readable code because as you will see, a lot of

84
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.100
code is valid from a technical perspective but can be hard to read,

85
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.800
I'll show you an example in a second.

86
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.200
With that, we have all the core extensions

87
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.520
I would recommend here,

88
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.600
you don't need the other extensions I have here, they are not even related Javascript development necessarily

89
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.330
and therefore we should be good here.

90
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.150
You can now go back to the explorer view here to see your files again

91
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:40.480
and now let me show you how you should basically configure your project and what this code formatting

92
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.270
is all about.

93
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.900
For that, let's open the assets folder, scripts in there, app.js and there you see the script I'm giving to

94
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.900
you. Now

95
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:55.570
you already see here why we're using a code editor, this and also in the HTML file is much more readable

96
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.900
than this here,

97
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:57.530
right.

98
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.780
It's much more readable,

99
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.030
keywords are highlighted,

100
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:09.040
we also get information if we hover over something, we get useful auto completion if we type and so on

101
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.150
and you'll see all of that throughout this course as we write code.

102
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.380
You don't need to understand this code here of course, we'll learn all about that throughout this course

103
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.350
but I want to show you this auto formatting. Let's say here in line 6,

104
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.300
I don't have this whitespace at the beginning or I even have code like that.

105
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.650
Technically this is valid code, I can already tell you that, Javascript is able to understand and execute

106
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:39.440
this code but to us humans, it's a bit harder to read and that's where we can use so-called auto formatting.

107
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:48.850
If you go to code, preferences, keyboard shortcuts and there you search for format document, you will find

108
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.740
this shortcut with a certain shortcut attached to it, if you don't have one here, you can right click

109
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.940
on this and change the key binding to assign a shortcut

110
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:03.910
and this is a shortcut you can then press to auto format your code. You saw that, the code magically

111
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.930
changed to a more readable version,

112
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:13.630
this is something where prettier helps us. Now in general of course, you can tweak your keyboard shortcuts

113
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:19.100
here, not just the format document but any shortcut you might be using here in these settings

114
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.560
and you got a lot of shortcuts can use, of course you can use the official documentation to learn all

115
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.320
about Visual Studio Code already if you want to.

116
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.930
I will also share some useful hints with you in the development and debugging section later in the course.

117
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:37.480
One thing which I would recommend that you do is that you also dive into preferences settings right now

118
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.590
though and there, you can switch between user and workspace settings.

119
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:47.800
Basically user settings are settings that apply to all projects you manage with Visual Studio Code, workspace

120
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.220
settings only apply to this project,

121
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:55.200
for example here I got a workspace setting and that's where this .vscode folder is coming from, where

122
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.180
I set the zoom level to 6 so that this is more readable to you,

123
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.400
that's all I have in there. Now

124
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:08.440
under preferences settings, you can tweak your user or your project specific settings and there for example,

125
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:14.610
you can search for prettier and configure prettier here as you see and the various options it offers

126
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.100
to you to format code as you want,

127
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:24.470
for example some things I have set up there is that I want to add semicolons at the end of every line,

128
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.530
I have this checked.

129
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:31.570
I have single quote check to use single quotes for text and I have a tab width of two.

130
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.970
Now this is not something you have to do,

131
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.770
these are just my settings in case you want to have the same code output as I have it here.

132
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.910
And with that, we have a basic editor setup which we can use to write our code throughout this course.

133
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.480
Now let's come back to the browser.

134
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:52.380
As I said, I recommend that you use Chrome there and you might want to use incognito mode to avoid any

135
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:58.110
distractions by any Chrome extensions you might have installed which might interfere with your web page

136
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:04.950
and maybe do something which is not caused by your code but by some extension. Also important in Chrome

137
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:11.490
are the developer tools. You can get there by using view, developer, developer tools or the shortcut which

138
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:17.330
is shown there and these are the developer tools we'll also spend a lot of time in, I'll zoom in a bit

139
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:23.520
here to make it bit bigger and there for example, we have this console where we can output some development 

140
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.590
log messages, something we'll do throughout the course. We have the elements tab where we can see the

141
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.200
rendered HTML content and so on.

142
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.640
Now one important setting I want you to make here in the developer tools to also have the same output

143
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.420
and behavior here as I have it, in a console area

144
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.120
if you click on the gear icon here, make sure preserve log is not check.

145
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.760
This simply makes sure that whenever you reload the page, this log will be emptied and we see a new

146
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.210
log output for the currently running page,

147
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.790
now that's all. Now we'll have a close look at the developer tools in a separate module,

148
00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.720
I just already want you to be aware of them and I want you to make sure that you use Chrome and have a

149
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.650
properly setup editor and with that, we're all set,

150
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:10.620
we can now dive into Javascript, its basics and get started learning this amazing language.
