1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,250
We added our shadow Dom and this changed things by a lot.

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,420
It is the right way to go but we're now missing our text.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:19,060
We had there initially and will now dive into a feature called templates to define our base H2 melt

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:25,670
structure of this H2 male element of our custom element and two later all to bring back that text we

5
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:34,730
passed between the opening and closing tax of our custom element now for templates we got two alternatives.

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:42,500
The first alternative for adding a template to our custom element is to go into our H2 female document

7
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,850
and there we can add a new element the template element.

8
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:53,570
This is a simple element built into the browser understood by the browser and the important thing here

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,940
is that this element is not rendered automatically now.

10
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:10,990
Here we can take our question mark and added in there like this we had it in the spans let's wrap it

11
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,340
in a span here to

12
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,840
select at.

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,160
Now we have a template which in the end is just dead span with the question mark inside of it.

14
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:29,120
So this is now our template and now we want to use that template as a blueprint for the age team Al

15
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,460
content that makes up are a custom element.

16
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,780
So previously we simply created that age similar content in the Connected callback and we happen to

17
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,940
have a very simple email template for our tooltip.

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,600
We only have this span with the Question Mark being added but it's easy to imagine more complex custom

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,370
elements like a video player which has a dozens of buttons and so on.

20
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,170
Now to use that content of the template in our web component.

21
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:06,400
Now all first of all give this template an idea of tooltip template for example and now in the tooltip

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,690
chars file in the constructor where we can access to normal Dom.

23
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,630
Just not the dom of this tooltip.

24
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,270
But we don't need that here there.

25
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:25,850
I will now get my template an old story and a constant by using the document query selector again accessing

26
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,380
the normal page dorm not the dom of this custom component.

27
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:38,610
And there I will use the I.D. selector to select the tooltip template so I'm using that I.D. which are

28
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:47,910
just added to my template now get access to this template and now I'm when I'm basically copy the code

29
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,500
I set up in that template.

30
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,680
So this span in this case here and use it as a template for my custom component.

31
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,040
And for that I will simply access my shadow route which is a way lable because I attached to shadow

32
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,360
Dom and there I will call append child.

33
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,930
I can do that here because I can already access the shadow Dom even before the element has been rendered

34
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:19,400
to the real Dom because the shadow Dom remember is kind of abstracted away from the real Dom anyways

35
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:27,110
so this is a way little in the constructor and now I will append a child here and the child is my template

36
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,680
and there we can access a content property to access basically the content inside of the template and

37
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,090
all the content we can call clone.

38
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:44,330
Note and there you have to pass a boolean indicating whether you want to do a deep clone or a shallow

39
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:49,360
clone a deep clone means that you would clone any nested elements in there too.

40
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:55,520
So if you had like a h1 tag inside of that span you would clone that too if you set the argument to

41
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,420
true.

42
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,000
If you set it to false you would only clone the top level of elements.

43
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:10,440
Now I will perform a deep clone here by setting this to true and with that for now safe that and we

44
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,000
reload that page we see double quotation marks here actually.

45
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,490
The reason for that being that we still have our code in there to add another question mark.

46
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:26,340
So we should remove dead and in addition I will just changed is a little bit down there.

47
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,690
Here I will set my tooltip icon equal to this shadow root.

48
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,540
And now here I want to find that span by simply adding a query selector because we can query to shadow

49
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,660
Dom just as just as we can query in a normal Dom.

50
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,810
Now we'll find that spanned there and with dad if I save that and we reload this page we have one question

51
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,470
mark only.

52
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,330
But I can still hover over that.

53
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,460
So now we are using our template our HDL template here.

54
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,440
Now this is one way of doing it but of course this has a couple of drawbacks.

55
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:09,420
For example this web component now requires some content to be added to our t email file where we in

56
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,110
the end just want to use that Web component.

57
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,320
And of course we're still losing that text here.

58
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,380
Now we can fix that text even with this approach but it will all just show you an alternative.

59
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:26,880
Cuties approach because it would be nice to have all the web component being composed in our JavaScript

60
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:34,650
file here so that we don't have to add a template to the civil code and we'll show you both this solution

61
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,520
and a solution for our lost text here over the next lectures.
