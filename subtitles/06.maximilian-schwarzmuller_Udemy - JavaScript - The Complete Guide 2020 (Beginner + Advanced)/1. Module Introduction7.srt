1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,570
Time for another module about functions.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,780
Wait, didn't we already have two modules that talked about functions?

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,780
Well, that will be the last one

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:19,510
but in this module, we'll dive into some advanced concepts which you need to know about Javascript functions,

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,570
which are definitely not beginner level but which are important.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,110
Specifically, we'll have a look at pure functions and side effects,

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,300
what that is and why it matters.

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:37,390
We'll have a look at factory functions, what that is. We'll have a look at closures and therefore revisit this

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,660
concept of scope which we already learned about

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,500
and last but not least, we'll explore a specific way of working with functions,

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,230
we'll have a look at recursion,

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,700
what this is, what it means and when it can be handy.

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,900
So with that, let's not waste any time and dive right in.
