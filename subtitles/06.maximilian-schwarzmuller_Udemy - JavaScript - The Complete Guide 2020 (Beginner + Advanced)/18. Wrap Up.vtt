00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.330
Now that's it for debugging and for writing efficient code.

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.470
In this module, you learned a lot about how to use and utilize and configure your IDE and make sure

3
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.680
you really do explore the features you can use there so that you can write code efficiently.

4
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.430
Make sure you do configure your IDE to suit your needs, both regarding its looks but also regarding

5
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.840
the way it works.

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.360
You learned about MDN and what a great resource it is and how to google correctly and use stack

7
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.700
overflow to find help

8
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.460
and you also learned about the Chrome debugging tools and how you can use your IDE for debugging to

9
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.360
run your code,

10
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.090
pause your code, find errors and also of course make sure that the app works the way it should.

11
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.560
These are crucial features,

12
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.230
as a developer, they're just as important to know as is the Javascript language itself,

13
00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.270
so really make sure that these are the things you feel comfortable working with, that you are comfortable

14
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.440
working with the debugging tools and with all of that, we are well-prepared to now dive back into Javascript,

15
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.850
dive deeper into it because now, we don't just have the very basics about Javascript down but we also

16
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.780
know how to write code, how to get help, how to debug and fix errors and hence we can now dive deeper

17
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.650
into Javascript.
