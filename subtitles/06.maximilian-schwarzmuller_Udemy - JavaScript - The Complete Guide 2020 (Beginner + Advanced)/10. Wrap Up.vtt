Now this is as deep as I want to dive into this.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.640
As I mentioned, all these features you learned about in this module are pretty niche - symbols, iterators,

3
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:19.920
generators, the reflect API and the proxy API all have their use cases but the use cases are pretty

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.750
advanced and often found in scenarios where you are writing code which is not directly impacting end

5
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.790
users of an application,

6
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.390
so people visiting the web site but instead other developers that might depend on your code because you

7
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.810
are authoring a third-party library, because you are working in a team or you're writing your own reusable

8
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.150
code which you maybe want to reuse in different projects you're working on. Then these features can help

9
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.330
you control how the code can be used, how it behaves, how certain things are locked down or controlled

10
00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:01.530
behind the scenes. You can make your objects loopable with the iterator, symbol and generators and iterators

11
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.650
and with symbols in general, you also have a feature that allows you to have properties and objects which

12
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.070
are not that easy to access and which most importantly are not that easy to change because you need

13
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.670
the exact same symbol to access it.

14
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.240
So with these meta features, with these advanced features, you are now really fully prepared to become

15
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.600
an expert Javascript developer and dive into all the depths of the language and whenever you encounter

16
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.490
these features anywhere, you know what they're doing and how you can work with them.
