00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,970
And that's it for libraries. As I mentioned,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,890
there are thousands of libraries and therefore it's impossible to go through all of them. As you grow

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,790
as a developer, as you work with Javascript day-to-day,

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,510
you'll encounter many libraries.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,770
It turns out you often just work with the same five or six popular ones

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:27,330
but if you have a specific problem which you want to solve, then as I explained, using Google really is

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:34,050
the way to read more about the problem and in that process, you'll often stumble across libraries which

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,470
you might want to have a look at

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:41,130
with the help of Github to find out how they work, if they're actively maintained, if they're popular

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:48,270
and so on and that's therefore then it. This is it for this module, this hopefully helps you use libraries

11
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,720
and improve your projects and it allows you to focus on your core business logic and not reinvent the

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,760
wheel over and over again.
