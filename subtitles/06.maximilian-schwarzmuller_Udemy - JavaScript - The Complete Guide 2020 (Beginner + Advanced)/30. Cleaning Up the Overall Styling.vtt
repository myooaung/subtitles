00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.580
So now did we talk a lot about styling.

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:13.070
Let me make the styling we have in place here a bit more pretty now for Dad and first of all go into

3
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.430
my light Dom add a star selector and set the global box sizing for all my border and for all my elements

4
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.910
to border box and now I'm just really working on the visuals.

5
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.680
This is nothing else although the fun family of san serif so that all my funds have this sensory look

6
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.760
looks a bit nicer already in my opinion.

7
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:40.390
I will also in my light Dawn get rid of this ugly blue border around my tool tip was just there for

8
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.960
demonstration purposes.

9
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.730
Also get rid of the highlight clause which we are not setting anything.

10
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.310
Let me also get rid of that div with the orange border and get rid of that orange border style up there.

11
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.250
I really just want to make this a bit more pretty.

12
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.460
Before we continue now this looks much better already.

13
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.600
And now let me dive into my web component styles and there for example Ford is overlay when I hover

14
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.740
over this I want to add some padding here and make this look a bit nicer.

15
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.700
Maybe a little drop shadow so Ford is hovering content which of course is this div here and we could

16
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.900
of course also use a C as this clause or ideas here if you wanted to there.

17
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:30.980
I'll give it as a padding of 1 as 0 1 5 rem border radius maybe of free pixels and a box shadow of 1

18
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:39.330
pixel 1 pixel 6 pixels and then disk styling which is transparent grey ish look.

19
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.890
If I now reload and I hover over does Fox shadow is missing.

20
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.130
Yeah because I forgot my colon here so let's fix this.

21
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.390
Yeah and this looks much nicer.

22
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.450
Let me also tweak the positioning it has position absolute but I want to move it down a little bit by

23
00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.450
setting top 2.

24
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:08.290
Let's say one room and left also 2 0 7 5 room maybe let's see how that looks like

25
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.730
move it down by 2 REM

26
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.750
Yeah.

27
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.220
Maybe one got 5

28
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.610
right.

29
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.150
I liked his way more looks better in my opinion now I also don't want is text in there to be bold just

30
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.440
because the overall component text is bolded because of host context so I will give my div You're a

31
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:49.210
font weight of normal so don't use that bold font weight I set for my eyebrow text so no I don't have

32
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.120
that bold styling in there anymore.

33
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.490
And now last but not least there's one other thing when I set this background color.

34
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.790
If I have the important tag then I also want to add a little bit of padding around my component let's

35
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.870
say so that the color does not sit directly on the edges.

36
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.370
And now this looks OK.

37
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.350
This is how I wanted to be.

38
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.400
This is a style I can live with.

39
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.820
Now with that let's move on and let's see which I recall functionalities we can add to our custom Web

40
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.390
components.
