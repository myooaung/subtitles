00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.960
Here is the app we've been working on in the last course module opened in Visual Studio Code.

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.890
Now that's the editor, the IDE we've been using throughout this course

3
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.130
and I showed how to set it up and how to basically configure it in the first course module,

4
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.560
so definitely make sure you watch that,

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.040
well I guess otherwise the last module was a bit hard to follow along anyways.

6
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:32.890
Now this editor is configured to suit my needs and I recommended some basic configuration which I like because

7
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.030
I don't think I have that much of a special taste,

8
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.460
still make sure you tweak this to your likings and that starts with the look. In Visual Studio Code

9
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:50.260
and of course in most or in all editors and IDEs, you will find similar settings, you are able to adjust its

10
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:57.370
appearance. In Visual Studio Code, you do that under code preferences and then for example here, the color

11
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.510
theme. The color theme is the core thing that influences how the editor looks like and a lot of people

12
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.110
prefer the dark look I have here, in my case with the dark plus default dark theme but you can also go

13
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.940
for a light theme if you're a fan of this or choose one of the many other install themes you find there.

14
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.390
You can also install additional themes with the help of the extensions section which I'll dive into

15
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.000
in a second.

16
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.460
So the theme here is the first thing with which it all starts, now besides the general theme, you can

17
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.920
also set a file icon theme here in Visual Studio Code and there, I installed the material icon theme

18
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.710
with you in course module one. You can of course also go with one of the built-in themes or install any

19
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.820
other theme you want,

20
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.910
either with this shortcut here but this will also just lead you to the extensions marketplace if you want

21
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.980
to call it like this and we'll have a look at that in a second.

22
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.450
So the look of course should really suit your needs.

23
00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.660
It's also not just a theme and the icons, also make sure that here in the view section, you configure

24
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.810
the appearance the way you want it to look, that you show the side bar or the status bar, maybe show one

25
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.210
of the other things you can show here, like that activity panel here which I personally don't like to

26
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.190
have which is why I remove it here.

27
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.200
So really play around with these settings and find a layout that you like, that works for you, that allows

28
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.520
you to be productive.
