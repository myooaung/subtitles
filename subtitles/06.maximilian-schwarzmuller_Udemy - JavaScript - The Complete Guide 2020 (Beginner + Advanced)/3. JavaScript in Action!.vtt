00:00:02.020  -->  00:00:04.069
Now let's simply see an example,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9096119

2

00:00:04.069  -->  00:00:07.656
which should make this clearer for that attached you find
NOTE Confidence: 0.9096119

3

00:00:07.719  -->  00:00:08.789
a simple project,
NOTE Confidence: 0.885053577058824

4

00:00:08.789  -->  00:00:12.222
which has? Free folders or 2 folders in one file
NOTE Confidence: 0.885053577058824

5

00:00:12.294  -->  00:00:15.083
assets folder at info folder and index.
NOTE Confidence: 0.881779134

6

00:00:15.083  -->  00:00:18.720
HTML file the extra folders and files we see here.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9145449

7

00:00:18.720  -->  00:00:21.588
Are just here in my local setup for version control
NOTE Confidence: 0.9145449

8

00:00:21.645  -->  00:00:23.163
and for my editor settings.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9145449

9

00:00:23.163  -->  00:00:24.607
We can ignore them right?
NOTE Confidence: 0.9145449

10

00:00:24.607  -->  00:00:25.995
Now you don't need them,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9145449

11

00:00:25.995  -->  00:00:28.550
they're not related to the web page so we get.
NOTE Confidence: 0.89404875

12

00:00:28.550  -->  00:00:31.991
3 things in there to folders and the index HTML
NOTE Confidence: 0.89404875

13

00:00:32.064  -->  00:00:35.871
file now you can simply double click that index HTML
NOTE Confidence: 0.89404875

14

00:00:35.944  -->  00:00:36.310
file.
NOTE Confidence: 0.915616751

15

00:00:36.310  -->  00:00:38.489
And it will open up here in a new browser
NOTE Confidence: 0.915616751

16

00:00:38.542  -->  00:00:41.040
window where it should at least have not open a
NOTE Confidence: 0.915616751

17

00:00:41.093  -->  00:00:41.890
browser window.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8815282

18

00:00:41.890  -->  00:00:44.443
And drag the index HTML file into it now.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8815282

19

00:00:44.443  -->  00:00:46.205
This is a little dummy page.
NOTE Confidence: 0.90082506

20

00:00:46.205  -->  00:00:49.450
I prepared for you. It holds some damning information about
NOTE Confidence: 0.90082506

21

00:00:49.505  -->  00:00:50.825
this course in about me,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9078421

22

00:00:50.825  -->  00:00:53.840
your instructor all this information is valid by the way.
NOTE Confidence: 0.914327741

23

00:00:53.840  -->  00:00:56.306
But of course, we're not building.
NOTE Confidence: 0.914327741

24

00:00:56.306  -->  00:00:58.419
This web page here right now.
NOTE Confidence: 0.914327741

25

00:00:58.419  -->  00:01:01.136
This is mostly HTML and CSS S or to be
NOTE Confidence: 0.914327741

26

00:01:01.208  -->  00:01:01.780
precise.
NOTE Confidence: 0.923024

27

00:01:01.780  -->  00:01:04.342
It's pretty much all HTML and CSS S at this
NOTE Confidence: 0.923024

28

00:01:04.402  -->  00:01:04.759
point,
NOTE Confidence: 0.923024

29

00:01:04.759  -->  00:01:07.388
and you can always go back to these files and
NOTE Confidence: 0.923024

30

00:01:07.446  -->  00:01:08.790
then the assets folder.
NOTE Confidence: 0.891509056

31

00:01:08.790  -->  00:01:11.758
You'll find images folder with my image.
NOTE Confidence: 0.891509056

32

00:01:11.758  -->  00:01:15.377
You'll find a styles folder with the CSS files and
NOTE Confidence: 0.891509056

33

00:01:15.449  -->  00:01:16.390
if you would.
NOTE Confidence: 0.919006348

34

00:01:16.390  -->  00:01:18.865
Look into the index HTML file for example,
NOTE Confidence: 0.919006348

35

00:01:18.865  -->  00:01:20.303
by right clicking on it,
NOTE Confidence: 0.919006348

36

00:01:20.303  -->  00:01:22.260
and opening it with a text editor.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9055997

37

00:01:22.260  -->  00:01:25.376
And you can use your text editor on Mac or
NOTE Confidence: 0.9055997

38

00:01:25.450  -->  00:01:29.233
the normal notepad or text editor on windows if you
NOTE Confidence: 0.9055997

39

00:01:29.307  -->  00:01:31.310
are using text edit on Mac.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9077755

40

00:01:31.310  -->  00:01:34.972
Go to preferences here. And on open and save make
NOTE Confidence: 0.9077755

41

00:01:35.046  -->  00:01:36.541
sure you check this.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9011011

42

00:01:36.541  -->  00:01:40.604
Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text
NOTE Confidence: 0.9011011

43

00:01:40.675  -->  00:01:40.960
box.
NOTE Confidence: 0.828062356

44

00:01:40.960  -->  00:01:43.770
Then close this and reopen.
NOTE Confidence: 0.891241252

45

00:01:43.770  -->  00:01:47.902
With Textedit and there's only applies to Mac here and
NOTE Confidence: 0.891241252

46

00:01:47.978  -->  00:01:50.350
you will see the raw HTML code.
NOTE Confidence: 0.927722335

47

00:01:50.350  -->  00:01:52.591
So this is a bunch of HTML code here.
NOTE Confidence: 0.927722335

48

00:01:52.591  -->  00:01:55.775
But what you won't see in there is anything JavaScript
NOTE Confidence: 0.927722335

49

00:01:55.834  -->  00:01:57.190
in this file it's just.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8355378

50

00:01:57.190  -->  00:02:00.640
HTML and some imported CSS styles.
NOTE Confidence: 0.905778944

51

00:02:00.640  -->  00:02:03.650
This needs to this page and here on this page.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9073672

52

00:02:03.650  -->  00:02:07.170
We have these 2 links dynamic interpreted and weekly type
NOTE Confidence: 0.9073672

53

00:02:07.232  -->  00:02:10.073
that if you click on any of these links you're
NOTE Confidence: 0.9073672

54

00:02:10.135  -->  00:02:11.370
taken to a new page.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9208311

55

00:02:11.370  -->  00:02:14.650
Here's the dynamic page where we see a more detailed
NOTE Confidence: 0.9208311

56

00:02:14.713  -->  00:02:15.470
explanation.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8827327

57

00:02:15.470  -->  00:02:17.970
And here is the weakly typed page.
NOTE Confidence: 0.929129839

58

00:02:17.970  -->  00:02:20.693
Now, what we have here is a traditional web page
NOTE Confidence: 0.929129839

59

00:02:20.749  -->  00:02:23.189
and what we also have here is a new request
NOTE Confidence: 0.929129839

60

00:02:23.245  -->  00:02:24.550
being sent to a server.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9005026

61

00:02:24.550  -->  00:02:27.377
If this were served by a server instead of our
NOTE Confidence: 0.9005026

62

00:02:27.438  -->  00:02:30.695
local file system and the new page being loaded right
NOTE Confidence: 0.9005026

63

00:02:30.756  -->  00:02:33.030
we're always loading a new page here.
NOTE Confidence: 0.945164263

64

00:02:33.030  -->  00:02:35.733
Of course, there's nothing wrong with that,
NOTE Confidence: 0.945164263

65

00:02:35.733  -->  00:02:38.679
but a more modern way a more user friendly way
NOTE Confidence: 0.945164263

66

00:02:38.743  -->  00:02:39.640
of doing that.
NOTE Confidence: 0.915720344

67

00:02:39.640  -->  00:02:42.175
Might be to not load a new page here,
NOTE Confidence: 0.915720344

68

00:02:42.175  -->  00:02:45.310
but instead to show this piece of information,
NOTE Confidence: 0.898651504

69

00:02:45.310  -->  00:02:48.472
maybe in an? Overlay to the existing page.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8884102

70

00:02:48.472  -->  00:02:52.161
Such a modal as it's called little pop up like
NOTE Confidence: 0.8884102

71

00:02:52.242  -->  00:02:52.803
window,
NOTE Confidence: 0.899397254545455

72

00:02:52.803  -->  00:02:57.141
which gets loaded. As a overlay on this already existing
NOTE Confidence: 0.899397254545455

73

00:02:57.219  -->  00:02:57.606
page,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9035174

74

00:02:57.606  -->  00:03:00.761
so that we don't need to fetch a new HTML
NOTE Confidence: 0.9035174

75

00:03:00.838  -->  00:03:01.530
page and.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9063469

76

00:03:01.530  -->  00:03:03.525
Break the user experience of it,
NOTE Confidence: 0.906346899999999

77

00:03:03.525  -->  00:03:06.971
therefore, but instead that we stay on this existing page
NOTE Confidence: 0.906346899999999

78

00:03:07.031  -->  00:03:09.510
and only tweak it a little bit so we kind
NOTE Confidence: 0.906346899999999

79

00:03:09.570  -->  00:03:10.840
of need to tweak the?
NOTE Confidence: 0.903675556

80

00:03:10.840  -->  00:03:13.290
Existing HTML code this code here,
NOTE Confidence: 0.903675556

81

00:03:13.290  -->  00:03:16.090
which was loaded by the browser whilst.
NOTE Confidence: 0.903675556

82

00:03:16.090  -->  00:03:19.100
We are on the page so without loading a new
NOTE Confidence: 0.903675556

83

00:03:19.170  -->  00:03:19.870
HTML file.
NOTE Confidence: 0.911855

84

00:03:19.870  -->  00:03:23.336
That's the idea and that is where JavaScript can help
NOTE Confidence: 0.911855

85

00:03:23.402  -->  00:03:26.410
us and why JavaScript was invented and why it.
NOTE Confidence: 0.92302537

86

00:03:26.410  -->  00:03:29.959
Is so important these days be cause any modern website
NOTE Confidence: 0.92302537

87

00:03:30.025  -->  00:03:34.100
you visit all these exciting user interactions you have there?
NOTE Confidence: 0.921371758

88

00:03:34.100  -->  00:03:37.320
With drop downs with overlays and so on all of
NOTE Confidence: 0.921371758

89

00:03:37.390  -->  00:03:40.820
that is driven by JavaScript and we can turn this
NOTE Confidence: 0.921371758

90

00:03:40.890  -->  00:03:41.590
page here.
NOTE Confidence: 0.898881555

91

00:03:41.590  -->  00:03:43.513
Thank you more exciting page as well,
NOTE Confidence: 0.898881555

92

00:03:43.513  -->  00:03:45.930
I prepared something for you.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9207596

93

00:03:45.930  -->  00:03:48.010
You might have noticed that in this.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9029985

94

00:03:48.010  -->  00:03:51.671
Starting code I provided to you in the assets folder.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9029985

95

00:03:51.671  -->  00:03:54.992
You also have a scripts folder with a huge file
NOTE Confidence: 0.9029985

96

00:03:55.063  -->  00:03:58.455
dot JS stands for JavaScript and this is how you
NOTE Confidence: 0.9029985

97

00:03:58.525  -->  00:04:00.080
store JavaScript code.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8818099

98

00:04:00.080  -->  00:04:02.369
In JavaScript now we can of course,
NOTE Confidence: 0.8818099

99

00:04:02.369  -->  00:04:05.720
also inspect that file by clicking on open with.
NOTE Confidence: 0.891256

100

00:04:05.720  -->  00:04:07.980
And then also texted it.
NOTE Confidence: 0.918324947

101

00:04:07.980  -->  00:04:09.960
And what you see in there.
NOTE Confidence: 0.936642349

102

00:04:09.960  -->  00:04:12.373
Is JavaScript code now at this point of time?
NOTE Confidence: 0.936642349

103

00:04:12.373  -->  00:04:14.052
Of course you won't understand.
NOTE Confidence: 0.936642349

104

00:04:14.052  -->  00:04:16.675
All this code? Maybe you understand none of that,
NOTE Confidence: 0.936642349

105

00:04:16.675  -->  00:04:19.350
if you have no previous experience with JavaScript.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9127664

106

00:04:19.350  -->  00:04:22.397
And will of course changed it throughout the course will
NOTE Confidence: 0.9127664

107

00:04:22.452  -->  00:04:25.281
start at the core basics and you will understand all
NOTE Confidence: 0.9127664

108

00:04:25.336  -->  00:04:25.880
this code.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9147665

109

00:04:25.880  -->  00:04:28.473
Once we progress throughout the course and of course,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9147665

110

00:04:28.473  -->  00:04:29.913
once we completed the course.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9147665

111

00:04:29.913  -->  00:04:31.978
But for now, we can just take this code for
NOTE Confidence: 0.9147665

112

00:04:32.026  -->  00:04:32.410
granted.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8923079

113

00:04:32.410  -->  00:04:34.292
Close this file and ignore it,
NOTE Confidence: 0.8923079

114

00:04:34.292  -->  00:04:36.781
and instead. Let's go back to our index.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8923079

115

00:04:36.781  -->  00:04:39.452
HTML file to the source code we open here in
NOTE Confidence: 0.8923079

116

00:04:39.512  -->  00:04:40.180
the editor.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8619854

117

00:04:40.180  -->  00:04:43.570
And below this link here where we import the app
NOTE Confidence: 0.8619854

118

00:04:43.641  -->  00:04:45.760
CS as file above the hat here.
NOTE Confidence: 0.897383034

119

00:04:45.760  -->  00:04:48.810
Let's add a new HTML tag.
NOTE Confidence: 0.856456665

120

00:04:48.810  -->  00:04:52.760
Script. Also, closing tag for it.
NOTE Confidence: 0.81246984

121

00:04:52.760  -->  00:04:58.755
And then add a SRC attribute to script here and
NOTE Confidence: 0.81246984

122

00:04:58.882  -->  00:05:02.709
point at assets slash scripts,
NOTE Confidence: 0.88122102

123

00:05:02.709  -->  00:05:06.915
slash apdj so at. This JavaScript file we just had
NOTE Confidence: 0.88122102

124

00:05:06.999  -->  00:05:07.840
a look at.
NOTE Confidence: 0.885830343

125

00:05:07.840  -->  00:05:09.752
That alone won't do the trick.
NOTE Confidence: 0.885830343

126

00:05:09.752  -->  00:05:11.880
Let's also Scroll down a bit.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8836786

127

00:05:11.880  -->  00:05:14.651
And go to these 2 links we have here to
NOTE Confidence: 0.8836786

128

00:05:14.722  -->  00:05:17.920
dynamic interpreted and the weekly type link.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8491334

129

00:05:17.920  -->  00:05:21.289
Now, Dear. Let's remove that link to info.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8491334

130

00:05:21.289  -->  00:05:24.410
Dynamic HTML and add a hash instead.
NOTE Confidence: 0.890719533

131

00:05:24.410  -->  00:05:27.700
And instead add a new attribute here.
NOTE Confidence: 0.870756

132

00:05:27.700  -->  00:05:31.246
Data dash text to this anchor tag here equals and
NOTE Confidence: 0.870756

133

00:05:31.318  -->  00:05:34.430
then double quotes and now let's go to the.
NOTE Confidence: 0.892165542

134

00:05:34.430  -->  00:05:37.801
Info folder and then to the dynamic HTML file open
NOTE Confidence: 0.892165542

135

00:05:37.868  -->  00:05:41.239
that with the text editor and simply grab the text
NOTE Confidence: 0.892165542

136

00:05:41.306  -->  00:05:42.520
you have in there.
NOTE Confidence: 0.886105359

137

00:05:42.520  -->  00:05:46.260
Between the paragraph tax excluding the paragraph tax.
NOTE Confidence: 0.886188011727273

138

00:05:46.260  -->  00:05:51.647
And copy that. And paste that here between the double
NOTE Confidence: 0.886188011727273

139

00:05:51.749  -->  00:05:52.460
quotes.
NOTE Confidence: 0.915494561

140

00:05:52.460  -->  00:05:54.812
Now make sure you get rid of any line breaks.
NOTE Confidence: 0.915494561

141

00:05:54.812  -->  00:05:57.420
You might have in their becaus that will not work,
NOTE Confidence: 0.915494561

142

00:05:57.420  -->  00:05:59.764
so that this is all one long line of code
NOTE Confidence: 0.915494561

143

00:05:59.821  -->  00:06:00.450
in the end.
NOTE Confidence: 0.87443006

144

00:06:00.450  -->  00:06:03.438
And they're off to read one more thing to the
NOTE Confidence: 0.87443006

145

00:06:03.505  -->  00:06:04.700
anchor tech class.
NOTE Confidence: 0.7736341

146

00:06:04.700  -->  00:06:08.560
To add a CSS S class info dash modal?
NOTE Confidence: 0.89373345

147

00:06:08.560  -->  00:06:12.208
Now repeat that. We can copy all of these attributes
NOTE Confidence: 0.89373345

148

00:06:12.278  -->  00:06:16.136
on the second linked and replace its reference with the
NOTE Confidence: 0.89373345

149

00:06:16.206  -->  00:06:18.030
hashtag reference as well.
NOTE Confidence: 0.843386054

150

00:06:18.030  -->  00:06:20.284
And the text. We show there should of course,
NOTE Confidence: 0.843386054

151

00:06:20.284  -->  00:06:22.440
now be the text we find in the weakly typed.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8712844

152

00:06:22.440  -->  00:06:25.770
HTML files if you open that with a text editor,
NOTE Confidence: 0.86669176

153

00:06:25.770  -->  00:06:28.068
Let's grab this. Text here,
NOTE Confidence: 0.8598028

154

00:06:28.068  -->  00:06:31.700
we find in their copy it.
NOTE Confidence: 0.895099163

155

00:06:31.700  -->  00:06:35.635
And also replaced the text here on the second anchor
NOTE Confidence: 0.895099163

156

00:06:35.711  -->  00:06:39.192
tag with this text now again make sure you get
NOTE Confidence: 0.895099163

157

00:06:39.267  -->  00:06:39.570
rid.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9011056

158

00:06:39.570  -->  00:06:43.470
Of any line breaks you might have here.
NOTE Confidence: 0.876382232

159

00:06:43.470  -->  00:06:46.250
Becaus these will break your code.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8906199

160

00:06:46.250  -->  00:06:49.612
Now, with that let's go back to our script important.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8906199

161

00:06:49.612  -->  00:06:53.063
Add one important word here after the SRC attribute and
NOTE Confidence: 0.8906199

162

00:06:53.126  -->  00:06:54.820
that's the defer attribute.
NOTE Confidence: 0.908724666

163

00:06:54.820  -->  00:06:57.875
This controls how and when this JavaScript code is executed
NOTE Confidence: 0.908724666

164

00:06:57.927  -->  00:07:00.360
and I'll dive back into this a little bit later
NOTE Confidence: 0.908724666

165

00:07:00.412  -->  00:07:00.826
for now,
NOTE Confidence: 0.877114087578947

166

00:07:00.826  -->  00:07:04.095
let's just add it. Then saved as whole index HTML
NOTE Confidence: 0.877114087578947

167

00:07:04.162  -->  00:07:06.830
file go back to your page and reload it.
NOTE Confidence: 0.899577439

168

00:07:06.830  -->  00:07:09.192
By simply clicking the reload I can hear and then
NOTE Confidence: 0.899577439

169

00:07:09.240  -->  00:07:10.590
click on one of these links.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8829134

170

00:07:10.590  -->  00:07:13.240
And now you will get this nice overlay here,
NOTE Confidence: 0.8829134

171

00:07:13.240  -->  00:07:16.520
which you can also close by clicking on that backdrop.
NOTE Confidence: 0.931078255

172

00:07:16.520  -->  00:07:18.530
Now, what we have here.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9258995

173

00:07:18.530  -->  00:07:23.477
Is knew content which is dynamically added to the existing
NOTE Confidence: 0.9258995

174

00:07:23.562  -->  00:07:24.330
web page?
NOTE Confidence: 0.920012832

175

00:07:24.330  -->  00:07:28.667
By JavaScript were not loading a new web page here.
NOTE Confidence: 0.920012832

176

00:07:28.667  -->  00:07:32.770
Instead, this overlay is shown by JavaScript.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9083986

177

00:07:32.770  -->  00:07:36.299
And this of course, is a way better user experience.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9083986

178

00:07:36.299  -->  00:07:39.149
Becaus now we don't send the user off to a
NOTE Confidence: 0.9083986

179

00:07:39.217  -->  00:07:39.828
new page.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9083986

180

00:07:39.828  -->  00:07:41.360
We don't wait for knew.
NOTE Confidence: 0.923962951

181

00:07:41.360  -->  00:07:45.340
HTML code to be downloaded which change the existing page.
NOTE Confidence: 0.923962951

182

00:07:45.340  -->  00:07:48.308
This is something you see on a lot of modern
NOTE Confidence: 0.923962951

183

00:07:48.375  -->  00:07:49.050
web pages.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9282093

184

00:07:49.050  -->  00:07:51.994
Because it's faster it's more like in a mobile app
NOTE Confidence: 0.9282093

185

00:07:52.053  -->  00:07:54.821
where you also don't have to wait for things to
NOTE Confidence: 0.9282093

186

00:07:54.880  -->  00:07:55.410
complete.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9052969

187

00:07:55.410  -->  00:07:58.708
And effort this is one of the core reasons why
NOTE Confidence: 0.9052969

188

00:07:58.780  -->  00:08:00.787
JavaScript is dad important,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9052969

189

00:08:00.787  -->  00:08:02.980
it allows us to make web pages.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9199236

190

00:08:02.980  -->  00:08:06.818
More dynamic. So if we come back to that question
NOTE Confidence: 0.9199236

191

00:08:06.897  -->  00:08:08.620
of what JavaScript is.
NOTE Confidence: 0.903039634

192

00:08:08.620  -->  00:08:11.755
If I quickly dive into the core things we learned
NOTE Confidence: 0.903039634

193

00:08:11.819  -->  00:08:13.290
on this previous slide.
NOTE Confidence: 0.903039634

194

00:08:13.290  -->  00:08:16.950
JavaScript is a dynamic weakly typed programming language.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9319021

195

00:08:16.950  -->  00:08:21.180
It's interpreted language, which means it's compiled on the fly.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9319021

196

00:08:21.180  -->  00:08:25.410
It's compiled before it runs and not compiled during development.
NOTE Confidence: 0.92251724

197

00:08:25.410  -->  00:08:28.725
As some other programming languages are it's a hosted language
NOTE Confidence: 0.92251724

198

00:08:28.779  -->  00:08:30.704
that runs in different environments,
NOTE Confidence: 0.92251724

199

00:08:30.704  -->  00:08:32.716
though, thus far in the last example.
NOTE Confidence: 0.90869107

200

00:08:32.716  -->  00:08:34.366
We just saw it. Run in the browser,
NOTE Confidence: 0.8948649

201

00:08:34.366  -->  00:08:36.917
but I'll come back to our environments in this course
NOTE Confidence: 0.8948649

202

00:08:36.965  -->  00:08:37.350
as well.
NOTE Confidence: 0.895386159

203

00:08:37.350  -->  00:08:39.964
And the most prominent use cases to case.
NOTE Confidence: 0.895386159

204

00:08:39.964  -->  00:08:42.830
We just thought we run code in a browser on
NOTE Confidence: 0.895386159

205

00:08:42.897  -->  00:08:45.230
a web page to make it more dynamic.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9185938

206

00:08:45.230  -->  00:08:47.773
So now we understand why we use JavaScript and what
NOTE Confidence: 0.9185938

207

00:08:47.823  -->  00:08:48.770
it allows us to do,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9185938

208

00:08:48.770  -->  00:08:49.950
but what do these turns?
NOTE Confidence: 0.9274785

209

00:08:49.950  -->  00:08:56.269
Dynamic weakly typed, and interpreted as well as host language
NOTE Confidence: 0.9274785

210

00:08:56.371  -->  00:08:57.900
mean in detail.
