X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.100
Moving down from the table head section and onto

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.580
the body where we can have each product line.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.030
You can also add in as many of these products as you would like to.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.945
Over to the editor, and we can begin to add the section.

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:19.215
In the last section, we created the table heading.

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:22.150
If we locate the closing tag for these elements,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.925
we can get to work on the body section.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:29.255
Just below the thead, add in the tbody.

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:34.340
Then place inside a class which will give us the white background color.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.300
Inside of the first row with the tr elements,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.255
the first piece of table data contains three things.

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:45.355
It contains a checkbox,

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:48.895
so add the inputs with the type of checkbox.

00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:51.890
This is going to sit just below this one here.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.490
Alongside our checkbox, we'll add the image elements,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.710
and the image element is going to be the picture,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.230
which we want to place next to each smoothie.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.135
Finally, the p element,

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:04.990
and let's go for the mangoes smoothie.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.620
Oops, this is just above the table.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.190
We actually need to cut off all this whole place,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.575
and place these inside of a cell which is td, the table data.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.625
Place this is in. They should now fix our issue.

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:21.155
The cell also needs some classes to make these align properly,

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:25.220
so since we want all three these items to go across the page,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.820
we can again make use of the flexbox,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.600
and then also align these vertically using item-center.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.090
Some padding on the x-axis,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.625
and we'll go for value of six,

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:41.950
and also padding y of four.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.255
The checkbox is fine as it is,

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:49.090
and we'll move down to the image and jump into the images folder.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.830
We have an image inside here,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.945
which is the mango.jpg,

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:56.245
and this is the image which I'm going to place next to this item,

00:01:56.245 --> 00:02:00.605
the alt text of mangoes smoothie,

00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:03.940
and also some classes to this elements.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.865
For our image, we need to make it a little bit smaller,

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:11.070
so we can do this with h-10 for the height,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.160
and also the same for the width too to keep this equal.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.670
Then if we look at our image inside the browser,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.295
we also need some spacing on either side.

00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:25.440
We could do this with the margin property on the x-axis and a value of four.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.635
Next onto our texts, we'll also add some classes into the p elements.

00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:34.115
First of all, we make the text to be a small size,

00:02:34.115 --> 00:02:37.595
the font-weight of medium,

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:41.490
the text color of gray 800.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.600
But let us base in also use the tracking wider utility which we looked at before,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.680
and then a class which we've not used so far, which is whitespace-nowrap.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.425
You'll see, as soon as we save this,

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:01.045
the mangoes smoothie text will appear on the same line.

00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:03.440
This means it stops the text wrapping onto

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.470
a new line if it's too long for the actual cell.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.725
The next piece of data is just under the status.

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:12.685
This is going to be a green active label.

00:03:12.685 --> 00:03:15.315
Let's go just below our td,

00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:18.435
add a new piece of table data.

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:21.695
We also need to add some classes into this section.

00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:25.130
We're not going to mirror the classes from the first one, because remember,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.305
this needed to make use of the flexbox to align all three items inside,

00:03:29.305 --> 00:03:30.840
so let's go back down,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.400
and we can add our classes.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.995
This one is going to be text-left,

00:03:34.995 --> 00:03:38.265
text-small, just keep it consistent,

00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:41.800
some padding on the left and right of six,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.910
tracking-wider, and also whitespace-nowrap.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.100
Inside of the cell, add a span element with the text of active.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.890
To make this look more like a button,

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.430
we're going to go into the span elements and add some classes.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.625
First, we'll change the text color to be green,

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:09.640
shade of 900, and then offset this with a lighter background.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.870
This is also green, but the value of 100,

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.805
a padding value of four on x,

00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:19.815
and then for y, value of two.

00:04:19.815 --> 00:04:25.905
Then round the edges, we round it as full. That looks good.

00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:30.495
Also if we make the browser smaller than the actual width of the table,

00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:32.750
you'll notice a scroll bar at the bottom.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.875
As mentioned, this is the scroll bar to make all the content come into play.

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:42.530
We have this because if we go to the start of our table. Let's scroll up.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.605
Remember we added a section wrapper around this,

00:04:45.605 --> 00:04:48.860
which has the class of overflow-x-auto.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.090
Next section, we'll have is the category, so back down.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.890
Just below the last piece of table data, add a new cell.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.320
From here, we can start to keep the styling more consistent.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.515
We can grab the classes from the last table data. Paste these in.

00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:11.000
Then in between the tags,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.710
we can add the text of smoothies.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.000
This is a pretty simple one.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.130
It just contains the text inside.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.750
Now we go across and we add the section for this doc.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.675
Keeping a consistent, copy the full td elements from above,

00:05:28.675 --> 00:05:32.090
paste this below, and then insert

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.590
an a inside of here since we're not tracking the stalk levels for these smoothies.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.140
What's next? We'll go across and take look.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.725
This is the price based in a new td elements with the same classes.

00:05:44.725 --> 00:05:47.220
Add a price for our smoothie.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.585
Then finally, over on the right just below the edit section,

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:53.035
this is going to be an edit button.

00:05:53.035 --> 00:05:57.500
This can also make use of the same classes so paste in a td.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.470
But this time this also needs a link.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.020
Since we don't have any pages to link to,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.075
we can just leave the href empty.

00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:10.185
But we do need to add some classes for styling the text of edits.

00:06:10.185 --> 00:06:11.430
Then back to our classes,

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.100
we can start to add a different texts color,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:21.875
text indigo 500, and also a darker shade once you use a hovers over this section.

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:28.850
Text indigo, and this time we'll go for a value of 900.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.875
Good. This is all working,

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:33.735
and this is our first item.

00:06:33.735 --> 00:06:36.850
You can now go ahead and add as many items as you'd like to.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.505
We have multiple images supplied in the images folder.

00:06:40.505 --> 00:06:41.950
If you wanted to practice,

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.455
you could either type out all of this section again,

00:06:44.455 --> 00:06:49.675
or you could copy and paste this full row section and then change the details inside.

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:51.085
The easiest way to do this,

00:06:51.085 --> 00:06:54.185
if we go to the table body section which we just created.

00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:58.375
Then inside, we need to directly copy this table row,

00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:01.235
so copy all of the contents,

00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:04.170
the closing table row tag.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.990
Copy this. Just below,

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.105
there is a new one just inside,

00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:10.620
and we'll go through this once more.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.620
This one's going to be for the strawberry smoothie.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.870
Take a look. Rather than mango,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.955
we'll change this to be strawberry.

00:07:17.955 --> 00:07:19.940
The active button is fine.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.225
This still it needs to move to its category.

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:23.960
You can change the price if you want to,

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.790
but I'm just going to leave this as it is.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.250
All we need to do now is just to change this image, so scroll up.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.265
This time, we want to change the image source to be the strawberry.jpg,

00:07:34.265 --> 00:07:37.620
and also change the old text too.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.335
We won't make this video really long and go through all these options,

00:07:42.335 --> 00:07:45.665
but you can now go ahead and add as many of these as you want to,

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:48.515
and make use of the images inside of the folder.

00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:50.705
But just before we finish this video,

00:07:50.705 --> 00:07:55.435
we can also add a dividing line between each one of our items.

00:07:55.435 --> 00:07:59.495
We can do this if we locate the table-body section,

00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:04.360
which we created at the start of this video alongside the background,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.425
add a class which is divided-y.

00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:09.350
Straightaway, when we save this,

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.875
we see the line is being placed between each one of these items.

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:15.200
We can also change the color of this divide too.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.825
All we need to do is to use the divide prefix and then add any color.

00:08:19.825 --> 00:08:23.295
I'm going to use gray-200.

00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:26.120
This divide is really useful for adding

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.380
a dividing line between each one of the child elements inside of here.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.380
As you can see, we can make use of the horizontal or the

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.355
vertical divides by using y or x.

00:08:36.355 --> 00:08:38.325
A handy thing about this divide,

00:08:38.325 --> 00:08:41.870
is it will only add a line between each one of the elements.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.840
It wouldn't add a line at the beginning or at the end,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.980
which would happen if we use something like a border bottom.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.490
If we did also want a dividing line between the table head and table body,

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.460
we could also add the same to utility classes,

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.875
but this time to the parent element.

00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:00.810
Now in this case, the parent is the table,

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.864
so copy both of these utilities.

00:09:03.864 --> 00:09:09.990
The parents our head and our body section is the table.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:14.945
I'll locate this at the class attributes,

00:09:14.945 --> 00:09:17.245
and then we can paste in our utilities.

00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:18.710
Then over on the right,

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.990
we can now see this utility is placed the divide between the head and the body section.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.670
Good, we're getting somewhere now.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.245
There is just a little bit more content to add just below this table.

00:09:29.245 --> 00:09:32.275
We can't carry on with adding more products if you want to.

00:09:32.275 --> 00:09:36.180
Then once completed, I'll see you in the upcoming video.
