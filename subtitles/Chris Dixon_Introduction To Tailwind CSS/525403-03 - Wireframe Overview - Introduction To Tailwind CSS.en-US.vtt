00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.170
To help you better understand what we're going to build through this class,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.580
I've created a wireframe sketch which is available for you to download.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.910
If you want to, it may be useful to download and keep alongside

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.395
you as a reference of what we're going to be building during at this class.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:25.410
Wireframe shows the basic overall look to how all project will be laid out.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.520
Over on the left, we have the full size, larger screen view,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.190
which has a sidebar on the left,

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.245
and the product detail alongside on the right.

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:37.290
Then over on the right-hand side of this image,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.610
we have a small screen view which has the content stacked,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.395
and also optimized for smaller screens.

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:46.730
Tailwind will also be used for this responsive layout,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.480
along with the general styling too.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.860
If you would like to use this as a reference,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.240
you can download it now.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.675
Also, I have provided the same images which I've used,

00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:59.545
and these are available to download with this class.

00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:02.360
You can make use of these or if you prefer,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.690
you can use some of your own.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.500
Create a different style of project.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.725
If you would like to, go ahead and download these images,

00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:11.710
and also the wireframe.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.480
Next, we'll take a look at how to get started with

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.510
this project and how to also set tail up.
