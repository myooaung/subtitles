00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.415
When designing or building any website,

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:08.550
spacing is always a important consideration,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.980
and with regular CSS we have both margin and also padding to help control this.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.100
As we've briefly looked at in the previous videos,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.600
Tailwind also provide some handy utility classes too.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.625
Starting with padding, which is the spacing inside of an element,

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:32.145
we can add padding to all four sides of an element using P followed by a value.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:35.645
We'll see what these values are in just a moment but below this,

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:39.975
we can also see that we can apply padding to one single site too,

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.225
either at the top, right,

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:44.310
bottom, or the left.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.745
As a little shortcut we can also apply padding to two sides.

00:00:48.745 --> 00:00:51.080
If you've used any coordinate in the past,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.380
you will be familiar with the x and the y-axis.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.185
X is horizontally, so this applies padding to the left and right,

00:00:58.185 --> 00:01:02.580
and the y-axis adds padding both the top and the bottom.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.285
The margin, this works just the same,

00:01:05.285 --> 00:01:09.260
but we use the m prefix rather than the P. Again,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.540
we can add padding to all sides or control them individually.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.355
Also to either the left and right together,

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:18.800
or we can group the top and bottom.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.770
Well, what about these values such as four?

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.195
Are they pixels?

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:26.030
M REM are some of the unit?

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.875
Well, this all relates to a REM value which we can see in the CSS file.

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:33.260
We can see what these values are exactly,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.790
if we go into the sidebar and then open up the tailwind CSS file.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.660
From here, let's search for some of our spacing utilities.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.900
Let's go for P-0, and let's take a look for the very first occurrence.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.630
Cycle through these and what we're looking for is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.110
a P-0 class which we've just seen in the slides.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.740
As expected this applies a padding value of zero.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.480
After each additional size we have one, we have two,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.915
we have three, each one of these adds a different padding value in REM.

00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:10.530
A quarter REM, half REM,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.250
three quarters and one REM is P-4.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.500
These all go under the quarter increments and they go all the way up.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.960
If we scroll to the very last one,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.760
this is the value of 96,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.685
which applies padding of 24 REM.

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:28.895
If you do want to know exactly what any of these values are,

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:31.220
just have a quick search inside the file.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.095
We have in fact already used some of these padding values inside of our index page.

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:39.350
We used a padding value of four with the aside elements,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.855
and let's go ahead and add some more spacing into this project.

00:02:42.855 --> 00:02:48.115
The title, some spacing at the top and bottom which we're going to apply with margin y.

00:02:48.115 --> 00:02:52.570
This is a H1 and let's place this at the very end.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.385
Margin, the y-axis and then the value of four.

00:02:57.385 --> 00:03:02.645
Save, and some spacing now applies at the top and bottom of our heading.

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:05.785
The same for each one of these links.

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:09.820
These links, we're also going to use a padding value rather than margin.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.685
This is because if we hover over any one of these links,

00:03:12.685 --> 00:03:15.515
we can see we have a small background applied.

00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:19.375
We want this background to be a little bit larger to surround the text,

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:24.890
so let's apply a padding value of two, p-2.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.885
If we hover over this link we can see the padding has applied.

00:03:29.885 --> 00:03:32.190
A couple of things to note here first of all,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.365
the product text has being pushed over from the left.

00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:38.170
Well, this is fine for now because we're going to move

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.930
all the text into the center of this section very soon.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.885
Also very soon we're going to apply some space in between each one of these links.

00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:50.980
We can also apply the rounded utility class to this link too.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.530
We can see this better if we hover over and

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.330
we can see the rounded edges on this background.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.560
Now if we apply this to all six of our links,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.930
copy the padding and the rounded class,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.250
and add this to our second link.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.470
Just for the span so we leave this, leave that link,

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.330
4, 5 and 6.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.740
We're going to test this before we move on.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.340
Great. This is all working and the next thing to do is to

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.735
add the vertical spacing between each one of these links.

00:04:21.735 --> 00:04:26.140
One way to do this is to add some margin to each one of these links,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.325
or even easier Tailwind provides a utility called space between.

00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:34.330
We have many child elements like this,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.800
such as multiple links.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.995
We usually want some space in between each one.

00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:42.230
But some of the common solutions have issues.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.330
For example, we could try adding some margin to the bottom of each link.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.990
This works but also note the extra margin at the very bottom,

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.720
which we may not want.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.350
Margin top causes the same issue,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.465
but leaves the extra space at the top,

00:04:56.465 --> 00:04:58.780
which also may not be wanted.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.955
What about using the margin? Why utility?

00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:04.670
Well, this is probably even worse because it also

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.220
adds the extra space in at the beginning and the end,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.825
and also the space between each link is doubled.

00:05:10.825 --> 00:05:14.600
Tailwinds space utility solves these problems by

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.580
only adding an equal amount of spacing between each element.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.085
This example is spaced vertically on the y-axis,

00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:26.470
but we can also have space across the page using space x.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.320
Rather than using multiple classes and applying these to each one of the links,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.150
we can also add a single space between class and this goes on the parents.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.455
In our case, it will be the unordered list.

00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:41.375
Let's locate this on other lists.

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:44.740
Just up at the top, add the class,

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.685
add the space utility and since we want the space on the y-axis,

00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:53.120
we add space y and the value which is four.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.655
This now gives us a nice equal space in between each one of these links.

00:05:57.655 --> 00:06:01.595
As you can imagine, we will be using spacing utilities very regularly.

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:06.600
Next, we will see how we can use the CSS Flexbox with Tailwind.
