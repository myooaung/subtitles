00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.060
Just like with many of the modern frameworks,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.170
Tailwind also has the concept of mobile first design.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.520
This means we start by designing for the small screen view, to begin with,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.610
and then as we get more screen space available,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.305
we can add or override any of the existing styles.

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:28.290
This can make sense because a lot of the course styling will remain for all screen sizes,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.350
such as the colors and fonts and we can just make

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.985
some layout or sizing changes when we have more screen space available.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:39.720
Back to the wireframe. Looking at the small screen over on the right,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.815
this is what we're going to begin with.

00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:44.825
The layout for this doesn't actually need a lot of work,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:49.585
since a lot of website elements tend to naturally flow this way anyway.

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:52.940
We already have a logo at the top and also the title.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.875
Next, we move down to the menu. Back to the project.

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:00.335
Since we are dealing with the small screen view,

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:02.635
we can shrink down the browser,

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:04.845
take up only the minimum width.

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:07.700
What we're going to do is go to the aside section,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.815
just below the level 1 heading.

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:13.985
Here we can create our links inside of the unordered list.

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:16.250
But now we'll create our list items.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.860
We have six different links and these are just going to be unstyled for now.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.210
The first one, again with no utility classes to pass in the link.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.605
For now, we don't have any extra pages to link these two,

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:33.250
so an empty href is fine.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.420
The first link is for products.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.835
The second list item,

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:42.420
this one is going to have the content of orders.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.245
Number 3, this one is for the inventory,

00:01:49.245 --> 00:01:52.900
and next, we have the customers.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.250
Number 5 is for the analytics.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.590
The last one is going to be for coupons.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.340
Save this and you can even refresh.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.035
I'm going to start off the live server.

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:17.760
We can see at the top, I have six links.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.875
As mentioned before, when we use HTML on its own,

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:25.450
it can generally for pretty good for the small screen view in terms of layout,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.430
would just need to add some styling to make it look good.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.705
To make it look good, we're going to need some Tailwind utilities.

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:36.140
To see a list of all the utilities we have access to,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.030
head over to the Tailwind homepage and then click on the documentation link.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.200
The Tailwind Docs is a great reference for all the utility classes.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.600
I've been using Tailwind for some time now,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.110
and I still use it as a reference.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.930
On the left, we have a list of all of the utility sections we have

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.160
available such as if you want to make use of the flexbox, which you will be soon,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.965
we can use spacing utilities, sizing utilities,

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:05.810
different typography such as the font sizes, different colors,

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.840
the font family, and also lots of different effects and borders we can add to.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.250
Of course, there's lots of different sections here,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.120
but the one we're going to be focusing on is the color palette.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.815
Let's do a search by the top for the color palette.

00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:24.175
This is the one we need just here.

00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:28.055
Then scroll down, we can see a list of all the colors we have available.

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:30.020
We've already used some of these in our project,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.460
such as the gray color,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.420
and we can see these have a shade from 50 all the way to 900,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.960
just like we've seen inside of the Tailwind CSS.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.605
You can see all the different colors we have available to start with.

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:46.120
These will suit lots of different use cases.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.380
All of these colors, which are the same,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.900
can be applied to lots of different things.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.700
First, we select a color such as red and the shade of 400.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.180
Then on the right, we have some applications for this color.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.070
We have the BG prefix,

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.455
which we've used to set the background color.

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:07.010
We also have the text prefixes at the text color,

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.840
and also if we want a border,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.110
we can use a color for this too.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.975
This is a nice way of keeping things consistent in our projects.

00:04:14.975 --> 00:04:17.750
We always have access to all of these colors and shades,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.645
and we can then just use a different prefix to apply it to different sections.

00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:28.685
Back to the project, let's apply some colors to our links and shrink this down.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:32.465
First, we'll set the text color for each one of these links.

00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:37.520
We need to jump into the a element at the class attribute.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.615
The first one, we'll start with the prefix of text,

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:45.675
the color, all about the shade.

00:04:45.675 --> 00:04:48.310
There's our first one, and often what we want to

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.590
do with these type of links is to create

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.390
a different style or a different effect when the user hovers over the text.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.705
For this, I'm going to apply a hover effect.

00:04:58.705 --> 00:05:02.875
The way to do this is to apply any one of these utility classes,

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:04.390
just like we would normally do,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.945
but we add the hover prefix followed by the colon.

00:05:08.945 --> 00:05:11.680
For example, if we wanted to change the background,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.535
we would use BG and set the color we want to apply.

00:05:15.535 --> 00:05:20.520
I I to go for grade 700, save.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.450
Now when we hover over the products,

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.235
we can now see the background color change.

00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:28.570
We could also add as many hover status as we want to.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.790
Since we changed the background color,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.505
I'm also going to change the text color too.

00:05:33.505 --> 00:05:38.105
Again, place in the hover state followed by the colon,

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:41.055
change it to be the text white.

00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:43.605
We can try this out in the browser.

00:05:43.605 --> 00:05:44.950
As soon as you hover over this,

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.350
we can see a subtle change to the text color.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.350
Happy with this for now,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.630
so we can apply this to all of our links.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.300
Let's just copy this class section.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.620
Well, first link and place this in all of the rest of these links.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.060
Make sure this is in all six.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.930
We can see this now applies inside the browser,

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.950
as well as this hover prefix.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.040
Just like with regular CSS,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.740
we can also target other states too.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.655
Instead of hover, we could change to another state such as active or focus.

00:06:19.655 --> 00:06:22.345
We do this in the exact same way.

00:06:22.345 --> 00:06:26.300
Just before we move on to the next video to look at some spacing,

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.190
there is a few elements which we first need to add to this section.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.220
Inside the wireframe.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.585
If will look at the links at the very top which you just added,

00:06:35.585 --> 00:06:38.540
next to the orders link we see a number 5.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.095
This is to show how many orders we currently have available.

00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:45.040
It also has this circle background too.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.600
Then after the last link,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.460
we can also see this gear icon,

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.320
which is a link to the settings.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.550
Let's start with the number icon,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.925
which goes just after our orders link.

00:06:57.925 --> 00:07:01.390
Place this in and still within our list item,

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.820
and then place the content as the number 5.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.330
We can just about see this on the screen,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.670
but this is a bit too dark,

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.320
so we need to add some utility classes.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.010
For the text, I'm going to apply a green color with the shade of 900,

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:22.020
and also a green background color too so bg green,

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.090
and this time the shade 100.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.925
The font size we can apply with dash sm,

00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:29.780
to give it the small size.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.040
Then to pad out the background color of green.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.495
Let's add a padding value,

00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:37.730
which is going to be equal to 1.5.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.150
We're starting to get somewhere in the browser.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.400
Now if we look at this, we have a square color.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.990
We'll also need to round the edges using the Tailwind utility classes.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.120
We, first of all, have the rounded class,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.815
and this gives a small rounded edge.

00:07:51.815 --> 00:07:54.685
We also have different rounded sizes.

00:07:54.685 --> 00:07:58.720
For example, we can apply a large rounding and this is a little bit bigger,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.040
but we can also make this fully rounded too, with rounded-full.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.310
This is fine. The last thing to do is to place

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:13.260
the gear icon down at the bottom and this is just below our coupons link.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.080
Also, make sure this is outside of the unordered list.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.155
Again, this can be placed inside of a span elements.

00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:23.680
For the gear icon, this is going to be a HTML entity.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.060
A HTML entity is a way of including an icon in our projects,

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.670
and we can apply these using certain codes.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.505
If you unsure about using HTML entities,

00:08:33.505 --> 00:08:36.175
a quick Google search will give you lots of websites

00:08:36.175 --> 00:08:39.595
where you can find out the available codes which you can use.

00:08:39.595 --> 00:08:43.630
First, the code which we need to apply is the ampersand,

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.370
the hash, the value of 9881,

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.695
followed by the semicolon.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.830
If you now see a gear icon at the bottom here,

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.745
and just make this a little bit bigger,

00:08:54.745 --> 00:09:02.560
we can use a Tailwind utility class of text and the size of this text will be 2xl.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.510
There we go. The content is now in place,

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.715
but all of this content which we just added,

00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:09.860
looks a little bit too bunched up.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.330
This is where spacing utilities come in.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.840
This is what we'll look at next in more detail.
