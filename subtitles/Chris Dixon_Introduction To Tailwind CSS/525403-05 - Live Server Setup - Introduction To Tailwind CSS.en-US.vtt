00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.870
Constantly adding new things to our project, saving the file,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.750
going over to the browser and then refreshing to see any updates,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.070
can over time become really time-consuming.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.435
This is why I wanted to quickly show you by plugin which is available

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:23.175
from Visual Studio Code which we can use to save us some time.

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:27.200
This plugin will allow us to make changes to our editor,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.380
hit ''Save'' and then a live server will constantly

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.375
keep our project updated inside of the browser.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:39.110
Installing this is optional and you don't need to set this up if you don't want to.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.155
Instead, you can just carry on refreshing the browser after any editor changes.

00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:47.250
If you do want to install this to save a little bit of time,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.715
what you can do is to go into the Extensions button just here.

00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:54.870
I already have this plug-in set up which you can see here.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.140
If you don't, do a search at the top for live server,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.995
and then click on this option, just here.

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:03.770
Since mine is already set up and enabled,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.095
you can see the disable button at the top.

00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:08.435
This is the first visit to this plugin.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.320
You should see the Enable button just here.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.590
Then run this extension and set up our project with the live server.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.445
All we need to do is to click on this ''Go Live'' button at the bottom.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:21.110
This should then open this up in

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.655
the default browser and then keep track of any changes to our site.

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:30.620
For example, if we go ahead and change our background to be red,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.515
it's saved and this will be automatically

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:37.310
updated inside the browser without needing to refresh.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.395
Let's just reinstate this gray color from the project.

00:01:40.395 --> 00:01:42.935
This is your state tool which I like to use,

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:45.660
and I hope you find it useful too.
