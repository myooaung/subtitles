00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.310
Welcome back. This video is going to take a look at

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.490
a couple of useful screen reader utilities.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.095
I'm currently inside of the Tailwind documentation and in the screen readers section,

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:16.850
which you can also find under Accessibility.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.890
Screen readers are important for accessibility and they read

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.030
all the contents of our web-page, visually impaired users.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.174
So if a user is visually impaired and they can not see our website as intended,

00:00:30.174 --> 00:00:33.280
they can use a screen reader to read out the contents.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.820
We have two screen reader utility classes which Tailwind provides.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.095
The first one is SR only,

00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:42.820
and SR only heightened element from view.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.530
But it still keeps in place to allow a screen reader to read out the contents.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.350
We can then use Not SR only and this one will

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.365
basically undo what we've just hidden and reinstated back inside the browser.

00:00:56.365 --> 00:00:58.100
So on the project,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.145
we're going to take a look at how to do this inside the table,

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:02.990
curly inside of our rows,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.300
we have this Edit button at the very end.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.235
So we also maybe don't need this Edit title at the top.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.990
This is because, for a non visually impaired user,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.545
these Edit buttons are probably enough to tell them what to do.

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:18.545
What we can do is to hide this heading at the top,

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:22.510
but still allow a screen reader to read out if needed.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.260
Let's do this by locating our table.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.340
Go down to the required section and inside the table head,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.080
we need to go to the end of this section to find our Edit text just here.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.050
Inside the clusters, we can use the SR latch-only class.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.135
Save this and this heading is now being hidden from view,

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:47.155
but it will still be read out by screen readers.

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:50.565
Remember we also have the Not SR only Class 2,

00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:51.900
which will undo this.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.255
This can also be used to show and hide content on different screen sizes,

00:01:56.255 --> 00:01:59.140
but we don't need this for our use case.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.860
This is just a little change,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.020
but it could be really useful in your site,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.225
if we have a section which we need to hide,

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:08.490
we'll still keep in place for screen readers.
