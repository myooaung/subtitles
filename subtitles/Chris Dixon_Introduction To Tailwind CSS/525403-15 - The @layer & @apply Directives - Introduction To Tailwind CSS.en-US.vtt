00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.795
Previously in the Tailwind generated file.

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:08.415
Down at the very bottom,

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:12.090
we added our own custom class that is built.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.710
This all works completely fine and it's fine for a lot of use cases but we're

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.110
starting to mess around with the order of the catholic created tailwind groups.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.105
Inside of our custom file here,

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.955
we have all these tailwind groups just here.

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:30.570
The Tailwind CSS is generated in the [inaudible] replace these

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.470
in and then our custom class is right down at the very bottom.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.300
One way of changing the order of

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.330
the generated file is to move our classes around just like this,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.850
so we can move our custom file to maybe just below the base styles.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.195
If we were to save this and go to the terminal and then rerun our generate command,

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:54.970
this will then regenerate our Tailwind file based on this new order.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.930
Once this is done, if we go to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.215
the Tailwind file and now rather than being at the very bottom,

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:01.780
we don't see our custom.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.825
So let's take a search.

00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:06.815
This has now moved up to line 603,

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:10.450
which is just below all of these base styles.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.925
This could help us if we need to move some CSS around,

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:16.310
maybe to avoid any overrides or

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.385
just generally to place it in the order which you want to.

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:24.875
An alternative to this is Tailwind also provides a directive to help with this,

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:30.745
we can assign our custom class to be grouped with any of these over-sections.

00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:34.410
If our custom class was based off a utility of

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.480
a component or we just wanted a base style for our project,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.890
we could merge this into one of these groups.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.360
The way to do this is with the layer directive,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.520
so we create the layer using the at

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.360
symbol followed by the name of the group which you want to merge it into.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.630
Let's go for a base for this example and then open up

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.265
a set of curly braces to insert our custom code.

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:06.955
We can grab our custom class from before and add this inside of our layer.

00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:10.950
This can contain as many CSS rules as we want to include,

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.755
so we could keep going, adding different classes and these will all be merged into.

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:17.810
No, save this file and,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.510
again, in a terminal, regenerate this.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.235
That was our Tailwind file,

00:02:27.235 --> 00:02:30.765
this is on line 603 with our base styles.

00:02:30.765 --> 00:02:32.465
If we try to change this,

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:37.600
maybe components then rerun our terminal commands.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.560
Let's see what happens after we run this.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.860
Once this is done and back to our Tailwind file,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.945
again do our search for a custom and this has now been moved down to line 637,

00:02:52.945 --> 00:02:56.065
merged in with the rest of the components.

00:02:56.065 --> 00:02:59.945
This is useful for reorganizing our custom classes.

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:06.655
Another useful directive is apply and we use this to create our own reusable components.

00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:08.580
See this, let's do some cleanup work.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.775
We can remove this custom section from before and also in our index page,

00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:16.490
let's take a look for our custom class.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.730
This is just inside our level 1 heading and the orange color has now been removed.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.465
Back to this apply directive and this is used to solve a problem with using Tailwind.

00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:32.270
The problem is our HTML file can get really

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.585
filled up with data and a lot of different class names.

00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:39.710
Also, we often duplicate the same classes on multiple elements.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.505
An example of this is all of these links in the sidebar.

00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:45.460
Let's take a look at our inventory,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.020
for example, and we highlight all of the classes here.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.570
We can see we've used it multiple times.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.225
We've used them for the orders,

00:03:52.225 --> 00:03:55.040
let's scroll down, we've used them for the analytics,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.749
for the customers, for the coupons,

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:00.115
we have a lot of duplicated code inside of here.

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:03.410
The applied directive gives us the chance to pull out all of

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.435
the HTML classes and create a reusable component-like setup.

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:14.210
The way to do this, if we copy all of these classes from one of our links,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.605
copy these and then go over to our custom CSS file.

00:04:18.605 --> 00:04:21.935
We can start by giving this a class name of our choice,

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:24.400
so let's go for nav-link.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.280
This looks a little bit like a normal CSS setup

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.720
but what we do need to do inside is to add the apply directive.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.235
After this, paste in the utility classes which you want to include,

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.630
add a semicolon at the end,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.820
and then down to our terminal,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.950
re-run the same command,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.230
give this a few seconds to run and this should insert this into our Tailwind file.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.860
Let's copy our nav-link over to our Tailwind file,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.740
command or control F2 searches file,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.570
paste this in, and now have our nav-link down at the bottom.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.460
We've got the border-radius,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.345
which we can see if we go into our section here.

00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:09.710
This is the rounded section, we have padding,

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.325
we have text colors, and we also have these hover effects too.

00:05:13.325 --> 00:05:15.820
We can see inside of our Tailwind file that

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.090
these hover effects have been generated as our padding,

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.570
as our colors, and also the color for the hover effect too.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.560
Now what we can do is go to our index page and rather than

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.305
having all of these classes inserted,

00:05:29.305 --> 00:05:30.940
we can then use our custom class,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.040
which we just created, which was nav-link,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.220
and then we can use this in place of all of the rest of the classes just above.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.580
The analytics, the customers,

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.680
the inventory, the orders.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.030
Be careful not to add this to the span elements and we have the products.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.050
I think this is all of the sections which we need to replace

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.640
and now if we save this and go back to the project,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.215
make sure the browser is reloaded and all of the same classes still apply.

00:06:09.215 --> 00:06:12.080
We can confirm this if we remove the nav-link from

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.774
any of these elements and this has now removed the CSS.

00:06:16.774 --> 00:06:19.670
Let's just reinstate this and to reorganize this,

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:25.360
we can also add this into the component group by surrounding it in the layer directive.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.500
Just like we looked at before,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.115
go to our custom file and then put our place,

00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:32.660
our section from before,

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.280
add in the layer directive,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.525
and we'll place this inside of our components,

00:06:37.525 --> 00:06:44.480
look at the braces and then we can paste the full section from before back inside.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.690
Down to the terminal, run the rebel command.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.310
Let's test this out in the browser, refresh.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.720
We shouldn't see any changes because all we've done is move this into

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.870
the component section of the Tailwind CSS file.
