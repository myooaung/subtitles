00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.770
Now we will look into five Homan Blockchain meets create misconceptions about that part

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:14.990
ages on limitations off the technology number one Smithies Block Janey's Big Quite.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.670
Actually,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.880
it is not the realities.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.270
Bitcoin is just one Cryptocurrency application abductor.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.390
We had a discussion about Cryptocurrency,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.250
and we go to find about 2000 cryptocurrencies available as that.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.450
So Blockchain is not a big guy.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.290
Also,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.010
the Blockchain technology can be used that can figure for many other applications.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.750
The other me.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.570
The 2nd 1 Blockchain is better than traditional databases.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:54.550
The realities Blockchain that one pages come with significant technical traders.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.360
That means traditional databases often still perform better.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.900
On the block chain is particularly valuable in lower trust environments,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.890
where participants can trade directly or lack an intermediary.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.650
The number three the meat block Cheney's immutable law.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.550
Tamper proof.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:29.630
But the realities Blockchain data structures upend only so data can be removed on

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.250
Blockchain could be tempered with if more than 50% off the leper computing power is control

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.320
on all previous transactions are reverting,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.250
which is largely impractical.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.210
Number four Blockchain is 100% secure.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:02.030
The realities Blockchain uses immutable data structures such as protected cryptography on

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.040
overall Blockchain system.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.350
Security depends on the adolescent applications which have been attacked and breached,

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.760
so we cannot see that blocked in 100% secure.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:25.420
The number five minute number five is Blockchain is a true mashing the realities Blockchain

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.270
can verify.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.930
All transactions and data entirely contain honor native to Blockchain example,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.450
And the Blockchain cannot assess whether an external input these accurate or truthful.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.480
These applies to all off Jane,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:51.950
as it's indeed a digitally represented on Dr So these are the mitts.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:00.880
Fire meets we spoke about find misconceptions about the advantages and limitations off the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.650
technology.
