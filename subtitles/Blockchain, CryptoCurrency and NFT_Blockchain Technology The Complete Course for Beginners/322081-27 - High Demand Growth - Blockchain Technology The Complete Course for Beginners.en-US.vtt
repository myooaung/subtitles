00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
Now we will discuss about high demand growth for Blockchain.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:19.860
This shows the total number of transactions in the Blockchain network so you can see a huge

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:28.630
rice since 2000 lines since its initiation never just 800 just starting from one

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.610
transactions.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.160
And now you can see when it comes to generally February 2nd off.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.010
2090 he does 378 million transactions,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.580
so it's a huge rice onda.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:55.420
You can imagine how these DEMAR for the block chain technology from the total number of

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.550
transactions both we can have an idea.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:09.750
So looking into the 2010 generally WAAS around 36,000 transactions on coming into gentle

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.950
1011 it was about 124,000 transactions,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.570
and in 2012 year it's 2.2 million transactions.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.950
Then the 2030.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.640
It's around 11 million transactions and gentle 1014 around 31 million.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:38.390
And when it comes to January 2015 it was about 58 million transactions and 2016 it was

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.230
about 100 million transactions.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.250
Likewise,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:02:01.000
in 2070 it's around 189 million transactions In general 2018 you can see 292 million off

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.900
transactions rising generally 2090 379 million transactions,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.950
so there's a huge demand for Blockchain technology.
