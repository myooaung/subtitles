00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.130
Now we will have on interesting facts about this Blockchain technology and why it is

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.090
revolutionary.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:18.460
I will tell you about 10 companies already adopted Blockchain in 2080 Asper Forbes one The

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.030

Be ready for all right Patron No,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.160
it's not the kind that punches your test.

talking BBC opening a cooperate demand for cryptocurrencies for sale and marketing a $76

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.730
billion market.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:51.720
Guardo's B two b that connects cooperate by US and sailors with past to discovery and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.090
better transparent.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.640
The company was founded by entrepreneurs from a mighty Lyndon Facebook Amazon So disease

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.120
about the cargo the third company were already adopted.

Its borrowing and lending platform really love users to earn after 5% interest on their

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.800
crypto wider taking longer than 9%.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.780
Just using their crypto s quality says yes,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.580
networks goal is to bring the next 100 million people into crypto,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.060
ultimately becoming the first Killah rapping this space.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.000
Risky or not disease one to keep.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.230
And now you're the spin tech startup is prior to destruct traditional bed.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.410
So this is about the senses network.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.950
Well,

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.110
only looking for the companies were Menlo one member one is a framework for building

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:07.070
decentralized application with the speed off traditional labor they approved for reputation

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.290
Algorithm means that no vacation for yes,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.580
as is this PDD centralized database that Austrian notes at the center off its day led by

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.560
Kidd fellow.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.000
But you know a successful order Britta on a Blockchain a level who walk worked on ethereum

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.900
voting mechanisms after 2016 year old hack Menlo One has solid credentials,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.390
and the I C E O is a must watch.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.880
So this I CEO means initial cardinal.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.070
All right,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.860
we'll have a look on the game place.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:53.900
The Thea other company who already adopting Blockchain Everybody is that online marketplace

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.720
back by Silicon Valley Venture capital.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.950

It's a significant amount,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.580
right after successful he didn't stalk.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.050
It's a hard cap.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.890
The A for fee utility program.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.310
Partners and publishers will be integrating the gameplay STK,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.550
which will enable the transaction approved in really good block.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.750
So the other one is that the company's the body,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.230
but he's an APP stores for developers by developers.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.660
Their vision is to become the backboard off which talented programmers can build world

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.980
older in Blockchain technology and off Jane Absent services.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.870
The goal is to take the lower of millions off developers by rewarded everything that can be

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.830
automated and in the process,

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.070
giving them back the time to be created.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:12.540
But he has a presence in the cloud marketplaces off Amazon Google G tub Boston and

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.750
imprisoned least off customers and partners.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:26.190
So we will look the other companies from among the 10 companies that a.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.420
D.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.090
B i t.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.670
80 b i d talk and will be the core puncheon off.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.600
CIA and CH MEDIA MARKETPLACE The world's first Blockchain poverty,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.020
media planning and,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:50.060
by platform for traditional media Brendan TV radio and out off all assets See A and C H and

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.430
N E.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.730
B,

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.810
I.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:51.210
D.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:58.090
Or created to help automate the multiple layers off manual processes that currently flag

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.960
the industry.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:10.170
The is easy is the bulls first content based Blockchain that feature features identity and

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.540
access management at the infrastructure level.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.700
This will revolution allies,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.130
the digital content and media industries as it offers,

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.050

access and stories.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.410
And the other companies that Goldie Locks,

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:37.450
world Lucky's aiming to change the red date I stole that secured across the It's

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:44.930
innovations allow for individuals and institutions to secure digital access to storage that

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.520
are physically disconnected from the Senate.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.560
Undo the moment users want to collect it for its intended purpose.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:03.830
So the last the 10 company is the F quite founded by Kazanjian former CTO O B F Cordis

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.020
decentralized,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.450
that fully transparent Cryptocurrency exchange,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.270
based in China.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.940
If corn is unique as its best on a mining,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:22.650
that profit sharing mechanism that will return upto 80% to so these are interesting fact on

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.650
,

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.480
actually,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.260
the pen companies that already adopted Blockchain in 2018.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.910
So,

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:30.210
like,

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:37.380
was every other new companies coming into this latest destructive technology,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.780
which is going to be revolutionary?
