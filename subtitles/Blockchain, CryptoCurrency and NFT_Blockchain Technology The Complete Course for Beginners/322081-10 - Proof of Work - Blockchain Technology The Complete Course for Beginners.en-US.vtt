00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.660
Now we be learning about a book room.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.050
A book is a mechanism that slows down the creation off Neuville's.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.870
It takes about 10 minutes to calculate the required approval.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.810
And you had a new book to the jail.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.710
You will have a currently the group over all the blocks.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.850
See anyone pass to tamper the blocks.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.790
So this security makes it more difficult to grapple with the duck into in a secure G.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.750
This responsibility will be birth on special non school the mines.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.990
So next session will be about the mine imposes.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:01:02.750
You have a very thorough understanding about mining on the mines before or girls who have

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.800
offensive call here to be in it.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.430
No,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.980
you see,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.660
What is this?

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.200
Beautifully.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:20.790
And it means when it comes to the peer to peer network in the Blockchain and Blockchain use

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.630
peer to peer over at everyone is allowed to drive.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.440
When someone joins in it work.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.130
Everyone gets a full copy off the daytime.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.250
The doctor they're not can use these two very by that everything is still in honor.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.030
The creation of New block will be very fight by East are and upon completion,

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.350
off verification the block will be either to the doctor.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.060
Also,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.560
during the verification is not find.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.020
The blocks are ample.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.960
The block.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.950
We'll get through it.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:02.650
So as we spoke now,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.450
when a new block through the blocky is created,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.520
every not in the network verifies it in religion.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.390
Hold everyone's verification.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.070
They will agree that the block will be added to the block.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.260
Everyone hence insists on that,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.370
you know you built with the block training.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:37.040
So this is how the brutal work happens that all of the notes in the never acted before

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.460
heading off the after they I interviewed you a very
