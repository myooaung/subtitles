00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
I know everyone what you will learn from this goes off Blockchain technology The complete

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.440
caused for business.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.890
You relent.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.410
What is Blockchain technology?

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.570
In this section you will learn the key concepts of Blockchain technology.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.770
Where are the block?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.740
Jenny's securely using cryptography and it is not controlled by your central authority.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.330
Also,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.820
the Blockchain has access to anyone on the network and everyone has copies off the data.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.410
So this is a very crucial for you to have a good understanding about the Blockchain

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.200
technology.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.470
The key Kansas A Blockchain technology.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.850
You must know it also.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.070
You will end the Blockchain dictionary,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.020
which is considered to be all the technical terms.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.910
You must know in order to go competently about Blockchain technology with your friends or

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.780
colleagues on cryptocurrencies and beat points.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.020
This is Ah,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.700
hardly discuss stopping the big kites.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:12.110
You will learn how this big coin How about its market capitalization at the dominance

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.980
Amanda the crypto currencies available right now.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.380
Also,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.420
we will go into a live marketplace to understand clearly on this crypto currencies and beat

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.560
twice there.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.510
We will understand how many Cryptocurrencies are.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.750
There's that now.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.960
And from that how much of dominance.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.890
The big going has taken over on what other other competitive crypto currencies Apart from

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.650
Bitcoins.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.960
Everything we learn from this section off bodies,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.360
Blockchain technology.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.550
All right Now you will be very giving What is Blockchain technology?

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.450
After you go through all these lectures,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:01.370
then it will be the right time for you to understand and learn how Blockchain birds in this

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.630
section of how Blockchain words you will be very clear be distributed ledgers,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.630
loved it and hash function.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.180
How it he's given the security for the Blockchain on the proof of work consents on the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.800
mining process where you will let everything about the mining What the miners what are the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.510
software is that they used for mining currently Everything you know in this section off how

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.330
rock Jane works why is Blockchain so revolutionary?

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.920
Vie v called that distract you change in this section you will in the 10 companies that

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.440
already a lot the Blockchain into their business and they're currently practicing.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:54.610
We'll see how their practices Also the 50 largest giant companies currently exploring the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.110
Blockchain to add up into the air bases.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.310
You will be surprised to hear their landlady that Facebook Oliver.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:13.460
But all these giant companies will be a every day in ball with the applications on the big

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.390
going legality around the world.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:24.360
Are you aware that your country's re 11 authorities are those illegal authorities?

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.480
Are they allowing you to transact Bitcoins in your country?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.550
Are you aware office?

Well,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.610
then this is the right place for you to learn almost for every country,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.960
the big kind legality around the world,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:47.530
which is said by their own authorities or the center back on,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.100
we will discuss the limitations of Blockchain technology even though it is destructive.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.950
It also has his own limitations off block in the limitation sections view this Gaza.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.980
What are the limitations there currently facing and how they have overcoming on also,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.730
especially the meat on the misconceptions off the block chain technology,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.360
how the people lying printed and how the people have understood the Blockchain technology.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:25.340
We will discuss in detail opportunities off Blockchain technology.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.960
I'm sure this will be your favorite section where you will learn the high pay jobs arising

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.930
from this Blockchain on the Blockchain skill that consider to be the fastest grove in

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.960
skills where the disruption valued and reveal analyzed the traditional value j on the

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.230
Blockchain ValuJet.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.490
How we happens on we will discuss about the use case off IBM.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:00.850
How they use Blockchain to their supply g are the very industry adoption.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.240
In this lecture,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.170
you'll be very clear that banking isn't the only industry that is adopting Blockchain into

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.950
the artists.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.580
But there are plenty of industries.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.760
Almost every industry has a high potential love enough to block J.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.250
So in this lecture really loads off go through the mechanism and companies.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.610
Research results are very industrious high demand growth for Block J.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.210
In this section,

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:36.190
we even go into lying marketplace off Blockchain and will have a very dear graphical

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:42.660
understanding up the increasing number of transactions to the Blockchain on how the rise

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.120
off demand for this block Jean happens and you are at the right track.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.290
Now you will learn everything,

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.590
so you will be very confident on J.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.160
Let these sections in detail.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.050
You will be the best Good luck with the course
