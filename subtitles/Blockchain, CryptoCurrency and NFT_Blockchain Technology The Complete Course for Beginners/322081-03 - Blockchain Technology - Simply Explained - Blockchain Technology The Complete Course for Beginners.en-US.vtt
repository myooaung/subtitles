00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
Hello,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:02.650
everyone.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.740
What is Blockchain?

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.490
Technology?

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:13.450
First of all will understand what is Blockchain technology in simple tips.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.850
If I were to us,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.000
what is Blockchain technology?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.510
Most of you would say it is the technology behind Bitcoin o E or any other cryptocurrencies

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.510
.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.790
01 of those.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.790
Yeah,

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.850
it's true,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.360
but it's like defining the unit as the technology behind email,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.660
which is also,

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.470
but it doesn't even really begin to describe the day,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.590
right?

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.890
So when it comes to Blockchain technology,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.860
there are different ways to think about the Blockchain.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:59.350
One way I think of a blocky as this one big ledger in the cloud.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.990
You know,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.690
majors are very important.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.760
Everything you own,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.840
including money,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.670
is nothing but entries in the ledger,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.150
right?

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.760
Let's it.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:20.750
I want to transfer $100 from USC to my friend in France.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.390
Andi.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.950
It's not money that just flies from USA to Frost,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.640
but it's actually a legendary happens in my ledger on a barrel.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.670
Landry happens in my friends legend France.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.570
Right now the problem here is there's between mileage and my friends legion fronts.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.950
There are several villages.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.370
We're joined by bags,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.230
insurance companies regulated and money transferring institutions like,

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.130
let's say,

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.410
Maple Reza MasterCard's.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:09.180
There are so many villages which are being maintained by different uses from everywhere

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.950
just for one neuron section.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.610
No,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.820
each of these John sections needs to be reconciled and change,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.550
because different uses may have different records from different days.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:36.180
So this creates friction as we have changed so many entries in different ledges.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.370
So these results to Italian delays and huge amounts off efforts.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.790
So my friend in Frantz will give the money after several days.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.210
But for some mirror due to one off the intermediaries,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:04.440
let's say she reserves Onley $90 the broken traditional sister.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.950
Now imagine instead of this broken traditional system,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.210
we only have one reversal religion.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.240
All the different users we discussed like me,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.330
my friend in France bags,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.540
insurance companies,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.490
intermediaries,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.530
regulators.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.530
All these are the party Supremes off this universal religion.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.320
Let's see,

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.200
in Blockchain terms knots in villages.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.860
So every time when a transaction happens,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.050
every single not will have toe authenticate Oh,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.580
validated each transaction.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:57.030
So then you needs to have just one single entry in real time.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.790
So these universal ledger is ah,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.930
heart off block J acknowledge So wherever transactions happen a block gets creator and

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.270
added to the chain after it's being validated by each not in a decentralized on.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.450
We call in Block J,

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:31.280
which is also considered to be a very secure network as the Blockchain is protected by

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.460
cryptography,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:44.700
which means it is very difficult to hack which way will discussing upcoming lectures or now

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:53.790
you have a clear understanding about what he's Blockchain technology in very simple deaths

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.790
.
