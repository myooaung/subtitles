00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.550
key concepts of Blockchain sick yard using crypto wrapping not controlled by essential

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:22.250
authority access to anyone on the liver on Everyone has copies off the data,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.590
so this is very crucial when it comes to Blockchain technology.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.170
Is that the key content that we must know?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:43.250
So let's discuss in detail about the key contends Off Block Shea technology sick you're

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.560
using crypto cryptography is the method of distinguishing and revealing,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.450
otherwise known as encrypting and decrypting information through complains,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:06.530
mathematics or else we can the complex algorithms and form you last in order to secure.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.360
So if you want to break this cryptography saw these mathematical problem,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.700
it's going to be very complex.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.850
That is why the Blockchain he's secure by crypto gravity.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.480
This means that the information can only be viewed by the intendant recipients that nobody

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.790
else,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:44.330
because the cryptography secures not controlled by essential authority,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.660
the other crucial consent of the Blockchain.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.620
The Blockchain is not a central authority control.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:01.620
It is a decentralized control mechanism where the Blockchain overwrites the need for a

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.550
central authority but distributing the information previously held in a centralized ledger

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.550
across the network of computers.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.980
In this way,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.690
no one person.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.460
No organization owns the Blockchain because it is decentralized.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.370
Yet anyone with an Internet connection and access in this case off private lodgings can

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:38.640
make use off on help maintained and very fight access to anyone on the network.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.120
A Blockchain can be build and access to multiple rates.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.240
For instance,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.520
Big coined the most popular preponderance in Blockchain,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.480
which allows anyone to participate in the in the capacity of a full knot or contributing

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.890
miler.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.990
So we will be discussing about these terms them about this.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.040
The process is off.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.610
The mining on will be my naming,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:14.260
detained in the compensations so anyone can take a read only role or make lady changes to

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.850
the Blockchain life at in a new block.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:25.170
Such block change vigils equal on open rights and access toe all participants on the Net.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:34.050
Everyone has copies off the data.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.020
The block chain isn't open and distributed.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.590
Ledger it users that happened on Lee data structure,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.720
meaning new transactions and data can be added onto a block tree.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.190
But past data cannot be raised,

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.940
which means that this tribunal ribeye these results in a very viable and permanent record

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.250
of data and transactions between different parties.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:12.420
This has the potential to increase transparency and accountability and positivity in handle

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.800
social and economy systems.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.270
When everyone has the data,

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.920
the copies off the dating,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.360
very job spirit,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.750
everyone will know how the transactions are happening.
