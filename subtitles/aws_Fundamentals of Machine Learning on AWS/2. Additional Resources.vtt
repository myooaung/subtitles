00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.480
[Autogenerated] as I said a bit earlier,

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.320
this course alone won't be enough for you to ace these machine learning exam.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.440
This is really just meant to give you a broad overview,

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.980
so you definitely want to look at some additional resource is as you

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.280
continue your studies at the beginning of the course.

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.430
I provided some detail on the learning path here,

7
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.130
a Pluralsight the other courses getting to a lot more

8
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.860
detail on the four exam domains.

9
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.190
So be sure to check those out on AWS.

10
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.840
You want to spend a good amount of time with the sage maker Developer guide.

11
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.600
I referenced this a lot throughout the course,

12
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.240
and this is really the definitive guide for all things Sage maker and ML on AWS.

13
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.310
As boring as it sounds, if you're super familiar with that guide,

14
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.640
you will ace the exam.

15
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.940
The Sage Maker blog is also a good resource.

16
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.910
When there's new features are updates release,

17
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.720
there's often a blog post about them,

18
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.050
and the developer guide will sometimes point to blog

19
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.810
post for added detail as well.

20
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.060
These are fair game on the exam questions you might know that

21
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.950
reinvent is AWS big annual conference all of the sessions are

22
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.980
recorded and posted on YouTube.

23
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.240
Do a search for sage maker and watch some of the deep dive videos there.

24
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.310
ID also strongly recommend that you work through some of

25
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.740
the other sage maker example notebooks.

26
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.800
We saw these in the very beginning when we set up sage Maker studio.

27
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.100
We're using the customer turn example for the course,

28
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.040
but there's a lot of other ones out there.

29
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.560
Hands on practice is really the best way to submit your learning.

30
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.420
So take some time and work through some of those other

31
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.140
examples and then check out the certification home page

32
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.340
as a reminder that's out here.

33
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.340
This will give you some additional details about the exam,

34
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.790
and I want to call out just a couple of things here.

35
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.240
If you look at the sample questions,

36
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.290
this will give you an idea of what to expect on the real exam.

37
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.940
There's only 10 questions here,

38
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.310
and you will see there's answers at the very bottom,

39
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.440
which are super helpful.

40
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.590
So check these out just to get a better understanding of how things are worded,

41
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.710
the types of scenarios they're asking about,

42
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.040
and the level of detail you need to know.

43
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.770
Also back on the home page for the certification you scroll down,

44
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.100
you'll see there's a practice exam here for $40.

45
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.190
This is 20 questions, and it's administered just like a real exam.

46
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.060
It's timed.

47
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.340
It's in the same browser environment is the actual test.

48
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.690
This one doesn't provide you the answers,

49
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.440
but it's a really good gauge of how ready you are for the exam.

50
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.850
If you take it and you get 40% for instance, you probably need to keep studying.

51
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.320
But if you take it and you get 90% you're probably on

52
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.740
your way to passing the actual exam.

53
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.310
I'd personally recommend taking it.

54
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.620
I know I found it helpful to schedule it.

55
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.720
Just use these schedule on exam button here,

56
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.000
and that will walk you through the same process as registering for the real exam.
