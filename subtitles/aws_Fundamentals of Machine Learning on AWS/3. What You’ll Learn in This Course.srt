1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,440
[Autogenerated] in this course, I'm going to answer those questions.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,960
If you're taking this course to prepare for the AWS

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,640
Machine Learning Specialty exam, you're definitely in the right place.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,110
But even if you're not specifically interested in the exam,

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,360
this is still a great place to start your journey on

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,370
AWS machine Learning for the exam.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,540
Let's take a quick look around the certification home page out on Amazon site.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,620
If you scroll through here,

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,170
you'll see a little bit more about what's measured the recommended knowledge

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,040
and experience and some tips on how to prepare for your exam.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,150
Over on the right, you'll see things like format,

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,840
the delivery method, the time and so forth.

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,740
It's growing up.

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,480
You'll see there's some sample questions available

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,750
for download and the exam guide.

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,910
Let me click on the exam guide in here.

17
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,170
You'll get some additional details about the exam again.

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,940
Recommended knowledge the format.

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,560
But I want to call your attention to the second page here,

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,440
where we get into the different domains covered on the exam.

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,750
You'll see there's four of them,

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,270
and these are the different areas that you'll need

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,440
to understand in order to pass.

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,660
And the reason I call out the domains here is because on Pluralsight we

25
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,040
have a learning path that addresses each of those.

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,440
The name of the learning path is AWS certified machine learning specialty.

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,540
And this course that you're watching right now is the first course in that path.

28
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,740
Now, this course isn't aligned to a specific exam domain,

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,130
but it will give you a broad overview of machine learning on AWS,

30
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,770
the machine learning process and different AWS

31
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,700
services you should be familiar with.

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,240
So it kind of touches on all four domains at a very high level.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,470
But to dig into the details of the four domains,

34
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,010
you want to check out these other courses in the path.

35
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,600
These go into a lot more depth than I can do here.

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,740
And I'd highly recommend taking those as you prepare for your exam.

37
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,790
And finally the last course in the path will get into

38
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,520
more of the mechanics of the exam.

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,940
Some tips and tricks, study strategies and so forth.

40
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,980
So that's an overview of the entire path this course specifically is

41
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,640
organized like this course introduction where we are now.

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,180
Next up,

43
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,310
I'll walk you through how to identify opportunities for

44
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,410
machine Learning XML isn't always the answer,

45
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,340
so I'll give you some guidelines for when it makes sense.

46
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,810
After that,

47
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,160
we'll get into the core concepts of machine learning and

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,920
how you can take your business problems and define them as

49
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,640
machine learning problems.

50
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,820
We'll talk about things like supervised learning,

51
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,230
unsupervised learning classifications,

52
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,840
regression inputs and outputs and a lot more.

53
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,040
From there, we'll dive into the machine learning process,

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,740
starting with fetching and preparing your data,

55
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,910
getting it from various data sources, cleaning it up,

56
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,240
doing what's called feature engineering and getting it ready to train the model.

57
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,140
Then we'll actually train the model using the data and evaluate how it's doing.

58
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,080
From there, we deploy and monitor in this module.

59
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,580
We'll talk about some architectural best practices and things like logging.

60
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,540
Then we'll get into more details about the AWS machine learning stack.

61
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,290
We actually touch on some of the services,

62
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,690
like sage maker a lot throughout the course,

63
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,250
but this module will pull it all together and cover the AI layer,

64
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,340
these AML layer and the underlying infrastructure.

65
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:07,660
Finally,

66
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,090
it will wrap things up and talk about what you can do next to

67
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,640
continue your learning and studying for the exam.

68
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
I've built this primarily for developers,

69
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,470
data scientists and data engineers looking to get

70
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,040
started with machine learning in AWS.

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,180
If you're in another role,

72
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,350
maybe a product manager or business leader just generally

73
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,200
wanting to understand what this is all about,

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,260
you should still be able to follow along in terms

75
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,720
of what you should already know.

76
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,240
You should be familiar with the basics of AWS.

77
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,740
So as I'm talking about services like I Am or E C two or S3,

78
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,040
you should know what those are.

79
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,620
The demos in this course will be using Python.

80
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,190
You should at least be able to read Python code and understand what it's doing.

81
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,340
But the code itself will be provided.

82
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,740
So if writing python from scratch isn't your thing, you should still be okay.

83
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,450
And then finally, we'll be using Jupyter notebooks in the demos,

84
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,620
so you should be familiar with how those work I

85
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,090
mentioned demos a few seconds ago.

86
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,530
I would strongly encourage you to follow along with those

87
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,040
as it's really the best way to learn.

88
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,590
To do that.

89
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,890
You'll need a couple things.

90
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,040
First you need an AWS account and and I am admin user,

91
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,770
as you should know, is a general rule.

92
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,550
You don't want to be logging in and doing things Azure root account,

93
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,340
so make sure you're in I am admin Instead,

94
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,240
I'm assuming you have this set up, but if not,

95
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,940
you could get started at a w s dot amazon dot com,

96
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,040
and then you'll also need Amazon's sage maker studio.

97
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,210
Sage Maker Studio is Amazon's integrated development environment,

98
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,100
or IDE for machine learning.

99
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,490
Released.

100
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,440
To the end of 2019.

101
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,040
I'll walk you through how to set that up in just a minute.

102
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,040
If you're already familiar with sage Maker,

103
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,530
you can actually do all of the demos in Sage Maker.

104
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,600
Not studio.

105
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,040
But you'll find things are quite a bit easier in studio,

106
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,000
so I encourage you to use that. If you're going to follow along now, let me show you how to get that set up
