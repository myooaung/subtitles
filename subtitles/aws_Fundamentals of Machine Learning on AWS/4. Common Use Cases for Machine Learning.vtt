00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.790
[Autogenerated] you may already have some use cases in mind.

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.830
Maybe you've been tasked with creating machine learning solution at work,

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.940
which is awesome.

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.440
But here are a few other use cases.

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.620
M.

6
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.700
L is big and retail and e commerce, and you've definitely participated in it,

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.060
whether you know it or not,

8
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.870
things like product recommendations on Amazon targeted ads that you get

9
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.280
on various web page is chat support when you need help with something

10
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.390
and even things like visual product search.

11
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.920
Or you select something in a photo on Pinterest,

12
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.040
maybe perhaps a piece of furniture,

13
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.280
and then you can shop for it on a retail site in the field of transportation,

14
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.360
self driving cars are the obvious example where a car needs

15
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.220
to know what certain objects look like.

16
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.030
Street signs.

17
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.000
People at intersections ride sharing apps use machine learning to

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.130
set different prices for different times of day route optimization

19
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.610
for delivery drivers to find the quickest route to deliver your

20
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.000
package and being able to see what traffic is like along the route

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.490
that you're traveling for.

22
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.990
Security and cyber security.

23
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.030
Several things here,

24
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.890
including video surveillance where maybe you want to detect

25
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.960
that a patient has fallen in a nursing home.

26
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.140
For instance,

27
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.880
you've probably seen captures recently that asked you to select

28
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.320
photos that contains certain objects and captures using image

29
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.740
recognition to make sure you're right.

30
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.770
Machine learning is used to detect unusual activity or patterns that

31
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.040
might be a threat to the network or other infrastructure.

32
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.510
And then good old spam detection were based on the content of the message

33
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.880
and the metadata about the message you can classify.

34
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.940
The email is spam or not.

35
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.190
And then, finally, with smartphones, you might use some of these yourself today,

36
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.140
your voice assistants like Alexa or Siri.

37
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.460
Some people unlock their phones using facial recognition and then photo editing,

38
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.870
where your phone can automatically detect a person in a

39
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.790
photo and then blew out the background.

40
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.740
For instance, I could go on and on with examples.

41
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.230
But to bring this back to your day to day job and to our

42
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.920
Globomantics story from the last module,

43
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.000
you might be faced with a question similar to this we can use machine.

44
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.940
Learning for that right?

45
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.170
I know voice assistance and self driving cars are cool and all,

46
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.240
but maybe not something you're gonna be working on in your job.

47
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.540
So what are some ways that you can use machine learning?

48
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.210
Maybe it's to analyze sentiment on your social sites.

49
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.900
What's going on with your customers?

50
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.040
Are there any fires or damage control that you need to deal with right now?

51
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.360
How can you dynamically price your products to take

52
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.940
advantage of changes in demand?

53
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.190
How can you apps cell or cross sell your customers

54
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.940
using recommendations and offers?

55
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.170
Maybe you're working at a company like Globomantics.

56
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.990
You have a large call center,

57
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.840
and you want to automatically route calls or chats based

58
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.240
on some intake criteria or sentiment.

59
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.480
Again, like Globomantics,

60
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.940
maybe you have a customer churn problem that you're trying to address.

61
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.670
Or, if you're in information security,

62
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.040
how can you detect suspicious activity on the network?

63
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.850
Or maybe you have site content that needs to be

64
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.980
localized for sites around the world.

65
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.650
You can use machine learning to do that.

66
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.540
Translation For you.

67
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.480
Here are a few guidelines about when it makes sense

68
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.930
to use machine learning first,

69
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.240
when it's just too difficult to code the logic and the old fashioned way.

70
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.270
In that last list,

71
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.910
you might have noticed the use cases are generally things

72
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.140
that a human would have or could have done.

73
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.780
For instance, to analyze sentiment,

74
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.150
a human could spend their whole day reading through social media activity

75
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.240
and come up with a general conclusion about sentiment.

76
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.250
That would be a pretty hard thing to code the old fashioned way,

77
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.340
using if else or case statements,

78
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.520
those kinds of scenarios where it's just too difficult

79
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.250
to code so human did it in the past.

80
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.660
Those are good candidates for machine learning when it's

81
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.340
just not cost effective to do it manually,

82
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.510
maybe you need to translate thousands of pages of

83
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.000
content into 30 different languages.

84
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.250
That's going to require a lot of human translators and hours now,

85
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.850
you might not want to rely on a computer to

86
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.680
translate the content of your home page,

87
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.940
for instance, maybe leave that up to a human still.

88
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.240
But if you have thousands of articles in a knowledge base,

89
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.970
for instance, that have a much smaller audience machine,

90
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.750
learning might make sense for those next.

91
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.910
When you have a lot of training data available, that's a good fit for M l.

92
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.340
It's all about data, and the more the better.

93
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.680
Finally, when a business problem could be stated as an ML problem,

94
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.500
then it makes sense now.

95
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.050
I know it's a little bit circular,

96
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.250
but let's say your business problem is that your product teams

97
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.440
aren't collaborating or communicating well,

98
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.030
which is causing delays in your product releases.

99
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.260
Machine learning isn't really gonna help you there now,

100
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.230
when not to use machine learning kind of the flip side of what we just said.

101
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.740
But if you don't have sufficient data, it's not gonna work.

102
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.330
And quote unquote sufficient will vary depending on what you're trying to do.

103
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.510
But for instance,

104
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.360
if you're trying to predict sales for a novel product that you just released,

105
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.140
you probably don't have enough data to accomplish that.

106
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.030
When your data can't be labeled,

107
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.540
we'll talk more about what labeling is and the differences

108
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.140
between supervised and unsupervised learning.

109
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.990
But the point here is that you need to know what

110
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.940
your data is before you can use it.

111
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.240
Was this historical transaction fraud or not?

112
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.730
Did this customer churn or not, as they say, garbage in garbage out?

113
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.740
So you need to be able to make sense of the data before applying machine

114
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.250
learning to it if you need to get something out the door quickly.

115
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.740
Machine learning might not be your best bet.

116
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.640
It's generally more complex and traditional applications,

117
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.840
and it can take time to prepare your data,

118
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.440
train the model, test it, tune it and make sure it's working correctly.

119
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.840
You don't want to rush that process,

120
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.040
or the resulting predictions are going to be worthless.

121
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.940
And finally, when there's just no room for error similar to my last comment,

122
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.040
it could take time to tune your model and get it just right.

123
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.900
There might be bias in the data that wasn't obvious at first,

124
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.440
and you don't realize it until months later.

125
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.350
Or you could have what's called Drift or the model performs well for a period,

126
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.040
but then degrades.

127
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.930
An example is, maybe you're predicting house prices,

128
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.210
but the real estate market changes over time,

129
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.140
either up or down, so your predictions might become less accurate.

130
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.000
If you have a mission critical application that can't tolerate errors. Machine learning is not the way to go
