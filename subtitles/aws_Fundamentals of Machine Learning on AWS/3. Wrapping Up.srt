and we've come to the end of our course.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,080
As you take this course and start using machine learning on AWS.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,320
I'd love to hear from you post your questions or comments on the discussion

5

if you're working on a team who recently started doing

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,570
machine learning at AWS and you feel that others on the

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,240
team would benefit from this course, please share it.
