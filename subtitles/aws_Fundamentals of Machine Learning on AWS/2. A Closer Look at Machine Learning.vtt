00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.420
[Autogenerated] with that high level overview out of the way,

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.430
let's dig a little bit deeper into machine learning.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.040
Specifically,

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.330
we said that in machine learning algorithms learn and

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.140
improve performance over time using data.

6
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.600
But what does it really mean to learn using data?

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.540
How could a computer learn?

8
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.440
Well, what's the same way humans learn?

9
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.850
Growing up, I lived on a farm.

10
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.900
We had all kinds of farm animals and pets.

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.640
My favorite was always the cat, and actually it still is today,

12
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.520
somewhere along the way, and I don't know how old I was,

13
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.340
but I learned that an animal that looks like this is a cat check.

14
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.760
And then it's the another kind of cat, maybe a different color or size.

15
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.660
But it was labeled cat, or somebody told me it was a cat,

16
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.940
and I recognized it as a cat check.

17
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.040
And on it went a black cat.

18
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.810
It had similar characteristics to the other cats ID scene,

19
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.150
so I categorized that as a cat check, but then something that wasn't a cat.

20
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.640
When I saw a horse, I compared it to my prior knowledge about cats,

21
00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.810
their characteristics,

22
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.140
size and so on so I could conclude that that was not a cat.

23
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.480
A similar thing happened when I started to read.

24
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.600
I learned the alphabet lowercase, uppercase letters.

25
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.110
I learned how to recognize the letters, how to write them,

26
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.740
how they sounded and then eventually put them together to mean something.

27
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.910
When I saw letters combined this way, a M b E r.

28
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.560
I learned that that was how my name was spelled check and a pattern of

29
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.580
5551212 was my phone number or we'll say it was check if the pattern of

30
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.140
numbers was different than it wasn't my phone number.

31
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.700
Now I know those are maybe overly simple examples,

32
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.140
but hopefully they convey the important point.

33
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.550
When we say that the machine is learning from data.

34
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.740
It's really all about recognizing patterns.

35
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.740
What are the patterns here?

36
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.920
All these cats have similar characteristics to pointy ears,

37
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.140
whiskers, eyes in the front of their head for and so on.

38
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.420
And if you show a computer enough pictures of cats,

39
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.230
it will eventually learn what a cat looks like based on the patterns in

40
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.190
the data so back to our definition of machine learning.

41
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.080
It all starts with the training data,

42
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.340
whether that's pictures or text or video or speech.

43
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.650
And then we pass that in to an algorithm.

44
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.290
And the algorithm will identify the patterns in the data and at the

45
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.530
end of that process will have a trained model that can then make

46
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.240
predictions for new data that's passed in.

47
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.040
Let's look at an example.

48
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.540
We'll use handwriting recognition.

49
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.290
In this case,

50
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.640
are training data will be a bunch of handwritten digits past In his images.

51
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.630
Those images get past when algorithm that will try to identify patterns.

52
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.300
To do this,

53
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.760
it'll look at each pixel of the image and try to pick out

54
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.230
shapes like Zero is a Circle one is a line,

55
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.940
and eight is two circles and so on,

56
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.430
and it illiterate on those images until we have a fully trained model

57
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.960
that quote unquote knows what a one looks like,

58
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.140
what a two looks like and so forth.

59
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.640
Pretty cool, huh?

60
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.730
But you might be asking, How exactly does that help me solve real world problems?

61
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.640
Just having a model that's been trained on an existing dataset,

62
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.570
and you're right to ask that the real magic and the real

63
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.090
value of the trained model comes into play when it can

64
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.840
recognize new things that you pass in.

65
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.620
For instance,

66
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.760
a banking application that needs to read the dollar

67
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.210
amounts that somebody hand wrote on a check.

68
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.790
That image could be passed to the model and the model can see a Ah ha!

69
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.930
This check is for $235 or a shipping application that scans hand written

70
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.940
addresses and needs to extract ZIP codes or address numbers.

71
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.430
This end pieces the prediction that the model makes,

72
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.720
or sometimes referred to as inference.

73
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.420
We're saying that based on all of this quote unquote knowledge,

74
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.970
the model has about numbers were able to predict that the ZIP code is

75
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.780
98 want to one or whatever it is or another example.

76
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.650
Maybe you've got an e commerce application.

77
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.140
You need to detect fraud during a purchase transaction.

78
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.810
So would feed in data about what fraud looks like.

79
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.370
Train the model on that data,

80
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.400
and then we'll be able to say a that transaction looks a little bit fishy.

81
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.200
There is a 93% chance that transaction is fraudulent and then take

82
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.790
appropriate action and the final example thinking back to our story

83
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.940
of Globomantics we have a bunch of data about customers like how

84
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.500
often they call in for support, what kind of plans there on,

85
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.140
what type of usage they have and so forth.

86
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.940
And ultimately, if that customer left to go to another carrier,

87
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.370
we train our model on that existing data and then is a customer

88
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.850
service agent is on the phone with a customer.

89
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.070
Maybe on the profile screen, for instance,

90
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.240
that CIA prediction score of there's a 37% chance this customers

91
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.970
going to leave or a 95% chance the customer will leave,

92
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.740
in which case you'd want to offer some kind of an

93
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.540
incentive to retain them as a customer.

94
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.890
Now, I mentioned a few percentages in those last examples.

95
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.240
The customer has a 95% chance of leaving and so forth,

96
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.250
and that's really what you're getting.

97
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.230
With that prediction.

98
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.840
It's a probability between zero and one where zero means

99
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.100
impossible and one or 100% means certain and in the middle

100
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.840
is an equal chance or 50%.

101
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.400
You'll call the trained model, passing some new data,

102
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.840
and the prediction it makes will be somewhere on this line.

103
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.330
So if we had to summarize all of the points we discovered and

104
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.220
put them into a more complete definition.

105
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.960
We can say that machine learning identifies patterns in

106
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.000
existing data to make predictions about new data. Now let's talk about deep learning.
