1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,440
[Autogenerated] machine Learning services.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,570
As I mentioned earlier, we've seen a lot of these in previous modules,

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,160
but let me just go out to the dashboard and highlight a few additional

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,980
things here on the sage maker Dashboard over on the left.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,240
You can see that we have ground truth, and this is all about labeling your data.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,560
You can use automatic labeling to do some of this and

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,380
then pull in humans as necessary.

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,840
And that human workforce is called mechanical Turk scrolling down.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,040
We've seen notebooks, training and inference capabilities already,

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,440
but we haven't really talked about the marketplace,

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,750
so let's take a quick look at that.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,420
I'll click into all products in the AWS marketplace.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,740
You can purchase things like pre built models,

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,840
algorithms and data exchange products,

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,020
and this page is only surfacing the featured ones.

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,770
But there's a lot more.

17
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,820
If you look at all products, so say you need a very specialized dataset.

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,140
Say something like these synthetic data for lung cancer.

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,330
If we click in here to view product here,

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,810
we can view more detail about what's included in here and

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,640
actually purchased the dataset and backing up.

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,230
Maybe there's other things.

23
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,190
Say, for instance, up here.

24
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,390
We've got abusive text content detection.

25
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,440
We could be the details for this.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,340
This might be a great way to get the functionality you

27
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,310
need and something that's kind of tried and true without

28
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,440
having to start from scratch.

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,630
So there's nothing real specific I want to call out here,

30
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:38,000
but just be aware that the marketplace is out there and sage maker can do work with products that you purchase here.
