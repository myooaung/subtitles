00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.970
[Autogenerated] what's your model is deployed and out there in the world,

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.640
you'll need to monitor and collect information about how it's doing,

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.190
which is the last step of the process.

4
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.470
Here there are two primary services you'll be using for monitoring.

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.990
First is CloudWatch.

6
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.210
All of the logs and operational metrics for your

7
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.220
model gets stored in CloudWatch, you can view things like CPU usage,

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.490
memory, GPU utilization, disc utilization and a lot more from within sage maker.

9
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.940
If you go to view logs that will launch a CloudWatch window for you,

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.950
the other service who uses CloudTrail this is the service you

11
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.510
want for monitoring activity around your API.

12
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.830
Who's calling the API there IP address dates,

13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.790
times and so on and then a fairly recent addition to the sage maker

14
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.040
family released to the End of 2019 is Model monitor.

15
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.240
This service continually monitors the quality of your models in production.

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.340
It will automatically collect data from your endpoints.

17
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.280
It detects changes as compared to baseline and the baselines created

18
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.640
from the dataset used to originally train the model,

19
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.740
it can detect data drift.

20
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.900
An example of data drift would be something like your model predicts

21
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.900
house prices but it's the real estate market Changes due to major

22
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.890
downturns or upticks your prediction slowly become less accurate model

23
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:26.000
monitor can do tech stuff like that for you, and it also offers visualization tools for viewing your results and statistics.
