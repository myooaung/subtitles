1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,240
[Autogenerated] artificial intelligence services.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,250
At the top of the diagram you'll see the are some major buckets for AI services,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,940
vision, speech, language, chatbots forecasting and recommendations.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,580
And with these,

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,270
you're not going to have to worry about picking the right algorithm or

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,540
tuning your hyper parameters deploying and so forth.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,610
These services do all that work for you.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,540
Starting with vision.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,290
There are three services to know about here.

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,430
Recognition, image recognition video and textract recognition.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,940
Images used for things like facial recognition,

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,800
image search sentiment analysis,

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,350
image moderation and face based verification recognition.

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,420
Video, as you might suspect from the name is for videos,

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,840
things like video search or video moderation.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,370
And then, finally, with Textract,

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,230
you can use this for document import and processing or text

18
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,240
extraction for natural language processing.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,430
This service just extracts the text out,

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,840
and then you can use other services like Comprehend to make sense of it.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,400
For speech.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,970
We have a couple of services.

23
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,660
Those are going to be Polly and transcribe Polly.

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,040
Is these text to speech services?

25
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,640
You'll sometimes see.

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,130
The poly logo has a parrot on it, So just remember that like a parrot,

27
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,340
Polly is going to talk.

28
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,820
Some use cases here are reading e books and training materials to

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,740
the visually impaired and announcement systems.

30
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,640
Transcribe is sort of the reverse here with speech to text.

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,010
Here.

32
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,040
Somebody talks and then transcribe is going to type or transcribe what you said.

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,380
Some use cases here would be closed captioning and subtitles,

34
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,840
or maybe transcribing customer service calls.

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,590
Now looking at language services here,

36
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,640
we have translate and comprehend and comprehend medical,

37
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,240
which is targeted to the health care industry.

38
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,830
Translate produces natural sounding language.

39
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,910
Translation.

40
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,940
So, for example, input English and output French.

41
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,160
A great use case here is when you need to localize your applications for

42
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,640
global audience or do sentiment analysis on multiple languages.

43
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,930
Comprehend and comprehend.

44
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,470
Medical.

45
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,140
These are all about making sense of your data.

46
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,620
You can use this to make sense of unstructured data like emails,

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,740
social media posts, reviews and support tickets.

48
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,110
How about Chat Box?

49
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,240
We have support for that as well.

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,990
The services called Lex.

51
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,320
With Lex, you could build conversational interfaces,

52
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,540
leveraging the same technology that powers Alexa.

53
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,440
Some common use cases here are call center bots where you

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,980
could do the initial intake and then pass the customer off

55
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,940
to someone else if needed.

56
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,050
Informational bots.

57
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,490
Things like the weather forecast for next week and productivity

58
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,620
bots to do things like schedule meetings,

59
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,340
book travel, tickets and so forth forecasting.

60
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,370
With so much data at our fingertips today,

61
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,640
wouldn't it be nice to be able to forecast the future?

62
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,310
And that's what forecast is all about This Does time series

63
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,640
forecasting using historical and related data some common use

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,680
cases Here are Salesforce casting,

65
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,340
financial planning and resource planning recommendations

66
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,780
We've touched on this a little bit.

67
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,930
Is far as a different algorithms that could be used to build in train a model?

68
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,490
But there's also a service for that, and it's called Personalized.

69
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,010
This is all about personalizing the user experience in real time,

70
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,850
so things like similar item recommendations,

71
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,880
content recommendations and personalized rankings and that

72
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,000
wraps it up for the top layer of AI services. Now let's move down a layer to ML services
