[Autogenerated] hi there.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.400
And welcome to this next module in the course about machine learning on AWS.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.190
I'm Amber is real JSON just to recap where we are in the big picture.

4
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.930
Last time we went over the mechanics of the course and how to get things

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.850
set up to follow along with the demos in this module,

6
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.140
we're going to start digging into concepts a little bit more.

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.940
We'll start by getting some terminology out of the

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.940
way for artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning.

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.760
Well, then take a closer look at machine learning and deep learning.

10
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.420
And finally, we'll get into some use cases for M L.

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.510
When does it make sense?

12
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.240
And when doesn't it make sense?

13
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.980
Let's start with this if you don't already know,

14
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.220
artificial intelligence,

15
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.140
machine learning and deep learning are not the same thing.

16
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.140
I hear and see them used interchangeably a lot,

17
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.740
but that's not quite right, but they're definitely related.

18
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.760
Let's start with artificial intelligence.

19
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.640
AI has actually been around for a long time since the 19 fifties,

20
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.570
and it's sort of an overarching term.

21
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.440
That means that we're enabling computers to mimic human behavior,

22
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.430
an image that might come to mind his computer

23
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.220
playing chess against a human machine.

24
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.020
Learning is a subset of AI,

25
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.950
and we'll build out a more complete definition of that in a little bit.

26
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.920
But at its core, algorithms learn and improve performance over time.

27
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.940
By using data, you pass a bunch of data about what credit card fraud looks like.

28
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.800
For instance,

29
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.570
the computer learns it and then can do predict if new

30
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.740
incoming transactions might be fraudulent.

31
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.920
Deep learning is a subset of ML, and here we're talking about neural networks,

32
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.010
which you can kind of think of as an artificial

33
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.640
representation of how the human brain works.

34
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.150
You might have heard of convolution, URL,

35
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.140
neural networks, CNN's or recurrent neural networks are en ends,

36
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.760
and you'll find this kind of deep learning in all

37
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:49.000
kinds of the built in AWS services. Things like speech recognition, computer vision, recommendation engines and more
