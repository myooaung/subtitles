00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.360
OK so we're at the end of this section.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.200
And as always it's your turn to put it into practice as you can see these giant letters.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.440
So we've got a couple of problems here that cover basically everything we talked about not everything

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.600
but all the big things we talked about in this section all about data types.

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:26.220
So strings text data types numeric data types and then date time information and ways of working with

6
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.220
those dates with some of the more common date functions.

7
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.480
So there's a couple of exercises here.

8
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.160
Some of them involve writing code.

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.810
Some of them are fill in the blanks.

10
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.710
Some of them are just I don't know what you would call this free response like this one here.

11
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.870
So let's get started.

12
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.400
And then in the next video we'll have a solution.

13
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:55.400
So this one was a good use case for char or chair or not chair chair or car that data type.

14
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.870
So when would you use that instead of or in lieu of Vardar.

15
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.040
So you can use one of the things that we talked about or come up with your own.

16
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.330
You don't have to write it down.

17
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.910
Just come up with something.

18
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.910
Next up fill in the blanks here.

19
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.700
So we've got a table that I'm creating called inventory or inventories or whatever some sort of something

20
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.250
that we're storing books or toys.

21
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.860
We've got an item name.

22
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.800
What data type should that be.

23
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.120
There's not necessarily one only one workable answer but there's one better answer price.

24
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.680
So what data types should price be and not just the type of not just the name of the data type but what

25
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.480
are you going to put in those parentheses.

26
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.620
And as a note all of our prices are less than $1 billion.

27
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.980
Not equal to $1 million just to be clear.

28
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.910
There are less than 1 million.

29
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.640
So how would we represent that with our data type and then quantity that number as well what data type

30
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.320
makes the most sense there.

31
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.490
Okay.

32
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.340
Then moving on.

33
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.970
What's the difference between Date Time and time stamp.

34
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.820
There's not just one difference but when would you use one versus the other.

35
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.080
How are they different.

36
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.980
This is we talked about it we've looked at the documentation for both of them.

37
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.430
So hopefully it's not too hard.

38
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.740
Next up in cloud 9 print out the current time using my as well.

39
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.320
So just the time then the next question is to print out the current date but not the time.

40
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.720
So just the date and then once you've done that print out the current day of the week the number of

41
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.130
the day of the week so if it's a what is it a Saturday it should be 7.

42
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.870
If it's a Friday 6 and so on.

43
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.100
So just print that out and then do the same thing print of the current day the week.

44
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.270
But this time it should be the name of the day that week like Monday or Tuesday.

45
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.680
So the English name of the day of the week for today the current whenever you're running this print

46
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.030
out the day the week.

47
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.430
Next up.

48
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:22.130
Print out the current day and time using this format so to month or month month slash day day slash

49
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.130
4 digits for the year.

50
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.890
And then once you've done that we have another one print out the current day and time using this format

51
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.300
which I wasn't sure how to actually boil this down to a nice little formula like we have here.

52
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.020
So I just gave you two examples.

53
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.470
So we have the full month name.

54
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.410
January or April.

55
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.350
Then we have this which there's a name for it.

56
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.970
I think it's Anglicized it Anglicize digits or something.

57
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.130
It's in the documentation so we didn't cover that.

58
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.380
You'll have to dig around to figure out how you format it this way.

59
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.880
But with the day of the month like two or one.

60
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.940
But instead of just the number we want this Anglicized version.

61
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.550
So second first third tent and so on.

62
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:15.810
And then at and then the time and for the time we just want our call and.

63
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.110
After you've done that we have one final thing create a tweet table and the tweets table should store

64
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.060
the content of a tweet.

65
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.740
So that's going to be text and I believe what is it 140 characters.

66
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.910
And then a user name and we don't need a character limit for that.

67
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.940
Or I don't know let's say 20 characters but that's not that important.

68
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.060
And then we also want to store the time that tweet was created.

69
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.600
When you've done that pat yourself on the back.
