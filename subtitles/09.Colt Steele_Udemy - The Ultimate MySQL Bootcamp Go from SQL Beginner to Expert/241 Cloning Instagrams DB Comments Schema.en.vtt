1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.600
All right.

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.550
So we're moving on now to comments and we did.

3
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.170
Users first and photos for a reason.

4
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.250
One is that they're simpler and essentially Instagram but also comments is going to rely on them because

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:23.110
if you think about how comments work you know if we go way back here these comments over here this anti-green

6
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.230
box to draw your attention are written by somebody.

7
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.490
Right.

8
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.160
So it's not just a comment like awesome or banger but there's also somebody who wrote that comment.

9
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.220
So there's some association there so a comment needs to be related to a user.

10
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.200
But then these comments are related to a particular photo.

11
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.950
These comments here are for this photo not this one.

12
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.790
Right.

13
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.020
So they're not just floating in thin air but they're also related to a photo which means we're actually

14
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.630
going to have two foreign keys.

15
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.970
So looks like this.

16
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:05.510
We have a comments table comments will have an ID primary key or comment text which is just you know

17
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.520
the text of the comment.

18
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.570
I didn't want to call it text because that's reserved word in my ask.

19
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.520
Well even though it might work for you which is not a good idea to mess with that in reserve word meaning

20
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.480
that you know text is a particular data type it's something that's used in my.

21
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.210
Well in the language so naming a column in a table is not a great idea.

22
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.910
It's like naming a column you know integer.

23
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.910
OK then we've got user ID which is a foreign key related to the user's dot ID.

24
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.020
So that's how we know who wrote it.

25
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.240
Then we've got photo photo-ID which is also foreign key.

26
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.270
This time two photos that ID which is how we know which photo the comment is on.

27
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.700
And then we've got our good old friend created it.

28
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.120
So let's hop over to cloud 9.

29
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.810
Do it down here.

30
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.850
After photos so it will do a create table comments.

31
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:17.110
And our main things we've got ID we've got comment text and we've got user ID photo ID and created it.

32
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.670
So we'll start with ID we'll do integer autoincrement primary key.

33
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:34.120
Pretty standard comment text will just be our char 2:55 as well as we want to make sure it's not know

34
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.430
we don't want anyone leaving empty comments.

35
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.820
If you try them on Instagram and just won't post it then we've got user ID which is just an integer.

36
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.480
But we also want that to be not know we don't want to have a comment that's an orphan that's not related

37
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.410
to a user.

38
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.780
Same thing for photo-ID.

39
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.990
It's going to be an integer.

40
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.310
And we also don't want it to be not know or we don't want it to be No.

41
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.490
We want to make sure it's not all because then we'd have another type of an orphan comment without apparent

42
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.210
photo.

43
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.230
So we have these two relationships here user and photo are related to comments.

44
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.880
OK.

45
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.350
And we don't want either one to be no and then created that good old time stamped default now.

46
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:27.310
But we're missing our foreign key constraints so foreign key will start with user underscore ID reference's

47
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.630
users ID comma.

48
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.210
Then we've got another foreign key.

49
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:45.500
This time we're working with photo ID which referer and says photos Id.

50
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.110
There we go.

51
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.520
OK.

52
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.840
So just to make sure I don't have any typos here.

53
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.230
My semi colon and I'm just going to resource that I can find it.

54
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.790
Here we go.

55
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.400
Looks good so far.

56
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.810
I tried to show tables.

57
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.200
I've got comments and I can do describe comments and we're good.

58
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.510
All right.

59
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.080
So just like the last few videos.

60
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.820
Stop here if you feel good with this.

61
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.150
If you want to see me inserts and data and see how we relate things when we actually insert the data

62
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.370
I'm going to do that.

63
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.250
But of course move on if you feel comfortable.

64
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.390
So if you're still here what I'll do is insert a couple of comments between here related to you know

65
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.330
these three users and these these three photos and this is where it gets kind of difficult to keep everything

66
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.450
straight keep all the IDs and everything straight in your head.

67
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:42.230
So we'll do an insert into comments and we'll have comment text then we'll start with a user id who's

68
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.600
posting it.

69
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.700
And then the photo ID values.

70
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.270
So let's say our first comment is going to be blue.

71
00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:02.320
Commenting on this photo here saying this is our comment it's just me.

72
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.580
OK.

73
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.610
So that's the comment text and the user ID is.

74
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.200
Who's saying it flew the cat has an idea of one.

75
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.670
And I just know you can tell because we inserted her first but of course if we went back to our select

76
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:23.260
way back here you can see now you can see there you can see here her IDs one.

77
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.120
OK.

78
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:33.160
And then the photo ID will say she's commenting on this one here a photo ID of two and I'll duplicate

79
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.960
that.

80
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.280
So let's say somebody else commented.

81
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:44.980
Say someone says Amazing shot on the same photo photo here and say I commented on that.

82
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.740
So that would be my user ID 3.

83
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.930
And we'll do one more this time.

84
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.300
Let's say Charlie Brown was commenting.

85
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.940
I HEART.

86
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.970
And Charlie Brown is easier I do too.

87
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.990
And let's say he's commenting on the first photo that was submitted by blue user id one so you can see

88
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.620
how it gets a little bit crazy.

89
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:21.520
But we can do that now and make sure I have my semi colon that of a comma there this time if we source

90
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.080
it everything looks good.

91
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.950
We can do is select star from comments.

92
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:27.580
There we go.

93
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.180
We've got three comments we could put a user ID in and a photo ID.

94
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.280
I want to do that now.

95
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.360
We'll do it as an exercise later with some more complex data.

96
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.920
But of course you can do that if you want a little bit of practice.
