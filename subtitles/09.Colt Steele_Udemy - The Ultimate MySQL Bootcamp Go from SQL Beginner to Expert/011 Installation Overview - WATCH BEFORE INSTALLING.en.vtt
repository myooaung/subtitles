00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.840
Already so is often a healthy amount of time talking about higher level things kind of setting the stage

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.190
for this course.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.740
Why should you care about databases what are databases what's.

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.090
Well where's that fit in what sequel.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.950
And so on.

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.190
Now it's actually time for us to really get going.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.430
So hopefully that's a little bit exciting.

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.040
Unfortunately the first thing we have to do is install the tools install my as you will on your computers.

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.350
So I want to add a note really early on which is that in my experience installing anything can be a

10
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.010
pain.

11
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.700
And that's true for someone who is an experienced developer all the way down to a complete beginner.

12
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.110
It's always a potential point of friction or things can go wrong and nothing is more frustrating than

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.120
being excited to do something.

14
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.520
Being excited to learn something new and then have it not work or have to spend hours trying to figure

15
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.320
out why it's not installed correctly and what's going on in my opinion.

16
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.580
It's one of the worst parts of being a developer.

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.920
And then also in my experience teaching I've seen a lot of people get discouraged really quickly when

18
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.320
something doesn't work out.

19
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.640
If you're unable to install my s.

20
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.560
Well when you want to learn as well it might just send you in a different direction and you might end

21
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.410
up learning another database like sequel light that doesn't require as much setup and that's easier

22
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.280
to install.

23
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.840
So we don't want that to happen.

24
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.050
Nothing against sequel.

25
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.320
This is not a course on sequel lite.

26
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.810
So I just wanted to put that out there that keep in mind installing can be a pain but I'm going to do

27
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.070
my best to try and make it painless.

28
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.680
So we have three options.

29
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.550
The first one for installation is to install it on a PC.

30
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.750
So if you have a PC if you're a Windows user you can follow those instructions.

31
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.860
The next option is you probably guessed is that you can install it on a Mac.

32
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.440
So if you're following along using a Mac this should be a good choice for you.

33
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.750
But there's also a third option which is to install it using a service called Cloud 9.

34
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.340
So if you've taken my other course you may be familiar with Cloud 9.

35
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.150
Basically an online interactive development environment in just a couple of videos or go into some more

36
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.100
detail about it.

37
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.100
And before we go any further I just want to highlight that installing using Cloud 9 is without a doubt

38
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.630
the best and easiest way to get started.

39
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.050
And it's what I recommend that you use which is why I spent so much time drawing this little box around

40
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.060
it install on cloud nine.

41
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.070
So why is that.

42
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.290
Why do we recommend that you use cloud 9.

43
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.350
There's a couple of reasons.

44
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.390
The first is that it's what I'll be using in the course.

45
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.970
So rather than doing everything on a Mac and confusing the Windows people are doing everything on a

46
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.270
PC and confusing people on a Mac.

47
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.370
I'm going to use cloud 9 which is something that anybody can use regardless of the type of machine that

48
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.100
you own.

49
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.330
How old it is how much RAM you have what operating system that doesn't matter.

50
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.720
It levels the playing field.

51
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.660
So because I'll be using it in the course I think it makes it a lot easier for you to follow along.

52
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.680
Now if you're someone who's pretty confident as a developer of course feel free to install it however

53
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.070
you like but I highly highly recommend that you use cloud 9 at least early on because you'll be able

54
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.300
to follow along much much easier.

55
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.320
And the second reason equally important is that it's way easier for you to get help if something goes

56
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.970
wrong.

57
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.930
If you're doing a project or an exercise and something doesn't seem to be working the way you expect

58
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.530
or you hit a bug or you're just not sure what you did wrong you can easily share the link to your environment

59
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.990
through cloud 9 and post that on our discussion boards and either me or one of the teams can help you

60
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.780
out.

61
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.050
So it's way easier for you to get help if you just working on your PC or Mac and you're trying to explain

62
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.840
what's wrong.

63
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.120
You're going to have to take some screenshots you have to upload them.

64
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.560
You might have to copy and paste some stuff from a terminal but if you use cloud 9 and I'll show you

65
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.230
this when we talk about cloud 9 in more depth you can just take the link of your workspace and share

66
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.020
that and anyone will be able to look at your code and diagnose the problem.

67
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.320
And the third reason they didn't write down and this is a really important one is that installation

68
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.360
is basically painless.

69
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.410
You have to sign up for an account and that's about the worst part.

70
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.550
Once you're past that it's one command to get my 12 working which is pretty amazing.

71
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.260
So with all of that said this is my recommendation or prescription for how you should go about this

72
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.240
course use cloud 9 to follow along throughout the course.

73
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.970
So everything that I do in cloud 9 you'll be able to replicate yourself in cloud 9.

74
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.520
And then once we finish the course you can return back to the installation instructions and then install

75
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.230
it on your Mac or your PC natively.

76
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.380
So I'll talk about what that means.

77
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.300
What's the difference between installing natively versus cloud 9.

78
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.300
When we talk more about cloud 9 and just a little bit.

79
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.780
So that's my recommendation.

80
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.240
I highly highly recommend that you start with cloud 9 and then later on if you'd like move to working

81
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.690
on your PC or your Mac.

82
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.400
All right.

83
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.030
So enough about that let's get down to business.
