00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.630
The next Pilton string function that we'll work with is called replace and what it does is it replaces

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.700
parts of a string.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.130
So if you want to get rid of a certain occurrence of a character or you wanted to replace all spaces

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.840
with commas or something like that you could use replace and the syntax looks like this.

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.580
Here's an example where we have the string hello world and you know what I just realized this again.

6
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.160
That's a bad word right there.

7
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.260
So if we want to get rid of that we could use Replace hello world comma.

8
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.190
What we're trying to remove.

9
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.560
And then what we want to replace it with and it will do that to all occurrences.

10
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.270
In this case hell only occurs once.

11
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.740
So that's what our output looks like.

12
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.720
Percent star Octa Thorpe.

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.160
Oh what's this thing called.

14
00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.400
There's an actual name for the at symbol but there's a real name and then O world.

15
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.120
So if I copy that over and just run it now.

16
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.810
See that's the output that we get.

17
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:17.350
We could also do something like replace hello world and let's just replace all Elle's with sevens.

18
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.920
Why not.

19
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.680
And that's what we need to do there.

20
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.390
And then we get hello world but with sevens instead of ells you know we could do the same thing just

21
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.740
to show you one more with oh's and replace them with zero.

22
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.150
Now one thing that is important to pay attention to.

23
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.670
Let's say I have hello here with a capital O.

24
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.520
Hello.

25
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.620
Here with a lowercase Oh excuse me world with lower case so the idea just say have upper and lower case

26
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.570
oves in here.

27
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.070
If I try and replace 0 and then say I just want to replace it with.

28
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.220
That's an asterisk.

29
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.810
What do you think will happen.

30
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.140
And the answer is it only replaces exactly this character so it is case sensitive.

31
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.020
So it didn't touch this capital O here.

32
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.250
So that's one way to use your place the other way that I mentioned is that it can replace multiple things.

33
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.960
So here is a civic example where I have a string cheese space bread space coffee space milk.

34
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:32.240
Maybe it's a grocery list or something and I want to replace all spaces with the string and wall space

35
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.410
and space.

36
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.640
Basically the output will be cheese and bread and coffee and milk inserted that right there.

37
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.060
Here here and here every time there's a space.

38
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.640
So if I tried running that you can see it works.

39
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.460
Cheese and bread and coffee and milk.

40
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.680
So now let's do something with the book data we have.

41
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.970
We'll do something really simple and similar to what we just did.

42
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.490
Let's replace all E's with threes and we'll just do lowercase E's So anytime there's a lowercase like

43
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.090
namesake Norse American we'll replace it with three.

44
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.950
So to do that is a select replace and don't ask why.

45
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.860
It's not really a real world example but it's like a place you want to do title.

46
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.340
And then what are we trying to replace lowercase is what do we want to replace him with three.

47
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.200
And then what table from books.

48
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:38.310
And we could get more specific but let's just do from books and you can see where you get the name sake

49
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.760
with three threes and all the way down.

50
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.520
Consider the lobster Cannery Row and so on.

51
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.650
And that's pretty much it to using replace a bit of a bonus at the end here is that also you can combine

52
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.530
replace with other functions like we've already seen use concat and substring together so we could try

53
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.430
the same thing by using replace and Concat for instance.

54
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.030
So I could do something like If I work in this book code I will comment this out which I haven't shown

55
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.840
how to do yet.

56
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.220
Highlighted it and on a Mac its command slash on a PC I believe it is control slash.

57
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:23.030
And when it commented out which means it just won't run it Tirso I can see it but sequel treats it are

58
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.400
minuscule treats it as if there's nothing there when it runs it.

59
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.780
So what I want to do now I want to combine replace.

60
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.740
So what I'm going to do is select and I'm just going to fill in some rough blanks here so we have a

61
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.030
place and then we're going to have from books.

62
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.820
But what we want to do is not just replace things I'll do the same thing where we replace all ease with

63
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:55.810
threes so that replace title the lower case e with three like that.

64
00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.420
But I'm only going to take the first 10 characters like we did with substring.

65
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:11.720
So I need to do substring and I want to do substring of this whole thing.

66
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.300
And you know I'm realizing as this goes on this is a little convoluted so I'll throw up another Don't

67
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.280
panic here.

68
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.920
This is more just me showing you that it's something you can do but it's not essential that you wrap

69
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.760
your head around this entirely but just to show you so substring.

70
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.600
And the first argument is replace this whole thing.

71
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:44.630
So basically we're taking a substring of this and then if this and we want to go from 1 to 10 so that's

72
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.310
a lot there.

73
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:54.230
Now if I pasted in here you can see what it did was first replace always with three and then take the

74
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.400
substring of that from 1 to 10.

75
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.010
And of course we could give it a better name because it is pretty ugly.

76
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:11.540
So we could do as weird string let's say and now we have weird string appear and yeah that's pretty

77
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.840
much it.

78
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.270
I just wanted to show that we could combine them together.

79
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.790
Why you would do this exactly again.

80
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.060
You probably wouldn't.

81
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.670
But the key here is that they're kind of like Lego pieces you can reorder them you can.

82
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.640
Well maybe more like nesting dolls actually where you can nest them inside of one another.

83
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.940
So like we did substring inside of a concat we can do a replace inside of substring.

84
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.490
So that's enough of a place we're going to continue with a couple more and then we'll do some challenges.
