1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,650
OK so next up we have a return to these long annoying tables with quite a few fields on this one.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,530
This is sort of like analytics for our reviewers and what we're doing here is compiling statistics on

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:13,860
them.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,490
So Thomas Stoneman how many reviews has he written.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,020
Five.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,940
OK what's the minimum he's assigned.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,120
7:04 No the maximum review is a nine point five.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:31,220
His average is eight point two and then a status which is saying that he's active and that's determined

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,330
to based off if the user has any reviews.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,390
So Marlatt and craft Craford has zero.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,810
So he is inactive but everyone else is active.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,730
So we've got a lot of pieces here and probably the most crucial thing to point out is that we have Marlan

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,060
Craford who has zero reviews which we need to pay attention to.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,360
We have to pay special attention to that because there's not going to be a natural join if we do an

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,290
inner join to we'll need to do a left join which will highlight the fact that he has no reviews and

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,900
then the rest is not too difficult.

17
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,180
Count min max average should be pretty comfortable with that status.

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,680
We need to do some logic there.

19
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,760
So let's start by adding in challenge

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:26,180
6 we'll just call this reviewer stacks.

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,040
OK.

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,470
So the tables we're working with we've got the reviewer table which is where we're pulling things like

23
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,700
the name.

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,350
And then we've got the reviews table which is where we're pulling count.

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,990
Well that's where we're pulling the the actual ratings themselves.

26
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,070
And then we're basically getting this data from there.

27
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,850
So we don't need to worry about the series table we're not working with that.

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,400
We will be in the next.

29
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,470
The final challenge here.

30
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,660
We're going to put all three together.

31
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,970
But in this case we're not.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,690
So we'll start with a select star.

33
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,620
Let's just do.

34
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:04,790
Well we'll start to start it's like star from reviewers we get all of our viewers here.

35
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,740
Perfect.

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,350
We want all of them.

37
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,740
So that will be the left part of our joint if you remember the two circles a and b.

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,930
This will be Circle A.

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,350
Right here.

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,350
We want all of this to show up even though Marlyn doesn't have any reviews.

41
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:30,040
Then we're going to do a join join revues on reviewers dot ID's where the reviewer Id like this one

42
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:38,280
two three four five six is equal to the reviews dot reviewer ID.

43
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,330
And then in the case of Marlan there is no reviewer ID equal to 7 in the reviews table.

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,190
So we'll get.

45
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,310
No no no.

46
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:56,280
And so on OK let's try it and if we take a look at the results here we don't get those Nil's and that's

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,670
because we didn't specify that it's a left join.

48
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,560
We left that off.

49
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,810
Now at the end we have Marlan Craford.

50
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,340
No no no no.

51
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:15,750
We need to make use of to do things like this where we have zero min max average or 0 0 and then inactive.

52
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,710
So we'll have to kind of make special exceptions for Marlin or for anybody with no.

53
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,910
OK so now let's start whittling down what we need.

54
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,190
We on first name last name.

55
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,070
So what we have here.

56
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,000
Right.

57
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,560
Then we want things that count.

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,170
Min max and average which requires us to group by but let's start by just putting rating here without

59
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,450
grouping.

60
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,120
Just verify what we need exactly.

61
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,010
OK so here's all the reviews and we want to group them together and we could group based off of first

62
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,340
name and last name.

63
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,820
But that's not guaranteed to be unique of course.

64
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:04,230
So it's better to group based off of the reviewer's I.D. so we can do that now group by reviewers.

65
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,140
Id just like that.

66
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,470
And if we do that.

67
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:14,790
Whoops didn't mean to expand again our group is working into weird magic.

68
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,670
It's working behind the scenes.

69
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,320
So now we can do things like average.

70
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,280
For instance let's start there.

71
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,830
Well actually even easier is counts.

72
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,030
We'll just count the ratings.

73
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,330
So behind the scenes it's group them.

74
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,930
Remember it went from this here.

75
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,390
So if we take a look at like these they were all grouped together.

76
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:44,570
So under Thomas Stoneman there's one two three four five but we only see Thomas Stoneman.

77
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,940
We don't get five results but they're there behind the scenes.

78
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:55,650
So you do count rading and you can see it looks good.

79
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,500
We get 5 9.

80
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,020
You can see Domingo and called for a ton of reviews.

81
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,420
Poor Marlon just hasn't written any.

82
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,280
So that's a start.

83
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,620
Then you've got Min and Max.

84
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:17,360
So those were quite simple to just let's start with men the men reading they've written and that works

85
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,500
for everybody except for good old Marlon causing us problems and we should be relatively comfortable

86
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,560
with fixing this at this point.

87
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,010
Notice that I just sent it to zero could have said it to be anything you could leave it at all.

88
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:41,020
But let's make it zero to match the chart so we can use our if no min rating then we'll set it to be

89
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,990
zero.

90
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,920
And if I leave it like this our table is going to be kind of ugly because we have this if not appear

91
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,290
we don't need all the space.

92
00:05:49,390 --> 00:06:00,300
So let's call this one as count and this one as men that you put down on the space looking better.

93
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:08,320
And then the same thing for max which we can just copy and just change men to Max.

94
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:15,120
OK so we got men and Max that's just triple check.

95
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,080
There we go.

96
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,210
Count min max.

97
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:23,590
And we've got average which by now you should be comfortable with doing as well.

98
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:32,000
It's the same thing as average but we'll run into that same problem with no we don't want no there.

99
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,150
We just want zero.

100
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,940
So if no.

101
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,290
Once again just like that

102
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,410
or copy it.

103
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,980
OK.

104
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:54,550
And we've got the first almost everything except now we need to work with status and status.

105
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,290
It's a little different because there's some logic here.

106
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,550
And what's that based off of.

107
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,030
Well it's based off of count.

108
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:06,080
So if count is more than one or greater than or equal to one then we'll call that user active for the

109
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:13,190
reviewer active otherwise it's inactive or we could switch it around we could say if count is equal

110
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,850
to exactly zero then status is inactive.

111
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,820
Otherwise they're active.

112
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,280
And to do it we could use a case statement and we can start with that.

113
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,640
What we're working with again is count.

114
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,300
So let's do this at the bottom our case.

115
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,380
And I'd like to do.

116
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,050
And as I said we'll call this status Okay.

117
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,780
And our first thing will check for in case is when Count rating and we can do when it's greater than

118
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:58,330
or equal to 1 then we say active status will be active else we need then here.

119
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:05,190
Otherwise in active active inactive.

120
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:10,450
Okay let's try that okay.

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,650
It works just fine.

122
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,350
But I did say there's another thing that we can do which I also haven't shown you until now I don't

123
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,360
want to overload you with a bunch of different ways of doing logic but for simpler case statements we

124
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,830
can use another function or another logical function which is called.

125
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,310
If so I'm just going to replace this with if I'll show you what it looks like.

126
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:36,420
We just say if and then the condition that we're looking for so if Count rating is greater than or equal

127
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:43,770
to 1 then the second argument is what we want to spit out and then the third one is the else condition

128
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,800
or the else argument.

129
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,970
So these are equivalent right here.

130
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,160
As long as they put status.

131
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,220
So let me make that a little bit easier to see this right here is saying OK if Count rating.

132
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:04,200
So if the count of all the ratings per each user each reviewer is greater than or equal to one then

133
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,360
status is active.

134
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,340
If that's not true status is inactive.

135
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,150
So this works great when we only have these two things that we're working with right.

136
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,350
Active and inactive.

137
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:21,870
But if we wanted to add another thing in it's a little more complex like if we wanted to say OK if it's

138
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,270
greater than 1 then they're active.

139
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,250
And if it's greater than 10 or greater than equal to 10 they're a power user or something otherwise

140
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,200
they're inactive.

141
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,720
It's much easier to use a case statement for that.

142
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,900
So I can show you that but I'm going to get rid of this first and just make sure that our new edition

143
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,260
works the same way.

144
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,480
Looks good to me.

145
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,000
We could go through and round.

146
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:54,350
Average is kind of gross but if we do that that's going to get quite gross to want to break that on

147
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,790
two separate lines.

148
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:02,750
We do want to format that to make it a lot more legible but otherwise it looks good.

149
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:09,200
So the last thing I'll do is optional as just to show you if we wanted to add in a third status from

150
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,650
active inactive and crazy active or something like that we can replace this.

151
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:26,870
If I go back to our case with the case and as status and we'll just do case when Count rating is greater

152
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:32,430
than or equal to 1 and actually let's start with if it's greater than or equal to 10.

153
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,970
In that case we'll say power user.

154
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:44,010
And then the next thing is when Count is greater than or equal to zero.

155
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,540
Let's just say active else and I need my hands.

156
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,580
I always forget those Else inactive.

157
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:06,130
So the way I formatted that is basically to say when it's the way that I formatted that is to say first

158
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,890
OK is it greater than or equal to 10.

159
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,780
Then it's a power user and we're done.

160
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,970
But if it's not that means that it's less than 10.

161
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,470
So if it's less than 10 but still greater than or equal to zero then they're active and that should

162
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,330
actually be greater than zero not equal.

163
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:27,720
And then if it's not greater than zero if not greater than or equal to 10 that means they're inactive.

164
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:34,550
So now copy that pasted over and you can see we have two power users Domingo and colt who have a count

165
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,410
of 10.

166
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,990
And now we're done.

167
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,620
So we made it through that quite a bit there.

168
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,310
I will leave this example.

169
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,130
But I will also duplicate it and go back to having that simple if statement so we don't have to have

170
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,920
a case.

171
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,040
OK so I'll do that.

172
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,190
You don't have to watch that but it's in the solution text or the solution file.

173
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,210
If you want to take a look.
