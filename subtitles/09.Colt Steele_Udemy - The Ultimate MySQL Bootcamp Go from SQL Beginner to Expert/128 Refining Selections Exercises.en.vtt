00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.800
Oh okey artichoke.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.200
Yep that's how I started this video off.

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.570
It's your turn.

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.000
So we've covered four different things here for new tools for this mysterious magical toolbox.

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.060
We've got distinct as well as ORDER BY and then limit.

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.380
And then finally like you're going to put those to use along with some of the stuff you've learned up

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.960
until this point with a couple of exercises and there are some clown images here to show you how excited

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
you should be and they're not at all creepy.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.580
So here's the first thing I need you to do.

10
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.630
Or I'd like you to do.

11
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.980
Please please do it.

12
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.370
Select All story collections.

13
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.930
So some of these books have titles that contain the word stories which tells you that they're are a

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.170
collection of stories.

15
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.230
What We Talk About When We Talk About Love Stories really good read by the way where I'm calling from

16
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.280
Selected Stories oblivian stories.

17
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.350
So using what we just saw and that's something I just want to point out for all of these exercises.

18
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.590
There are ways that you could directly select things maybe a little bit easier or you could cheat in

19
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.830
a way but make sure that you do it the way that I specify please.

20
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.140
Using that things you just learned so specifically titles that contain the word stories not exactly

21
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.840
stories but something that contains stories in it.

22
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.240
So that's the first one.

23
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.190
All right.

24
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.680
And then the next one find the longest book in the entire database or in the entire books table.

25
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.810
So this is what you should get back.

26
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.870
Print out the title and the pages The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay 634 pages of course don't

27
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.290
just select based off of four pages is exactly 6:34 or where the title is The Amazing Adventures of

28
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.770
cavalier.

29
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.030
Anyway please do it the right way so that your queery would always work no matter how many books are

30
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.010
in the table and what they're named and how many pages they have.

31
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.290
It will always get the longest book OK.

32
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.400
Just one.

33
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.380
Then the next problem print summary.

34
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:12.340
In our case a summary contains the title Dasch the year and print 3.

35
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.980
Only three of the most recent books.

36
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.410
So 2017 2016 and 2014.

37
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.090
So again a summary and it says it says summaries of that.

38
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.160
Remember how to do that.

39
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.670
The title Dasch the year it was released and then only print out the three most recently released books.

40
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.790
All right.

41
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:42.580
Next Next up is find all the books whose author's last name contains a space character and only David

42
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.180
Foster Wallace.

43
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.350
In our case.

44
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.690
Don't cheat and just say.

45
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.910
Author L name is exactly foster space.

46
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.870
WALLACE But how can you find any author last name that has a space in it.

47
00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.610
And then when to do that find the three books with the lowest number and the lowest stock quantity.

48
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.000
So as you can see here you forgot American Gods is 12 where I'm calling from has 12.

49
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.130
What we talk about when we talk about love has 23 and I'd like you to print the title.

50
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.560
The released year and the stock quantity.

51
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.510
So just to reiterate the three lowest stocks.

52
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.050
All right then we have this one.

53
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.330
Print the title and the author last name.

54
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.140
So you've got title author out name sorted by the author's last name.

55
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.010
So this is all of the books by the way so sort by the author last name and then sort by title you get

56
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.250
some of these authors for example Carver Eggers are game and have multiple books.

57
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.480
So if we look at Carver for instance Carver has what we talk about blah blah blah where I'm calling

58
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.700
from what we talk about comes before where I'm calling from alphabetically.

59
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.570
If that makes sense.

60
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.830
Same thing with Eggers a heartbreaking a hologram.

61
00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:03.850
The circle so sort first by the last name of the author and then on top of that the title then we've

62
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.310
got this one just make this happen.

63
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.070
It's kind of difficult to write out exactly what's happening.

64
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.790
The main idea is that we're going to go through every book you're going to print out this string here.

65
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.600
My favorite author is and this is yelling in all caps I won't wake my neighbors.

66
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.420
It's kind of fleet but my favorite author is and then the author's first name capitalized and the author's

67
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.590
last name capitalized and an exclamation point at the end.

68
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.530
And do that for every book sorted alphabetically by the author's last name so you can see Carver comes

69
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.480
first.

70
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.960
Aggers Foster Wallace game and down to Steinback and then McCrery.

71
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.240
Call it yellow up here.

72
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.610
Yes it's a bit of a complicated one but fortunately it's last.

73
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.920
Hopefully you can make this one work.

74
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.260
It's a little bit long.

75
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.370
Good luck.

76
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.820
See in this Lucian video.
