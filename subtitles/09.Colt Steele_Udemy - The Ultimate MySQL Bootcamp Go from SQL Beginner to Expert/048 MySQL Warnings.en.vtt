00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.240
Now this video is going to be a slight departure.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.200
We're still working with inserting data.

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.130
But it's a slight side note which has to do with something called warnings.

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.670
So to illustrate what I'm describing here if we tried to insert something that looks like this.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.670
So we're going back to cats and our cats have a name and an age.

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.760
If we tried to insert a cat whose name is this gigantic string this is a cat named Charlie which is

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.540
also a human name.

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.920
In fact I know a couple of Charlie's.

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.070
Fun fact if we're trying to put that as this cat's name and age is just 10.

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.400
If we do that let's go ahead and copy this just so I don't have to type that.

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.450
Make sure we have our cats table let's do describe cats.

12
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.550
Ok so name and age.

13
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.750
Remember those this restriction here of 50.

14
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.220
I'm just going to paste that and put a semi-colon.

15
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:05.200
I get something that says queery OK one reflected one warning just to double down on that.

16
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.230
I pulled it out into a separate slide one morning.

17
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.350
Oh my gosh what's going on.

18
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.960
Well if you wanted to know what that warning was we can use this command.

19
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.930
Show warnings.

20
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:27.580
So we'll go back and type show warnings and I want you to pause and think what is the warning.

21
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.660
If you were to guess obviously we haven't talked about it yet but what do you think.

22
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.100
I'll see.

23
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.710
And the answer is I get a warning here that says Data truncated for column name so that corresponds

24
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.310
to name here which had a limit of 50 characters.

25
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.270
And this is more than 50 characters I can't remember how much it is but it's more than 50.

26
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.350
And if we look at Katz

27
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.690
you'll see that our First of all our table gets a little messed up here.

28
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.700
But the string for name gets cut off after this cat is named Charlie which is also a.

29
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.680
And then the rest is gone.

30
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.700
So it's not like it's hidden and it's not displaying.

31
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.660
It's just not stored at all.

32
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.070
So that's important to note.

33
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.760
So that's one warning that we saw there.

34
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.130
And that happened when our data was truncated.

35
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.650
Can you think of another warning we could generate deliberately with something we could do that would

36
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.030
give us a warning to pause video or don't but try and come up with something based off of what we have

37
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.400
currently set up for cats.

38
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.000
How could we insert something that would give us a warning.

39
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.480
All right.

40
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.290
So what I was imagining is that we could try to insert something where we mixed up a data type.

41
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.160
So let's say age instead of being an integer we passed in some text random jibberish that should generate

42
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.950
a warning.

43
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.420
So let's try and insert into cat's name first and then age

44
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.760
and name will just be lemah.

45
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.910
Why not.

46
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.240
But age will be jibberish like that which is not a valid integer value.

47
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.420
Well hit enter.

48
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.670
We get one morning and we can view that warning with show warnings.

49
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.720
And this time it's a different warning.

50
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.860
It says incorrect integer value.

51
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.820
So the last one we saw said that name was truncated it was too long.

52
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.760
This one is telling us that incorrect integer value for column age.

53
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.980
So then here's a second thing for you to think about.

54
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.870
And you probably I mean Ill just have to guess but what do you think is stored in.
