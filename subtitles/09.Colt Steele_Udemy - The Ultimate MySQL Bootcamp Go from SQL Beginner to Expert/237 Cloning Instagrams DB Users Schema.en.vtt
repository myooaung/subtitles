00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.660
All right.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.640
So this is the first video of basically talking about the tables need and implementing the tables you

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.950
need for Instagram clone.

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.220
And the first thing we'll start with is users users is a pretty obvious place to start.

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.890
I guess another one might be photos but users is at the core of everything.

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.640
If you think about it because users are connected to you know photos are connected to comments they're

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.050
connected to likes they're not connected to hashtags but pretty much everything else relates to users.

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.800
So what I'm going to do here is something super simple like I said in the last video.

9
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.520
There's a lot more we can store here.

10
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.270
Email password.

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.300
Like 20 different things.

12
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.950
Location city IP address.

13
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.240
All that stuff.

14
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.960
We're just going to focus on the basics so when Id a user name and it created it and created that will

15
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.210
just be you know the day that user or the time stamp when the user signs up.

16
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.600
It will have a default value of now or current time stamp username.

17
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.410
It's just going to be of our Chaar of our car and ID will be a primary key and we'll be referencing

18
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.070
this ID in other places for example when we're talking about photos.

19
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.340
Photos will have a foreign key referencing the user ID.

20
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.640
So we'll go ahead and the first thing I have is just an empty directory.

21
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.820
I may add just to store this.

22
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.980
And I'm just going to make a new file and I'll just call it Instagram underscore and clone underscore

23
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.520
clone.

24
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.390
Eskew will open that up.

25
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.160
And this is where all work.

26
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:41.010
So this is where I'll do a create table users and like we said we're going to have an ID we have a username

27
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.120
and a created at so id is going to be integer or just.

28
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.460
And I'll do integer just because I've been doing it.

29
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.510
But it's an alias for integer.

30
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.840
Good to see both.

31
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.350
And we'll have it autoincrement.

32
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.460
And it's a primary key.

33
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.780
Great comma.

34
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.850
Come back to your name in just a second.

35
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:15.730
Created that will do time stamp with a default of now and you can also do current time stamp and remember

36
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.720
you could do date time aswell time stamp.

37
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.010
It's just smaller it's easier to store.

38
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.910
OK so then we've got username and we know it's just going to be a VAR char to 5:5.

39
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.460
There's another constraint that we could add though which is we want user to be unique.

40
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.920
We don't want anyone to be able to sign up with another with the same user name essentially.

41
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.470
So we can add unique.

42
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.830
And you might be wondering Well then why would we have him Id be the primary key.

43
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.080
Why not make user name a primary key.

44
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.910
You absolutely could do that.

45
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.670
But if you're going to have foreign keys somewhere referencing username and you're working with a long

46
00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.270
string of someone to use your name is you know something massive like that because we could do 255 characters.

47
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.820
That's going to be slower and more annoying to search potential while not potentially definitely slower.

48
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.480
If you have thousands and thousands of entries compared to a smaller integer so it's good to have a

49
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.050
primary keeping an integer.

50
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.760
We can still have this unique constraint and we can also add not no we don't want anyone to be able

51
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.100
to sign up without a username.

52
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.150
OK.

53
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.240
I'm going to go ahead and make a new database to put this in but I'm going to do it in this file.

54
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:36.960
So I'll do a create database and also just called Instagram or IGY clone and then I'll use IGY clone

55
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.390
just like that.

56
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.970
So now every time I run this file it's going to make this database use Instagram clone the new database

57
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.430
and create the table.

58
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.000
And the reason I'm doing that it's just one to show you that you can we haven't really seen using these

59
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.280
commands in a file but also as we go we may want to rerun this and recreate the users table or another

60
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.110
table if we realize we missed something up.

61
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.450
We need to change something.

62
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.200
We're not going to have any data in there yet.

63
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.690
So it's super easy just to create the database again.

64
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.720
Drop it then create it and then use it and then create a table of users.

65
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.270
OK.

66
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:22.500
So with that said let's try this then to do source and I need to reference this directory slash Instagram

67
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.990
clone as well.

68
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.700
Okay.

69
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.300
And just to double check the describe users.

70
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.650
That looks good.

71
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.180
OK.

72
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.210
So if you are good with that go ahead move on.

73
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.840
Next step we're going to talk about photos.

74
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.690
But I will spend a minute or two just adding one or two users so that we can work with them in this

75
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.350
section.

76
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.960
Remember in the next section we're going to have a massive data set that I'm going to give you but if

77
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:55.310
we want we can just play around with some data so I'll do an insert into users and we'll just insert

78
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.360
user name and let's just do two or three.

79
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:11.630
So we'll have to that cat and we could also have I don't know Charlie Brown and then I'll just put myself

80
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.520
in there just like that.

81
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.590
OK.

82
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:24.030
So what we can do now if I just do free resource this whole thing I'll get an error because it tells

83
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.270
me I can't create this database.

84
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:34.320
Instagram it already exists so I could either drop the database first and I'm going to do that for now.

85
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.520
You typically don't want to do that.

86
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.330
You know you don't want to drop database ever if you can avoid it.

87
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.420
But if there's no data in there yet or if the only data that will be in there is in the same file like

88
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.510
we're doing here just testing it out.

89
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.610
This makes it easy because I can just run this one command it will erase the database recreate it and

90
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.620
get all the new table set I need in there as well as the new data.

91
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.230
It's now it can do a select star from users.

92
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.730
And that Rigaud we've got created that and there automatically IDs automatic and our 3 user names.

93
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.580
OK.

94
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.970
Next up photos.
