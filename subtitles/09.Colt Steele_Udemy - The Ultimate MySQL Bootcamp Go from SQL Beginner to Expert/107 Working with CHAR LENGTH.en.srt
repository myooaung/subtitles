1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,590
The next function we'll take a look at is pretty quick as well.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,030
It's called Chaar length and what it does is it just tells you how many characters are in a given string

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,240
and that's pretty much all there is to it.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,750
So it looks like this char underscore length.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,770
And when we do it on hello world we could count the characters so 1 2 3 4 5 6 for the spaced 7 8 9 10

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,280
11 and we get 11.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,430
At least my slides says we get 11.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,300
Let's verify that.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,160
Can't trust those slides.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,490
Whoever made them.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,490
Me.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,830
So you can see we get 11.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,040
So if we changed it and just added a bunch of stuff we won't count it but it says that's 31 characters

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,810
long.

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:45,880
OK.

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:53,860
So we could do something like select and let's just print out the author last name this time.

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,690
So author Al name comma then will also side by side.

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,300
Print the chart the character the character length of the author's last name.

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:12,510
So it might say something like Carver and then next to that one two three four five six characters and

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,240
eggers also six characters and so on.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,410
So it's just going to be our author's last name followed by the number of characters and their names

22
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:27,460
so character char length author L name just like that.

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,630
And let's put in as here and we'll just call it we'll just call it length.

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,490
Just like that from books will enter and you can see we have this nice little table with our author's

25
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,760
last name and a corresponding length.

26
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,630
So we've got a lot of authors who are six characters long.

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,420
The last name six characters long.

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,870
And then you know we get Smith who's the shortest and so on.

29
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,040
We'll see later on how he could sort things and order them differently.

30
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,840
But for now we've got them all here.

31
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,610
All right.

32
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,060
So just like before if you feel like you have a grasp of this.

33
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,300
Feel free to move on.

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,920
I'm just going to show that we can also combine character length.

35
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:17,160
So what I would like to do is end up with a result that looks something like this.

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,790
Eggers is.

37
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,490
And then six characters long.

38
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,420
So I'd like that for every author that we have.

39
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:40,080
So if we break it down this is going to be author's last name concatenated with is concatenated with

40
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,170
the character length concatenated with characters long.

41
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,920
So it's going to be kind of a big one.

42
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,570
So let's let's try it out.

43
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:55,000
We're going to do a select concat and the first thing will concatenate is the author's last name.

44
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:02,160
So author L name and then we're going to concatenate that with space is space.

45
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,140
So that gives us this right here.

46
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:14,100
Then inside of that we're going to add char length of author L name.

47
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,610
You can see this is getting kind of long.

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:27,620
Comma is excuse me not is space characters long and are parentheses.

49
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,620
So that's kind of a lot here.

50
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,250
We're concatenating the first thing the author's name and then adding is and then adding the character

51
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,160
length and then adding characters long.

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,670
So we're building this sentence one piece at a time and then we also need to specify from books.

53
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,290
OK so let's take a look let's copy this.

54
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,380
Paste it in.

55
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,330
And there we go.

56
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,410
Here he is six characters long.

57
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,870
Carver is six characters.

58
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,380
Steinbeck is nine characters.

59
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,890
Foster Wallace is 14 characters so that's working.

60
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,240
By now you should know he can use as to make this a little prettier.

61
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,950
The only other thing that I'll take a moment to address is that this is kind of ugly.

62
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:16,490
It's something that I do often to form my sequel meaning my personal sequel not my as well the database

63
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,330
is used one of these formatters.

64
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,860
So there's a couple of them.

65
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:30,950
I like this one as well dash format dot com and I can paste in my query and just click Format and it

66
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,530
will just format it a little nicer for me.

67
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,600
And it depends on you know when things get really long and have long create tables that will clean things

68
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,520
up nicely for you.

69
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,660
So in this case this is a cleaned up version not that much of a difference to be honest.

70
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,220
But we can replace it anyways.

71
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,270
It's a little easier to read.

72
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,920
All right.

73
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,460
So that's all there is to character like.

74
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,460
That's all there is to char like.
