WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.870
OK so now what we're going to focus on is actually getting each team implemented with our web application.

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.590
So right now we're responding with these little things of text like this.

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.710
And before we go too much further just another note if you know him out great.

4
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.340
If you don't know Tim I am he'll just sort of have to hang on for the ride here.

5
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.800
I'm sure you've heard of it.

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.610
Well I guess hopefully I'm not assuming too much but most you've come across age Tim.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.180
Every web page to look at is built with age him.

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.910
Behind the scenes there is this marketplace guage that is dictating what elements go where and then

9
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.450
there CSSA which I'll get to later which makes it look pretty.

10
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.460
So what we're going to do is focus on writing aged him out so that we can have things like a form and

11
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.670
a button or we can have large text which is known as an H1 and we actually can do that right now and

12
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.230
it really hacky way.

13
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.360
So let's say rather than just.

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.960
Well let's do it for my joke.

15
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.310
But I could do is make this joke.

16
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.580
I'd talus sized part of it.

17
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.950
So I'd say What do you call a dog that does magic tricks and all type italicize the answer by putting

18
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.320
around it the E-M tag which is how you make things.

19
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.500
Italicize sense for emphasis.

20
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.120
So if I just put him out inside of this string and actually I can make this bold to say I'll do strong.

21
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.760
First thing you should notice if you've ever written to him.

22
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.220
This is a horrible way to write it instead of a single line like this.

23
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.630
It's just not a good experience so we're going to see how to get around that.

24
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.220
But I'm just showing you it's possible to have Tim Allen there.

25
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.930
So if I go to slash joke you can see I'm getting him out.

26
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.550
That's being rendered properly properly.

27
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.300
So if we wanted to get like a form on our home page which is what we want eventually by the end of this

28
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.900
video we could put all of h tim out to make a form instead of the string.

29
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.230
But it's going to be significantly longer than this.

30
00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.460
So we're not going to do that.

31
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.030
And there's a bunch of reasons why the main one is that it's a pain but it's also hard to change things

32
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.420
and it doesn't really allow us to style it.

33
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.020
SS When we get there.

34
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.780
So to jog your memory this is what we're working towards.

35
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.680
Here's what our app will look like.

36
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.490
We have a big background photo of a beautiful mountain in Argentina and we've got.

37
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.300
Join us.

38
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.370
Big text different font different color then we've got this other text.

39
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.880
To your email to join 500 or whatever the number of users is.

40
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.000
Others on our waitlist.

41
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.610
We are 100 percent not a cult.

42
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.250
And then we have a form with a single item in it or single fields a text field and then a button that

43
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.570
will submit the form.

44
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.060
But if we strip away all the pretty styling all the makeup or paint on top.

45
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.440
This is probably what it looks like.

46
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.000
This is you know the bare bones of it.

47
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.620
So this is what we'll get to by the end of this video.

48
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.940
So this will be our home page.

49
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.270
We are going to replace the content here.

50
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.230
The single string with this and to do it there's a couple of steps we have to take.

51
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.020
So here is the HTML itself if you don't want to type it this is the Timah we need.

52
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.200
We've had an 81 and says join us.

53
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.370
We got a paragraph.

54
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.070
We'll come back to this class.

55
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.310
You don't need that actually right now.

56
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.630
But then we've got enter email to join strong which is the bold around 518.

57
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.450
Then we've got a form which will also come back to.

58
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.640
So I'm just showing you this is all we need to actually make him I'll at the correct time out to make

59
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.420
that page.

60
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.890
Now how do we actually get this to be sent back.

61
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.930
What we want is you know in this route when you go to slash basically give the user to this.

62
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.980
We can't just make that a single string.

63
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.230
So what we do is use something called Ejay Yes.

64
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.580
And you have to bear with me here.

65
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.190
There was a couple of steps you have to go over and if you're new to web development this will be a

66
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.220
bit intimidating possibly.

67
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.960
It's probably a terrible thing for a teacher to say but just hang in there just know that we're going

68
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.400
somewhere and some of the steps along the way may be confusing but once we get there it won't be too

69
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.940
bad.

70
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.060
So E.J. this is what's known as a templating language stand for embedded javascript.

71
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.630
It's an alternative to writing just plain edged him out.

72
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.450
It allows us to add in variable values and code logic.

73
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.460
So this is where it's that slide I go back here.

74
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.870
This is H Tim L but this right here is not always 518.

75
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.350
So we couldn't do that in a normal HTML file we would want to be able to say okay this is Tim.

76
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.770
But right here in that strong tag in the bold area there's a variable but you can't do a variable in

77
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.570
regular h him up.

78
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.040
So that's what we're going to use Ejay ask for.

79
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.820
It stands for embedded javascript.

80
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.070
It didn't just HMO that allows you to embed javascript inside of it.

81
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.770
So we'll see how to do that in a moment.

82
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.570
But the first thing we have to do NPM install dash dash save.

83
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:58.710
Yes this is you know you should know by now hopefully that this is going to tell our app and our packages

84
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.280
are based on that we want yes installed and it should install it and save it record to packaged Jaison

85
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.790
which you can see now we have Ejay us there.

86
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.280
That's our first step.

87
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.960
Then we're going to do something else.

88
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.100
This is configuring our express application set view engine Khama.

89
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.730
Yes.

90
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:27.010
So apps that said is a method that allows us to set certain settings in our app view engine is the most

91
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.320
common one to change.

92
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.560
There are other templating engines there's things like Jayde which is a common one Hammil.

93
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.370
There's other languages.

94
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.640
So basically they are similar analogs T.J..

95
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.420
Yes.

96
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.420
OK so we'll go do it at the top is a traditional place to do it just like we're setting up you know

97
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.880
our connection appear and make sense to set and to configure application wide things up top.

98
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.590
So we'll do that and then the next step is OK where do we actually start writing these files and to

99
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.590
show you that I'm actually going to work backwards so the line that will be running in our route that

100
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.030
will actually render a file is redstart render some string.

101
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.770
In our case home and the process that will happen behind the scenes that express doesn't really show

102
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.560
you or tell you about it it will automatically look for a directory called views.

103
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.270
That's a standardized name.

104
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.290
So we're going to look for a directory called views you can change it if you want it to but we're not

105
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.140
going to.

106
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:35.170
And inside that directory it's going to look for a file called home dot whatever the view engine we

107
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.170
said which is Ejay us in our case so it's going to look for home.

108
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.950
Got you.

109
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.510
Yes.

110
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.190
In that View's directory.

111
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.680
So what that means is we need to create a directory and then we need to create a file we'll call it

112
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.030
home.

113
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.390
But you could call it landing page yes or route study.

114
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.910
Yes.

115
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.520
Whatever it is you just need to remember the name.

116
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.040
So let's do that now.

117
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.140
Will do.

118
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:04.000
Right click where you can do make directory of whom are comfortable with a terminal new folder views

119
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.300
inside if there will make a single file which we will call home.

120
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.960
Yes.

121
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.970
Again you could call it whatever as long as it ends and Ejay.

122
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:22.150
And you remember what you call it and we'll start with a single H-1 we'll just say this is HMO and save

123
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.690
it.

124
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.280
Then we go to her.

125
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.170
Yes.

126
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:31.960
And let's just work with our route rather than sending results and we have count.

127
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.790
We're no longer working if rest does send.

128
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:39.040
We have a restaurant render home test.

129
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.790
I'm going to be a broken record but it's looking for a home.

130
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:47.230
Yes because we added this new engine is Ejay Yes and it's looking in views by default.

131
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.890
So we need to make sure we have that file.

132
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.890
It's going to take the contents of this file and send it all back rather than a single line.

133
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.310
We can write our code now in a separate file.

134
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.190
So let's see if it works.

135
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.040
Start her app.

136
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.720
Try going to the home page.

137
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.530
There we go.

138
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.910
This is aged him up.

139
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.360
Our other pages still have.

140
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.820
Well this one is HDMI out but it's not coming from a separate file.

141
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:10.740
OK.

142
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.800
So then what we can do next is I'll just show you.

143
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.360
You could you know use rest out render home you can send the same file in all of these instead of just

144
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.270
send.

145
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.170
You can reuse files in different routes.

146
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.640
It doesn't matter.

147
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:34.870
So here we have the same thing for joke so for now if I get a joke as well I get the exact same thing.

148
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:35.410
OK.

149
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.520
So these don't care about what they're called.

150
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:42.330
The name of this has nothing to do with the route although it should if you're just following best practices

151
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.890
to get rid of that.

152
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:50.180
So now let's just copy the time that I provided here so that we don't have to type it all ourselves.

153
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.840
So I went home that E.J. is just going to paste this in.

154
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.860
We'll go over what some of this is.

155
00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:02.880
In particular the form we haven't talked about but let's just get this in here and see how it works.

156
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.080
So we have to save a file.

157
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.420
Now we get our form.

158
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.570
So we have join us which is our H-1.

159
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.420
So we started with and we have a paragraph again.

160
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.180
Don't worry about the class at all for now.

161
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.870
Can actually just get rid of that if you want.

162
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.160
Just focus on keeping it simple.

163
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.680
Then we've got end to your e-mail to join in said the paragraph.

164
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.440
All of this is in the paragraph.

165
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.800
There we go.

166
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.540
518 is hard coded for now.

167
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.430
We're about to replace that.

168
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.970
We are 100 percent not a cult.

169
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.750
And then we've got this form which we're just going to ignore for now.

170
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:41.230
Except know that there's a text input in a button which we get all looks good.

171
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:47.400
And in fact we can clear out that form and just leave it like this to start OK.

172
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:53.490
So now what we want to do is figure out how we get our data in here because right now this is just plain

173
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.380
to him.

174
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.910
There's no use for this Ejay a stuff that I was talking about but the whole point is that we want this

175
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:08.430
to be five 19:5 20 499 10000 whatever the result of this is whatever count is.

176
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.270
But how do we get count this variable over here.

177
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:21.030
What we do is after resod out render we can pass a comma and pass a javascript object and I'm allowed

178
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.150
to pass data through.

179
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.850
So what we want to send is count.

180
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.710
But first I have to give it a name.

181
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.590
So typically you'll see something like this.

182
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:36.850
Count count rather than that all do data is counted.

183
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.790
I'm going to change it later but just to show you they're distinct.

184
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:47.790
So what this does now is it says OK take count whatever it is which last time we counted as 501.

185
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:55.910
Send that to this template and give it the name of data basically put it in an object under the key

186
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.690
of data.

187
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:03.230
So inside if here if I refer to data it will be referring to whatever count was.

188
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.100
The problem is I can't just say data.

189
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.690
I just do that and refresh we just get into your e-mail to join data others on our list.

190
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.200
So I need a way of saying hey this is not.

191
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.020
This is not each tim Elvis this is special.

192
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.050
This is code and the way we do it.

193
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.240
It's weird if you've never seen it before.

194
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.250
It looks like this.

195
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.220
So we have brackets just like we would.

196
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.570
Tim Alba angle brackets.

197
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.400
But then percent equals and then percent on the closing side.

198
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:38.700
And this is basically a signifier that says this is not age timeo whatever's in here is going to return

199
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.270
a value that we want to put in the HMO.

200
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:46.650
So if data is equal to 500 it will be replaced with 500 If it's equal to 12.

201
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:51.840
It will be replaced with 12 kind of a lot to take in as I was saying there is a lot of moving pieces

202
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.530
here.

203
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.670
Unfortunately we don't have well we don't really have time I guess we could we could have time.

204
00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.630
But the Course isn't on.

205
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:00.040
E.J..

206
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.370
Yes.

207
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:02.240
It's not on web development.

208
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.030
This is just a vehicle to showing you how to make something.

209
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.920
OK.

210
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:11.850
So data will be count whatever's coming through there.

211
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.870
Let's try it and we've got five on one.

212
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.480
And of course we could insert one more user very quickly.

213
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.390
Let's do Austin.

214
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:27.190
Two three four refresh refresher page now it's 502.

215
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.570
So we've accomplished our goal.

216
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.360
If you feel comfortable with how it's working.

217
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:31.910
Go ahead.

218
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.820
Stop move on to the next video.

219
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.420
If you have a couple of questions so go through the process again.

220
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.770
I'm not going to recreate it but I'm going to step through what's happening.

221
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:46.330
So we'll start with this app that get slash that's activating the router when I go to this you are well

222
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:53.900
we still have our slash joke for instance we we're talking about the route route when I hit that route.

223
00:12:54.230 --> 00:13:01.280
First thing that happens is this code runs which the end result is it figures out how many users are

224
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.060
in our database.

225
00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.070
It's running this code in our database.

226
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:12.320
Select count start as count from users that's coming back stored in results inside of results.

227
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.940
We're finding it the reason it's stored under count is because of this as.

228
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:22.300
So if I call this counter then this needs to be done counter.

229
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.110
OK.

230
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.610
So then we're storing that in a variable called count.

231
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:32.500
So this has something like 501 in it.

232
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:40.100
Then what we're doing can get rid of this line now is we are rendering the home that Ejay s file which

233
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.570
is automatically looked for it in the directory which is right here.

234
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:50.420
We have a bunch of H-2 melon here some of which we haven't talked about yet but then we have this one

235
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.550
variable.

236
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.950
But this very weird syntax we haven't seen before.

237
00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.730
This is our way of saying hey this is not h tim Jim.

238
00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:05.360
This is a special value we can put javascript in here and just to show you a couple other things I'll

239
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.570
do another one.

240
00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.610
And then our funky bracket thing again.

241
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.840
And I can actually just do simple math in here.

242
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.530
It's something like 4 times 98.

243
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:21.180
This will run as JavaScript whatever the result is I'm terrible at mental math will be printed there.

244
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:33.230
So if we refresh our page we get 392 and we could also pass in another piece of data like favorite color

245
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.800
and I'll just say it is purple which is true color highly underrated.

246
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.230
Pass that in over here.

247
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.960
I can refer to.

248
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.850
Favorite color.

249
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.800
Why we would do this.

250
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.170
Well that's another question.

251
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.710
But I'm just showing you that way.

252
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:54.260
Here we go.

253
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.540
Favorite underscore color.

254
00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.150
We have access to whatever we pass in here.

255
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.590
So favorite color is the string purple.

256
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.510
I will need to restart the server.

257
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:12.060
If we are changing our Actually yes file now we get purple it's coming through.

258
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:18.060
So the only difference is that data right here is not something we're coding in our cells are not hard

259
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:26.820
coding and it's coming from the database from all this work running the query and then basically extracting

260
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:32.220
the data out saving into the count variable and the last thing I'll do is change to be count because

261
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.340
data is just a bad to bad name for a variable.

262
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.550
Everything is data.

263
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:41.220
But the reason I call the data again was just to kind of show you that there's a difference.

264
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.380
It can be confusing at first if you see count count which one is which.

265
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.840
This is the value we're passing and this is the label for it.

266
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.750
This is the key.

267
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.720
OK.

268
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.090
So just make sure it's still working.

269
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.040
Refresh your email to join 502 others on our waitlist.

270
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.640
We are 100 percent not a cult.

271
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:01.640
Perfect.

272
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:02.010
We're done.
