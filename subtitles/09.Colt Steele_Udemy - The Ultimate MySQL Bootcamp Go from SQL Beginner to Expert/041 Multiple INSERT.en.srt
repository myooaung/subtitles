1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,210
So another thing to know about the insert command is that you can use it to bulk insert data so we can

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,720
insert 10 different users at once or we can eventually once we get to it we can update 10 different

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,290
users at once or delete 10 or whatever it is.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,570
But for insert the way that it works is that rather than just giving one set of values like Charlie

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,100
who is 10.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:29,330
We just use a comma separated list so we tack on a comma and then we add another one Saidy who's three

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:35,790
and then comma lazy bear who is one note about the column placement does not matter.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,820
You'll see it.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,010
I think what's more logical is actually to put it here at the end of the line.

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,550
But often what you see is here I think it makes it easier for you to just visually break things up and

11
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,800
to see hey here's a new line and here's your line but really just a matter of preference.

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,230
So don't pay too much attention to that.

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,280
Don't pay any attention to that actually.

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,400
What's important is that we have a list and we can multiple insert all at once.

15
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,630
So let's try it.

16
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:10,940
So we have our catch table with blue and Draco we will do an insert into cats and we'll do name followed

17
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:19,360
by age now we have values and our first pair are first set of values will be.

18
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,490
Oh boy this is the hardest part of teaching this stuff coming up with the fake data.

19
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,140
Let's say peanut

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,900
and peanut to and comma could they come.

21
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,860
There doesn't matter.

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,260
Let's say the next one will be called butter.

23
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,640
Who is four.

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,820
Yes I am looking at a thing of peanut butter in my kitchen right now.

25
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,870
So that's where that comes from.

26
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,960
And lastly let's do.

27
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,560
Sure.

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,230
Jelly.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,740
Who is it.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,670
Just like that.

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,680
We need our semi-colon to end it.

32
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,170
Now we get something slightly new.

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,990
Cleary OK.

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,770
Three rows affected.

35
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,550
Awesome.

36
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:18,540
So to check our work we can just to select a star from cats again and I should be consistent.

37
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,170
It doesn't matter.

38
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,680
But I'll capitalize.

39
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:30,560
From now we have blue Draco which were there before peanut butter and jelly that turned out nicely and

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,760
we inserted them all with one command.

41
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,450
So later on in the course when we start working with some more complicated data what I'll actually do

42
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:45,680
is give you a file that has an insert statement that will insert let's say 20 different items into a

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,500
database 20 rows and you'll be able to run that one line and get kind of starter data that you can use.

44
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,640
It will be an easy way to populate your database with data without having to do it manually 20 times.

45
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,190
OK.

46
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,330
So that's all there is to multiple answers.
