1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,500
All right.

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,430
So now we're talking about less than we just talked about greater than and greater than or equal to.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,260
So this one should be much shorter.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,810
In fact the total time that it will take will be less than the previous video.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,460
So it works the same way although it does the opposite.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,140
If you're familiar again just the less than bracket the angle bracket I think it's what they're called.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,120
Just remember that.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,750
So shift.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,670
And then on most keyboards is a comma so we can do things like this.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,100
So rather than selecting all books released after 2000 we just switch it to the less than sign in our

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,930
select star from books wherever released here is anything below the number 2000.

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:50,180
So if we try that select title and released year from books we do all of them.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,580
And let's do our order by again released here just to make it easier to see where we have missing gaps.

14
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,330
OK.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:04,560
So we want all of these to disappear or excuse me on all these disappear and only want to select these

16
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,860
five.

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:19,400
All we need to do is add in our where released here is less than 2000 And there we go.

18
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,560
OK.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,550
So that's pretty much all say about it for now.

20
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,300
Along with that of course we have less than or equal to which works the same way that greater than.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,380
Well it doesn't work the same way it works in the same way that greater than or equal to does.

22
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,220
So if I wanted to include the year 2000 for whatever reason I just need that equal sign after the less

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,580
than sign and now we get the same five books plus the one that was written in 2000.

24
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,710
Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,810
That's pretty much it.

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,630
I will throw up a few exercises here if you want to try evaluating them and then moving on to some more

27
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,450
interesting and complex operators.

28
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,640
All right so I'm back here.

29
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,380
I typed up a couple of quick exercises.

30
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,790
Go ahead try these out.

31
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,110
I'll throw up that same graphic again and I'll be back in one second.

32
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,340
OK I'm back here.

33
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,020
So let's go through these quickly.

34
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,190
The first one is three less than negative 10.

35
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,260
Well I don't think so but let's verify.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,020
You can see zero meaning false.

37
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,970
It's not is negative 10 less than negative 9.

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,760
Yes it is.

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,350
It's lower than negative 9 is 42 less than or equal to 42.

40
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,360
Ok need to add a space there.

41
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,360
And as you would expect we get yes we get one true because 42 is equal to 42.

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,030
Now on to the odd string ones it's the letter H.

43
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,030
Lowercase less than the letter P also lower case.

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,140
And if you remember to the last video of how this works H comes before p.

45
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,580
And they both lower.

46
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,100
So yes this should be true and it is OK.

47
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,320
So this final one is UPPER CASE Q less than or equal to lowercase q.

48
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:16,050
Well this should be reviewed from the last video because I remember that case doesn't matter.

49
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,780
So we see that yes indeed it is true.

50
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:27,410
Prickish Q is less than or equal to lowercase Q And if we get rid of the equal to this is basically

51
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,990
a duplicate of what we just said in the last video.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,320
But I just want to hit this home that it is not lower it's not greater than they are equivalent.

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,880
Well that's a minus sign.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,630
There you go.

55
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,310
They are equivalent.

56
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,340
As you can see we get true or 1.

57
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,260
OK.

58
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,960
Next up.

59
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,510
Moving on to much more exciting much bigger and important logical operators.
