1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,350
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:07,210
So we're moving on to capturing the relationships of friendships between users.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,260
So we're talking about followers or follow NGs or however we want to term this I'm just refer to it

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,220
as follows.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,930
But it's not really a great term either.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,890
But basically how do we capture the data.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,030
When I follow another user and they may or may not follow him back.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,840
It doesn't matter.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm still able to follow them and that's how many captures is one way relationship and the easiest way

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,620
to do it is with a single table that will call followers and all that it is is to use your ideas.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:47,070
So both of these are primary excuse me both of them are foreign keys referring to a user id a different

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,630
user ID that's important.

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,630
We can't have a user follow him or herself.

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,870
So there are different ideas and I called them follow her ID and follow the ID.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,570
You could do you know User 1 ID and user to ID.

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:07,950
But the idea here is that you can tell who is following who the follower is the person following that

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,010
follow we.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,850
Its a nightmare to try and discuss here.

19
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,750
So let me give you an example.

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,090
Here's our table of users.

21
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:21,950
So we have three users Tommy blue cat and cold steel and they have an idea of 1 2 and 3 respectively.

22
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,800
OK so here's our follows table.

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,700
And the first thing that say that Colt me decides to follow blue.

24
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,900
So that means you know follower ID is three follow were being me the follower.

25
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,560
Who am I following to do the follow me.

26
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:47,330
But she doesn't have to follow me back and she doesn't follow me back at least not yet.

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,340
If you look next I'm following user id of one which is Tommy.

28
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,610
Speaking of blue

29
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,090
OK let's see where was I.

30
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,140
So why with user id three follow Tommy.

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,440
OK.

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,920
And then.

33
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:13,640
Now Lou your idea is to finally follows me back she decides I'm a good owner and she wants to follow

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,870
me on instagram.

35
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,050
But the key thing here is that it's a one way relationship.

36
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,830
You know here we have I'm following Tommy.

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,140
But Tommy does not follow me and this is all we need the structure to encode that information.

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,360
A couple of points we should make that these are both foreign keys created that it's just good to know

39
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,300
if you want to keep track of you know when people are being followed.

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,180
Again not a central but something that Instagram definitely is tracking.

41
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,420
You know friendship date or something.

42
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,330
And then also we don't want to have duplicated followers.

43
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,120
So I don't want to be able to follow blue again.

44
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,170
So we need to enforce that.

45
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,020
These are unique the combination of these two in an order.

46
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:02,120
So as you can see you know three and two is here and we can have two and three but we can't have another

47
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,340
three and two.

48
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:03,850
OK.

49
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,930
So let's get to it.

50
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:11,010
We've got follow Id follow the ID and created it and we won't be needing a primary key ID.

51
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:17,000
Right now Id integer that is a primary key because we won't be referencing these friendships or followers

52
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,150
anyway so create table follows.

53
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,940
If you have a better name Feel free to use that.

54
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:32,630
And the first thing we have is our follower ID and our follow e id and then create it.

55
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,200
OK.

56
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,140
Gosh.

57
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,000
OK.

58
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,350
So let's start with creating that time stamp default now.

59
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,280
Perfect.

60
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,120
Then we've got follower ID and follow we are both integers.

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,510
We don't want them to be all.

62
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,170
Copy that on over our commas there.

63
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:06,170
And now we also need to officially declare these as foreign keys without the foreign key follower ID

64
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:17,110
reference's user user's ID and we can just duplicate that line and just change follow the ID.

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,120
It also references user ID and then the last thing I mentioned is we want to enforce that you can only

66
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,370
have one of a given relationship.

67
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:32,450
So if user id one is following user id too that can not but that can only be in the database once but

68
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,990
user ID to can follow the user id one anyway.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,910
So to do that its just a matter of primary key in the order that we actually put them in here won't

70
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,920
really matter.

71
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,850
I mean it makes a difference to my ass.

72
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,610
Q Well but for us it won't matter.

73
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,450
Follow.

74
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,360
AG Okay so that creates the table for us.

75
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,150
Let's just check that everything works looks good.

76
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,480
Let's do a describe follows good.

77
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,220
All right.

78
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,760
So just like the last couple of videos were done if you want to stick around and I'll play around recent

79
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,440
data and show you that this primary key constraint is working.

80
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,520
Okay.

81
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:22,800
So if you're still here let's try doing an insert into follows and we'll have our follow were Id first

82
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,850
and then our follow we ID should start with just something jibberish.

83
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,830
You're saying it enough times.

84
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,760
So let's say that we started off we've got these three users right.

85
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,930
So blue follows Charlie Brown that's going to be one comment too.

86
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,350
And we'll also have blue follow me.

87
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,250
That's one comment three.

88
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,390
And then let's say I also follow Balue back.

89
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,860
So that is three come in one.

90
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:59,120
And then let's say that we have Charlie Brown follows blue.

91
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,530
I would say Charlie Brown follows me.

92
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,570
So that's to come three.

93
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,460
OK.

94
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,020
Let's try inserting them.

95
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,940
Looks like it works.

96
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,530
You can do you know.

97
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,450
So like start from users excuse me from follows.

98
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,760
Great follow ready follow the idea and create it out.

99
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:25,100
And then the true test is if I try and reinsert a relationship like insert into follows.

100
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:32,150
Getting sick of this follower Id follow we stuff are almost.

101
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,890
So let's say try and insert this friendship one comment two.

102
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,950
So that is blue following.

103
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,250
Let's do one of three blue following me she loves me so much she wants to follow me again.

104
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,840
If we try and do that it's a duplicate entry.

105
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,900
But as we saw you can see here we already have three Kamo one.

106
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,810
So if I did do you know if I read you one common to this time which we also already have it's blue following

107
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,330
Charlie Brown.

108
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,980
It's a duplicate entry.

109
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,300
But if I switch the order and do two come and one that's permitted because we don't have that in here

110
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:07,820
yet.

111
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,740
But now of course it's duplicate entry.

112
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,010
So the order does matter right.

113
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,240
Who's following who.

114
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,050
OK.

115
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,180
So that makes sense.

116
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,000
We're moving on now to our final piece which is tag's hashtags.
