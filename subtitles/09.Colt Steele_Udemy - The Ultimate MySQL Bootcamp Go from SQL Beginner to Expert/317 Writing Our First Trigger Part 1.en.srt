1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,750
OK.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,620
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,590
In this video we're going to create our very first trigger.

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,260
And as a heads up there's a lot of new code a lot of syntax the way that this is going to work is that

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,000
we're going to run the code first and then we'll ask questions later which is maybe not always the best

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,480
approach.

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,650
But I think here it will help just illustrate how things work.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,120
Kind of the overall goal because you can get lost in the woods.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,080
Is that the expression.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,800
Whatever.

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,650
You'll get lost potentially if you focus on these new things like this here this here.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,780
All of this stuff here that we've never seen before and I don't want you to get hung up on that but

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,570
we will address it in future videos the next three videos after this in fact.

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,000
So in this one we're just going to get this running and see that it works and what it is.

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:53,850
It is very simple validation that basically we have a users table with any data let's say name and age

16
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:00,420
user name and age and all that we want to do is prevent new users from being created if their age is

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,800
less than 18.

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,260
So it's pretty straightforward.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,570
The idea behind it.

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,430
Like I said in the previous video it typically would be better to actually do this on the client side

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,160
of your application rather than waiting for the insert statement to get to or rather than initiating

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,810
a statement sending some code to your database having the database try and insert it and then realizing

23
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,830
hey this is age is less than 18 then sending an error back to the client side that can take time.

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,770
It's much better to just say on the client side let's say of a web app have a validation on the form

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,470
that is going to check.

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,830
Is age less than 18.

27
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,690
On this form.

28
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,810
Well then don't let the user submit the button.

29
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,720
Or don't let them click the button or display an error message or something like that rather than bothering

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,280
with all this database stuff.

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,770
But it's important to know that you can do this.

32
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,920
I'm going to show it to you and it's a nice simple example.

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,900
So a couple of things.

34
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,320
I'm in a new folder here just called triggers.

35
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,210
I'm going to make a new database as well.

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,230
And I guess this is a good time as good a time as any to let you know that I have seriously injured

37
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,260
my wrist on one hand so I'm typing one handed.

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,060
I'll try and edit around it.

39
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,840
Hopefully it's not too noticeable.

40
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:18,770
So we've got create database and I'm just going to call this one trigger demo.

41
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,040
Oh man.

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,040
OK here you go.

43
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,540
Then we're going to use that.

44
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,600
All right.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Now I'm going to make a new file.

46
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,550
While I'm here.

47
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,930
And I'll just call this users as well.

48
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,920
And we're going to make a simple table create table very very simple users.

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:53,710
And like I said it's only going to have let's go with user name which will be a Vardar and then we'll

50
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,690
also have age which is an event and that's it.

51
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,050
OK.

52
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,330
So we can go ahead and run that just to validate that or to check that it works.

53
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,520
So where do source users start as well.

54
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,940
I read this in the same directory.

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,590
OK.

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,300
We should be able to show tables and I should be able to insert a user lets you insert into users and

57
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:26,560
will the user name comment age should all be boring review at this point.

58
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,940
We'll go with Bobby

59
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,730
and ages let's go twenty two or three.

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,240
OK.

61
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,350
There we go.

62
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,060
And as always select start from users just verifying that everything works.

63
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,420
All right.

64
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,830
Pretty boring stuff.

65
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:51,680
Now we're going to go ahead and create this trigger and what this trigger it is going to do is right

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,190
before that piece of data is inserted inserted into use right before a new row is created.

67
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,470
We're going to say Hang on hang on.

68
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,880
There's a trigger that's just been triggered and it's going to check if this new user row if the age

69
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,040
is less than 18 and if it is then we're going to throw an error.

70
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,790
We're not going to let it happen otherwise proceed normally and insert the user.

71
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,200
So the syntax I've already typed it up here you can just copy this if you'd like.

72
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,390
It's going to be easier.

73
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,120
Well like I said we'll go over the Internet of it as we go through the section but to start with this

74
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,420
copy it and what I'll do is make a new file.

75
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,730
You don't have to you could just add it down here and just rerun this whole file but then you would

76
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,500
you know you've already created the users table and so you'd have to recreate it and drop it and then

77
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,330
recreate it.

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,050
Anyway it doesn't really matter.

79
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,450
I'm going to make a separate file.

80
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,160
I think it's good to keep your triggers separate.

81
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,640
So I'm just going to call this users trigger that as well.

82
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,790
OK.

83
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,530
And then I'm just going to paste it in and hit safe and then I'm just going to source this file just

84
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,750
like any other sequel file that we've run.

85
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,270
It's just a little different than what we've done before.

86
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,760
This is sort of like meta sequel where we're not actually interacting with the database immediately

87
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,920
we're not creating tables or not inserting things.

88
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,200
We're creating restrictions or triggers on another table.

89
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,520
OK so I'm going to source it.

90
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,300
I call that users trigger as well.

91
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:28,070
Well actually before that let me just verify that you can create a user who is less than 18.

92
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:35,030
So let's say Sally is 16 and that works just fine.

93
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,110
They're both in that.

94
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,650
But now when we source our users underscored trigger us.

95
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:49,280
Q So we get this silly error which is my fault and rather than any editing around this I'm actually

96
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,970
going to leave it.

97
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,760
It's somewhat educational.

98
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,860
I have a table called people that it's expecting before answered on people while there is no people

99
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,930
table in this database.

100
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,710
It is a users table.

101
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:09,110
So let's recreate that.

102
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,150
OK so now I do that and we get this message that like we get every other time something works.

103
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,330
Query OK.

104
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,890
Now let's see what happens.

105
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:30,270
So let's start off of something we know works like let's do Sue who is 54.

106
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,900
That should work.

107
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,000
And it does work.

108
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,680
But now let's do.

109
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,240
Man this is the hardest part.

110
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,800
Let's go with Yang who is 14.

111
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,590
Less than 18.

112
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,980
And we get our message error.

113
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,550
We'll talk about this 16 44 forty five thousand.

114
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,790
All that fun stuff must be an adult and it's not just an error.

115
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,160
If we actually go select all our users.

116
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,410
Yang doesn't get inserted so it's not just like an air that gets thrown out just as a fly.

117
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,940
But it also prevents things from actually being inserted.

118
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,300
So that's the basics.

119
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,550
We've got it working in the next video.

120
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,750
I'm going to break down some of the new pieces of code in particular what the heck this is here and

121
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,220
here and here.

122
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,760
Also what this new thing is new age.

123
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,360
And most importantly what is signal's sequel state 45000 message text all this stuff.
