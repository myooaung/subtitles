1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,770
All right.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,170
So the first one is to change Jackson's name to Jack.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,280
So we'll practice what I just talked about running select before you do the update.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:21,390
So let's just try selecting star from cats where name equals Jackson.

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,580
OK so we get Jackson but we want to update his name to be Jack.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,360
So now we do our update cats.

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,430
Set name equal to Jack.

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,220
That's what we want to change it to.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,510
And where do we want to change it.

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,520
We're going to change it where name is currently Jackson.

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,520
Now I didn't specify that you had to use wear name ECOs Jackson.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,090
You could also say where everywhere everywhere ID is 7 or where breed is Fink's because we only have

13
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,410
one Spinx right now.

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,530
So any of those are valid.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,390
Now if we do or select again we get nothing because there is no cat named Jackson.

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:10,330
If we change it to Jack we get the same cat whose name is now Jack.

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,160
Next up change Ringo's breed to British short hair.

18
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,260
So let's do the same thing where we just do a select.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,150
Her name is Ringo.

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:28,340
You can see that currently breed is short hair but we want to get more specific British short hair so

21
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,800
to do that we do an update.

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:45,700
Cats set breed equal to British short hair like that where a name equals Ringo.

23
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:53,820
And again you can also do cat ID one or where breed is shorthair you could identify this cat however

24
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,790
you like but let's make sure it worked.

25
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:04,520
So now if I select where name is Ringo we see Breede is now British short hair.

26
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,880
So the last one update both Maine Coons so breed equal Maine Coon and make their ages 12.

27
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,920
So let's just take a look at our current set up in our database can see we have these two main COONTS

28
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,730
Cindy undoubled door.

29
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,360
Cindy is 10 Dumbledores 11 for whatever reason.

30
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,420
We want both of them to be 12.

31
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,110
So let's just select both of them first.

32
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:39,260
Select star from cats where greed equals man you're just like that.

33
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,660
Perfect.

34
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:47,290
So we are we are targeting them correctly so we can copy that and then we'll do our update.

35
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:59,460
Cats set age equal to 12 we don't need quotes where I'm just at and it updates.

36
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,110
Both of them.

37
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,590
So that's really what I was testing here is that you understood that where is not always just going

38
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,010
to return one result.

39
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,900
Whatever is returned will always be updated.

40
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:17,020
Which is also important to note that if you leave that wear off and I just said Update cat set age 12

41
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,320
that would update every cat which we don't want to do which is why it's always important to select things

42
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,600
first and make sure you know what you're targeting.

43
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,750
Sometimes you might there could be reason to be wanting to update everything in a table like if you

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:37,540
are making a big change or you are migrating something or you realize that you made a big error early

45
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,610
on in your application and you have every piece of data is wrong somehow.

46
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,760
Maybe but most of the time you're being very specific in the changes you're making.

47
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,980
So just to double check we select again.

48
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,220
You can see Cindy and double door and now both 12.

49
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,300
That's all you needed to do.

50
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,960
Perfect.

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,820
Next up we're diving into delete.
