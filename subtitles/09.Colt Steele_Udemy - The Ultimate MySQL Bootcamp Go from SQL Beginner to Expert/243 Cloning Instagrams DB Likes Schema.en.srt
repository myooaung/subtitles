1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,600
All right.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,330
Moving on to like this.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:08,640
So we've seen now users photos and comments and likes are a little bit similar.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:16,470
They are like the comments schema because when we think about how likes work on Instagram at least you

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,130
like something you like that particular photo.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,230
Let's say it's corresponding to that photo.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,120
We need to have an association there.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:31,980
But then there's also the association between me the person liking it and the like itself.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,940
And that might not matter if we allowed for infinite likes you know anybody could like something as

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,340
many times as they wanted to say it was a button that clicked and it just kept going every time I clicked

11
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:43,760
it.

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,670
We could get away with not storing user information with a like.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,850
But even then it might be nice to see how many times somebody had like something or how many likes you

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,500
know in general.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,240
How often do I click the Like button compared to somebody else.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,020
It might be it might help us figure out who's a bot like on Instagram that's a big problem actually

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:11,430
are these bots that people write they go and just like photos like things all the time create comments

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,840
that are just cookie cutter.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,150
It's kind of frustrating actually if you're a photographer because you know you'll post something and

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,480
then you get excited that you have you know 100 people who liked it and it turns out a lot of them are

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,910
bought.

22
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,760
If you actually go try and look at them they don't have any photos post really.

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,750
They always comment the same thing.

24
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:38,190
Long story short in this giant dataset here I actually coded in some bots that will be working with

25
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,130
basically people who aren't in search who aren't creating much stuff they're not posting many photos

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,470
but they are liking a lot of things and commenting on the same thing all the time.

27
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,210
Anyway back to likes.

28
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:59,310
It's going to look like this will have a user ID and a photo ID and a created app so our user ID is

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:07,720
going to refer to a user's ID and a photo ID refer to a photo ID and there is really nothing else.

30
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,330
Is no information being stored there.

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,030
You know aside from the date or the time it was created when the like happened.

32
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,030
But what else is there in store.

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,430
You know maybe Instagram is doing stuff like whether it was liked from the web version versus the iOS

34
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,120
version.

35
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,810
Maybe they're storing you know other information here possibly but for us this is the basics.

36
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,530
We just need a user ID and a photo ID and every time no photo is liked by a different user.

37
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,300
We get a new like just like this with the user id and photo ID.

38
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,030
So we'll start by coding this.

39
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,610
You might have noticed that I didn't add an ID to the likes.

40
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,060
Explain why in just a second.

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,480
But let's start by creating our table.

42
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,710
So we have create table like this.

43
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,960
And don't forget the semi-colon.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:05,470
We've got a user ID and a photo ID and are created at headstart was created at we often neglect it.

45
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,730
Time stamp the default now.

46
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:09,600
OK.

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,640
Nice and easy.

48
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,790
User ID is just an integer.

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,850
I don't want it to be empty.

50
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,040
Same thing for photo ID.

51
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:32,830
But then we need to set up our foreign key constraints for key user id references user's ID comma and

52
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,430
other foreign key.

53
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,580
This time photo ID references photos Id.

54
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,400
OK so now let's address why we don't have an ID here.

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,370
And the main reason is that we don't need an ID.

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,800
We're not going to be referring to like anywhere else.

57
00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:00,570
If we were it would be good to add an ID there maybe but we're not having any table store information

58
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,350
about likes.

59
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:07,590
The other thing you might be wondering about is how do we ensure that you know there's only one like

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,550
per user.

61
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,290
Is there a way to do that in the database.

62
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:18,030
Because right now if I did this I could just insert let's say my user ID is one and a photo ID is one

63
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,430
I could insert a like with the user id one photo ID one and then insert it again and again and again.

64
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,200
And there's nothing stopping that.

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,480
So what we really want to say is we want a unique combination of the two.

66
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,880
There can only be one instance of every combination and there's actually a way of saying that we haven't

67
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:45,630
seen it but you can do this primary key and then we can just say use your ID comma photo ID.

68
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:52,350
So what this will do is basically not allow you to insert to you know like that are exactly the same

69
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:58,800
the same user ID and the same photo ID and I'll demonstrate that if you feel confident if you trust

70
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
me there you can skip move on.

71
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,260
We're done with the ski mask here.

72
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,240
Let's just make sure that it runs.

73
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,940
I don't have any syntax errors of course.

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,050
OK.

75
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,880
It does.

76
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,640
But if you'd like to see me try it out like the last couple of videos.

77
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,730
I'll do that now.

78
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:21,280
So if you're still with me I'm going to do is take these photos and these users I'm going to have some

79
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,100
of them like them.

80
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,320
So let's take a blue user id one and that first photo she created it.

81
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,270
That doesn't matter.

82
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,180
You can like your own photo on Instagram.

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,000
So will insert into likes

84
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,610
and we have user id come a photo ID.

85
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:51,500
So the first one will be one coming one so I'm inserting blue is liking this photo.

86
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,900
And then let's have Charlie Brown also like it.

87
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,260
So that would be a weps to come in one.

88
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,710
And then we've got the next photo here which has a photo idea of two not this.

89
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,820
Remember this is the user who created it.

90
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,270
But this has an idea of two.

91
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,890
So let's say blue also likes that one.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,810
So blue idea if one likes photo ID two and she likes photo ID of three.

93
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:27,200
And then what say I have used already three I like photo with idea of three.

94
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,480
OK.

95
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,400
So let's start there.

96
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,100
We run it.

97
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,360
It works.

98
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,220
There shouldn't be any problems at this point.

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:44,100
But now if I try and do this insert into likes user id come a photo ID values.

100
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,800
And I do one comma one.

101
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,170
Well that's not that.

102
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,060
There you go one come one which already is in there blue.

103
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,960
User ID one.

104
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,250
And then this photo.

105
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:03,040
And while Bob 5:53 with idea of one we already have that like that if I try it you can see it duplicate

106
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,000
entry 1 dash 1 for key primary.

107
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,980
So the way it does it is basically combined to to keep track of the combination like that the dash between

108
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,360
it.

109
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,920
So that's pretty much it.

110
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,560
I will copy what we just did an ad a note here.

111
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:29,720
If you're looking at these notes later just saying it won't work because of primary key constraint and

112
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,750
are commented out as well.

113
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,500
We don't want to run that every time.

114
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,190
Great.

115
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,710
And next up we're moving on to a fun one which is relationships following followers all this stuff.
