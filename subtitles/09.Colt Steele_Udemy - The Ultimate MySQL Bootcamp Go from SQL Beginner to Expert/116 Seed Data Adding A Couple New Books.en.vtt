00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.920
All right.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.850
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.800
So in the last couple of sections we focused on select and we're going to continue that trend in this

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.380
section.

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.440
We're going to talk about some of the other tools that we'll be able to use to get more specific when

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.510
we're selecting things.

7
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.130
So we'll be able to do things like sort our results that we get back in alphabetical order or reverse

8
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.950
alphabetical order or limit the number that we get or only get unique results back and a bunch of other

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.710
things that we'll be able to combine and use just as other tools in our arsenal or or weapons rather

10
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.100
in our arsenal.

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.720
So before we do that though I want to start by just adding a little bit more data to the books that

12
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.270
we're currently working with.

13
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.530
Basically I want to have a bit more variety.

14
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.570
So I'd like to insert three new books and they look like this.

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.220
So we have one here 10 percent happier by Dan Harris release in 2014.

16
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.650
We have 29 in stock and it's 256 pages long.

17
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.500
You'll see why we have said why we're inserting not just a couple of videos but there is a reason we're

18
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.190
going to come back to it and then we have a fake book.

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.310
So just imagine that we're testing our system or something and we want to make sure it works or we have

20
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.440
fake underscore book and then that's written by Frida Harris in 2001.

21
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.060
287 copies in stock 428 pages.

22
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.150
And then this is actually one so I haven't read either of these but this is one I just finished.

23
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.230
And that's one of the reasons I added it and there's another one though.

24
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.120
It's really good.

25
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.370
By the way if you're looking for a book called Lincoln in the bardo by George Saunders released just

26
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.350
this year and we have a thousand copies in stock because it's brand new.

27
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.030
So we haven't sold any or we haven't sold many yet.

28
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.170
Or maybe we're anticipating a big flood of sales.

29
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.370
And it's 367 pages.

30
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.770
So either type it up or copy and pasted in the code is available along with this video and we're going

31
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.830
to just copy and run over here make sure that we're doing let's make sure we're working with the correct

32
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.130
database.

33
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.540
All right.

34
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.810
And bookshop.

35
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.050
And we'll just paste that in in certain books.

36
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.910
Blah blah blah blah blah.

37
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.820
We don't need to go over everything.

38
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.010
All right.

39
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.780
So we get three rows affected.

40
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.270
Let's do a select title from books.

41
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.780
Just make sure that we have those in there.

42
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.160
Here we go.

43
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.070
We had to consider the lobster in the last section.

44
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.770
Now we have 10 percent happier Facebook and LinkedIn in the Barta.

45
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.440
All right.

46
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.940
So that's all I want to do here.

47
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.850
I highly recommend that you go and do this if you want to follow along.

48
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.520
It will make the exercises much easier.

49
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.200
It will make them possible in the first place and you'll be able to type the code that I type on your

50
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.380
own.

51
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.920
So I highly recommend that you do it.

52
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.940
But I guess you could just watch if you want to do so without further ado let's get on to the new stuff.
