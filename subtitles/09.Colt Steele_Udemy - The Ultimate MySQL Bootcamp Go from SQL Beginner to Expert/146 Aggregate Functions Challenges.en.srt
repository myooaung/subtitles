1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,450
All right.

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,400
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,040
Me and my cat Cooper.

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,700
Wow.

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,120
That was my cat promised.

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,380
So in this video we're now going to spend some time or you're going to spend some time getting some

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,310
practice with the different functions we just saw things I count men Max some and average as well as

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,100
using them with Group.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,330
So in this video I'm just going to lay out the challenges for the exercises and then in the next video

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,400
we'll talk about solutions.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:37,230
So the first one is to print the number of books in the database so you know don't just do a select

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,010
star from books and then manually go through in and tabulate or count them write a single line that

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,090
will print out the number of books in the database and then once you've done that move on to this one.

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,470
Print out how many books were released in each year and after say the wording on some of these is it's

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,340
not great.

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,730
But I kind of struggled to figure out how to explain this the best way.

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:10,230
Basically group things by year that they were released and then just print out how many were released

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,850
that year each year.

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:20,140
So it should look something like 2005 and 2006 two books 1945 one book.

20
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,100
Now those numbers are just made up.

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,470
So don't worry about those numbers.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,470
But basically that's the idea.

23
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:34,500
You should have a year and then accounting for how many books are released that year and then next up.

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,550
Print out the total number of books in stock.

25
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,480
So there's a stock quantity and every book has a stock quantity.

26
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,800
So print out the sum.

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,710
Ah I just gave it away.

28
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,800
Well print out the sum of all of the books in stock.

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:01,120
So just add together all the quantities and then find the average released year for each author.

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:09,930
So you'll need to go through group things by author first or last and first name and then find the average

31
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,060
year that they were released for each author.

32
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:18,420
So your results should look something like Raymond and then Carver and then the third column should

33
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,220
be the average or least year.

34
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,500
Let's say that's 1980 5.2 or something.

35
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,930
Next up find the full name of the author who wrote the longest book.

36
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,710
So full name here is in a different color because it's a little different.

37
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:41,570
This one you'll need to use one of the tricks that we saw in that video where we talked about men and

38
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,300
Macs and that issue and my cats being a nightmare.

39
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,860
C'mon.

40
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,980
No no.

41
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,860
She's just knocking everything off my desk.

42
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,430
Low OK.

43
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:07,680
So what was the idea here is to not just find the longest book or the page count for the longest book

44
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:15,790
but actually print out the name of the author of the full name so you'll need to you can get full name

45
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,780
you want first Plus last name with a space in between.

46
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:26,610
Of the author who wrote the longest book so you need to find the longest book and then use that to find

47
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,310
the author basically.

48
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,820
And there's a couple of ways of doing it.

49
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,550
If you remember the min and max video that the second min and max video where I talked about some of

50
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:42,360
the problems or one problem in particular that arises when you try and print information like title

51
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:50,630
or author based off of something being men or max and then the last challenge here is to print this

52
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,690
data.

53
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,710
So we should have the years released notice that we have an alias for all three of these.

54
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:04,220
So that year like 1945 the number of books released in that year so you know 1 1 1 1.

55
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,390
But then here we go.

56
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:11,540
In 2001 there were three books and then the average number of pages for those books released in that

57
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,440
year.

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,510
So I won't tell you how any to group things in this case but hopefully you can figure that out based

59
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,340
off of this image.

60
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,500
All right you get it.

61
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,300
Take care of this cat situation.

62
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,340
Oh my God.

63
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,400
And then in the next video we'll have a solution.
