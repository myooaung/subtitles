00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,540
Warning this video may contain extremely frustrating installation instructions for experienced developers

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,690
only it's advise that you install use in cloud 9 to avoid moveless pain.

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,490
OK.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,990
Welcome to this video on installing my as well on a Mac.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,930
And again I'll warn you this can be painful.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,390
And this lecture and doing this all these steps are 100 percent optional.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,680
In fact if you don't have a good reason if you're not sure if you should do this then that means that

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,040
you shouldn't do it at least not until you get to the end of the course.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,990
Of course if you're somebody who is an experienced developer and you know you want to get this running

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,990
locally at the beginning on your Mac then go ahead follow these instructions.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,810
But I would definitely recommend that you go through the course for ninety nine point nine percent of

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,520
the people in this class go through the course of cloud nine and then install this on your Mac at the

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:50,850
end.

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,890
It just makes everything so much easier.

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,640
OK.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:59,500
So if you're still here though the steps to actually install it are surprisingly simple.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,880
The problem is once you install it you run into issues depending on your developer environment depending

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,900
on things like using bash or Z show.

19
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,900
If you have permissions issues and passwords and it just turns into a nightmare a little bit.

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,940
Well not just a little bit a lot.

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,510
So the first thing we need to do.

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,230
Like you said it's actually nice and easy just go to my office.

23
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,550
Q l dot com.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,700
Goes to the downloads tab.

25
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,720
And what you'll see here are a bunch of the basically like the commercial services and Ms.

26
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,700
Q. Well enterprise software that is not free.

27
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:44,230
We want the community section and then we want the first thing here my Escudo community server.

28
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,530
Then at the very beginning this is kind of just a blurb about it some documentation instructions.

29
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,220
But if you keep scrolling down you'll see the download links.

30
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,940
So you'll need to select the one that corresponds to your Mac.

31
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,150
Depending on how old your Mac is how new it is what version of Mac OS it's running.

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:10,490
All of that you'll have to make a decision but for me it's for first one here so click download and

33
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:16,390
it looks like you have to type or you have to sign in or create an account but that's not true.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,730
You scroll down and there's this link.

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,400
No thanks just start my download.

36
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,560
Of course if you want to you can sign up.

37
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,050
But most of you probably don't care.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,850
So just quick.

39
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,520
No thanks.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,160
Just start my download and I'll see you in just a second once I edit this download time out.

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,720
All right.

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,780
Now that's completed downloading.

43
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,610
So I'm going to open it up.

44
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,200
Might take a second to open but once it does you'll see a single file inside of this and we'll just

45
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,480
double click follow the steps continue.

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,990
Read every word.

47
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,870
This of course I've already done it so you know I know everything it says.

48
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:01,090
Click Agree tells you one point when 3 gigs of space needed to make sure that you have that available

49
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,370
then will click install.

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,430
Then it will ask you for your password for your computer.

51
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,600
Fortunately yes I can use my thumb finger that way you don't have to watch me type my password.

52
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,370
I don't have to edit that up.

53
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,950
It's always a problem.

54
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,820
I don't want people to see my passwords.

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,280
OK.

56
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,600
So here's an important part.

57
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,300
I mean this all important but this in particular it gives you a little pop up here that says a temporary

58
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,970
password is generated for root at the local host and then it gives you this password.

59
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,190
So I highly Well I highly recommend that you need to copy this.

60
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,020
Technically if you forget to lose it you can reset the password.

61
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,050
It's just another set of steps and complications.

62
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,630
So copy this.

63
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,760
Save it.

64
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,150
OK.

65
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,640
We're now done installing it.

66
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,110
Move it to the trash.

67
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,520
So we're done with the install but that's the easy part.

68
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,760
Just a couple of clicks.

69
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,350
Now we need to do a couple of things.

70
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:09,410
The first is startup the server so to do that we go to System Preferences and it should be down here

71
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,870
there should be a new icon somewhere at least depending on how you have your setup.

72
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,290
For me it's about muffed my as well.

73
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:21,330
Will click on that and we should see my server status you know blah blah blah.

74
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,900
It's the server instance is currently stopped.

75
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,590
There's a button to click to start it which will start it.

76
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,960
And then there's also this checkbox which will address.

77
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:38,710
Now depending on what you want you can have my s q all server startup every time you start your computer.

78
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,950
I'm not going to do that.

79
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,830
You have to type your password again.

80
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:48,360
I have like 6 or 7 database servers on here and I just don't want any of them to start up on this machine

81
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,070
at least this is not my developer machine this is what I use for teaching.

82
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,900
Totally up to you.

83
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,490
Just depends on how you're using it.

84
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,890
But if you're just learning my ask.

85
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,170
Well now it might actually be good to leave it on so you don't have to continually started.

86
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,140
But either way it's not that hard to start it's just a button here which will click now.

87
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,980
And there we go.

88
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,580
If you didn't click this or uncheck this you may have to type your password when you click that the

89
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,530
first time.

90
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:23,270
OK so now what we have left to do is open up our terminal and start interacting with this.

91
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:31,480
So I'm going to bring the font size up a bit and theoretically you should be able to type my well but

92
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,260
this is where we start running into issues.

93
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,240
So I'm getting this command not found.

94
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,760
And if you get this again this depends on how your Mac is set up in your developer environment.

95
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,860
And this is where it's annoying for me.

96
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,680
I'm using something called the show I'm getting command not found.

97
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,450
And that's because the my Escudo command is not it's not in my path.

98
00:05:51,490 --> 00:06:00,120
So what I need to do now open up my dot slash dot S.H. RC file

99
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:09,740
and I'll paste this line in here just so you can see it or include this in the instructions for this

100
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,870
lecture.

101
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,660
You can find this on anywhere online it's very common error when people type in my school and you get

102
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,920
command not found.

103
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:27,940
In fact if we just did that right now and went to Google see depending on what version of OSX you're

104
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,560
running there's all sorts of replies that are basically exactly what I just did it.

105
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,590
In fact that's where I got the wine originally.

106
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,760
It just depends on if you are using bash and if you are then you can use a line like this but essentially

107
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,710
you know there's all of these possibilities depending on your environment.

108
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:48,340
So I can't cover all of them here but find the correct command for you to run.

109
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,730
And that's only if you're getting command not found.

110
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,520
All right.

111
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,200
So we need to save this file.

112
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,750
Close it down or back to a terminal.

113
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,760
Then the next thing I'm going to close the window and reopen it.

114
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,870
Or you can quit terminal or you can source your profile.

115
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,300
Now what I need to do is try my ask you out to get.

116
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,010
OK so now we have a different problem and this is a great problem.

117
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,770
This is a problem we should have access denied for user Culp's do local host using password.

118
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,300
No the problem is if you're a member.

119
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,880
Well first of all this means that my secure while the command is found it's running but we're getting

120
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,840
a result now.

121
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,460
And the problem is that I'm trying to start my as well and I don't have permission I need to log in

122
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,190
as the root user and remember we save that password.

123
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,610
So I went and copied that password that we were told to save.

124
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,230
It's on my clipboard Now I could paste it but that won't do anything.

125
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:52,980
What we need to do is run my as well dash you space route dash P and hit enter and it should promptly

126
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,850
for the password.

127
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,580
You can paste that in and we're in.

128
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,500
All right.

129
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,400
So if you get this far congratulations everything's working.

130
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,380
If you didn't get to this point it's likely because of a couple of reasons.

131
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,990
One is that you're still getting that command not found issue.

132
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,620
That one this is relatively easy to fix the problem is you have to be comfortable using your command

133
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,920
line and opening up you know hidden files like abash profile or yours the HRC file.

134
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,680
The other problem you could run into is this permissions thing.

135
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,040
And if you didn't save that password I told you you should save but if you didn't or you close the window

136
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,040
accidentally you can reset the root password.

137
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,490
All you need to do is go online and Google it.

138
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,650
There's a couple of posts online about it.

139
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:47,250
Basically what you do is you run my ask you about Dash you space route and there's something called

140
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,510
flush privileges commands and you can update your password with a new password.

141
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,090
There's a couple of things you can do like that.

142
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,470
Basically rather than me making a video for every possibility.

143
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,650
It's much better if you just find it out online.

144
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,380
And this is why I recommended that you use cloud 9.

145
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,700
Promise you're not paying me.

146
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,450
It's just that this is difficult especially in an online setting.

147
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,340
OK.

148
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,420
So you might think we could start running some miniscule code if you tried.

149
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,910
Here's something we haven't actually seen yet.

150
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:25,050
But if you tried this were actually about show databases this would show us databases and if there are

151
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,540
databases it would still show us something.

152
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,930
But instead we get this you must reset your password using alter user statement before executing this

153
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,050
statement.

154
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,510
OK.

155
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:40,890
So our final hurdle here what we need to do is have a command that I just had on my clipboard but it

156
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,050
looks like this.

157
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,910
Alter user in quotes root at.

158
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:52,560
And then in quotes local host identified by and then all you need to do is provide a password here in

159
00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:00,030
quotes that you would like to use for the root user for your my s q will install for this server instance.

160
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,760
And so just type something I'm just going to make my own password.

161
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,970
There we go and hit enter.

162
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:07,880
Oh.

163
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,600
A Michael.

164
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:17,380
Now if we get the query OK things should be working if I try my show database's command this time we're

165
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:17,910
in.

166
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,990
I don't get this permissions problem.

167
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,960
Ok it worked out.

168
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,360
So again that command I'll also include in the instructions if you need to do that it's just alter user

169
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,760
root local host identified by password.

170
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,360
OK.

171
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:39,610
So then the last thing is if you want to close out by the way it's Kamandi which we'll be covering all

172
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,480
of this if you're going through the course of the very first time and this is how you decide to start

173
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,180
will actually go over these commands in the next section when we install everything.

174
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,930
Once we have everything installed and we start talking about mice.

175
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,050
Q Well but we need to be able to verify the install.

176
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,510
So there's a couple of comments.

177
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,910
OK so now if I wanted to try logging in again I shut it down.

178
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:08,480
It's my as well dash you route dash P and then we'll ask me for my password which I changed to password

179
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,240
to type that you won't actually see it.

180
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,860
But if you type it correctly you're in.

181
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,130
OK.

182
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,440
So that is our journey to installing my s.

183
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,340
Q On a Mac.

184
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,560
Great time.

185
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,890
Hopefully if you got to this point you made it through and everything worked out.

186
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:31,000
If not if you're just starting this course off I still highly recommend that you switch to using Cloud

187
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,330
9.

188
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,380
Avoid all of these issues and then come back to this when you feel more confident.

189
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,630
Otherwise if you absolutely have to use a Mac we'll try our best to help you out.

190
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,930
Anyway moving to.
