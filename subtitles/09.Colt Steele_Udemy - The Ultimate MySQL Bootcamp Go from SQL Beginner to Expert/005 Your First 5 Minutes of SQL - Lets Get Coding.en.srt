1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,850
All right I mentioned I wanted to get us writing some code as soon as possible.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,850
So that's what we're going to do in this video.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,270
Obviously it's super early on in the course so don't get your hopes up for doing anything crazy impressive.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,630
It's going to be pretty basic.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,170
But the idea is that I just want to introduce you to writing some sequel.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,440
Show you what it's like.

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,990
So the first thing you'll need to do is click on this link if you want to open the slides I've included

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,580
them with this lecture or I've included the link itself as a resource with this lecture.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:33,330
So however you would like to get there go to this link which takes us to this page right here.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,790
This is the tri sequel Ed. And I'm going to make my screen a little bit bigger just so that you can

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,380
see it.

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,480
Here we go and I'll start by just deleting what's already in there.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,650
So you might be wondering what is this place.

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,940
That's a good question.

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,760
It's an interactive browser based sequel environment.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,910
And what that really means is that think of it as your own personal sequel sandbox in the browser where

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,010
you can go try some things out and play around.

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,770
It's purely for educational purposes.

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,350
So this is not what you would be doing if you were actually working with a real production database.

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,200
But what it lets you do is type some sequel queries and run them by clicking this run sequel button

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,520
and you'll get a result.

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,690
And that's fundamentally the process of working with sequel.

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,740
You type something and then you run it and then you get something back.

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,220
Oh and before we go any further I should point out that we're talking about sequel here not MY as well

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:20,640
yet.

26
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,510
And if you're confused about that distinction totally normal question to have.

27
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,760
Wait until the next section when I go into detail about the differences.

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,150
But for now I'd like you to try running some code.

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,430
So here's the first line of sequel that we can try running.

30
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,030
So like star from customers so you can either type this or copy it from the slides or from the included

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,750
code file.

32
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,850
After this lecture so I'll just copy it from the slides here.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,620
And then back in the editor I'll paste it in and click run.

34
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,300
So the first thing you'll notice is that we get a bunch of data back.

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,740
So I'm not going to go into the details of the syntax and what all this means for every command we run.

36
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,240
It's really more about just giving you an experience of running commands.

37
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,080
The rest of the Course talks about the details and the syntax.

38
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:08,710
But what this does is it gives us all of the data about customers in this database so you can see we've

39
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:14,010
got 91 customers and every customer here has a name.

40
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,580
So these are stores or restaurants.

41
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:23,520
There's the contact at the restaurant or the business the address the city the postal code and the country.

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,260
OK.

43
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,680
So that's all I'll say about that.

44
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,870
So let's start from customers.

45
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,070
That gives us all of our customers data that are in the database right now.

46
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,500
So here's another thing we could try.

47
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,440
It's very similar.

48
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,280
Select start from orders.

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,220
So we'll just copy that and back here in the editor I'll paste it in and click run as well.

50
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:48,820
Non-sequel same thing happens but this time we get all of our data printed out for our orders.

51
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,460
So you might be wondering where is this data coming from in the first place.

52
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,580
Very good question.

53
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,520
It's preprogramed in here.

54
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,600
So every time you open this in your browser you have this preloaded data set that you can work with

55
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,600
and just by taking a quick look at our order data you can see we have things like an order ID a customer

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,540
id an employee ID an order date and a shipper ID but there's really not much descriptive information

57
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:10,910
here.

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,010
And that's actually why I chose this table.

59
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,070
I wanted to make the point that a lot of the data you'll be working with on its own are like a snapshot

60
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,060
like this isn't very meaningful.

61
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,380
What we actually want to do is start combining it with other tables.

62
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,190
So we're not going to do that now but that's what we're building up towards the end of the course is

63
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,260
how do I combine customers with orders and products and shippers to get some meaningful answers out

64
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,240
of my data.

65
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,760
So here's another thing we can do.

66
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,320
Very similar to what we've done already but there's a little bit extra.

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,700
So select start from products ordered by price descending DGSE.

68
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,540
And if I paste that in here and click run what I get now are all of the products in my database.

69
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:56,190
So they have a product ID name a supplier ID category ID a unit and then or price.

70
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,030
And they're currently sorted by most expensive down to the cheapest all the way at the end.

71
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,470
So I won't force you to listen to me trying to pronounce some of these but these are our products and

72
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,020
they're currently sorted by price.

73
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,150
So just a simple modification to the query yields radically different results.

74
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,900
And if we just get rid of that order by price we get the same data back but now it's ordered by product

75
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,840
id rather than the price.

76
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,610
Okay.

77
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,420
And stepping up in complexity a little bit here here's another query.

78
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,480
This one is significantly longer and this one actually involves two different entities.

79
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,120
So we saw customers we saw orders separately.

80
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,470
If you try copying this and pasting it in and you clicked run what we actually get here is a list of

81
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:44,260
records for a customer and then the number of orders a given customer has placed.

82
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,080
So remember this data is stored in two separate places.

83
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,210
We had the customers data that had nothing to do with orders.

84
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:56,110
And then we had the orders data and all that it contained was customer ID and then we combined them

85
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,380
with this query.

86
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,380
So do not focus on the syntax.

87
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,550
Don't panic about that.

88
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,950
Of course we'll get there.

89
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,940
We'll talk a lot more about how to structure queries.

90
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,840
I mean most of this Course is about structuring complex queries.

91
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,590
In fact here's a quick preview of some of the things we'll be doing.

92
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,810
So here's an example of a slightly more complicated query.

93
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,880
This time we're working with photos and images.

94
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,080
We're working with users and likes and putting them all together to get some information out.

95
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,230
And here's another one little bit crazier where we're working with ratings or reviews and TV shows and

96
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,890
reviewers.

97
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:36,250
So think of like a Netflix or iTunes where you can rent or watch a TV show and then rate it from one

98
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,400
to 10 or a to five for whatever the rating scale is.

99
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,410
Here we're working with that data to figure out who our power users are who are the most active users

100
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,290
who are reviewing the most things.

101
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,440
So we'll be building up to these sort of queries by the end of the course.

102
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,440
You should be able to make sense of this and do a lot more by the way.

103
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:52,990
OK.

104
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,610
So that was a taste of sequel.

105
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,150
Hopefully it didn't taste too bad.

106
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,690
So in the next section we'll dive into the nitty gritty of what sequel is and how it compares to my

107
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:00,830
ass.

108
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,660
Q Well we'll get everything installed and then finally we'll have our first set of exercises.
