Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,380
So this section as you may have guessed we're continuing on with our books data.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,490
We're not doing cats reading books.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,860
And primarily what we're going to do is focus on some more advanced my s cool features things like limiting

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,790
the number of results that we get back instead of 10000.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,140
I want five.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,730
Then we'll see how to do things like sorting our results.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:28,080
I want the top five books sorted by sales or sorted by title alphabetically or by genre all sorts of

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,980
things we can do.

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,720
And then from there of course at the end we're going to have some fun exercises and challenges to wrap

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,520
everything up.

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,580
So let's get started.
