1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,500
They're welcome to the next video.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:09,060
So in this video I would really like to do spend a couple seconds introducing myself as well as introducing

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,530
blue.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,830
This is our course teej.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,750
You'll see her pop up a couple of times in the course hopefully you don't have a problem with cats anyways.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,440
So my background really is that I've been teaching people to program in person for the last five or

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,280
so years I've been teaching a web development bootcamps in the San Francisco Bay area pretty much nonstop.

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,180
So if you're not familiar with who camps where did all the camps that is the way they typically work

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,070
is that there are three to six month long programs where students basically commit their lives for that

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,100
duration to learning to cope and nothing else.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,010
It's a very very intensive program.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,220
We take students who have zero programming experience all the way up to the point where they get web

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,240
developer jobs.

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,620
So really rewarding work.

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,110
I fell in love with teaching five or seven years ago and recently I decided to try my hand at taking

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,560
my in classroom approach and trying to bring it online.

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,190
So this is my second course and this course as you know is on my ass.

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,690
Q Well it's kind of the next logical step to teach online.

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,690
So I used to teach this in person as well.

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,420
I'm now trying to take my curriculum and bring it to the classroom on Monday.

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:12,800
All right.

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,210
So that's enough about myself.

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,330
If you have any questions if you're curious or you're actually interested in in person bootcamps you

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,110
have questions.

25
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,590
Absolutely reach out to me.

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,570
Send me a message or post a question on the discussion boards.

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,360
All right.

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,340
See you in the next video.
