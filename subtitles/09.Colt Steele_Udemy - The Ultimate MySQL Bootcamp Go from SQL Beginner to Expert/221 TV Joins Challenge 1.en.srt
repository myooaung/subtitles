1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,030
So we inserted all of our data.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,140
We have our schema ready in our tables created.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,450
Now let's get down to business.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,860
Let's do some stuff with it.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,780
So I'm going to break every problem that I'm going to give you.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,880
There's quite a few here into it's own video.

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:22,110
Hopefully I'll make them a bit more manageable and you won't want to go to sleep or drown yourself after

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,800
watching it.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,540
So the first thing that you'll see here the format of these is that I'm going to give you the results.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,900
It's much easier just to give you a picture of them rather than trying to describe a bunch of text with

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,420
what it actually means.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,820
It's much easier to show you.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,250
So first thing I should say is that these results are truncated.

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,670
These are only for the first 15 or so used limit.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,520
But I want results for everything it's just too hard to fit them onto the screen would be very very

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,170
tiny.

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,840
But the key thing is that we have a title for a movie or excuse me for a series and a corresponding

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,900
rating.

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,850
So we're going to need to join those tables together.

20
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,740
We need to join the series table with the reviews table because right now they're not in the same table

21
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,370
we're storing the titles separately from the ratings.

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,030
So let's do this now we'll go over to cloud nine and the first thing we'll do is just start simple.

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:28,920
We'll select star and we'll just start from series which we've already done.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,620
Just like this one thing I should highlight before we go too far.

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,950
I did deliberately add some series that don't have any reviews so that nobody has rated them yet and

26
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,410
that was deliberate so that we can work with that later.

27
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,830
However in this example I only want to see movies.

28
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,730
I keep saying that we want to see the titles of series that have been rated so we don't have any Knolles

29
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,370
in here which is a bit of a hint.

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,470
So select star from series and on its own we get this.

31
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,490
Now what we want to do is join.

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,520
So if we do a separate select to start from previews

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,270
we want to join.

34
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:23,490
Basically where this ID of the series is the same as the series ID.

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:31,210
So these first five here one two three four five correspond to Archer which is what we see here.

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,140
So to do that we don't need to separate selects you energy select star from Sirius.

37
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:44,480
Well do join with reviews on.

38
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,060
And where do we want would you want to join on series.

39
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:59,990
Dot ID equal to revues dot series underscore ID just to reiterate where this idea of the series actually

40
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,440
is going to be easier if I do it here.

41
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:13,550
Where this series ID is equal to this idea of the series table OK and all we want are title and rating.

42
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,620
We'll start with just getting everything and lets see if were in business yet.

43
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,310
Well its a little hard to tell because we have this formatting issue where we have so much data.

44
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:32,390
Things are being cascaded over but if we look closely we can see okay we have Archer 8.00 Archer seven

45
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:39,330
point five or eight point five and so on and if we scroll down you can see that not every single TV

46
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,090
show is here.

47
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:46,440
You'll notice the IDs jump seven eight nine General Hospital 10 and catch fire.

48
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,540
Then it goes up to 13 so whatever.

49
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,900
11 and 12 are we don't have any reviews so that's good not that we don't have reviews that's not good

50
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,410
but they're not showing up which is what we want.

51
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,590
So now we'll just whittle this down to title and rating.

52
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,300
And that's all we want and I'll format it a little bit nicer.

53
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:14,670
Here we go hit enter and now we get all of our data on the left side.

54
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,520
We have title on the right side.

55
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,200
We have corresponding ratings.

56
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,980
So hopefully what we just did there seemed relatively similar to what we did in the last section where

57
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,860
we're writing these joints what will build up to in this section is doing a double join where we have

58
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,580
another joint statement because we want to connect all three of our tables.

59
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,760
But for now we're working with one table or two tables at a time.

60
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,410
OK.

61
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,010
So we're done with that one.

62
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,460
I mean just put a comment up here.

63
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,610
First let me just do challenge one.

64
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,870
Now we'll move on.

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,960
Next video we'll pick up with challenge to.
