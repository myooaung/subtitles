1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,000
So to close out this section here we're going to get a little practice with data types and the syntax

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,110
we're creating and deleting tables.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,950
So one more activity this time I'd like you to imagine that you work at a pastry shop so you're going

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,650
to manage I manage in air quotes that you can't see me doing right now but you're going to manage a

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,680
pastry shop in the inventory for these pastries.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,260
It's going to be very simplistic but you'll need to create a pastries table and there should be at least

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,630
two columns if you want to add more that's fine.

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,620
But a name for the pastry.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,990
So what is it a croissant.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,990
A chocolate donut.

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,370
Whatever it is as well as a quantity which should be a number so I could go in and see that there are

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,830
10 croissants or five chocolate her size and so on.

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,060
But we won't fill it with data because we haven't seen her do that.

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,890
So we're just defining the table and the columns.

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:01,580
So I'd like you to do that then use a command to inspect your table and the columns using the my.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,840
Well command line interface so one of those short little commands we saw just to make sure basically

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,460
to check your work.

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:15,300
And then lastly delete all that hard work to your table so passive idio if you'd like go through this

19
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,170
and come back when you're done and hope.

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,370
Be here.

21
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,790
OK.

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,090
So I'm back in cloud nine.

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,160
I'm actually still if I select database.

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,870
I'm still using cat app.

25
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,370
There are no tables in it right now because I deleted the cat's table but I'm just going to put our

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,100
pastries table in here even though it has nothing to do with cat app.

27
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,160
Maybe it's a cat bakery or something.

28
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,740
Actually dog bakery so maybe we're not too far off.

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,710
But anyways it's just a silly exercise.

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:55,200
So we want to create a table so create table and then the name of the table will be pastries plural.

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,660
Then in parentheses and I'm going to do it on one line just to show you that it's not a problem.

32
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,590
So we'll have the name of the pastry.

33
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:11,370
And one thing that you may be tempted to do if you come from some other databases is to put a code in

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:11,900
there.

35
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,760
That's the thing I find myself doing just some from experience that I have some other tools but you

36
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,710
don't want that there.

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,720
So if you see me doing that I hope they catch yourself to create table pastries name is going to be

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,530
a Vardar and it should be 50 characters maximum.

39
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,950
So in print this is 50 and then we have age.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,890
Excuse me we have quantity if you want to abbreviate that with just Q T Y which is what you'll see pretty

41
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,700
commonly.

42
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,920
You could do that as well.

43
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,150
And that's just an integer that you need.

44
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,240
I semi-colon to end and we hit enter.

45
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,140
And we have a nice small error message.

46
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,210
So that was accidental.

47
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,580
I'm not going to try and play it off like you did on purpose but I am going to leave it in here.

48
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,500
And that's mainly because it's something that pops up pretty commonly.

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,890
People aren't perfect at least I'm not especially when I'm recording.

50
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,350
Got a lot of stuff to worry about.

51
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,070
Can you identify what went wrong.

52
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,640
I'll give you a hint.

53
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,970
I'm just missing one character.

54
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:22,900
Yep if you've got it I'm missing a comma here and the error messages aren't always that useful but it

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:30,910
tells me there's an error in my syntax and it's something near quantity and so right before that I'm

56
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,310
missing a comma.

57
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,750
It's treating all of this as name which is wrong.

58
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:45,250
We need that comma there so we can recall that line go back and insert a comma.

59
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,240
Now when we do it we get queery OK and we'll move on to the next part which was to make sure things

60
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,760
worked.

61
00:03:51,810 --> 00:04:03,950
So we could either do show tables and then we can do show let's do describe describe pastries perfect

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:13,670
name for our char quantity is an end and the last thing was to drop our pastries table drop table pastries

63
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,290
goodbye pastries and just to verify it worked.

64
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,170
Let's do show tables again.

65
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,520
And there's nothing here.

66
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,700
Perfect.

67
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,350
So the next section is all going to be about inserting data.

68
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,390
We make tables.

69
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,260
They're empty.

70
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,380
How do we get stuff in there.
