00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,580
Say hey welcome to the next section.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,290
So this section as you can probably gather we're still working with our books data.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,150
I hope you're not tired of it yet.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,250
If you are almost done.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,060
But it's important that we keep working with one dataset for a little bit at least so that you can get

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,090
familiar with it.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,940
And the reason that that matters is that as we do some of the more advanced things we want you to be

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,260
able to check your work.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,850
So in this section we're going to learn a lot about different ways of performing analysis on data.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,450
So things like finding averages or something a bunch of data together grouping things by authors and

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,710
calculating average quantities or page numbers per author.

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,650
These are operations that if we had 10000 books or 10000 something else it's really hard to know if

13
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,900
you're doing it right or wrong.

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,690
You get an answer just a number of let's say sixty seven point five.

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,650
And how could you know if that's right or wrong.

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,020
But if we're working with books and we have 20 of them and you're familiar with the page counts and

17
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,690
the authors you'll know.

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:00:59,980
OK.

19
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:05,750
This author has three books that seems right versus OK that author only has two books why are we saying

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,080
that.

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,540
You know we have three or something like that.

22
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,020
Terrible example but the same idea is true.

23
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,980
We know our data at this point.

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,450
We're going to at the end of this course and along the way you know we're going to keep upgrading our

25
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,360
data to more complex structures more tables more rose complex stuff.

26
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:28,580
But at the very end kind of the capstone case study we'll be working with Instagram esque data fake

27
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,950
data for Instagram and we'll have thousands and thousands of rows and you won't actually know if you're

28
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,600
doing things right or wrong based off the number you're getting unless you've manually checked your

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,970
work by you know doing a thousand additions or something.

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,910
So all this to say stick with the books if you can.

31
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:51,230
And in this section we're focusing a lot on these new aggregate functions.

32
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:58,620
So those are things like finding averages counting summing things together based off of grouping data.

33
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,170
So it's a bit hard to explain and a headshot that's showing you code.

34
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,000
So I'll let the code do that.

35
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,420
And just a few videos from now.

36
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,690
But the rough idea is that we take our data and there's all sorts of insights we can gain.

37
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:17,000
So rather than just working with an individual row or a group of rows we can combine things into like

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,040
mega rows.

39
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,380
I can combine all of our authors and group books based off of who wrote them or group books based off

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,570
of what year they're written in and then perform operations on those groups.

41
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:35,930
So it allows them to do things like find the average sales that we've had per year or we could do things

42
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,450
like find the average page number for books per general.

43
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,990
And then we could expand that obviously to more complex stuff.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,680
If you're working with advertising data or let's say our Instagram data we'll be able to at the end

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,270
of the course do things like find out which one of our users is a power user influencers what they're

46
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,820
called I guess meaning that they have the most comments the most likes on each one of their posts on

47
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,450
average.

48
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,980
So who in our database is getting on average the most likes and comments.

49
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,050
Or we could do things like which hash tag generates the most traction and to do that we would need to

50
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:17,270
analyze all of our hashtags and then take all of our photos that have those hash tags group them together

51
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,280
figure out which one of those hashtags generates the most likes.

52
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,690
So there's a lot of stuff that we can do with these aggregate functions.

53
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,820
They form the backbone of a lot of the questions and analysis that we'll do throughout the course.

54
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,650
All right.

55
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,640
I'm rambling now I'm going to go away.

56
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,520
Hopefully you enjoy this section.

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,590
It's important to say that a lot but it really is.

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,800
And of course we'll have a bunch of exercises throughout the course or throughout the section and especially

59
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,560
at the end.

60
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,200
And I'm trying to keep it interesting.

61
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,260
Look forward to those.

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,120
If you don't just remember it's a database course.

63
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,580
I'm trying my best.

64
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,500
It's you know it's databases.

65
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,620
All right.

66
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,200
I'm done.
