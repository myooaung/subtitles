1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,410
So this is the read solution.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,760
Basically it's a bunch of select statements we're going to write.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,280
So the first one is to select all shirts but only print out their article and their color.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,920
So back in cloud 9.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:20,010
All we need to do is select and rather than just select star which gives us everything from all shirts

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,500
I mean this is correct in that we want all shirts to be listed but we wanted to narrow down the fields

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,770
we get which was Article comma color.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,910
And there we go.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,570
Article color T-shirt white polo shirt black tank top white and so on.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:46,170
Next up select all medium shirts but only print out shirt I.D. So that's all we want.

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,740
So let's start off by just getting the medium shirts to select star from shirt wear.

12
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,720
And then we need to do a shirt size equals medium.

13
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,770
Just like that and hit enter and we get four shirts that have shirts heads of media.

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:10,320
But all that we want is everything excluding the shirt Id just a moment ago I think I said it backwards

15
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,420
on everything but the shirt ID which means we need to list everything we want out.

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:28,050
So select article color comma shirt size comma last worn and then we can just copy this from shirts

17
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,870
where shirts equals medium.

18
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,150
And here we go.

19
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:42,030
We have all mediums and we have the four columns we're looking for which excluded shirt ID sorry surety.

20
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,520
So that's it for the selecting portion to read in our crowd.

21
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,950
Next up update.
