1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,690
All right.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,220
Welcome to the next section.

3
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,010
So what we're going to do here is basically take the schema design we came up with in the last section

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:15,000
for roughly Instagram ish application with photos and users and comments and tags and followers and

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,250
all of that we're going to take that schema and implemented.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,550
And I'm going to give you a bunch of data to put in your database like a couple of thousand of things

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,350
to enter.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,540
I wrote a giant file and what we'll do is put that in there so we all have the same starting place and

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,440
then we're going to pretend that we're the company and we're trying to figure out certain things like

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:42,000
Do we have too many bots on our application or their user accounts that are inactive or their user accounts

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,950
that have never posted a photo.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,190
Maybe we could send them an e-mail campaign you know encouraging them to post a photo or hash tags tend

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,600
to be most successful.

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,490
That kind of stuff.

15
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:59,100
So all of this section every video will be asking a question which is basically a nice way of saying

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,880
open an exercise.

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:06,210
But we're now posing it rather than just giving you a table which is what we've been doing where you

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,000
know it's a table and I just ask you to recreate this.

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,040
I'm now going to pose the question as if we work at a fictional company and we're trying to find something

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,560
out.

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,920
For example it might be something like we're running a new ad campaign and we need to figure out which

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,600
five hashtags get the most likes.

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,800
Something like that.

24
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,220
So that's how this will work every video on the section will be a question and rather than having all

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,010
of the solutions at the end making a giant video that takes like half an hour to go through.

26
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,070
I'm just going to break them up.

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,480
So every video will have the question at the beginning and then a following solution.

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,280
But the first thing we need to do is insert all of our data so included in this section is this file

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,170
here starter data as well.

30
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,750
And there's two components the first one is setting up our schema.

31
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,630
And there's nothing new here we talked about all of this in the last section but if you were following

32
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,560
along and doing it yourself you may have named something slightly differently.

33
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,460
Like instead of photo tags you may have called that tagging.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,280
Or instead of you know I don't know instead of follow me and follower and follows Maybe you call that

35
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,090
following or relationship or something.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,460
So in order to give you this data here to insert I needed to make sure that we all have the same schema

37
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,620
even if just one thing is named differently.

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,840
It's a problem.

39
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,960
So the first part of this is just a bunch of create tables.

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,630
All the tables are discussed as well as dropping the existing Instagram clone database creating a new

41
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,120
database and then using it if you want to if you want to keep your current Instagram clone database.

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,820
If you've been working with that just give us a different name whatever you want but you need to do

43
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,830
it to all three of these.

44
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,370
OK.

45
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,890
So we set up the schema but then the fun part which is all of these Insearch statements and it doesn't

46
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,130
look that impressive when you look at it in cloud 9 because it doesn't wrap them onto new lines.

47
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,190
And if I start scrolling you'll see I'm scrolling really fast but look down here at the progress bar

48
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,760
I've barely made a dent.

49
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,960
And this is not a great way to visualize the data.

50
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,890
So instead here I am in Sublime Text and here's the file that I generated.

51
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,380
It's the same exact file.

52
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,810
It's just displayed all here rather than having to scroll across.

53
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,070
I have to scroll down.

54
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,060
So you know we won't do any sort of grand tour of the data but I will say this I spent a lot of time

55
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,910
trying to figure out how I wanted this to work.

56
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,680
Obviously I didn't type this myself.

57
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:43,740
I would have taken days probably Instead I wrote some code which still took probably an entire day and

58
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,350
a half to get it this how I wanted because I didn't want just randomized data.

59
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:54,270
If I just wanted to insert a bunch of random users and posts and comments that have no meaning to it

60
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,680
I could have done that pretty quickly but instead I tried to design this so that there is certain personas

61
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,360
to our to our users so some users post a lot so they have a lot of comments a lot of posts.

62
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,740
Some users are lurkers meaning that they don't really do anything except look at people maybe like certain

63
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,430
things.

64
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,670
At best they don't comment and they don't post.

65
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,890
Then we have things like bots which on Instagram are a real problem where bots are accounts that exist

66
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,220
basically to go out and like a bunch of things.

67
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,040
Comments on things usually the same exact comment but they don't post things and then we also have like

68
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,050
celebrity accounts who have very few people that they actually follow.

69
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,330
But they have tons of followers and they're not very active with commentating or liking with very active

70
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,210
with posting.

71
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,480
So then we've got things like hashtags and I didn't want to just do a bunch of random hash tags.

72
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,100
I tried to actually come up with combinations of hash tags.

73
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,110
It would be common.

74
00:04:53,110 --> 00:05:00,880
So you know things like smile and style and fashion might be together often but then we might also have

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,320
smile and party or concert.

76
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,320
Those might go together or we might have you know landscape and sunrise and sunset and beach could be

77
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,670
a combination for a beach photo at sunset.

78
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,890
But then we could also have beach night with party or beach with beauty or something like that.

79
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,590
So that's just kind of scratching the surface.

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,890
But I tried to design a lot of that in there so that we had somewhat real data.

81
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:34,010
With that said things like comments the text of a comment is just random Lorem Ipsum text.

82
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,070
So there's nothing there you know that's going to be meaningful about the comment itself.

83
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,240
What's more meaningful is the relationship between the comment and who posted it.

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,320
And if they have a lot of comments or they don't have many comments and that sort of thing.

85
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,380
OK so that's enough of that.

86
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:55,100
So even with all the effort that I've put in here there's still only you know 100 or so or exactly 100

87
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,110
users about 250 something photos.

88
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,380
But then when we start talking about likes there's thousands and comments there's tons.

89
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:11,520
And following follows whatever recalled it there's tons and tags there's only maybe 20 hashtags.

90
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:18,610
But then when you apply them to all of those photos 200 photos we get thousands to thousands of instances.

91
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:25,720
So all you have to do is get that into a file and then execute that file scroll back over and take too

92
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,330
long.

93
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,540
Oh boy almost there.

94
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,170
Here we go.

95
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,060
So execute this file and I'll just do that now.

96
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:43,630
With source Instagram slash starter data and that should just be the path that corresponds to wherever

97
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,050
that file is and whatever you've named it.

98
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,030
OK so it takes a little bit compared to what we've seen so far.

99
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,480
So if you take a look we've got you know a bunch of tables being created seven I think.

100
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,670
And then a bunch of things being inserted 100 257 seven thousand six hundred twenty three 7400 eighty

101
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:07,240
eight eight thousand seven hundred eighty two 21 and then 501.

102
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,690
So this is still a very small dataset compared to.

103
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,180
I mean tiny miniscule compared to Instagram.

104
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,350
This is maybe like a minute of Internet activity.

105
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,370
Probably less than that a couple of seconds.

106
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,660
As far as the number of photos and stuff but it's still an order of magnitude greater than what we've

107
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,130
been working with.

108
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:31,650
One other thing that I'll show you is that we haven't really seen giant amounts of data like this.

109
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:39,720
And if you try and do it to do a select star from likes which I think we have a lot of you actually

110
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:46,140
if you if you start to scroll through it you'll see that we're not going to be able to see all of them.

111
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:53,460
There is a number that we that the terminal or that the Seelye will print out for us and then it just

112
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,160
gives up or it decides not to display all of them.

113
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,910
That doesn't mean they're not there.

114
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,940
So if he did account for example

115
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,350
count star from like we get eight thousand.

116
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:12,970
And if you you know join them with another table it will join all of them it just won't display everything.

117
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,450
So for some reason you needed to display every single like it would be better not to do it using the

118
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,850
CSI but to do it from you know another file or some code somewhere.

119
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,080
Anyways so that's it we've got the data set up if you'd like.

120
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,440
Play around that explored a bit and then we'll start with our fun challenges in the next video.
