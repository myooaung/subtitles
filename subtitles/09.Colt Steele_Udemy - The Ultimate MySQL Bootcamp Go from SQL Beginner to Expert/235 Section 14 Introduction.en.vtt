Hey welcome I'd like to show a couple of things.

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.280
Here's a nice trick you can do that.

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.470
She's like a good T-Rex or something.

4
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.690
Great job.

5
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.090
That's the first thing.

6
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.360
But the second important news that I have here is that this section is the one where we finally do our

7
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.250
Instagram data or Finally cloning Instagram.

8
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.630
And that's actually an exaggeration we're only cloning the database.

9
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.770
And even then we're only doing like 7 or 8 tables not you know 20 or 50 Instagram tables but still we're

10
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.390
doing the basics the important stuff photos and comments and users and likes and follow you know follower

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.890
following relationships hashtags all that fun stuff all the relationships between them and then all

12
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.890
those joints.

13
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.690
There's a lot of opportunities there.

14
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.930
So this is sort of acting as a bit of a endcap on this.

15
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000
Of course it's not the end.

16
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.700
But this is the last kind of data set that we're working with and then I'm going to show you after this

17
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.090
how to build a web app with my Eskew well.

18
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.820
So that's also coming up which hopefully is exciting but this section like I said is all about Instagram

19
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.280
data.

20
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.980
Really exciting stuff.

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.950
You basically build the schema and then the next section is going to be a bunch of challenges and problems

22
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.430
with it.

23
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.280
OK let's get started.
