00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.160
Everyone welcome to the ultimate My ask you about developer boot camp.

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.310
I know it's a bit of a mouthful of a title.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.110
My name is Colt.

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.880
I'll be instructor for this course.

5
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.910
So in my experience the first couple of minutes of any course sometimes the first day of a college lecture

6
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.660
is all devoted to introducing the instructor talking about the syllabus and document th's and exercises

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.040
and turning in assignments.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.770
And you don't actually get to cover much of the content that you care about.

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.190
But this is in I ask you of course I want to talk about my school as soon as possible.

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.840
So here's a promise I'm going to make to you.

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.570
I'm going to talk about who I am and my background if you care about that.

12
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.960
Going to talk about what the Course covers and it doesn't cover.

13
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.110
I'll show you the projects and the assignments.

14
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.990
All of that fun stuff in just the next four minutes.

15
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.580
And then by the next five minutes by the fifth minute of this course we'll be typing secret code.

16
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.830
We won't have to install anything on it have to get set up.

17
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.700
We have this nice work around in the browser where you'll be able to actually run code immediately.

18
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.420
OK so that's what i to you.

19
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.010
With that said I'll shut up.

20
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.030
I'll start talking about myself and who I am in the next video and then we'll move on at the syllabus

21
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.710
and so on.

22
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.640
But remember end of this section will be typed in code.

23
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.270
All right let's get started.
