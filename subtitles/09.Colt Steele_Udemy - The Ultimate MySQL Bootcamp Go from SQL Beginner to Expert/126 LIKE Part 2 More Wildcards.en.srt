1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,040
So that's the basics.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,660
But there's another wildcard character that I'll show you which is the underscore.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,250
So here I have a really weird query.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,660
This is for underscores in a row they will have to trust me that it's four.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,070
And it was hard to tell what this will do.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,690
So we're searching stock quantity which is a number and we're trying to find where it's like for underscores

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:31,380
and basically an underscore is a wildcard to specify exactly one character any character but exactly

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:31,870
one.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,510
So four of them in a row is saying I want to find where the stock quantity is for characters long.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,110
So let me show you why we might want to do that.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:50,390
Why do a select stock title and stock quantity from books just like that.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:58,000
You can see that we have Star quantity of to her sorry two digit two tickets 32 43 three.

13
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,190
She is giving me a tough time.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,520
Digits 154.

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:09,450
And then this great book linking in the bardo has a thousand copies in stock is brand new.

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,860
People don't know about it yet.

17
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,730
They're not buying it.

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,140
I'm sure people will buy it soon though.

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,400
Once Of course they they realize what a great book it is.

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:23,190
So if I wanted to select books where stock quantity is four digits long I could use that wild card.

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,490
So let me just say that again.

22
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:32,190
So select title and stock only from books where stock on or the like.

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:39,580
And all I have to do so just to clarify if I did this that wild card just means anything.

24
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,810
So that's going to give us everything.

25
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,330
And if I do four of them it doesn't make a difference.

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,230
That's not saying four characters.

27
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,060
That's just four different ways of saying anything at all.

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,190
It could be nothing.

29
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,550
It could be a thousand characters it doesn't matter.

30
00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:03,660
So by adding underscores that's for there you'll see I get Lincoln in the bardo or I could do two underscores

31
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,980
and I only get the two digit stock quantities.

32
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,250
Now that's not to say the only time you use underscores is when you're trying.

33
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,690
Yes.

34
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,630
Blue is my cat.

35
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,230
Are you going to say hi.

36
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,520
She's now sitting on the computer.

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,520
OK.

38
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,620
So back to where I was.

39
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,450
Get this cat hair out of here.

40
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:29,920
The underscore is not only used and actually it's not even primarily used for counting digits like that

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,480
but it's a way of specifying exactly one character.

42
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,460
Like I said Let's say that we're working with phone numbers and in the US they might look something

43
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,630
like this.

44
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,120
So we have an area code in parentheses and then three digits dash four digits.

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,900
And if we wanted to match that pattern we would have something that looks like this like and we'd have

46
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,020
a first print to see and if we just put this wildcard there that's going to say any number any letters

47
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:04,590
whatever it is in between those parentheses but we're actually looking for three digits and then another

48
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,280
three digits after that parentheses.

49
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,380
Then a dash and then four digits.

50
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,750
So basically we have these two wild cards at the end of the day present sign which means anything or

51
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,580
nothing.

52
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,530
And then underscore which is exactly one thing.

53
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,500
And you can chain them together to match patterns then that brings up another question which is but

54
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,290
what if I'm searching for a book that has a percent sign in it.

55
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,140
How would I do that.

56
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:39,030
And you may have noticed that I expertly planted a book title with the percent sign and I was thinking

57
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,010
ahead for once.

58
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,180
How would we select that.

59
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,730
Or there's also a book title that it's not so creative It has an underscore in it.

60
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,110
How would I select that one.

61
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:56,910
If these characters are special wildcard characters how do I actually search for the exact character

62
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,010
percent side or the exact character underscore.

63
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,440
And the answer is actually pretty straightforward.

64
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,230
We use what's known as an escape character.

65
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,250
In this case I always forget which one is backwards and forwards slash but whichever slash This is the

66
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,860
one over the turkey.

67
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:23,300
Pretty sure that his backslash so backslash percent signed is going to match a percent sign.

68
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,830
So this entire thing right here is basically saying percent sign.

69
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,510
Likewise with underscores backslash underscore is the escape character.

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,710
So let's put that into practice.

71
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,650
Let's try it out.

72
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:44,430
So a select title from books and we'll just do that first all and you'll see we've got 10 percent happier

73
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,110
and then fake under scorebook.

74
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,830
So let's start with 10 percent happier.

75
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:56,220
So I want to select title from books from books where title like and just I mean this should be clear

76
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,480
right now.

77
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,490
But if we tried to do this that's not going to work that's going to give us everything.

78
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,770
But if I tried to say okay percent signed that means anything and then a percent signed and then anything

79
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,090
afterwards that's not going to work either because that's basically just three different ways of saying

80
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,890
anything at all in the title.

81
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,040
So that's where we need our backslash.

82
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:24,000
Now you could read this as you could condense this to say exactly a percent sign 1 percentage sign anything

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,870
before anything after.

84
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,200
And there we go.

85
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,210
That's how we get 10 percent happier.

86
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,540
Same thing with the underscore.

87
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,630
I won't go through that whole routine again.

88
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,950
We just replaced that backslash present with backslash underscore and that gives us fake book.

89
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,540
All right.

90
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,480
So that's all there is to like for now.

91
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,080
It's very very useful.

92
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,090
We'll be using it quite a bit in this course.

93
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,100
It's probably one the most commonly used things in my school are in school when doing queries.

94
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,970
In all likelihood you won't be matching percent signs or underscores all that often but you'll be doing

95
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:06,390
things like this all the time where you're using the percent wildcard and the underscore wildcard to

96
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,460
match patterns.

97
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,300
OK.

98
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,600
Next up exercise is.
