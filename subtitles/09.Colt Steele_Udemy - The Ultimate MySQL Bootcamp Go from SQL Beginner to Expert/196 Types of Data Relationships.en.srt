1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,620
OK so we've established that in real life data can be crazy complex outside the classroom.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,180
Things aren't as nice as we'd like them to be.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,190
So we've established that fact but now where do we start to kind of wrap her head around how we represent

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,710
complex data using my queue up.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,220
And the answer is we're going to start talking about the relationship basics.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,700
So I know it sounds like you know marriage counseling 101 or something but this is not that it's not

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,390
that this is about the different ways that data can be related.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,500
So if we have two tables or two entities things like mortars and customers and students and teachers

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,420
movies and reviews and users how how are they related.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,590
And there's a couple of different ways there's that kind of these big broad categories we can break

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,350
relationships down into and the terms that I'm going to use that you'll occasionally come across are

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:52,850
three.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,570
There's a first one which is a one to one relationship and it's going to go through all of them first

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,370
before we talk about what they mean.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,600
And you talk about examples.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:08,840
So one to one relationship a one to many relationship and then a many to many relationship.

17
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,970
So the reality is that one to one relationships aren't actually that common but perhaps another example

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:22,720
or one that I've recently used is had a Customers table that had the basic information for a customer.

19
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,800
So things like the username and password although again you don't actually store the password directly

20
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,290
but your name and password and email and the registration date.

21
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,010
And then there was a separate table where we stored all these details about our customer.

22
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,840
So rather than storing 10 or 20 extra columns on the basic customer table we decided to split it up

23
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,980
based off of what was most commonly needed in the app we were building.

24
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,410
And most commonly All we needed was a user name and the password and the email but there was a whole

25
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,240
bunch of other information that we were storing.

26
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,550
So we created a customer details table.

27
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,520
And that's a one to one relationship.

28
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:06,840
One customer has their own row one row in the customer details table and one customer details row is

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,050
associated with one customer.

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,490
So cold still has a cold steel customer details but there is no other user or customer that could be

31
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,010
associated with it because it's a one to one relationship anyway so I guess that is not the most common

32
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,770
what is the most common is actually a one to many relationship and that's what we'll spend the most

33
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,110
time on in this course because like I said it's really common.

34
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,480
So here's an example the relationship between books and reviews.

35
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,540
One book can have thousands of reviews right.

36
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,610
Let's say into thin air by Jon Krakauer could have probably tens of thousands of reviews by this point.

37
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,460
Been out for a while.

38
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:54,540
It's pretty popular but those reviews belong to that book exclusively to one book.

39
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:05,200
So the relationship is books have many reviews but reviews belong to one book so it's a one to many.

40
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,880
So that's a really common classic example.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,940
Reviews are ratings and books are some entity.

42
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,970
OK.

43
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:20,510
So then the next thing that we'll discuss here is a many to many relationship and many to many is still

44
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,710
relatively common in the way that it works.

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:30,650
So what it sounds like we have two entities in this case books and authors and you kind of speak through

46
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:30,760
it.

47
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,430
You could say OK books can have many authors.

48
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,440
That's true.

49
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,990
We could have two authors writing a book together and those authors can have many books.

50
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,720
There's no rule that says authors get know can only write one book.

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:51,050
You know J.K. Rowling rambling However you say that as ten plus books so it's a two way many to many

52
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,800
relationship.

53
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:57,660
So hopefully you can see the difference to their reviews in books reviews belong to one book.

54
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,090
They're associated only with one book whatever the book title is for that review.

55
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,700
It can also be the same review associated for another book.

56
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,170
So that part of the relationship is one.

57
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:09,710
Right.

58
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:15,350
And then we have the books to reviews which is a many relationship books have many reviews.

59
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,900
This is different because books can have multiple authors and authors can be long to multiple books

60
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,520
or authors can have multiple books.

61
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,270
And the way that we represent this is actually a little more complex.

62
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,980
So we're going to come back to it.

63
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,740
We're going to start off in this section by talking about the most common relationship and how we represent

64
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,910
that which is the one to many relationship.

65
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,920
So that's coming up next.
