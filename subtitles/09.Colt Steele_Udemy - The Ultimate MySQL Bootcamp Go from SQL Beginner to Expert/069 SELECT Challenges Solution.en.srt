1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,760
So let's see the answers here.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,910
Feel free to skip forward if you feel like you got them right.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,220
So the first one write the sequel that selects the following.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,340
We only want the cat ladies but we want all of the results.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,420
All the cats so that will be.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,360
Select cat ID from cats.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,620
So we want all cats but only the cat Id returned.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,550
And that's what we get.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,070
Next up write the sequel query that selects the following name and breed for all cats.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:38,120
So it's similar to the last one except we want name and breed from all cats.

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,150
There we go.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,550
Name and breed.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,810
OK so let's talk about the solution to this one here.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,710
We need to use both these select expression and the WHERE clause we want to select name and age from

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,250
cats where breed equals tabby.

16
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,640
So let's do that.

17
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:05,320
Select name Khama age from cats where breed equals tabby.

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,950
Just like that.

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:13,280
And we get Ringo who's four and Misty who is 13 and that's exactly what we wanted to see.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,970
Now the final one is a little trickier as I mentioned we didn't know exactly how to do this but hopefully

21
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:25,730
you were able to figure it out because it's exactly the same syntax but we're just checking slightly

22
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,060
different.

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,200
Where clause.

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,520
So we'll start with the first part.

25
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:39,770
We want to select cat ID and age so that's a select cat ID comma age from cats where and we want where

26
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,150
cat ID is the same as age.

27
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:50,750
So we've been doing things like where age equals to or we could do were cat ID equals one but we can

28
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,250
also just do or cat D equals age because we're both going to be numbers.

29
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:00,050
And my sequel I'm sorry my as well is smart enough to figure that out.

30
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:06,890
So it's going to compare cat idea and age and see where they're equal as you can see we get what we

31
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,350
want.

32
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,060
Cat ID and age and they're equal.

33
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,060
So let's go back and revise this a bit and do a show like Star

34
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,680
just so you can see exactly what we're working with.

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,420
We have egg in Jackson.

36
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,480
We're ages for ideas for ages seven and idea seven.

37
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,380
OK.

38
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:33,910
So in addition to having some practice there we also learned that you can compare columns and the values

39
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,680
rather than just picking at an exact value like four or 10.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,790
We can compare two different columns and select based off of when they're equal to another.

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,420
All right.
