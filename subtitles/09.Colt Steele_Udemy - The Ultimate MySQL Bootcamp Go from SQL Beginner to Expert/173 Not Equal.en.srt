1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,180
So in this section we're going to focus on what are called logical operators.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,530
Actually we're focusing on operators in general and most of the ones we're going to work with are logical

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,660
operators that distinction doesn't really matter though.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,770
I'm just going to call them all logical operators and they allow us to add logic into our sequence statements.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,760
So up until this point we've seen things like well like what.

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,810
Which allows us to select things based off of you know text looking or containing certain strings matching

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,890
patterns.

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,590
We've seen how to do things where we can check you know select all books where the title is exact the

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,750
Lincoln and the Bardo or where a released year is exactly 2013.

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,940
But there's a whole slew of other things that we'd like to be able to select based off of.

11
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,330
And that's what we're going to focus on in this section.

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,050
So we're going to see how to do things like select all books not published in 2017.

13
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,150
Right now we don't have a way of doing that.

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,880
Or what about select all birthdays between two different dates.

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,510
So not just all birthdays that are exactly you know April 22nd 1990 or 1992 or whatever it is.

16
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:24,370
But between those two dates or select all items so this is some table I made up called items all items

17
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,310
that are in stock and price below 1999.

18
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,800
So that's two different things.

19
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,090
We know how to select all items that are in stock.

20
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,360
But there's a second component which is not only the need to be in stock but they need to be priced

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,910
below 1999.

22
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,720
And right now we don't know how to do that either.

23
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,730
With that lengthy introduction out of the way let's take a look at some of our first ones.

24
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,850
So the actual first one we're going to look at is called not equal.

25
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,080
And it looks like this exclamation point and an equal sign.

26
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,170
So we've seen hundreds of things using equal sign.

27
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,480
Right.

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:09,220
We've done you know select let's do title released here from books where Let's do release year so we're

29
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,890
released here is exactly 2017.

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,710
So we've seen how to do this you know with equal sign.

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,250
We've been doing it all the time.

32
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,610
However what if I want to do the opposite.

33
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,340
I want all books that were released in any year excluding 2017.

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,470
So what we want to do is basically replace that equal sign with a not equals.

35
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,820
So we could do that.

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,720
So like title from books where a year is not equal to 2017 if you're familiar with any programming languages

37
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,630
you've probably come across this not equals.

38
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,920
It's a pretty universal way of writing not equals.

39
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,690
So let's give it a shot.

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,500
Recall this and just replace it with not equals.

41
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:01,610
And now you can hopefully see that we get everything back except for Lincoln and the bardo.

42
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,430
And of course if there is more than one book released in 2017 then we would get any book back or all

43
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,970
books back except that those books from 2017 so we can see that it's gone.

44
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:21,080
We could do the same thing but instead of working with this year what if we do it with author.

45
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,030
So let me just start over here.

46
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:32,310
Let's select the title and author last name from books and we'll start just with all of them.

47
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:41,560
And then let's select where author last name is exactly equal to Harris.

48
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:54,010
So we have two Harris's where author name equals Harris just like that and we get those too.

49
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,170
And by just flipping the switch here.

50
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,870
That exclamation point we now get everything except those two.

51
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,590
OK.

52
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,140
So hopefully you get the point by now.

53
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,440
Not equals works like you would expect if you're not familiar with the exclamation point.

54
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,340
It might take a little bit of getting used to but otherwise it's pretty straightforward.

55
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,890
It's the opposite of equals awesome.

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,050
So that's the first one that we're taking a look at but we have quite a few more.

57
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,090
Next up we're going to talk about something very similar which is not like.
