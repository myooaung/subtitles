1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,980
So we saw not equals which is the opposite of the equal sign.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,820
Now we're going to look at.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,030
Not like.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,210
And as you probably guessed not like is the opposite of like.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,520
So just to review.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,360
We haven't used like all that much but it is pretty common.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,650
An important one.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:25,890
It allows us to match patterns in strings usually so we can do things like select let's do all titles

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:36,410
and we'll just do title from books where title like and we can do things like.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,480
Start off.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,050
How about all books that contain How about books that start with the letter W.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,200
Just like that.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,650
And if we just do w on it's own Remember that doesn't really give us anything unless it's an exact match.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,230
If the letter W. but we use the percent sign there as a placeholder.

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,600
And now this says all books at start with the letter W and anything afterwards.

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,740
Or we could expand that to be any title that has a letter W..

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,580
OK so that's it for review.

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,240
That's how like works we match these patterns.

19
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,630
Anything that matches this pattern where these are placeholders that present signs mean anything goes

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,680
there anything that matches this will be returned.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,280
So all of these contain a W somewhere.

22
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,140
All right.

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,590
So that brings us to not like which as you have probably surmised by now it will do the opposite.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,730
So here's an example.

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,620
Select all books with titles that don't start with the letter W..

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,260
So rather than the exclamation point equals like we had four not equals.

27
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,280
We just use the word not space like.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,560
And then in this case w present sign means something that has a W and then anything after that and then

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,070
we're negating that with not so.

30
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,450
This in effect says it's like all the book titles that don't start with the letter W..

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,060
So if we go back.

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,860
Recall this which gives us these.

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,060
Well actually then we get rid of the percent sign at the beginning.

34
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,410
These are the three books that start with a W what we talked about when we talk about love.

35
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,200
Where I'm calling from.

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,230
And white noise.

37
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:23,730
And if we go and just add an OT now we get all book titles excluding these three.

38
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,400
All right so that's it for not like.

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,160
Hopefully you like that rather than not liked it I guess.

40
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:32,780
All right.

41
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,850
Well let's just move on.
