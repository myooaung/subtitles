1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,530
I'll write to you then.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,690
Welcome back everyone.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,970
In this section we're kind of continuing with the trend of focusing on selecting our data on reading

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,180
it if we're going back to crud in the last section.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,030
We saw things like sorting with order by using limit and so on.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,770
In this section we're going to focus on what are called aggregate functions.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,490
And basically these are built in functions in my.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,380
Well that will allow us to aggregate or combine data to get meaning out of it.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,020
So by the end we'll be able to do things like find the average page link of all of our books or find

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,860
the average page length for each author.

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:46,590
So you know let's say we'd be able to tell that someone like Carver who writes short stories maybe has

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,810
shorter books compared to David Foster Wallace and that's just average but we'll see how to do other

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,740
things like count some men max and a bunch of others.

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,030
And they're known as aggregate functions because they work on aggregated data.

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,350
So yeah let's get started.

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,480
It's time to learn some more stuff and it will definitely 100 percent be the most fun thing that you've

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,340
ever done.

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,970
Let's get going.

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,840
The first thing we're going to take a look at the first one of these aggregate functions is called count.

20
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,330
And it does pretty much what you would expect at least in the way that I'm going to show it to you.

21
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,000
Now we're going to revisit count in the next video when we introduce what's called Group By.

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,170
But for now we're just focusing on count on its own.

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,300
And what it will do is count whatever you tell it to count.

24
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,160
So here's an example.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,230
How many books are in our database.

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:40,260
If we want to do that right now you could do a select start from books and manually count which technically

27
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,520
would mean that would work.

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:49,200
But if we have you know Amazon's database that has millions of books that would be a lot of work that

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,830
would take at least a couple of thousand Mechanical Turk to do so.

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,270
That's not ideal.

31
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,310
Instead we can use count and it just looks like this.

32
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,910
Select count star from books.

33
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,930
So let's try it and then we'll discuss it a bit more.

34
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,480
So here I am.

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:16,470
I'm using the same database just double checking bookshop so we can do a select star from books.

36
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:23,100
And like I said we could go through an account and you can just rely on the IDs of course because we

37
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,410
could have deleted some.

38
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,040
So just that the highest number of the ID is not a reliable way of knowing how many books are in there.

39
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,580
Because when you delete something those IDs don't change they don't shift down.

40
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:43,230
So instead we do a select count and we'll put start here which basically will count every row the entire

41
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,460
row so select count star from books and we get 19.

42
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,120
So that tells us there are 19 books and we could verify that.

43
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:03,820
You know let me just speed this up as I count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19.

44
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,850
All right so there were 19 books so we can trust this count.

45
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,530
That's right and that's one way of using counters to check how many things are in table in general a

46
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,680
more specific way of using it would be to do something like this.

47
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,350
How many author first names are in our database and it's not 19 we know that now.

48
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:31,110
Because if we do a select author name from books you know we have some authors who are in here multiple

49
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,170
times Neal game and it's in there twice.

50
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,090
So it's going to count them twice.

51
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,330
It's just going to count everything here.

52
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,320
So if we did this select count author name from books is it really going to be correct.

53
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,820
And the answer is no as I just said.

54
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,970
But let's just try it.

55
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:54,260
It's like the Count of author L name from books or we're doing actually FNMA or.

56
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:00,770
And it tells us there are 19 author names and that's technically true there are 19 f names in here.

57
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,590
I want to know how many unique first names are in there.

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,430
Unfortunately there's a way of doing that and it relies on distinct which we've already seen.

59
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,830
So we just put distinct inside if that counts.

60
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,180
So select count distinct author F. name from books.

61
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,070
Let's try it.

62
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:32,290
Select count distinct author F. name from books and now it tells us 12 and I won't make you sit through

63
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,080
me counting it.

64
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,760
But there are indeed 12 first names that we have in our database.

65
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,690
So instead of 19 it's now decided.

66
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,170
OK.

67
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,000
There's only one here and there's one here and there's one here.

68
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,820
So that's the basics of using count along with using count with distinct.

69
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,490
Now I do want to show you a bit of an edge case here.

70
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,060
Let's say I want to know how many unique authors are in my database.

71
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,170
So that means first name and last name.

72
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:09,180
So if we do our select count and let's just you author last name first from books.

73
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,260
We get 19 as you would expect there's 19 rows.

74
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,530
Every row has a last name.

75
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:23,980
But we know that there are some duplicated last names and if we just look at those just do this very

76
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,390
quickly it's the same problem that we had a first name right.

77
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:39,260
We had Foster Wallace Dave Eggers and we have Geymann So if we use that distinct select account distinct

78
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,310
last names maybe you can see where I'm going here.

79
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,080
I hit enter.

80
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,610
It tells us there's 11 distinct last names which is true.

81
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:59,030
There are 11 distinct last names but that doesn't mean there are 11 distinct authors because if we go

82
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,280
and do a select author f name comma author L name.

83
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,550
So if we look at both first name and last name from books remember that we have Dan Harris and Frieda

84
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,600
Harris.

85
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,430
So when we're selecting distinct last names it treats this as the same because Harris is the same as

86
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,430
Harris.

87
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:23,420
So if we wanted to know how many distinct authors were in there what we could do is to author L name

88
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:31,610
comma author name and now it's only going to return distinct roads where first name and last name or

89
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:39,940
last name and first name are distinct and that gives us 12 which in our case is the same as just doing

90
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:47,680
this right here as we just saw if we only to author FNM but that's because we don't have any duplicated

91
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
names or any duplicated first names in there.

92
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,510
We have David Foster Wallace but we don't have I don't know David Johnson or something.

93
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,550
So this would be problematic if we had multiple Davids.

94
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,110
So then we could use this where we're doing distinct author I'll name an author name together and the

95
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,980
last thing we'll do is this question here.

96
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,250
How many titles contain the string.

97
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,580
The Th.

98
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,460
So if you'd like to make this a little bit of a mini exercise go ahead and try it.

99
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,080
How many titles contain the in the title.

100
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:26,670
How many books title contains the up and the answer is that we need to use like alongside with count.

101
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,290
So let's do it now.

102
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:37,720
We're going to do a select and let's just start by selecting the book's title from books where the title

103
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,350
like.

104
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,790
And then this is where we need those wild cards.

105
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,320
Th e we need a wildcard on either side.

106
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,780
All right and here we go.

107
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,970
The Namesake the king circle the amazing the lobster the bardo.

108
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,250
Great book by the way.

109
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,520
So there are six of them here right.

110
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,290
Yes.

111
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:09,130
So if we wanted to do that with our code dynamically not by counting ourselves you just replace that

112
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,740
with a count.

113
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,400
So let's count from books retitle is like the.

114
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,770
And it tells us there are six.

115
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,080
All right.

116
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,950
So I just want to show you you can combine it just like you can with any other of the things that we've

117
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,790
seen to you know substring or concat or upper.

118
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,080
They work the same way.

119
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,280
In this case we're just selecting count.

120
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,390
All right so that's count.

121
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,900
Next up we're going to go a little bit off the rails and talk about something called group by Brace

122
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,720
yourself.

123
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,420
It's it's refreshing.

124
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,300
Let's put it that way.
