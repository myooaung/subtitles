1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:00,820
All right.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,290
So I have some good news which is that in the next video we're going to start typing code.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,770
I'm going to start with sequel.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,450
The bad news is that we still have to make it through this video.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,760
Hopefully it's not too painful.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,020
Essentially what I want to talk about is different types of content in the course in how the course

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,190
really works.

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,740
It might be a little different than other courses you've taken online depending on how they were structured.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,410
Basically I break the content into a couple of different categories.

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,440
The first are things like this video where it's a video of me talking usually with Lou and you know

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,320
what you don't have to watch them to kind of just serve to introduce content.

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,310
It's a way for me to kind of interact with you to say hello and to set the stage for what comes next.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,700
And if you're someone who has no patience for that sort of thing.

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,260
Absolutely skip it.

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,530
So then after that we've got the actual content of the course the lectures.

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,730
So there are a ton of videos where it's mostly screen cast and I'm explaining concepts.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,820
I usually make a bunch of diagrams slides I try and make things somewhat visually interesting.

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,070
I'm not a great graphic designer but in trying to keep things interesting to look at and then I also

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,230
you know type code and there's a lot to watch there ideally.

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,770
So it's a combination of slides with me talking over it as well as diagram for animations.

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,550
And then most of the time typing code in our text editors and running sequel code.

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,910
So those are the lecture videos but then we've also got.

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:27,020
And this is probably the most important part more so even than the lectures which are the exercises.

24
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,260
So one of the things that I think makes my courses stand out a bit.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,520
Some of the feedback I've gotten has to do with exercises and activities and I think the really really

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,930
central to making a good course.

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,270
So I kind of throw them everywhere in the course and then within those exercises we've got a couple

28
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,480
of different categories of challenges.

29
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,700
The first are what I call rapid fire basically paused the video.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll ask you a question very short quiz type questions and then there are the second type of exercises

31
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,170
which usually come at the end of a section.

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,800
The last video typically And it's an entire video dedicated to exercises.

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,710
Usually there's like five to 10 challenges in that video and then following that there's always a solution

34
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,950
video where I go over the solutions.

35
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,740
Tell you the answer and then also show you myself coding them.

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,360
And there's always the solution code is available if you don't care to see me explain it.

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,870
If you just want the code you can get that at any time.

38
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,850
And the final type of challenge is more comprehensive.

39
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,960
It's essentially there are a couple of sections that are entirely devoted to exercises so they might

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,770
have seven or 10 different videos but they're all about one set of problems.

41
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,840
So there's not many of these in the course that take a while but there are a couple of these challenge

42
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,550
sections.

43
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,620
So just to reiterate we got quick rapid fire questions.

44
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,670
We've got more general kind of summation quizzes and exercises at the end of a section.

45
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,330
And then we've got an entire challenge sections.

46
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,880
And of course after every lecture I include the code of the commands that I type there in a file that

47
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,560
always comes after the lecture.

48
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,780
And it always starts with the word code in all capital letters.

49
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,200
So the last thing I'd like to add is a piece of advice I guess which is that I highly recommend you

50
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,400
do the challenges and do these exercises.

51
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,040
Obviously I have no control over that.

52
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,440
You can just skip through everything and just take the pieces.

53
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,450
Of course you need.

54
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,920
But if you're trying to get the full experience kind of the way that I designed it I would do all the

55
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,050
exercises do the challenges even if that means you know going at a slower pace.

56
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,430
It definitely means you'll go at a slower pace but you'll learn much better and hopefully you'll have

57
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,600
a better experience.

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,370
And with that said the other component that's really important are the discussion forums.

59
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,020
We've a full time team in the course as well as myself who are here to help you at any point.

60
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,640
So absolutely lean on that.

61
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,410
Ask any questions you can come up with.

62
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,730
We're here to help.

63
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,280
All right on to the code in the next section.
