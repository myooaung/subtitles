1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,380
So the next couple of videos are all about tables which are the most important part of sequel.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,390
They are the true heart of using sequel and in this first video we'll start off by setting the stage

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:19,080
or setting the table if you will let me get away with that for how they work what they are and then

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,360
we'll dive into data types next and then will actually create tables and see the code that you use to

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,330
create them.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,470
So let's get started.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,400
The first thing you should know is that a database is just a bunch of tables.

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,450
So we've already created a couple of empty databases and deleted them as well.

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,530
But what goes in them are just a bunch of tables.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,400
That's where the data is stored as a short aside.

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:50,250
This is in a relational database So everything we're talking about uses sequel things like my Escudo

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,760
postscripts sequel like those are relational databases and they use tables they use tabular data but

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,120
not every single database in the world does.

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,040
And we'll see some examples of those later on this course is not about those types of databases but

15
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,970
it helps to kind of bring them in to show you some contrast to what you're learning.

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,490
So we'll see that later on.

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,440
Just a short caveat there.

18
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,930
So tables hold the data.

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,080
That's my definition if you want the boring Wikipedia definition.

20
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,410
It looks like this.

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,310
Tables are a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database.

22
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,110
Hopefully you're still awake after that.

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,680
But let's take a quick example using CAS.

24
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,790
So we're going to model some cat data using a table.

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,660
OK.

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,760
So let's take a quick look at the cats table.

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,430
Drum roll please.

28
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,070
That or die.

29
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,730
I know it's pretty hilarious.

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,030
You're probably falling out of your chair.

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:49,950
All right.

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,200
So the real cats table at least in this context doesn't have an apostrophe.

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,680
Look something like this.

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,530
And of course there's a million different ways we could break down the data for cat for modeling cats.

35
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,730
In my case I just went with a name breed and age.

36
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:16,060
So we could do plenty of other things like location gender is spayed is neutered that sort of thing.

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,630
But just doing name breed and age.

38
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,530
So I've put a couple of cats in here.

39
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,540
We've got flu.

40
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,560
Who's this Scottish Fold who's one year old.

41
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,670
That's my cat.

42
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,110
I've got rocket who is a Persian who's three years old.

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,200
Totally made up Monte who is a tabby who is 10 years old.

44
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,380
That is my childhood cat.

45
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,050
He's still kicking and biting people.

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,720
We've got Sam who is a munchkin.

47
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,470
If you don't know what that breed is look them up they're pretty hilarious.

48
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,940
Although Pender's said they have really stubby legs who is five years old also made that cat.

49
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:59,280
So some terminology when we're talking about tables and you hear the term columns it's referring to

50
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,230
the headers on that table.

51
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,380
So what are the different components of data the different pieces that have to be there.

52
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,840
In our case we have name breed and age.

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,870
So those are the columns and then the rows are the actual data in the table.

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,440
So here a row.

55
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,290
Blue Cat is one row rocket is another row Monte is another row Sam.

56
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,430
It's another row.

57
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,480
I really wish those lined up correctly but I just drove myself nuts trying to get it to work.

58
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,940
Please forgive me.

59
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,480
Anyways so databases are made up of lots and lots of these tables.

60
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,380
It's usually not just one.

61
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:42,640
And if you have a really really simple app and you're just storing one thing then it will just be one

62
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,430
but usually apps are pretty complicated and data is complicated.

63
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,180
All that we modeled there was cat.

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,890
But imagine if this was actually an app let's say it was a pet sitting app and cats were one thing that

65
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,890
we had to keep track of.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,720
But we also have to keep track of owners and the pet sitters and addresses and dates and appointments

67
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,630
and payments and those are all going to be tables.

68
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,090
Some of them might even even be multiple tables.

69
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,120
But for now we're not going to really worry too much about that.

70
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,550
But just to show you sometimes it does get crazy you can click this link or I'll click it follow my

71
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:25,960
own instructions to see the breakdown of some of the tables that Facebook's database or a social network

72
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,570
might use in their database.

73
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,670
So this is not actual.

74
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,310
It's not 100 percent accurate.

75
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,750
There are things that are missing or incomplete but this just shows all the different tables or at least

76
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,170
some of the different tables involved in a pretty complex app.

77
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,700
So as you can see there is a bunch of them here.

78
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:51,620
Things like accounts and events and message notification Web site screen name address blah blah blah

79
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,100
all these different things to take into consideration.

80
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,640
So things can get messy.

81
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,440
And as you progress in this course you will start working with multiple tables you'll see how they connect.

82
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,070
But we haven't even seen how to create a single table yet.

83
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,170
So we're going to focus just on individual tables and then we'll move on from there.
