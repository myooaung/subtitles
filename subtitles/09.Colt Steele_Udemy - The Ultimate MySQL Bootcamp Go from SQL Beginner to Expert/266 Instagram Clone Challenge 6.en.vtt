00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.520
OK so next up you know suppose get in the brains of our Instagram clone application employees and we

2
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:15.810
make money by having sponsored content by having advertisers post things on our app and they want to

3
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.120
know what hashtags they should use and which are most popular at any given point.

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.290
So what we want to do is just find the five most commonly used hashtags so we can tell our advertisers

5
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.710
these are the hashtags you should use on your own stuff because they're trending right now.

6
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.450
So people are looking for so to do it it's pretty straightforward.

7
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.670
We have a single join.

8
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.070
We're basically going to connect hashtags or tags with photo tags.

9
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.440
Remember we have two tables that one table is just the name of the tag and the other table is every

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.870
time the tag is used and applied to a photo.

11
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.800
So we want to count basically we a group of those photo tags together count them but then we want to

12
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.930
find the associated name of the tag.

13
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:08.580
So let's start that will do six most popular hashtags five most popular hashtags.

14
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.350
So if we start with just selecting star tags as we've seen before it's just a list of the hashtags themselves.

15
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.010
And then well NRD hash tag name and then created it.

16
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.140
But we've also got photo underscore tags and we've got a bunch of those 500 and each one is just a hash

17
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.990
tag or a tag ID and then a photo ID that it's being applied to see if we can get to the top here.

18
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.530
Here we go.

19
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.540
So the photo ID photo I.D. 14 is being tagged with whatever hash tag I.D. one wishes sunset.

20
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.130
So photo 14 has a tag sunset.

21
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.630
So what we want to do is we can start if we want and by just focusing on these and counting how many

22
00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.470
times each tag was used but it makes it a little easier to follow if we join tags.

23
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.520
So we have a name of the tag as well.

24
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.810
So we'll do that.

25
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:12.910
We'll do select star from photo tags and then we'll do join tags.

26
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.180
Get rid of the other stuff here on photo tags dot tag ID.

27
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:30.470
So is this where this tag I.D. equals tags dot I.D. So now we see there's a lot of stuff five hundred

28
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.850
rows if we go up to the top we can either already being grouped roughly.

29
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.630
Not exactly but they're being grouped roughly by the tag name.

30
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.590
So we've got you know 14 was tagged with sunset 21 or Taghreed sunset 40 or 45 was tagged to sunset

31
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.320
and so on.

32
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.470
So then what we want to do is basically collapse them using group by.

33
00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.500
And we could use a tag name to collapse them but we could also use the tag ID which is easier because

34
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.780
it's just a simple integer rather than having to work with strings and text.

35
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.940
So we'll do the tag that ID.

36
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.030
So that group by tags that Id Now we do this.

37
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.360
We're getting closer.

38
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.800
Now we only have 21 because they've been grouped together.

39
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:31.290
Then finally rather than selecting star let's select the tag tags that tag name comma.

40
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.870
Do these on separate lines.

41
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.640
We want the count Star

42
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.690
OK so we can see things like sunset was used 19 times photography 16 times sunrise 17 times.

43
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:57.770
Then we'll go and give an alias as well just call it as well to get total.

44
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.680
Next up we want to find the maximum.

45
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.540
So you could use max but would be better.

46
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.490
But I'm going to do is just use ORDER BY and limit because we want the five most popular so actually

47
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.040
you couldn't use Max because we want 5.

48
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.770
So we'll do order by what are we ordering by this count here which we called Total Order by total.

49
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.450
And if we do that it will be in in ascending order.

50
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.260
So we want to change that.

51
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.350
And then we want to limit it to 5 and that should do the trick.

52
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.550
And there we go.

53
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.460
We see that the top five tagged right now number one by far is smile.

54
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.670
Apparently it's very popular and we've got beach at 42 party thirty nine fun and EHLO well.

55
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.420
And I know for you know smile and beach are kind of engineered to be there because when I was making

56
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.180
the data I wanted some hash tags that could be used in multiple contexts and things like you know Beach

57
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.930
could be used in landscape photography shot alongside sunrise or sunset or landscape but it can also

58
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.970
be used like in a model photography shot alongside model beautiful.

59
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.900
It could be used in a party you know alongside a party hash tag if it was a beach party.

60
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.180
Smile can be used in a lot of ways.

61
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.180
So can party.

62
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.220
So anyways I tried to come up with certain tags that could be used in different ways.

63
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.120
And there we go.

64
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.520
Those are our top five hashtags at the moment.

65
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.190
Next up you guessed it something else.
