1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,080
All right.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,480
So I know you've been dying in suspense waiting to see how you use min and max in conjunction with goodbye.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,080
Well it's finally time.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,490
So the way we do it is really similar.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,930
It's basically identical to how we did count when we use that along with GROUP BY.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,980
So let's take an example problem.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,750
First something like this find the year that each author published their first book so we want something

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:32,950
like Raymond Carver and his that I don't actually know this but let's say that in our database his first

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:39,030
book was published in sometime in the 80s I believe 1980 one let's say.

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:45,910
And we do the same thing for let's say David Foster Wallace in his first book in our database was published

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,260
in 1999 or whatever it is.

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,170
Don't quote me please.

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,540
And so to do that.

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:01:00,520
Basically what we're doing is finding the minimum release year but we can't just do this right where

15
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:12,080
we do a select men released year from books because that only gives us the absolute minimum we want

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,070
a group.

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:21,100
All of our books by author so unique author and then find the minimum release year for each one of those.

18
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,640
So we need to use GROUP BY MEN.

19
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,270
And it looks like this.

20
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:33,040
And yes I know this looks kind of long as this emoji tells you it might be a little confusing.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,310
Basically let's focus on the important parts first which is this right here.

22
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,320
And then the group by statement.

23
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,580
Now remember when we do a group by I'm doing author L name Khama author name because we have two authors

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,910
who have the same last name.

25
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,590
And so I don't want I believe it's free to Harris and Dan Harris.

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,240
I don't want their books grouped together.

27
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,000
So we're separating it out.

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,900
So this is going to group all of her authors together make those different groups I call them what I

29
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,720
call super rose or something like that.

30
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,440
And then for each one of those We're going to find the minimum release year as well as the author's

31
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,970
first name and last name because if we just find the minimum release here it's not that helpful to see

32
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,570
if that's all we print out.

33
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,480
We want something like Raymond Carver 1980 rather than just seeing 1980.

34
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,590
So let's give it a shot.

35
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,600
Make some space.

36
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:39,490
We'll do a select author half name com author Al name Kalima men released here and then I'll do it on

37
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,860
a separate line from books grouped by.

38
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:57,050
And we want to do that double author L name comma author Daphne enter it we go.

39
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:03,330
So we got Raymond Carver and the minimum release here for him is 1981 which I think is what I just said

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,270
or what I guessed Don let's say Dave Eggers and we've got two dozen one.

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,460
David Foster Wallace 2004 no game in 2001.

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,290
And so on we can see the minimum released year for each author.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,440
And just to you know hit twice.

44
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,630
Well that's annoying.

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
Or doing it on separate lines.

46
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,280
If I had left off.

47
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,320
Let me finish this from books.

48
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,800
Group by and let's just say author Al name.

49
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,680
I just left it that everything looks the same except for two Harris's Dan Harris 2014 Frieda Harris

50
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,340
2001.

51
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:53,470
Well now all we have is Dan Harris in 2001 which is not true he never released a book in 2001.

52
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,780
Frita Harris did.

53
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,640
And that's because we're grouping everything by Harris.

54
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,500
And so it puts Dan and Frita together.

55
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,340
So that's why we need both.

56
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:08,350
And so we're going to continue using that group by author L. name Khama author for name quite a bit.

57
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,500
As we progressed through these group buys and the next couple of videos.

58
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,450
OK.

59
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,780
So we can also do something like find the longest page count for each author.

60
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,450
Very very similar.

61
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,960
We just need to use max.

62
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:30,710
So that's going to be a select max pages from books group by.

63
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,340
And then our same author name Khama author FNMA just like that.

64
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,030
However we just do that and it's not very useful.

65
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:49,300
So let's go and add in select author F. name Khama author and then come back pages.

66
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,430
Now we can see Raymond Carver's longest book is 526.

67
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,720
Neil Gaiman's is for 65.

68
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,520
John Steinbeck is 181.

69
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,920
He only has one book in there I believe.

70
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,060
George Saunders is 367 his longest pages.

71
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,010
So that's the basics of min and max in conjunction with Group II.

72
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,150
Obviously you could group things differently.

73
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,740
We've been doing a lot of grouping based off of authors but we could group things by the year they were

74
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:23,660
released or I don't know the quantity we have in stock or whatever we have whatever available piece

75
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:29,450
of data we could get by but grouping by author makes a lot of sense for calculating some sort of meaningful

76
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,300
data.

77
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,750
Next up we're going to continue on with some of these aggregate functions and we're going to in particular

78
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:42,620
focus on some which will allow us to add things together and average which allows us to calculate averages

79
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,560
Oh wait wait wait I forgot I made this slide I ended the recording and everything started editing and

80
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,640
then I remembered I also have this slide here of a nice clean up version that just shows you can use

81
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,190
things like Max and grouped by along with Concat.

82
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:05,930
So all this does is same thing it finds the longest page count for each author but rather than just

83
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:13,490
printing out this mess here it's not really even a mess but what it does is it combines some data and

84
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:20,300
it uses aliases so that we have author and longest book as our column headers and Kinkead to put together

85
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,340
as you've already seen the author's full name.

86
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,220
So just copy that one over here paste it and there we go.

87
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,530
We get author longest book and we have a full name here and there longest book.

88
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,950
Yep that's it.

89
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,130
Now we're actually done.

90
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,220
I promise.
