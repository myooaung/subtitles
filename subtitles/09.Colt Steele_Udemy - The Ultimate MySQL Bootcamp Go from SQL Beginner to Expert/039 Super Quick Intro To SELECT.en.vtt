00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.080
OK so we left off the little cliffhanger which was we've inserted data.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.860
How do we know that it actually worked.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.630
And the main reason I made this a separate video is that it gives me a few seconds a separate opportunity

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.470
to talk about one of the main dilemmas behind figuring out how to best teach this contest which is that

5
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.220
pretty much everything in this course is related and interdependent.

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.360
A lot of it is.

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.090
So here's an example.

8
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.080
I'm showing you or I'm talking about inserting data but it's really not that great of a learning experience

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.600
unless you know how to view data.

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.310
But if I teach you to view data first without having you insert it there's nothing to view.

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.240
And so on.

12
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.480
So my approach is to try and teach things in isolation but then kind of bridge the gap and give sneak

13
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.850
previews when necessary.

14
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.930
So with all of that said I come from the future here with a sequel command you won't actually learn

15
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.090
learn officially until the next section.

16
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.660
So for now you can just copy this.

17
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.470
We were not going to talk about really what it does or how it works until the next section will dive

18
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.550
a lot more into the select statement.

19
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.340
But to view all of our data in any given table select star from the table names or select star from

20
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.900
cats and that's all I'm going to say about it for now.

21
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.490
Our priority is still focusing on creating and inserting data.

22
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.280
This is just going to help us check that it worked.

23
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.300
So let's try it.

24
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.200
We should have two cats in there.

25
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.810
Select star from cats.

26
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.610
And there we go.

27
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.170
We've got name and age of blue who is one and Draco who is 11.

28
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.580
And remember we inserted these in different orders so we did name and then age for blue and then we

29
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.880
did age followed by name for Draco.

30
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.870
So that's all there is to this.

31
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.100
We know that it works.

32
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.430
There's a lot more to using the select command.

33
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.980
Probably 30 percent of this course will be focused on selecting data and filtering and sorting it and

34
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.710
searching and all sorts of different ways of viewing data.

35
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.260
But for now this is a magic little shortcut.
