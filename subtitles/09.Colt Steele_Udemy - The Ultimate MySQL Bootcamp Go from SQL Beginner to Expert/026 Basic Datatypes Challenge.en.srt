1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,130
So as I mentioned we have a really quick activity now and the point here is to get you thinking about

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,120
data types and thinking in data types or in terms of data types.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,940
So what I would like to do is draw or write or just think about a tweet table.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,560
So modeling tweets If you're not familiar with Twitter that's going to be a tough one I guess.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,610
But basically there are three things that need you to at least three things that I want you to model

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,370
and these are the columns.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,370
So a user name.

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:35,100
So when someone tweets let's say I tweet in I have I don't actually use Twitter but if I had an account

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,160
and I call that coffee lover colt I mean that's just terrible.

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,080
But if I did it would need to be maximum 15 characters long.

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,120
So how do you specify that.

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,400
What data type is it and the content of the tweet.

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,020
Whatever the tweet is itself can't be more than 140 characters.

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,710
And then the number of people that have favorites that tweet basically like it or did it.

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,390
So you don't have to draw it out but if you want to draw it out in a tabular format and then fill in

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,110
some fake data or even real data that you find Go ahead and do that but just you know think about what

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,850
these data types are in terms of what we just learned.

18
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,020
And there's really only two choices that we saw.

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,510
So hopefully it's not too difficult.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,420
So we'll be right back with a solution.

21
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:27,760
OK.

22
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,920
So let's start talking about the answer to we had user name which is a maximum of 15 characters that

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:42,600
would be a Vardar and you would put 15 nodes in parentheses to specify that it's no more than 15 characters.

24
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,830
Then we have content of the tweet max of 140.

25
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,710
It's very similar.

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,440
It's also var chards text.

27
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,350
But this time we restrict it at 140 characters.

28
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,260
Then we have favorites which is just a number.

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,780
So we use it and then hear some mock data that I did if you take a look we have cool guy who tweeted

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,270
My first tweet.

31
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,430
Now as one person who liked it or favorite it.

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,880
Then we have guitar queen who tweeted I love music.

33
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,910
Smiley face.

34
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,980
How endearing.

35
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,880
And we have 10 favorites on that.

36
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:23,930
And then lonely heart this sad guy or gal who tweeted still looking for love and that has zero favorites

37
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,130
because nobody wants to be depressed.

38
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,660
All right.

39
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,000
So next up we're going to see how to take the stereotypes and actually tell sequel or Maya's well how

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,610
to implement a table using those data tips.
