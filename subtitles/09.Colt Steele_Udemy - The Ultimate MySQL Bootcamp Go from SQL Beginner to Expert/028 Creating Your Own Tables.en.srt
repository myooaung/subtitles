1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,940
So now that we've learned how tables work and we've seen a little bit about data types we finally get

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,040
to start creating tables.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,120
So here is the magic syntax for creating a new table in my school.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,070
Here is the generic version.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,140
So it's create table and then the name of the table.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,790
So cats or users or people or results or whatever it is.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,510
And then in parentheses a column name and then MySpace and that data type.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,710
And there are a few other things that can come along with the data type but for now we're just talking

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,790
about data type.

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:44,780
So a column name like age is an ENT or address is of our chart or our car however you want to pronounce

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,840
it.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,180
So that's the main idea.

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:53,240
And you keep listing these columns as many as you need it could just be one it could be 20 and you separate

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:01:00,050
them by columns excuse me by commas and then when you finish you add your semi-colon and that's that.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,060
And you don't have to format it this way on separate lines but I think it's easiest to understand.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,330
It's definitely easier to read when you get much more complex ones but you could do it all on a single

17
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,160
line just like anything else in my as well.

18
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,810
So here's an actual example using our catch table.

19
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,850
So we're just working with name and age create table cats.

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,640
One thing I should point out is that table names should be pluralized so it doesn't actually matter

21
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,750
for the mechanics or behind the scenes that won't change anything.

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,910
But you want to just follow this convention use plural because that's what a table describes is multiple

23
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:43,390
cats or people instead of person or payments instead of payment and so on.

24
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,410
OK.

25
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:51,440
So we have parentheses and then we list our columns and the corresponding data types so name will be

26
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:58,800
Vardar with a 100 character limit comma age will be an integer.

27
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,990
So let's hop over to call 9 and see if it works.

28
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,210
So the first thing I'll do is just make a new database.

29
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,160
You don't have to do this if you're following along.

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,340
But I'll just call one cat app.

31
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,930
Forgot my semi-colon.

32
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,930
Then we will use.

33
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:30,220
OK so now the next thing we'll do is create table cat and then we can either do parentheses here and

34
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,720
that's what I usually do when I'm working in the mines.

35
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,070
Q. Well command line or in the shell.

36
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,110
So you don't have to worry about spaces too much.

37
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:50,100
So create table cats and then we'll say name is var char 100 comma age isn't it.

38
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,690
And then we'll close our parentheses with a semi-colon.

39
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,690
Queery OK.

40
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,910
0 rows effected perfect.

41
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,710
It appears to have worked or at least we have to trust that it works because right now we don't have

42
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,230
a way of testing that.

43
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,350
But we will the next video cliffhanger.
