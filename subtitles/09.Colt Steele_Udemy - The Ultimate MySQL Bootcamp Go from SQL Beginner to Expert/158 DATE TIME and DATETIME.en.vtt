00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.720
All right.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.990
So we've made it through that war zone of string and numbered types in particular the number types are

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.480
always a bit hairy but we're moving on to something equally finicky dates and times.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.370
Often the bane of many programmers existence having to deal with time zones and synchronizing things

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.530
across the world in the daylight savings it's just a nightmare Piers.

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.210
Fortunately my school makes it relatively simple for us.

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.780
I'm going to show you how in the next couple of videos this is going to be serious here not just a single

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.590
video.

9
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.120
And in fact in this first video I'm just going to give you a quick overview of the three important data

10
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.200
types that will take a look at.

11
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.900
So the first one is called data and what it does is it just stores a date without a time.

12
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.700
So the format looks like this year year year year year dash month month dash date day.

13
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.520
So 1999 dash 11 dash twenty five or something.

14
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.340
So as it states here that that stores that date but no time.

15
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:12.480
So there are instances where you may use this things like a birthday if you're asking a user to sign

16
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.840
up and specify their birthday.

17
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.280
Most users don't know the time.

18
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.210
Well I don't know.

19
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.020
I don't know the time.

20
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.380
I was born I know a lot of people do but it doesn't matter.

21
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.170
At least for most web sites it doesn't matter what time someone was born.

22
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.420
You just need that date.

23
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.800
Another option is the opposite the time.

24
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.310
So time is another data type that stores values with the time but no date.

25
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.740
So out of the three I'm going to show you this is the one I use the least by far because there's not

26
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.890
many things that you just need to store time.

27
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:56.730
Maybe if you're I don't know if you're working with reminders maybe like I'm at a loss really.

28
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:05.280
But basically store times and the syntax the format is our our dash or excuse me Colan minute minute

29
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.440
colon second second and the final data type and the one that I use.

30
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.540
By far the most out of all of them is Date Time.

31
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.800
Not very creative and just date plus time does what it sounds like.

32
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.280
Which I also realize I'm saying way too often in this course but it stores values with the date and

33
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.060
time.

34
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.940
And this is pretty useful and you get both.

35
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.570
And like I said this is what I use the most.

36
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.090
So when you're doing things like I don't know when to use or signed up for your site or when something

37
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.670
was last updated.

38
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.150
You know when a profile picture was last updated or when somebody commented on a Facebook post.

39
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.750
Those are all stored with date times because just having the time on its own isn't that useful.

40
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.100
So let's go with this Facebook example.

41
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.760
You know if I comment on someone's post Facebook doesn't just store the time that I commented.

42
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.200
Ten thirty nine P.M. say because it's just not that useful to them.

43
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.640
You know I think what Facebook does is it displays things like how many days ago or hours or minutes

44
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.050
ago something you know I commented it will say like Colt commented three seconds ago 20 minutes ago

45
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.790
two days ago last month and it needs more than just a time to figure that out.

46
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.110
Right and needs the time and that day.

47
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:29.970
So daytime very very useful and used all the time in applications and a really common use case in programming

48
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.680
in general is when you have a column let's say a row in a database and a table and it's created you

49
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.560
often want to just store the date and time it was created so that you can then go and sort things based

50
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.940
off of how new they are and how old they are.

51
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.860
So very easy.

52
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.870
You know if you're working on comments for example going back to Facebook Facebook comments are displayed

53
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.490
in the order that they were written and posted.

54
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.470
So you need to store that created at time so that your date time is coming and the format is also what

55
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.700
you probably expect year year year year dash month month dash date day which is the date part and then

56
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.440
a space hour hour Cohen minute minute Colan second second which is the time component.

57
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.720
OK so we talked about those three we didn't see them in action but we saw that they exist date and time

58
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.540
and date time and again I use date time the most we'll be using it the most it's the most versatile

59
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.880
and the most useful.
