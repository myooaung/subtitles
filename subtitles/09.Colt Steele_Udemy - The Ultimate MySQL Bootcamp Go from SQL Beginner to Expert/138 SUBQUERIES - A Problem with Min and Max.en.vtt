00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.210
So what we're discussing in this video in case you didn't see the last video that leads into this is

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:13.170
that there is a problem with trying to do something like this select max pages common title from books

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.120
if I want to find the title and they'll find the title of the longest book or any other information

4
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.650
along with the maxim pages.

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.300
It doesn't work and what it's doing right now is actually returning

6
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.490
here we go is first finding the longest pages maximum pages which is indeed 634.

7
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.790
But then when I ask for title it's actually just giving me the first title The Namesake.

8
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.440
And the reason that it does it it's kind of complicated and weird.

9
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.250
But basically you can think of it as sequel or my as well as executing this and it finds Max pages first

10
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.960
which is independent from this so finds this 634.

11
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.030
And there's only one row that it's preparing to print out.

12
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.930
So then we get Khama title and there's only one spot to fill.

13
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.820
So just takes the first title.

14
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.010
So these are independent of one another.

15
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.160
They're not connected unfortunately but there are ways around it.

16
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.450
So the first thing I'll show you is something a little weird.

17
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.660
It's weird.

18
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.770
Overall it's just weird to you at this point because we haven't seen this before.

19
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.610
It involves something called the sub query which we'll return to later on in the course.

20
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.860
But I wanted to just preview now.

21
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.290
And basically what it lets us do is run one query instead of another.

22
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.180
So it looks like this select star and this case had its star although we could use the title but select

23
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.420
star from books where pages equals and then this is the weird part.

24
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.070
Parentheses and inside the print we have another query select.

25
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.020
In this case I did mean pages from books.

26
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.880
So what's going to happen is that this will actually execute first select whatever we have here.

27
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.150
So let's say how many pages I believe is 1:29 or in our case Max pages would be 6:34.

28
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.090
So it's going to find that in return 634 here.

29
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.790
And then this will run select star from books where pages equals 634.

30
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.220
So let's try it out now and I'll show you basically manually what's happening.

31
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.130
So think of it as doing a select max pages from books just like this.

32
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.670
Which is 634.

33
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:55.450
And then copy that and do a select and let's do a will do star like star from books where pages equals

34
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.090
6:34.

35
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.610
So it's a two step process and you can see with our formatting a little screwed up we get the Amazing

36
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.770
Adventures of Kavalier and Clay which is indeed the longest book 634 pages so we can do that all at

37
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.400
once or at least in one line of code with it.

38
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.940
If we just recall this select max pages from books that will be our Sobe queery.

39
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.980
And so that's kind of going to be a fill in the blank.

40
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:35.370
So we'll have a select and let's just do title and pages this time from books where pages equals the

41
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.770
result of finding the max pages.

42
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.220
So it's doing what we just did.

43
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.760
But in one line of code and now you can see if we get the Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay 634

44
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.550
pages.

45
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.410
So we can also do that with men and if we just replace this

46
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.640
you'll see that Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love short story collection great

47
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.450
short story collection if you like short stories is the shortest book 176 pages.

48
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.530
So that's all we'll talk about with subcreative.

49
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.600
That's all I'll show you.

50
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.400
But as you probably imagine there are other uses for them.

51
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.990
But there's a small problem.

52
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.990
It's not really a problem but there's something to consider which is this is a little bit slow.

53
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.270
In our case it's not that slow so I'm slow at all because we have very small data set but it's effectively

54
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.030
running two queries so each one of these is run independently.

55
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.210
So when we hit ENTER when this executes.

56
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.350
Like I said two things are happening to separate queries that are going to take time.

57
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.240
Each one of them every time you do is select.

58
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.070
It takes time and there's a faster way if you are worried about speed.

59
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.210
And it involves something we've already seen.

60
00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:01.260
So there's nothing new no fancy ness no top secret no advanced features.

61
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.960
So queries or anything like that that you haven't been introduced to yet there's a way of doing it using

62
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.150
what you've already seen.

63
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.760
So that way is using order by.

64
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.630
So what we could do is just order by pages in ascending order so do a select star from books ordered

65
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.340
by pages ascending and then just limit once or Chapa everything else off and just take the first one.

66
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.520
And that will give us the exact same result.

67
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.620
But it's not going to take much time.

68
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.790
So I can be as difficult for my as queue up to run because it's only selecting one thing and it's only

69
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.010
running one query.

70
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.400
So let's try that.

71
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:50.020
We'll do a select and let's just through Title and pages from books instead of doing our web pages equals

72
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.910
PABX blah blah.

73
00:05:51.040 --> 00:06:00.620
Well just to our order by and then we want to order five pages ascending limit one and we get the exact

74
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:08.630
same result that we got before with another longer query that involves a subquery and we can do the

75
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.500
same thing with men.

76
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.880
And to do that we just change our order yes.

77
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.130
It still bothers me.

78
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.990
Four letters DGSE sending is only three letters so inconsistent.

79
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:28.930
But if you remember that DGSE are descending you'll see that the longest book is yet again the Amazing

80
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.910
Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.

81
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.260
OK.

82
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.310
So that was a bit of a tangent but it's important to address because I think a lot of people myself

83
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.080
included.

84
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.790
I remember when I was learning this stuff setting out and thinking that you could do something like

85
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:53.320
select men let's say year a title comma let's say Star quantity and that it would go find the minimum

86
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.550
year and then the corresponding title and start quantity.

87
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.480
And that's not the case.

88
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.320
That's just not how it works as we've seen.

89
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.680
So I just wanted to point that out and highlight a couple of solutions just so that you're aware going

90
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.260
forward.

91
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.970
Things aren't always as intuitive as you'd hope.

92
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.920
OK.

93
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.440
Next up we're going to continue with min and max and use them in conjunction with group by.
