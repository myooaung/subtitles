00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.830
Already.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.730
So in this section we're going to focus on the basics of something called crud.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.170
So it's an acronym.

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:16.710
C R U D and it stands for create read update and delete or destroy some variation of that.

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.040
The idea is that these are the four main operations that we perform on our data we've already seen how

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.940
to create data when we have a database we want to be able to add data in.

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.550
We want to be able to search back or read it back out.

8
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.380
We want to be able to update it.

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.620
And then also to delete it.

10
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.950
Those are the four most important and most common operations that will do in credit self.

11
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.380
The acronym is not particular to databases.

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.440
It's common in other facets of programming and web development but it's a nice acronym that fits what

13
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.760
we are trying to do here.

14
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.830
So what we're going to do is step through all four different operations and we've already seen create

15
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.060
it should be review.

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.040
Hopefully we'll do it using Insert into.

17
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.600
So going back to our cats we have things like insert into cats name and age and then the values Tocco

18
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.980
and 14 so we won't spend any more time talking about create in this section but we'll be using Insert

19
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.620
into throughout the rest of the course.

20
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.470
But really what we're going to focus on here are the other three operations.

21
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.950
So how do we read data out.

22
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.320
How do we search how do we find things.

23
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.970
How do we update data.

24
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.570
If we made a mistake or something changes and then how do we delete data.

25
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.170
How do we do it.

26
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.570
Everything from a table and how do we do the one or two things at a time.

27
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.830
So that's really what this section will focus on.

28
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.970
And we'll kick it off by talking about reading data out.
