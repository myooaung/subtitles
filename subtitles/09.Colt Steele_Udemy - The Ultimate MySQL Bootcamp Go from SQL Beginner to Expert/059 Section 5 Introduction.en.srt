1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,760
They will come back.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,340
If you're looking at my desk right now and you're asking wow why is there so much crud on it.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,900
Well you're onto something.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,930
This section is all about crud.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,650
Yeah.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,610
So crud is an acronym it stands for four things.

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,170
C R U N D.

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:19,810
Create.

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,680
Read update and delete.

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,790
And they are the four basic actions that we want to be able to do to our data.

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,200
So we've actually seen two components already.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,190
We've seen how let's say we're working with users.

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,080
We've seen how to create users with the insert command we've seen how to read users take them back out

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,010
you know spill the milk out of the database.

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,440
That is the read section which we did with select.

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,890
Now we also are going to review more about select and insert.

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,740
But primarily we're going to see how to update and delete information.

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,840
So how do we change something in our database if we made a mistake or let's say a user change their

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,470
password they clicked forgot my password and they want to reset it.

20
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,100
We need to change it in the database and then delete.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,710
Let's say every user decides to leave our site for some really bad reason we can delete him or her.

22
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,370
So that's the focus of this section.

23
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,360
We're going to have a ton of exercises because we're seeing a lot of commands and now that we have those

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,370
four commands in place we'll be able to go do a lot of stuff.

25
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,070
They're kind of the fundamental for things of any database or any data.

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,930
So tons of challenges coming up.

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,040
Look forward to that and I'll see you basically in the next section when I have to do another one of

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,860
these videos.

29
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,510
So you know it.
