00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.790
OK let's go through some of these solutions.

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.320
So the first one versed in uppercase is following sentence despite the cat look at me with such hatred.

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.880
So I'm just going to copy it.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.410
And the first thing I'm actually going to do is make a new file so I'll come up here and do new file

5
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.470
and I'll just call this exercises.

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.010
Q Well done in there.

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.210
I'll paste this.

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.820
And we know that we need to do two things we need to reverse it in upper case.

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.620
The order doesn't really matter.

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.710
So let's do a we need to do a select first.

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.920
Either way select reverse.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:52.100
And we're going to select the reverse of this and then we can do Opper here just like that or we could

13
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.220
switch them and do select upper reverse.

14
00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.080
Well let's give it a shot and I'm missing my quote there.

15
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.200
Let's get out of here.

16
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.020
Missing that closing quote.

17
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.260
Go try it again.

18
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.900
And there we go.

19
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.830
It's reversed and all uppercase.

20
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.050
So now I'm going to comment that out and we'll move on to the next one.

21
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.660
What does this printout.

22
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.360
So let's start on the inside.

23
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.250
Concatenate I with the space with like space and cat.

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.240
So it will be I like casse the sentence with spaces but then we have a replace and replace.

25
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.220
It's going to get rid of all those spaces and put dashes.

26
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.010
So it should be I dash like Dash cats.

27
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.570
Let's try it.

28
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.430
There we go.

29
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.910
I like cats with dashes so that one is really just testing that you understand how these are actually

30
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.630
executed and that you can stack multiple nest multiple functions.

31
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.780
Next up we have our first one really working with the book's data.

32
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.350
So replace all spaces in book titles with the arrow.

33
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:19.350
So we need to do a select and we know that there's going to be a replace and we know that it's going

34
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.410
to be from books.

35
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.000
So let's start with that.

36
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.890
So what are we replacing.

37
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.700
Well we're looking for all titles and we're replacing a space with the arrow.

38
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.540
Double check or play spaces with arrows that should be good.

39
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.680
And the other thing was that appear we had title.

40
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.000
So we need to use as a title.

41
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.030
So let's copy it.

42
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.950
Make sure it works.

43
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.730
There we go.

44
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.250
Title the arrow namesake Norse arrow.

45
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.670
Mythology and so on.

46
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.660
I'll comment that one out and we'll move on to the next one.

47
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.830
Print this out.

48
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.630
So we should have forward and backwards.

49
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.060
And this is last name printed regularly and this is last name reversed.

50
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.290
So let's start.

51
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.010
We know we need to have a select and the first thing that we know is that we're going to have author

52
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.250
Ellen name as forward's.

53
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.990
Just make sure I have that.

54
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.890
So that's says that that will give us this right here.

55
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.730
And let's close off let's do from books just like that so we can start with this if we want it and we

56
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.170
get that left portion.

57
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.480
Now we need this right portion so we need a comma because we're now selecting two different things.

58
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:59.240
And what we want to do here is use reverse author our name as backwards just like that.

59
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.690
Let's copy it and then we go forwards backwards.

60
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.320
Regular last name reversed last name.

61
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.550
All right comment that went out and we move on this one.

62
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.020
We need to print a full name so first and last name of the author all in caps.

63
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.220
So there's a couple of ways we can approach this.

64
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.420
The easiest way is just to capitalize one string.

65
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.090
So we combine the two first in mice and then capitalized.

66
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.050
If you wanted to though you could take capital first and then capital second or excuse me capital first

67
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.820
name capital last name then combine them.

68
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.280
And that works just as well.

69
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.260
But it's easier to just do it once.

70
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.240
And it's also faster.

71
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.450
So the other thing is we have four names in caps up here.

72
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.490
So we need to use as.

73
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.800
So let's start by printing fullname.

74
00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:04.790
So we have a select from books and what we need to do is concat And what are we can catting author f

75
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:13.670
name comma author LNA and I'll leave it like this for now but hopefully you can predict what the problem

76
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.250
is.

77
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:23.090
When I do that we don't have spaces so let's at our space in and that should give us the concatenated

78
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:29.080
version and well free at the right comma.

79
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.320
Now let's try it.

80
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.080
There you go.

81
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.640
So you get Jhumpa Lahiri Dave Eggers and so on with the spaces.

82
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.310
So now what we want to do is just uppercase that so we could do it on the same line because uppercase

83
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:51.280
is so short we can just say upper of that copy and paste it in.

84
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:58.220
We also need to rename this up there so we need as and what to call it full name and caps.

85
00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.860
So there are spaces in that.

86
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.170
So we need to use quotes full name in caps.

87
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.490
Copy that.

88
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.960
There we go full name in caps.

89
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.060
And if you want to format a little bit better here we can do this

90
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.480
just like that and it will work just the same.

91
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.430
Ok let's come with that one now and move on.

92
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.500
Make this happen.

93
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:35.560
So what we have again is first that excuse me the title was released in and then the year.

94
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.710
So we're going to need to make use of concatenates.

95
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:47.520
So let's start off with our select and we'll have a concat but we will also have from books just like

96
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.440
everything else we've done.

97
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.050
So what are we going to concatenate.

98
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.990
Well first is the title after the title.

99
00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.160
We have space was released in space so we need those spaces.

100
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.030
Comma like that.

101
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.810
And we could just start with that.

102
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:15.530
Want to take a look and we get the namesake was released and Norse mythology was released and then we

103
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:23.600
just need to add in the year comma released year and we haven't really worked with a year in a while

104
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.540
sort of you forgot what the name of that column is.

105
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.610
Earlier I when I was recording something I ended up having to redo it because I was referring to year

106
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.310
rather than released year.

107
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.010
So you could just you describe books and see that.

108
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.280
OK.

109
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.890
It's called released here.

110
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:42.630
All right.

111
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:50.400
So then we'll copy that and paste it and we get the namesake was released in 2003 and so on.

112
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.530
The only thing we need to change is this appear.

113
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:58.710
It's supposed to be called blurb as blurb.

114
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.840
And there we go.

115
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.460
So we're done with that one commented out.

116
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.220
Next up print book titles and the length of each title.

117
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.680
So printing the title is easy.

118
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.360
Then we just need to use char length and print the character length.

119
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:26.550
So let's do that now select from books and what do we want to select.

120
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:32.650
Well first we want title and then after we select the title we want char length.

121
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:38.150
And one thing I should highlight there is that because this is a sequel file might have noticed I get

122
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:43.550
these autocomplete suggestions so I can either click or I can hit tab.

123
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.970
And that's much faster in my experiences to hit tab.

124
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:53.810
So we want the length of the title just like that

125
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.160
and we get the namesake 12 Norse mythology 15.

126
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.340
And that's what we want.

127
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:08.020
Except we need character count just like that.

128
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.330
However this will cause an error.

129
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.530
We need to put it in quotes because there is a space there.

130
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:23.360
Now we give it a shot and it works out right.

131
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.570
Last one I promise.

132
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.840
So this one is more complex.

133
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:32.710
Three different things for selecting each one is complex on its own.

134
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.680
So let's tackle the first bit.

135
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.010
The short title.

136
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:43.140
So we want the first 10 characters of the title plus dot dot dot.

137
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.270
So we'll comment this out.

138
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:55.060
We'll do our same select from books and we'll start by selecting the first 10 characters so that substring

139
00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.180
or fairly easy substrate or whatever that's the substring.

140
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:07.420
And we want it of title from 1 to 10 just like that.

141
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:13.990
So that should just give us at this point should know what it does gives us the first 10 characters.

142
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:18.510
But we also want to concatenate that with dot dot dot.

143
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:25.660
So we'll do that here concat with the string dot dot dot dot com Economy.com.

144
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.000
And now we copy that.

145
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.290
That works but it's supposed to be called short title.

146
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:45.540
So we add as short title and we just triple check our work looks good.

147
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:52.400
Now we have our next thing we're selecting which is the author but we want last name comma first thing

148
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.800
so it's going to be another concat actually.

149
00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:04.960
And we'll start with the author L name comma a comma in quotes.

150
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:12.040
Kind of hard to talk about comma comma common but this coming here is actually going to be concatenated

151
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.210
in.

152
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:18.410
This is quite a string to look at their author name.

153
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:25.090
And we want it to be as author so we don't have to use quotes for that.

154
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.140
Let's try it and see if we made any mistakes.

155
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:29.960
It looks good.

156
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:34.440
So we get here we come a jumper game and come in Neal.

157
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.110
That's what we expect.

158
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.940
And it's called author.

159
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.770
Finally we need this last portion quantity and this should be the number in-stock followed by the string

160
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.360
in stock.

161
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:55.030
So if you don't remember what the column name is we can do describe books and you can see OK we have

162
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.260
stock quantity.

163
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.060
So that's what we want to use.

164
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:08.370
So this time we're starting off with a stock quantity comma and then we want space in space stock

165
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.380
just like that.

166
00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:19.720
And then we need to use as quantity boy.

167
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:20.850
That's a long one.

168
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.440
So let's try it out make sure we didn't do anything wrong and that looks good.

169
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.220
32 in-stock hundred fifty four in-stock.

170
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.620
And then we have author and short title both working.

171
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:37.220
Now one thing I want to point out here that stock quantity is a number it's an it.

172
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.940
But it doesn't break everything.

173
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.060
Concat is OK with numbers like this.

174
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:50.250
What it does is it just takes the string version the text version of 32 and adds it to in-stock.

175
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:56.350
So it basically does this 32 plus in stock.

176
00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.040
So that's very different than trying to add a number to text.

177
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.300
All right so that was a lot I know but we're done now.

178
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.840
We're done with these string functions and we're moving on.
