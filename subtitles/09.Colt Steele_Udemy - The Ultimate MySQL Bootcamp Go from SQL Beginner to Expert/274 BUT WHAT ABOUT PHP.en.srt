1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,690
All right.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,640
So I'll start this video off with a quick anecdote.

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,960
Stupid story.

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,110
I have a course online right now.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,600
It's done relatively well a lot of students and it focuses on a bunch of technologies including H.M.S.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,630
s javascript.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,550
We talk about no genius as well.

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,850
Talk about Mango D.B and a bunch of other tools that go along with them and at least a couple times

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,790
a day.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,890
You know I get comments or questions or people demanding that you know it should cover ph or should

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,480
cover Ruby or why doesn't that cover C or Java.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,570
And those are valid questions right.

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,780
People have reasons for wanting to learn different things.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,910
So I'm not trying to diminish their concerns or not.

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,660
I'm not trying to say they shouldn't want to learn those.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,170
But there's no way that any course can teach all of those.

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,760
And there's no reason that it should because like I said you only need one maybe two.

18
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,430
So the reason I bring that up is that it's kind of a contentious thing.

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,440
People especially students when people are learning to program it's overwhelming.

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,900
Everyone tells you to learn something else.

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,320
It's very confusing.

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,580
You know do you learn something that's easy to learn because it's easy to learn or is it better to learn

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,820
something that's popular and more people are using even if it means that it's tougher.

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,160
You know what's the best route.

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,250
And I think the answer is there is a different way for everyone.

26
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,610
It's kind of a lame copout answer.

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,470
So when you're making an online course you have to decide.

28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:33,630
And what I decided for this course is we're focusing primarily on node and the typical kind of conventional

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,280
choice would be ph.

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,550
So I would talk about why I made that decision and the first reason is that I personally am not crazy

31
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,720
about BHP.

32
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,160
I've done some work with it some worked with wordpress.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,480
Like I said I used to be very popular.

34
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,540
There's still a lot of people using it but it is no longer the reigning champion of programming languages

35
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,360
on the web.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,970
Like seven years ago it was.

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,850
That was the language that you used if you wanted to make a web app.

38
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,230
But nowadays there's so much more competition.

39
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,860
People are writing things in Noad or they're writing them in Ruby and tons of other languages.

40
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,500
Scala closure all these different languages that you could use and they all have benefits right.

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,360
They all have kind of they came later.

42
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,000
They were able to see what worked what didn't work where problems were with other languages.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,490
They all kind of tried to address different things.

44
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,000
So I won't go into a lot of the technical details.

45
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
There there's an interesting article online.

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
Is the most hated programming language.

47
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,360
Not that that is an excuse to not use it but it's interesting.

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,080
I'll link to it if you want to read about it.

49
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:46,200
Basically talks about how PDP got so popular back in 1995 when it started and then where does the hate

50
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,520
towards it come from.

51
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:55,380
And largely the consensus at least is that P2P was kind of cobbled together it wasn't a consciously

52
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,320
crafted as this as here.

53
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,730
Programming Language things are added over the years and there's inconsistency there are some security

54
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:09,000
issues but you could actually say the same thing about javascript which is a valid criticism that it

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,500
was created.

56
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,080
And I think it's nine or 10 days kind of as an experiment.

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,870
It wasn't some crazy planned out language and things have been added over the years and they're constantly

58
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,940
updating the specification for Javascript.

59
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:30,570
So that's not necessarily why I chose to not teach Ph.D. and choose a node in javascript instead.

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,470
It's really more about the data that's on this page.

61
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,870
This is from 2016.

62
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:44,850
It's a stack overflow server they do with how many 56000 coders who answered the survey and there's

63
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,250
45 questions.

64
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:53,190
So if we scroll down and click on technology and go look at the technologies tabs we can quickly see

65
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,830
first of all it's sequel.

66
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,110
Very popular good news.

67
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,110
And you can see here you have HP which is in 2016 around 25 percent.

68
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:11,120
If you go back to 2013 noter said it started at 35 percent then went down to 28 percent then up a little

69
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,000
to 29 and then down to 25 so the lowest it's been.

70
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:22,380
So you can see there are charts online that I couldn't find any that were copyright free essentially

71
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,730
had a license that I would be able to show you the image.

72
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,260
But there are charges online you can see the decline.

73
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:35,010
It's not a very steep decline but there is a decline and at the same time if we look at no japes here

74
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:43,580
which is was it seven point five percent now it's going up to 9.9 percent 13 percent 17 percent.

75
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,290
It's growing very quickly in comparison to other things around it.

76
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,730
And then also if you take a look you know javascript does appear as number one which is great because

77
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,590
no genius uses Javascript syntax.

78
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,580
It is javascript.

79
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,470
We'll talk about that if you're not familiar with it.

80
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,560
So you know if you notice a trend down here more people use javascript than any other programming language.

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,090
PH appears to be falling out of favor as node and angular merge.

82
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,600
That's kind of the main takeaway trend.

83
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:20,380
And if we scroll down a bit more we can take a look at the top tech on Stack Overflow see javascript's

84
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,500
up nice and high still.

85
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,630
If we look at trending stuff we basically see that it's all javascript while almost all javascript related

86
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,430
re-act javascript.

87
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,930
We've got node nowhere on here page.

88
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,420
Now I don't want to say that you only pick something based off of it's if it's trendy or not.

89
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,090
That's not the point here.

90
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:47,020
The point is more that I picked no because it is something that will prepare you for the future and

91
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,420
if you want to learn ph.

92
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,320
There are so many options out there and I didn't want to just make another version of a course that

93
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,600
could have been made a couple of years ago.

94
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,050
I wanted to make the most up to date current course.

95
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,060
So basically you know it's a decision that I made.

96
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,440
There is not one answer.

97
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:10,090
You could still make a great ph P in my s to of course today I'll probably end up adding a little P.S.

98
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,850
But it's not going to be the focus of the course.

99
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:19,840
And minor minor thing but it is interesting if you look at your top paying jobs or free stroll down

100
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,070
and look at you know what no developer an average around $85000.

101
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,480
The Capeci minor while $10000 difference.

102
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,730
So nothing.

103
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,360
That's why I chose to do that.

104
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,060
But it is interesting to see.

105
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:41,680
And then finally if you look at the correlated technologies you can see ph P and sequel there's a tight

106
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,940
correlation there right.

107
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,430
But there's also javascript and sequel which is what we're going to be focusing on and that's becoming

108
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,570
very very popular.

109
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,910
A great combination.

110
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,950
So that's horrible.

111
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,220
So that's sort of some of the data behind why I picked that.

112
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,450
Why I came to this decision.

113
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,760
If you're curious about it.

114
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,800
One other thing there there's a good core post about why BHP is losing popularity why people are trying

115
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,550
to you know and stuff and Ruby and why people are you know down on HP which hopefully the takeaway is

116
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,690
that that's not my intention.

117
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,100
I'm not trying to make Peachi seem bad.

118
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,710
I am just trying to show you another option.

119
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,010
All right.

120
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,840
So thankfully this was an optional video.

121
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,990
You didn't have to sit through this and not that you have to sit through any video but well we're done

122
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,830
with it now.

123
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,890
Thanks for sitting through that.

124
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,960
If you chose to.

125
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,320
Next up we're going to introduce our very exciting fun project.
