1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,420
Get here we go.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,240
So let's first start off by just making a new file to work in.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,040
So we have some cleaning.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,060
We'll just call it exercises as well.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,160
So we have a nice place to put the answers.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,030
OK.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,870
So our first one here find the earliest date a user joined.

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,630
And we're not selecting anything except the earliest date.

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:29,160
So all we need to do is take advantage of created that and use the men operator them in function.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:37,120
So it's just a matter of select men created at from users.

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,250
And we'll see if that

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,940
copy and paste it and the one that I get here looks like this.

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:56,150
So 2016 5 one notice says earliest date so that's the easier part to fix.

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,030
And then notice the format.

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,260
So let's do as earliest date first.

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,370
That will make it cleaner then we need to format the date.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:15,160
So I'm going to put this on a new line and the way that we format remember is we use date underscore

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,180
format.

19
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,310
Think back to our date section.

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,780
So we're formatting the result of the minimum created which is this.

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,280
And we have a second argument which is the date string how we want to format it.

22
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:36,070
And the one I gave you had the month name which I believe is capital M and then that day with the suffix

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,720
which is I believe capital D and the year four letter for numbers capital Y.

24
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:50,860
So you need percent capital D percent capital no backwards capital M percent capital D percent capital

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,600
Y.

26
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,910
Let's see oh I have to copy this pasted in.

27
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:57,810
And there we go.

28
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,710
May 1st 2016.

29
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,360
OK.

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,150
Look we're only a day off from the first dataset that I added when I made these exercises I had a different

31
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,970
set of data and you just watch me rerun it delete it or create 500 new ones so these will be slightly

32
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,640
different than my answers to.

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,950
Next find the email of that user.

34
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,900
So the same one that we just found this is the earliest date.

35
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,180
How do we find that e-mail.

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,520
So let me label this challenge one and this one.

37
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,700
We have to use a subquery because basically what we're trying to do is well first we can clean this

38
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,570
up a bit.

39
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:43,120
We don't need to format this one but basically what we're trying to do is take this earliest date which

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,340
looks like this.

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:57,150
And then we want to do a select well do e-mail from users where created at is equal to that date.

42
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,250
How do we find that user.

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,500
So let's just do it manually.

44
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:10,600
It looks like our answer is Cole Bailey at yahoo dot com so we can use a so Kery to help us where all

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,530
we have to do we can get rid of this and say select email Commack created at Or we could just say select

46
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:27,410
star to make it shorter from users where created it equals and then we have to do our several query

47
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:35,650
select men created out from users.

48
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,800
So those parentheses indicate that this is a query that needs to happen.

49
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,490
So this is evaluated what is men created that need my parentheses to work there go.

50
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,750
What is the miscreated.

51
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,680
Well it's going to be this.

52
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,150
So then basically this whole thing is replaced by that and then we're finding users start from users

53
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,230
where creativity is equal to that.

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,930
So let's try it.

55
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,360
There we go.

56
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,090
Looks good.

57
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,920
We've got e-mail and created at of course it looks different but this is the correct answer.

58
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:16,040
Call Baly and we saw that because earlier we just manually selected it based off of that date and it

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,800
worked perfect.

60
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,830
Moving on.

61
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,940
So we're taking every user taking they're created at date and then we're extracting the month name from

62
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,880
that date whatever the month is combining them.

63
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,900
We're grouping them and counting how many exist.

64
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,120
So how many users signed up in November.

65
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,540
In our case November was the highest and then we're.

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,600
Us well.

67
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,640
So let's start by just extracting the month name.

68
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,980
So if we were to take a date like where's that.

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,640
This one right here.

70
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,830
How do we get the month name from that.

71
00:04:51,220 --> 00:05:03,040
Because if we just do select the month of that it gives us a number so that we can do instead is month

72
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,360
name.

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,030
And that gives us may.

74
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,070
So we'll start with that.

75
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:15,830
Well do select month name of created at from users

76
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,520
and we get 500 different month names.

77
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,330
Well there's only 12 different ones but 500 rows.

78
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:36,440
So then what we want to do is a simple group by and let's just give it a name like as month and grouped

79
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,310
by month instead.

80
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,960
So rather than retyping that whole thing.

81
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:48,920
OK so now we have 12 assuming that we have a date in every month of the year which we probably do if

82
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,580
we have 500 but we don't see how many there are.

83
00:05:52,700 --> 00:06:07,980
So then we need our second field and our second field is count we just do count start just like that.

84
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,790
And here we go almost there all that we need to do.

85
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:21,660
I believe I gave this an alias of count and then we also want to order by count and we want it to be

86
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,000
descending.

87
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,040
Let's see if it works.

88
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,850
Riego November the highest count as well with 52.

89
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,520
Although it diverges.

90
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,680
January was first or was second.

91
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,450
In my case may and then April.

92
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,310
All right.

93
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,930
So we use this month name and we group them based off the third month.

94
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,620
You could also just replace it with this.

95
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,750
But it's easier just to type a month and then grouping them counting them and ordering them.

96
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,440
I mean just put a note that this is challenge 3.

97
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,140
Moving on.

98
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,980
Challenge for count the number of users with Yahoo emails.

99
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,850
So for this one it's a bit of a throwback and we need to do is use like to figure out you know which

100
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,410
emails have Yahoo in them.

101
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:19,090
So we'll do a challenge for let's do a select star from users where we just need to say we're created

102
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,870
at like.

103
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,820
And we don't just want to say Yahoo.

104
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:29,320
Remember that's only going to find in one of my saying created an email like Yahoo.

105
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,400
We don't want to do that because that's only where email is exactly Yahoo.

106
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:40,600
So we need these placeholders but we could improve this a bit because this would match anything that

107
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,130
had Yahoo in the string anywhere and we could have someone's email be you know Yahoo.

108
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,760
Tim at gmail dot com.

109
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,950
Or maybe someones last name is Yahoo or something Yahoo's.

110
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,030
So we don't want that.

111
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:03,670
So all we want to change is we'll do at Yahoo dot com and this will guarantee that the string ends at

112
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,960
yahoo dot com.

113
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,730
So now let's take a look.

114
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,450
Here we go these are all yahoo dot com emails and then all we wanted to do is count how many.

115
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:19,110
So rather than selecting star who would you select count Starr as Yahoo users.

116
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,610
I think it's what we call it from users where email lists like Yahoo.

117
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:33,330
And this time there is 170 and finally challenge and refine calculate the total number of users for

118
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,710
each email host.

119
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,930
So this one involves using like along with a case statement it's a little bit complicated.

120
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,420
So we're doing the same thing we're recounting number of users but we're doing it dependent on the provider.

121
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,950
So we're going to have a case statement so we'll just start right off with select we'll do case and

122
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,210
I like to do my end as well.

123
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,700
I think we called it provider.

124
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,600
Yep.

125
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:04,530
So we'll start with that and will do from users and what is our case.

126
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,570
Well we can start with this Yahoo.

127
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:15,870
One will say when email is like Yahoo then provider is Yahoo.

128
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,910
Right.

129
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:25,310
So we'll will do the same thing just basically copy this and say when email is like at gmail dot com

130
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:34,520
and in Gmail then gmail one thing I should note there is this kind of nicer way of doing this if you

131
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,660
are familiar with regular expressions but thats out of the scope of this course.

132
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,540
But if you do know it you can get by with that.

133
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,700
So we've also got Hotmail

134
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,410
than Hotmail.

135
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,410
There we go.

136
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,900
OK.

137
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,650
Then finally we'll have or else which will just be other.

138
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:01,530
So we have this provider field now a column that will have gmail yahoo hotmail or other.

139
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:09,340
So let's do e-mail Khama case so that we can see the email side by side against what we pulled out of

140
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:09,580
it.

141
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,530
We got 500.

142
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,050
Take this one re-adapt more one at gmail.

143
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,280
We get gmail.

144
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,040
Ruben Medhurst at Yahoo.

145
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,340
We get Yahoo.

146
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,060
Perfect.

147
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,740
So now just a matter of grouping them together and counting.

148
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,100
So we can get rid of e-mail.

149
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:32,430
We don't need to display it then we're just going to group by provider which is what we just created.

150
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,600
So let's start with that.

151
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,330
Cool.

152
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,460
So we're grouping them together.

153
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,040
Looks like we don't have any others in this case.

154
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,990
We're going to group them.

155
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:49,070
And then finally we're going to count after our case statement ends we added comma count star

156
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,340
copy paste.

157
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,560
And there's just a small discrepancy which is this is called total users.

158
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,280
Also this is sorted.

159
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,650
Very easy to change.

160
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:09,800
Call it has total users like to capitalize that actually.

161
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,530
And then finally well let's just make sure that that works to start.

162
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,650
Great.

163
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:25,070
Now we need to sort of order by total users and if we do it this way you'll see that it's ascending.

164
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,300
We want to do the sending.

165
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:33,000
Right now we've got all the providers on the left and their total number of users.

166
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,500
Perfect.

167
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:34,890
All right.

168
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,380
So hopefully enjoyed that chance of working with more data though isn't hard coded in some of its dynamic

169
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,320
all of its namak 500 plus users.

170
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,870
Next up in this next section we're finally going to connect the database we just created which is filled

171
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,370
with all that see data and we're going to connect it with a web application and figure out how to get

172
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,140
those to talk.
