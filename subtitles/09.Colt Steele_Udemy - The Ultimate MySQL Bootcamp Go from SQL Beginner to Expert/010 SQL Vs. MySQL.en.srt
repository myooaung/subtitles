00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,490
So in this video we're going to talk about one of the more common questions that comes up early on which

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:12,410
is what is the difference between my ask her will and as well or I usually just say sequel.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,110
But what's the difference between these two.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,490
Obviously sequel is contained in the name of my essay.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,730
Well what's the significance of that.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:28,320
So let's start off with discussing sequel which stands for structured query language.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,470
So the sequel is the language that we use when we talk to our databases.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:42,750
It's the way that we interact and access the data update data delete things and basically manipulate

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,840
the data in our databases.

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:51,090
It's the language we use so it's how we do things like find all users.

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,560
Now what I'm showing you here is not actual sequel code you'll see that in just a second.

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,200
These are just humanised versions.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,640
Find all users who are 18 years old.

14
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,160
Add a new user with username jumbo Jim or if you want to get crazy.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,600
Delete every single user.

16
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,990
So these are the sort of things that we use sequel to do.

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,150
So we write these lines which are called queries structured query language.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,150
And once we hit enter or once we run that sequence code it's executed and it goes off and it talks to

19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,210
our database and it does it for us.

20
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,760
So if you are curious what it looks like here's a really quick one line preview.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,780
The English version find all users who are 18 or older is translated into this select star from users

22
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,440
where age is greater than or equal to 18 semi-colon.

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,370
So hopefully that actually seems pretty straightforward.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,980
Now we're going to dive into a sequel.

25
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,120
All throughout this course you don't need to worry about this exact statement.

26
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,450
What's important though is that you can see there is a special syntax we use and that this query here

27
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,830
is going to be sent off to interact the database somewhere.

28
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,770
So the next point I want to make is that when we work with my AS Well we're actually writing sequel

29
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,670
all the time.

30
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,350
So my S Q Will is what we talked about earlier.

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,990
A database management system and there's a bunch of them out there.

32
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,730
Here's some common ones.

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,130
Post gresse sequel light Oracle.

34
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:33,000
Those hundreds of others and there's dozens of popular ones but hundreds of them all over the world

35
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,830
that maybe aren't as popular.

36
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,860
So all of these ones here that I've highlighted use as Cuil or sequel.

37
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,390
That doesn't mean every database ever does.

38
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,000
But what are called relational databases do.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,950
And we'll talk more about that later when we discussed tables.

40
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:55,920
But for now the point I want to make is that as well it's not unique to my school or to postscripts.

41
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,080
That's why they all have this as Cuil in their name.

42
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:07,950
They share this language so structured query language sequel is a standard basically that these relational

43
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,530
database management systems like my Escuela implement.

44
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,680
So it's kind of a lot of jargon and terminology again but the main takeaway is that when we use something

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,360
like my Eskil will actually be writing sequel all the time.

46
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:29,730
So here's an example of what a line of sequel code looks like to do the exact same thing in my sequel

47
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,820
database and a postgresql database.

48
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,430
Here's the my as well.

49
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,860
And here's the post press and hopefully you notice they are identical.

50
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,910
Both of these are different database management systems.

51
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,380
They have differences to them but they both use as well.

52
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,240
You will be writing as well when you interact with these databases.

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,720
So just to hit that home there are slight differences in the syntax.

54
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,610
They are not identical but they are very very similar.

55
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,420
Oh and I'd better not forget to mention the sequel standard.

56
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,830
So the way that this whole thing works is that there is a standard for how sequels should work.

57
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,470
It's kind of it's actually written down.

58
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:20,430
You can read it online and all these different database management systems basically are tasked with

59
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,320
implementing that standard in their own database and making it work and they deviate sometimes a little

60
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,670
bit.

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,080
But for the most part they're very very similar.

62
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,470
So the two takeaways here.

63
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:38,310
One is that once you learn sequel it's really not that hard to switch to another database that also

64
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,360
uses sequel.

65
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,720
So you're learning my ask.

66
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:47,460
Well you could pretty easily switch to postgresql or to sequel light with not a lot of time needed to

67
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,240
get up to speed.

68
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,800
And the second thing is that what makes databases or database management systems to be specific what

69
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,630
makes them unique are the features that they offer.

70
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,070
Not the sequel or the language itself.

71
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,630
So if we go back to this diagram all of these use as well but that doesn't mean that they're identical.

72
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,150
And yes you might write the same line of code to do the same thing here.

73
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,720
So what makes these different or the features that they implement things like.

74
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,860
How secure is one versus the other how.

75
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,310
How fast is it how much how big is the download.

76
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,220
How do user permissions work and on and on and on.

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,070
And we'll talk more about what those differences are when we get to a point where they actually make

78
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,170
a little bit more sense.

79
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,520
I don't want to just talk to you.

80
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,580
OK.

81
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,510
So this was about my ask Cuil versus sequel.

82
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:47,770
Sequel is structured query language it exists separately from my well and my well is a database management

83
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,960
system that implements as well.
