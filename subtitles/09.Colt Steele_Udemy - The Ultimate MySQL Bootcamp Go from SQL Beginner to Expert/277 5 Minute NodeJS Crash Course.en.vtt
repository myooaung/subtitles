1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.510
OK.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.710
So it's time for a five minute crash course of note and Javascript.

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.770
Obviously that's not enough time to even scratch the surface.

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.940
But I'm just going to show you the basics of what you need to know for us to continue on with the course.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.770
OK.

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.370
So back over in cloud 9 we will delete everything.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.660
Get rid of it so you can do that either.

8
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.600
If you want to use a command line you can do use Ahram and armed dash R.F. or just highlight what you

9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.350
need to delete right quick.

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.330
And where's that.

11
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.260
And then we'll say yes to all you want to remove all of it and Humphrey now can get rid of some of this

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.610
stuff.

13
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.720
Perfect.

14
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.180
Make some space.

15
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.860
I'll bring this up a bit.

16
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.660
Now all that we're going to do is make our first javascript file we can call it whatever we want.

17
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.180
You can either use touch genius or what you know you don't have to call it app dodgiest where you can

18
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.340
right click over here and click on new file.

19
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.140
I'll do that one and I will call this oh I'll do it.

20
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.090
It's a standard name.

21
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.090
OK.

22
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.220
And I won't recreate it down here.

23
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.900
Now we'll open it up double quick and we'll add some javascript in here.

24
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.570
So what I want to show you is this basic workflow with node that we kind of saw already we type some

25
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:25.190
in a file we save it and then we execute the file with the command node space and then the name of the

26
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.750
file.

27
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.980
So it's very similar at least in principle to what we did with the sequel files where we had save a

28
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.120
sequel file ending and as well.

29
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.570
Put something in there a query then we would execute it using source and then some file name as well.

30
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.150
Same idea.

31
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.390
So I'm going to show you some very simple code.

32
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.320
There's something called And again if you know this stuff.

33
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.030
Feel free to skip it.

34
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.220
Something called Constant Aag kind of the simplest possible commands you can do in my ask.

35
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.720
It will just print something out.

36
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.230
So we can do our basic hello.

37
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.010
We don't need caps.

38
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.760
Hello world.

39
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.920
We'll put a semi-colon there which should seem familiar from my school at least.

40
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.960
And let's start with this.

41
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.870
Our first application very basic when all we need to do to execute is come down here and type node and

42
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:27.780
the name of the file which we called app dot J.S. and it runs silly but it works OK.

43
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.390
So that doesn't seem useful of course but it's something right.

44
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.850
And to see kind of why a programming language would be useful let's at least do this 500 times.

45
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.910
Maybe that's not useful but we can at least see how it's helpful at doing something that we can't do

46
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.580
on our own.

47
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.600
So we can create a simple loop

48
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.710
will do less than five hundred.

49
00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.220
Now in my other courses this is like an entire video five or 10 minutes with exercises but not going

50
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.360
to spend time on that.

51
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.310
What this does is it says whatever's inside of here.

52
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.880
Repeat 500 times.

53
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.810
Basically this is a counter saying OK we're starting at zero.

54
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.030
And every time through the loop we're going to add one to I which is what this does here.

55
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.910
So we go 0 next time around 1 to 3.

56
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.570
Keep going while it's less than five hundred as soon as it hits 500 we're done.

57
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.180
OK.

58
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.430
So if I just put that in there whatever's in these brackets here will happen 500 times.

59
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.610
Let's do it now.

60
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.170
One thing I could add that I probably should is this var key word it's just don't worry about it.

61
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.190
But it's important to have it there.

62
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.990
Now if I run it scroll up can see get hundreds of the world's Well 500.

63
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.610
So imagine you might be wondering why you care.

64
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.210
Well imagine instead of console log.

65
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.470
What if we had insert a new user into the database.

66
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.800
That would be a fantastic way to quickly see a database with a bunch of data.

67
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.830
Remember how we had to do this obnoxious copy and paste.

68
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.700
So I would give you a file you would copy and paste it like for the movies data and reviews areas these

69
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.360
big files you have to copy and paste it in.

70
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.970
It's an awful way of getting sampled data.

71
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.990
Well we can use javascript to create data for us.

72
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.120
So just a couple other things I'll show you.

73
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.180
You know we can do math and basic things like five plus five.

74
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.000
And I won't do this 500 times.

75
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.970
We can comment things out selecting them and doing command slash.

76
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.430
So that won't run anymore.

77
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.900
So now I'm only running five plus five.

78
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.670
You can see we get 10.

79
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.920
One other thing to address is what what is node if you're not familiar with it.

80
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.690
And that's actually a pretty common question.

81
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.190
There's a bit of confusion about.

82
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.190
No no.

83
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.830
Yes.

84
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.220
Which is what is called and regular Javascript.

85
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.730
And what the difference is basically Javascript is a programming language was created first.

86
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.010
It's been around for a while and it's existed as a language that you can use on the client side.

87
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.190
So what that means is that back on this diagram there's a line right here not right now but imagine

88
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.750
a line.

89
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.040
This is the client side so I could write javascript code that did things over on someone like on my

90
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.310
computer you could write code that would animate something or make a game or just add some pretty effects.

91
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.610
That's not to say that it's not powerful.

92
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.210
But traditionally it was used to decorate pages if you will and it had nothing to do with databases.

93
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.660
It had nothing to do with servers.

94
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.400
You would use another language over here like DHP and you would use javascript's on the client side

95
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:46.170
of the front end but then node came around about five years ago now and what it is is an implementation

96
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.600
of javascript written so that you can use it on the backend so that you can do things like this you

97
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.060
can create a server with javascript instead of having to do it with Ruby or THP and you can talk to

98
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.380
a database like any other server side language.

99
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:09.240
So to summarize that node is javascript it uses basically the exact same syntax but you can use it on

100
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.240
the backend which is what we'll be doing in this course.
