1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,550
So we've covered creating and reading.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,400
Now we're on to updating our shirts.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,870
So the first problem is to update all polo shirts and change their size to be large.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:21,630
So we'll start by just selecting polo shirts select star from shirts where article equals polo shirt

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,850
just like that.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,490
OK so this is what we get and what we want to do is change shirt size to be large.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:38,170
So we need to keep this copy it now and then will type out update shirts set.

8
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,560
And we want to change shirts size to now be large.

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,340
And where do we want to do that only wear article is polo shirt.

10
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,610
Hit enter.

11
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,830
We get three roads affected.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,590
Three rows changed.

13
00:00:53,770 --> 00:01:01,990
Now if we go back and run our same select We should see all polo shirts are now large as we could do

14
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,030
the same thing just to see it in the grand scheme of things.

15
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,710
There we go.

16
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,910
We have three largest now.

17
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:18,140
All polo shirt the next problem is to update the shirt last worn 15 days ago and change the last one

18
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,650
to be zero.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:32,120
So we'll start by just selecting that shirt like we did earlier where last worn equals 15.

20
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,690
There it is.

21
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:38,190
Tank top blue medium last one 15 days ago and we wore it today.

22
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,150
It was a hot day.

23
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,450
Needed a tank top and we want to update it last one to be zero.

24
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:56,680
So update Schertz set last warn equal to zero where last one is currently 15.

25
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,140
We get one row affected one changed.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,060
Let's do our select again.

27
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,810
We no longer have it.

28
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,670
But now if we say select where lost where and zero we have two shirts this T-shirt that was already

29
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,220
there in our blue tank top we just added.

30
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,960
Perfect.

31
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:21,320
So the final update is to update all white shirts change their size to extra small and at the same time

32
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,900
change their color to off white.

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,370
So this needs to happen all at once.

34
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,820
You can't do two lines.

35
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,200
I mean you could but that's against the rules for this problem.

36
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:41,910
So let's start off by just selecting all white shirts like star from shirts where color equals white.

37
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,440
No way.

38
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,050
Get rid of that extra L there.

39
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,710
Here we go.

40
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,140
So we have two shirts a T-shirt that's.

41
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,970
It's small and a tank top.

42
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,630
That's white.

43
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,720
That's small.

44
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,500
So we want to change color to be off white and shirt size to be extra small because we shrink them and

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,810
we mix them with colored stuff in the washing machine.

46
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,790
So their colors now off white.

47
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:18,330
So to do that let's start with the first part update shirts and we'll set color to be off white and

48
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:29,010
then we'll do the second part with a comma shirt size equals x x x or small just like that and then

49
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:37,160
we'll do our where color currently equals white and that should do it.

50
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,610
Fingers crossed.

51
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,220
No typos.

52
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,010
Now if we go back and select where color is white we should have nothing.

53
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,780
But if we say we're color is off white we should have two that are extra smalls or we could of course

54
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,020
do select star from shirts to check our work.

55
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,610
We have extra small off white X or small off white.

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,150
OK.

57
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,010
So that problem is just making sure that you could update multiple fields at once making sure you understood

58
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,720
that.

59
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,790
OK that's it for update.

60
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,020
Next we move onto the delete.
