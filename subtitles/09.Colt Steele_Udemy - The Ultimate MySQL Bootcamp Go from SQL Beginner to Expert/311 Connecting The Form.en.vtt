00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.090
OK so picking up where we left off for you remember in the last video where we got the age team up and

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.880
running the Ejay Yes file I said ignore the form for now we're coming back to that.

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.400
Well now as a video where we're going to get that form working and it involves a couple of new concepts.

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.780
So hang in there.

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.790
The minus Cuil part is the same.

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.650
We've already seen how to insert.

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.120
If we go back to this early Where's that.

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.550
Here we go we've seen how to insert this single file you know we inserted this single rescue of the

9
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.360
dog.

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.820
We also saw how to do it with this object syntax and then we saw how to do a bulk insert with a lot

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.570
of them which we don't need to worry about.

12
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.400
So we've seen how to do this.

13
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.800
Now we need to figure out a couple of things.

14
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.380
One how do we get the data from the form.

15
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.450
This form here styled so this form user types or email and let's join now.

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.490
First of all where do they send that request to.

17
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.370
We need to figure that out and maybe you guessed this we need to define our route for that.

18
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.840
But there's a slight difference in that route to get to in second because there's another problem which

19
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.200
is how does that data from the form get there.

20
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.110
Well what we want to do is use what's known as a post route.

21
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.880
So there are different types of requests.

22
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.780
I briefly touched on this get and post request this is not of course an HTP.

23
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.660
So you kind of just have to take me at my word here that we need to use a post request because it allows

24
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.950
us to send data with the request the form will automatically take the data from here and send it as

25
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.520
a post request to the destination that we tell it to send it to.

26
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.290
So let me show you how we do that.

27
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.940
We've already seen it.

28
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.390
We deleted it honestly from the form.

29
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.680
So there's no suspense here.

30
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.170
We create a form element and the first thing we can do is add in method and method we all set to be

31
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.410
posted in all caps all lowercase it doesn't matter.

32
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.790
You'll see both.

33
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.610
And that is saying that when this form is submitted from the button the last button for Button is the

34
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.530
last thing in a form it will automatically submit the form to when it's submitted.

35
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.970
It's going to be a post request and we'll send it to a route that doesn't exist yet.

36
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.960
So we send that with action equals and then we could send it slash.

37
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.310
But that would just redirect us back here.

38
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.300
Except that needs to be a get request so we'll get to that in a moment.

39
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.790
But we could do slash register or make up a route that doesn't exist.

40
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.660
So right now this form is going to take us to a page that doesn't exist.

41
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.560
And if I try it

42
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.630
massive This is still much bigger than it is in reality it's about the size.

43
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.440
That's harder to read so I'm just increasing the font.

44
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.170
So if I enter something in here law click Join now tells me cannot post to slash register.

45
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.940
Great.

46
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.010
So we need to define a post-draft to register.

47
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.530
And again the reason we're doing posts is it allows us to send the form data.

48
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.890
But what I could also do if I did a request show you what happened.

49
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.770
We already have a get route to find a couple of them.

50
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.380
Let's do a get request to slash joke.

51
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.990
So what that means is that when this form is submitted it's going to send the data to slash joke as

52
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.650
it get which we already have.

53
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.840
That's what this get comes from after it gets last joke.

54
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.900
So if I really start and try again this time of five and to whatever they're in I click Join now.

55
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.680
You'll see it takes me to slash joke.

56
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.540
There's also a question mark here.

57
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.950
So that's something to consider.

58
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.910
What's happening is that our data isn't being sent because we're not giving it a name to be sent under.

59
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:44.730
So what we do is assign our input here and name and this will be the label for whatever this is right

60
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.650
here which is e-mail so that's the best thing we can put their e-mail.

61
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.610
So when our data is sent off by the form it will be referred to as e-mail.

62
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.210
And there's only one piece of data that we need if we had multiple things in our form we might have

63
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.890
e-mail on first name and last name and they could all have a name.

64
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.880
So now if we do it you don't need to restart the server to do that.

65
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.780
But now if I do lost at gmail dot com Nahit join now notice that my you are it's hard to read but it

66
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.850
says slash joke we sent to get requests.

67
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.330
US joke and then it appends e-mail equals blah.

68
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.980
Percent.

69
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.950
40 is what it's doing for the at sign gmail dot com.

70
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.460
So you can see our form data is making it here to a different request but this is not a poster request

71
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.330
and we want it to be a post request for work.

72
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.800
Really the main reason is that we don't want our data to be appended like this in RL.

73
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.520
We could get away with that the standard way of sending data from a form if you're adding it into a

74
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.010
database is to do it as a post request.

75
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.120
This is known as a query string that's a lot of terminology here.

76
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.090
This doesn't matter.

77
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.910
We don't want it to work this way.

78
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.500
I'm just telling you that it's not a conventional sign of a good practice.

79
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.510
If you're doing like a search form or something.

80
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.190
This makes sense and you may have noticed search forms and search results will often have a query strings

81
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.390
after the route.

82
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.610
We don't want that.

83
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:12.410
We want to send our data using a post request and not to slash joke but to slash register.

84
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.390
Now the problem is how do we create a route that will listen for that.

85
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.040
Essentially what we're trying to do back to this handy dandy animation is something like this.

86
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.020
Hello server.

87
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.710
I would like to sign up here's my e-mail.

88
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.000
Pass the e-mail to the server.

89
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.410
And then our note app or express app is going to take that e-mail and run an insert query with my s

90
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.620
q will ask who will hopefully says great.

91
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.830
It worked then we get back either something like this.

92
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.230
Thanks for registering page.

93
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.740
Or we just redirect back to the home so we'll decide on that.

94
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.310
So how do we get it to.

95
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.900
How do we get the Express app the right side here and the green to accept this email or even know that

96
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.140
a request is being made to slash register

97
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.190
with this app.

98
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.690
Post this is how we defined post-trib.

99
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.740
Just like a get route except it's after post.

100
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.280
Everything else is the same.

101
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:14.550
So let's do that now at post slash register which needs to match whatever we put here.

102
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.990
So if this was registration or create user then this needs to be registration or create user.

103
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.140
And our same request and response.

104
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.890
This will only be triggered when a post request is sent to slash register.

105
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:41.580
So just to prove that let's do a canceled blog post request sent to a cash register just like this.

106
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:51.140
And now if I restart my server if you go back here if I submit this form I'll make it take up half the

107
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.890
window here.

108
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.300
Watch down here and I go here in a type whatever I want in here and they click Join now.

109
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.940
Notice that we get our post request sent to slash register and if I try and get there another way.

110
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.500
Like probably just going to slash register.

111
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.620
This is sending a get request.

112
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.150
We haven't actually discussed that but when you just go click on a link or you enter or you are out

113
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.430
manually that is sending a get request and that's why it's telling me it can not get slashed register.

114
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.510
So essentially the only way that we're going to be able to in practice so that we'll be able to get

115
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.000
to this route here and trigger this code is through the form.

116
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.110
So one more time.

117
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.920
Put something in here.

118
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.870
Watch down there.

119
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.230
A post request it's being sent every time.

120
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.600
So what we want to do now is be able to extract the data that's being sent.

121
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.470
And for now you have to trust that it's being sent that are formed and it's being sent.

122
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.520
We don't have a way of seeing it in the way that we see it.

123
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.250
Oh boy it's a little bit complicated.

124
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.140
I mean they're walking through the steps here.

125
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.480
This is the annoying set up we have to do.

126
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.400
So we have to install something called body parser.

127
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.530
And I won't waste much time talking about it.

128
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:05.380
What's happening is that express is a lightweight framework which means that it doesn't come with everything

129
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.290
that you would possibly want preinstalled.

130
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.400
So we have to go and select certain things and body body parts are as one.

131
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.120
What it does is it parses the request body.

132
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:21.020
So remember that when a request is sent there's all this it's just a giant block of text.

133
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:27.790
And somewhere in there it says Email is equal to code whatever we typed in here.

134
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.540
But it's in a giant block of text.

135
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.000
It's not it's not javascript or anything.

136
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.080
So the parser will intercept that and turn it into javascript that we can then use and manipulate.

137
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:45.140
So then what we need to do and I'm just doing this quickly it's just copying and pasting importing body

138
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:51.080
parser equals required body parser so we can save that make sure a package that Jason has body parts

139
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.700
are in it.

140
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:57.020
Then finally we tell our app to use it.

141
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.460
So I'm also just going to copy that line and put it next to Epcot set.

142
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.910
We have our configuration lines together.

143
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.170
We're not going to go into detail on this line but this is just requiring body parts or doesn't do anything.

144
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:14.230
We have to tell Express which is app or write app is from express that we're using body parts.

145
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:23.490
And this now allows us to extract information from post requests and here's some magic line request

146
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.540
dot body dot email.

147
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:32.930
So what this will now store in the request body in that post route under e-mail will be the email address

148
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.940
coming from the form.

149
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:40.130
So let me show you that if we go to our post-draft for register rather than consulate log post request

150
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:46.560
sent to slash user will also add plus request up by email.

151
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:51.150
Email is that request up body that e-mail.

152
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.180
OK.

153
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:58.640
So we definitely need to make sure that we have name equals email and then we should be good to go assuming

154
00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.700
our install went OK.

155
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.190
That started the server again.

156
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.070
It looks good.

157
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.090
Let's go over here.

158
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.770
Just going to refresh this page.

159
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.480
Now I'll type C at gmail dot com.

160
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:10.980
Sure.

161
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.390
Now and what do you know.

162
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.900
Post requests sent to slash registered e-mail is see at gmail dot com.

163
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:25.060
So whatever is typed into that form is being stored in request up body as email.

164
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.600
So body pursers doing the heavy lifting for us here.

165
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.160
We had to do a couple of annoying lines.

166
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.080
But let me show you what body looks like.

167
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.830
So request up body on its own.

168
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.280
So I'm going to comment that line out were not canceled out logging anything.

169
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:50.230
Now if we go back to the form refresh and I type I don't know h at gmail dot com and click Join now.

170
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.160
This is what our request body looks like.

171
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.960
Email is HHG mailbag.

172
00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:02.130
Com Again e-mail is coming from here but if I get rid of body parts Sure let me show you what life is

173
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.620
like without it.

174
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.260
And I do the same exact thing.

175
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.050
H a teammate dot com.

176
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.310
Now there is no request of body.

177
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.700
It's undefined.

178
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.370
I did everything else the same.

179
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:21.510
So just this single line telling her to use body purser is what allows us to access request our body

180
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:26.550
so the information is still being sent to express express.

181
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.900
It's just not doing anything with it.

182
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.400
Request of body is what we need along with this body part of the line to start using it.

183
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.190
So it's kind of confusing but that's the whole ethos of.

184
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.550
EXPRESS Is that you add the tools you need as you need them.

185
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.700
So rather than giving you everything at once and you might only use one out of 20 things it gives you

186
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.260
one thing two things.

187
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.840
And then you go and grab the other things you need.

188
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.230
So if you need post requests you need a request a body to be filled in with data.

189
00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.730
Then we need a body person.

190
00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.740
OK.

191
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:04.770
So then all we really need to do now if we're isolating request body email that's the e-mail that's

192
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:05.600
being sent.

193
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.170
Let's save it to a variable

194
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:15.090
now we just need to insert that make a new user which we've already seen how to do.

195
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:20.510
And I won't make as you know type it from scratch but we're going to be doing connection.

196
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.220
Queried and we've already seen how to do that query.

197
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:30.710
It's going to be an insert into if we go back let's just copy this code here this is what we've done

198
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:38.880
in the past where we inserted a single user go to app Julius.

199
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.510
So I have it commented out uncommented.

200
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.530
There's a couple of things we're doing.

201
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:49.550
The first I made a variable called person with an e-mail and created app but we don't need that created

202
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.770
out anymore because this is for F.A..

203
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.360
We actually have a real created.

204
00:12:54.460 --> 00:13:00.090
And then for requests up body to email you can just replace that.

205
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.570
OK so we can get rid of that variable too.

206
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.370
So this is just preparing the data to be inserted.

207
00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:11.050
We'll have a person object that has an e-mail request by email and then we need to do here we can not

208
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:19.680
we don't need to store in a variable is just a connection that query insert into users set to pass in

209
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.630
person.

210
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:22.980
And then we have our callback function.

211
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.300
So this is a review we've already seen how to insert.

212
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.260
So I want to spend a ton of time on it rather.

213
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.650
Well we can start by just constantly logging the result which will be a lot of stuff hopefully.

214
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.170
Let's see what happens now.

215
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.900
We have body parts are working again.

216
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.400
OK good.

217
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:45.940
Now if I go over here this time it will insert a real user so let's do more serious e-mail address.

218
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.210
Well I guess that doesn't matter about Miranda.

219
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:54.700
Let's not do all caps or end five for at hotmail dot com.

220
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.830
And there you go join now and look what we get back.

221
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.880
Affected rose 1.

222
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.780
It says OK pack it.

223
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.290
All this other stuff.

224
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:12.280
And if we went in to our might as well if we wanted to do a select star well it's going to take a bit.

225
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.610
Let's do what I have to type it ourselves.

226
00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:26.480
Like start from users quarter by created at limit 1.

227
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:31.810
We don't have a users table in all caps so boy we get the wrong user.

228
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.050
Scared me for a moment.

229
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:39.640
We need to also change the order at order by created at to be descending.

230
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.510
And here we go Miranda 54 at hotmail so it worked.

231
00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.950
Long story short it worked and we're pretty much done.

232
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.190
The only other thing we have to decide is OK are web apps just kind of hanging here.

233
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.230
You can see that.

234
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.580
What do we do next.

235
00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:04.780
And we could either do something like a red dot send thanks for joining our waitlists.

236
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.940
Let's say we can start with that.

237
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:13.840
And if we restart the server do it again have someone try and sign up the new e-mail.

238
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:22.650
Let's say Jane Doe at gmail dot com click and now now we get.

239
00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:23.910
Thanks for joining our waitlist.

240
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.960
So it's totally up to you how you want to structure this part.

241
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.480
What I'm going to do is just have it redirect back to the same page to the original page here and we'll

242
00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:37.360
be able to see 503 or 504 it's really up to you.

243
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:42.500
This is how you you wouldn't use redstart send you could do a render and you could make a thank you

244
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.230
page if you wanted to.

245
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:50.530
But what I'm going to do is show you another line which is just redstart redirect.

246
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.540
So Reade's being response appear redstart redirect to slash.

247
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.530
Now just take us back to the home page.

248
00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:04.830
So effectively what's happening right restart time is we're on the home page 504 is how many we just

249
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.060
got from the database.

250
00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.170
I entered a new one Dave at Dave dot com.

251
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.470
I clicked your and now it's going to hit this post route slash register.

252
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:20.450
We're extracting that e-mail from that form data in the body and then we're inserting it as a new person

253
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.560
in a new user in our database.

254
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:29.420
When that finishes we're redirecting back to slash which starts this whole process over.

255
00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:34.140
It's going to then select all the count of all users.

256
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:40.310
Then it's going to was my cat and it's going to render our home page with that count.

257
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.470
So to the user it will just look like this page refreshes.

258
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.530
And this goes from five a four to five or five.

259
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.880
But behind the scenes a lot more is happening.

260
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.510
And there we go.

261
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:50.690
OK.

262
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.810
So that's awesome.

263
00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.070
Hopefully you think that's cool.

264
00:16:53.070 --> 00:17:00.270
All we have left is to style it if you would like a little bit more detail on the in the insert part.

265
00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.800
And I can go over that a bit more if you'd like.

266
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.700
And what's happening here.

267
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.510
But if you feel like you've got a grasp on it you want to move on to styling.

268
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.410
Go ahead.

269
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.280
OK.

270
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.250
So just to reiterate we could have also done a little bit more manually if we wanted to we could have

271
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.950
written a query like this.

272
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:26.220
If I did var query and I could have done insert into user's e-mail so this would be more familiar.

273
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.110
Values.

274
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:39.820
And then I would do print the C plus request body data email plus close the closing parentheses like

275
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:40.540
that.

276
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.500
And that could be our query.

277
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.050
So this would turn into let's say request.

278
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.660
Email.

279
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:54.930
Dave had Dave dotcom it would turn into Dave at Dave dot com like that.

280
00:17:55.450 --> 00:18:03.440
So we could eat we could also do this query this way and then we would need to do is pass.

281
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.170
Q Right here if that makes sense.

282
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.570
So that's another way of doing it.

283
00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:14.080
But this is kind of the standard way of doing it with the my s q library at the mass Q package that

284
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:14.850
we've been using.

285
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.470
So I'm going to get rid of that.

286
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.870
But either way maybe this syntax is more unfamiliar.

287
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:26.330
If you don't know javascript put it this is what we already saw as as to how to insert a single piece

288
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:31.730
of information a single row into a table and it's working great.
