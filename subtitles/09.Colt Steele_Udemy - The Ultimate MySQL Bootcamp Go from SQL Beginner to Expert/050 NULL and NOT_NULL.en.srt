00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,170
This video we're going to answer a simple question.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:10,760
Back when we typed describe table names to describe cats What's up with this part.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,580
What is this.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,010
No column here in this little table.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,540
And why is there to is for name and age.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
So this video is all about.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:20,940
No.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,100
The concept of No.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,500
I've been working with no sequel.

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:31,490
So to start off let's talk about what NO means NO basically means that the value is on known.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,430
It's sequels way of saying I don't know what this is or there is no specified value.

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,570
An important note is that it does not mean zero.

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,730
Some people often think no means zero.

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,600
It doesn't in this context.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,910
So to illustrate the significance of these having a yes here it basically means that these are permitted

16
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:49,960
to be No.

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,780
It's OK if they have an unknown value and that's that happens by default.

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,680
To illustrate though that that is the case.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,190
Here's a little bit of code right now.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,960
We could run this command.

21
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:09,460
We have a catch table with name and age but we could do insert into cats and only specify a name.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,340
And in this case I used Alabama not sure who named her cat Alabama but you could probably say who names

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,600
are cat blue which is what I named my cat so we could run this command.

24
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,220
And Age has no specified value.

25
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,750
So in fact let's try it right now.

26
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,360
Make some space inserts into cats.

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,010
Name.

28
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,100
Values is the siren.

29
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:49,740
Our Bama just like that we don't get any warnings or anything saying that name her that age is empty.

30
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,830
Nothing like that.

31
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:59,140
Now would you like star from cat you'll see that we have a new cat whose name is Alabama.

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,810
But age is no.

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:09,120
And again that's because we have no oil as a permitted value or it's technically not of value but age

34
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,240
is allowed to be no.

35
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,620
So his name so I could do the same thing or an even more extreme version.

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,340
I could run this insert into cats nothing values nothing.

37
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:32,190
You know if I did that take a moment to guess insert into cats nothing values nothing.

38
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,640
What do you think will happen.

39
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,280
Let's do a select star.

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,230
Now we have cat no name no age no.

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,050
So then the question becomes how do we prevent that.

42
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,430
How do we require that name is not know and that age is not enough.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,800
And the answer is not no.

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:59,080
So what we can do is specify when we actually define a table that something let's say a field like name

45
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,770
is not all.

46
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,070
And we use this syntax right here.

47
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:11,250
So here's an example for a cat to table and I'll be using this convention Cat 2 Cat 3.

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:19,160
So in a cat to table or 2.00 version when we define it we would say name is Vardar.

49
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,760
This time I use 100 but the limit doesn't matter really followed by not no.

50
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,280
So that means that it will not be permitted to be empty.

51
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,990
And then age is also an IT age is an integer who is also not no.

52
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:42,690
So if we try that right now I'm going to create a table Kappes too.

53
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:53,820
And we're going to have and I'll do this on separate lines name is Vardar 100.

54
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,920
It's OK.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,620
This one you can have longer names and then you have not know followed by age.

56
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,320
Isn't it also not know what hit enter.

57
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:22,390
Now let's start off by using describe cats to this time under no for both fields says no.

58
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,200
So that's one way to tell that these are not allowed to be No.

59
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,500
And just to emphasize this I made a slide.

60
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,570
Notice the difference here.

61
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,050
So now let's actually put it to the test.

62
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:43,610
Let's try to insert into Cat 2 and this time will only do name and we'll leave off age and then we'll

63
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:49,310
have values and name for this one will be Texas.

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,960
In keeping with the state theme.

65
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,400
OK.

66
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,830
What do you think will happen.

67
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,540
Insert into cats where age is not allowed.

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:09,020
No but we're not specifying age so it says queery OK we didn't get an error message and we got a warning.

69
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,730
So let's do show warnings warning field.

70
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,340
Age doesn't have a default value.

71
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,600
So what it's telling me is that I left age off I didn't specify it.

72
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,600
So what it was going to do is make it no.

73
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,120
But then no not allowed to be no.

74
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,060
So I need to go find a default value and there's not a default value specified.

75
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:37,220
So if we look you can probably guess her next or next video will be on default values.

76
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:44,930
But if we do select star from Cat 2 you can see it automatically defined 0.

77
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,620
So the next video we'll talk about why that happened but the way that it works if it's not allowed we

78
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,650
know you don't have a default it's going to be zero.

79
00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:02,800
Now let's try the same thing with insert into Cat 2 and this time only age is specified and age will

80
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,990
be 7 I get the same query OK.

81
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,800
One morning show warnings.

82
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,640
This time it says field name doesn't have a default value.

83
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,720
Let's do our select star.

84
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,800
Notice what we get right here earlier.

85
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,780
See how far back I can go.

86
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,140
We had no.

87
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:30,040
1 we didn't specify a name when we inserted into cats just regular cats not cats too.

88
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,830
But now when I don't specify a name it doesn't say no.

89
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,090
And this is an empty string.

90
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,520
So there's a difference.

91
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,760
No means that there is no value at all.

92
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:47,410
We didn't specify empty string is just a type of a VAR char that just has nothing in it.

93
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,340
So you can think of it as this basically.

94
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,260
OK so next we'll talk about how we specify these default values.
