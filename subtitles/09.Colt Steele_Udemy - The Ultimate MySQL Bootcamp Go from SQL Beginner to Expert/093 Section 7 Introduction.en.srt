00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,000
A welcome to another one of these videos at the beginning of a section where I just make a fool of myself

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,710
do something ridiculous this time.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,020
We're working with books.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,440
You can see it got more props.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,740
Just really love props on this course.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,420
And they're here for a reason because in this section we're getting introduced to our new data set.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,610
So for the next couple of seconds we're going to be working with one dataset that I'm going to give

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,070
you and it has to do with books and books make a particularly good dataset because there is a lot of

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,360
data to model.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:38,940
We've got things like you know titles up the authors how many authors there are things like reviews

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:46,470
ratings page count release dates tons of information for all different sizes of books and giant prop

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,540
books medium small books all that fun stuff.

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:56,730
And our back story here to very weak backstory is that we run a small online bookstore and we're being

14
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,740
just slaughtered by Amazon.

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,020
So we're fighting back.

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:06,960
The only way we know how much is redoing our database inventory management system so that's what we're

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,610
going to do.

18
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,690
We're going to fight back by redoing our database and that will be what we start the section doing.

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,120
But then once we have that data in the database we're going to move on to learning a bunch of new commands

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,170
and those commands all are called string functions.

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,800
So explain what those mean in just a little bit.

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,250
I don't want to make this video too long.

23
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,250
But basically they expand our way of selecting data and working with text or with strings.

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,000
Really important and kind of fun things that we can do.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,230
So we're going to go ahead and get started.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,110
Oh before I forget this book here it's a very important book.

27
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,100
This represents the book of equal knowledge.

28
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,690
Yeah.

29
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,920
Kind of regret this now but this is the book of equal knowledge.

30
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,020
You can ignore there's a bunch of bugs in here.

31
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,590
They're attracted to the light I can ignore that part.

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,940
Our book of equal knowledge doesn't have any bugs in it.

33
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,020
We are bug free.

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,580
Anyways I think I should probably end it here.

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,970
I'll see you in the next video.
