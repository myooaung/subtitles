1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,690
All right.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,490
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,650
So we're moving on to our next question here.

4
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,810
Even though this one actually isn't framed as a question there's no question mark.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,450
But that doesn't make it any less relevant or less real world.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,010
In fact this is one that I think is a really common operation a common question to ask and it has to

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,320
do with inactive users.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,880
So across any sort of startup or online app company there's often you know users who sign up create

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,490
an account and then do nothing whether it means never posting or never buying something never converting

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:38,850
from a free account to a paid account like in the case of Spotify or never in my case.

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,530
You know this is a real example for my courses.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,810
Students who sign up and then never start it never make it past the first video.

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,910
They're at 0 percent and I'm actually able to send targeted.

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,580
I think once a month twice a month I can send an email update and I can target that to specific segments

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:04,380
so if I updated an introduction section to a course and I only wanted to let students know who haven't

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,940
started yet and want to target them and say hey by the way I notice you haven't started yet.

17
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,200
Well this is a good time to start.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,280
I just revamped the whole intro.

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,700
I could do that based off of what we're going to be doing here.

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,780
Of course our data in our database is set up differently but it's the same idea.

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,770
So this is a really common thing and all we're going to try and do is for our Instagram cloner fake

22
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,770
Instagram we're trying to identify users who have never posted a photo.

23
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:35,280
So they've signed up and never posted anything and we want our users to be more engaged.

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,600
For a bunch of reasons you know we want higher engagement on our app which means that we could you know

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,130
have a higher valuation potentially or sell ads for more maybe get higher investments.

26
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,200
All that kind of stuff.

27
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,770
We want people posting if they're signed up it looks bad to have dead accounts people who sign up and

28
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,880
then give up.

29
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,640
So we're going to try and send an e-mail.

30
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,300
We're not worrying about doing that but how are we going to target these people who have never posted

31
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,010
a photo.

32
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,890
First step let's identify them.

33
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,580
And essentially we're going to need to work with a users table and the photos table.

34
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:16,810
So I'll add my three here which is identify inactive users users with no photos.

35
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,340
OK.

36
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,070
So you've probably gathered we need to do a join.

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,050
We're going to be working with the users table so we can start there.

38
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:33,150
Select start from users and you know we have 100 something users but we can't see who's done what because

39
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,480
we have the photos table.

40
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,070
And if we do our select start from photos just to jog your memory.

41
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,760
Well I guess we haven't actually seen all of our data here yet.

42
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,710
We've got about exactly 257 photos but a lot of them are done by the same user.

43
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:54,960
So this here is user ID if I scroll way up here we go we can see you know these the these are all posted

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,470
by the same user so three these are all from the same user.

45
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,170
These are often the same user but then we have some users who haven't posted anything.

46
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,880
But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at the photos because these are the posted photos.

47
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,520
So what we need to do is join these two together and hopefully you know what we need to do.

48
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,060
If I just do a regular inner join.

49
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,660
Inner join Fotos.

50
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,960
And where do we want to do it.

51
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:31,950
Want to join on users thought Id equals photos dot user ID and if we run this now

52
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,660
it's a mess.

53
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,010
So let's focus on just the things we need.

54
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:46,280
So rather than star can do username maybe the image you Aro and we can just start with those two.

55
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,000
All right so we can see you know all these user names and what they've submitted.

56
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,480
But the problem here is that this doesn't account for the people who haven't submitted anything.

57
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,420
So if there was a user who didn't submit something they're not showing up here because we're doing an

58
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,860
inner join which remember is the intersection of both circles the left and the right where they overlap.

59
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:14,150
But what we want is to identify where users on the left have no overlap on the right for photos.

60
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:22,790
So we can change this to a left join and that one change for a rerun this will have to scroll a bit.

61
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,740
There we go.

62
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,920
You can see we have certain users who have a knoll over here and that's referring to the fact that they

63
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,230
have no photos corresponding to them.

64
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,460
So there's a couple of them as I go here and that's what we want to be able to identify.

65
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:45,390
So we're almost there actually all that we need to do is only select the users that have photos of no

66
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,310
essentially And of course if I go back to having star here it's not just image you are all that.

67
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,770
No it's everything in photos it's hard to see.

68
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,920
Here's an example.

69
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,310
But we've got a couple of nos here.

70
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:04,130
We've got the image or the photo I.D. we've got the image you know you've got the user idea for a photo

71
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,630
and then we have it created at it's not.

72
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,490
So all four things are no.

73
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,230
We just need to focus on one of them.

74
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,410
It doesn't matter which one.

75
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,970
So I'll go back to that just adding a user name here and we can do that it doesn't matter really let's

76
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:27,620
do immature again and then we want to do is Ad-Aware down here but we can't just say where photos dot.

77
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,190
You know we can just do ID equals all that doesn't work remember and all is weird.

78
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,120
So we need to do.

79
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,930
Where photo start ID is.

80
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,850
And this could be anything on the photo side.

81
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,670
It could be photos that I.D. could be photos that image you or photos that user id any of them.

82
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:51,430
So I'll just do it as I.D. and if I do this now you'll see.

83
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,230
And we actually don't even need to display that image you know.

84
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:01,810
But if I do that this is our list of users who have never posted anything for whatever reasons some

85
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:09,130
of them programmatically created them as bots which all they do is go comment and like other people's

86
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,280
photos they don't post anything themselves.

87
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:18,010
And then another persona of a user is a lurker which is somebody who has an account and they don't use

88
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:23,170
it all that much but they just kind of look at people's photos maybe like some thing but they don't

89
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:23,610
really.

90
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,640
They definitely don't post and they don't comment.

91
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,870
They're kind of a silent member of the community.

92
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,910
So we get a decent number of them.

93
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,080
Sorry for that fire truck and that's all we need to do.

94
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,440
You know if we wanted to figure out how many.

95
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,750
That's another thing we can just add account in.

96
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,870
But we just want that username so that we can target them.

97
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,650
These are people who have never posted anything.

98
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,420
And just to note you know if you did this the other way around it would have worked just fine as well.

99
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,420
Do Fotos users and then right join

100
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,270
does the same thing.

101
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,670
So either way works.

102
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:06,030
But the key thing is that we're working with know where we have an intersection where some users and

103
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,020
some photos overlap.

104
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,100
Most of them do.

105
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,230
But then we also have that subset of users who have no photos.

106
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,210
And we need to also join those with no.

107
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,940
Which is how we were able to tell if they have no photos.

108
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,200
So here's my solution.

109
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,340
If you came up with something different post it and we can discuss it.

110
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,810
Moving on.
