1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,160
So let's talk about solutions to these.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,870
The first one to delete all four year old cats.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,040
All we need to do is start off and you don't have to do this but I like to start off by making sure

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,620
we're selecting things correctly just like start from cats where age equals four.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,940
We get Ringo and I just like to copy this

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,520
and do a delete from cats.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,720
And of course I forgot to add a space but the tweet from cats for ages for now if we do a let's do our

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,680
first select We should see nothing.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,340
And if we do a select star

10
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,560
we should see that we're now missing number one who was Ringo by Ringo.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,940
OK.

12
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,840
Next up do eat cats.

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,570
Whose age is the same as their cat ID.

14
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,420
So this one involved something slightly different.

15
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:05,240
Like I mentioned where we're not just checking for a specific piece of data like Breede equals Maine

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,050
Coon or age equals 12 but we're checking we're cat ID equals age.

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:20,800
So we'll do a select first Nexstar from cats where cat ID equals H.

18
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,180
Or you could do Agios cat ID and we get Jack Kaede idea seven ages 7.

19
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,010
Great.

20
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,120
So then we'll just copy this

21
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,530
and do our delete from cats where cat equals age says one row affected.

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,580
If we try unselected again it's gone.

23
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,160
If we do a select star now we're also missing Jack.

24
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:52,480
You can see we just have two three five and six which leads us to our final example.

25
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,390
Eat all cats.

26
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,360
So this one is pretty straightforward.

27
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,780
If we tried to do the equivalent select it would just be select star from cat with no ensuing where

28
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,050
clause just like that.

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,680
So to delete all of those.

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,940
Well it's just the leads from cats.

31
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,570
All of our cats are being released at once into a land of rainbows and joy.

32
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,320
We hit enter here they're definitely 100 percent not dying.

33
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,600
Nothing bad will ever happen to them.

34
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,420
Here we go.

35
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:32,130
For those affected selected star from cats the moment of truth.

36
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,070
And they're all gone and not it.

37
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,580
OK so we've now covered the C and R in the U and the D in crud that spells crud.

38
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,960
Which means we're done with this.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,710
Next up we'll get some practice putting it all together.
