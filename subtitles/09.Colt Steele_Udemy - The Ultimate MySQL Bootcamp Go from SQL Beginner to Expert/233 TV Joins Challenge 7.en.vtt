00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.380
OK we're at the final video here the final challenge and this is the one that puts everything together

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.850
are really more what it's doing is putting together all three tables that we have.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.410
So what we're actually getting out of it is not that impressive right.

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.670
We're not doing any crazy analytics or anything like the previous one.

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.440
Not that that was too crazy but nothing like that.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:29.040
All that we're doing is putting the title of a movie here of a series and then every rating that it

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.260
got along with the reviewer who wrote that reading.

8
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.020
So we've done the first part up until here right.

9
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.890
We've done title and writing together or where we've done reviewer and writing together but now we're

10
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.700
going to put them all together so that this is the information for one review right.

11
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.470
It's the movie that was the series that was reviewed.

12
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.250
It was the person who reviewed it.

13
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.240
Notice that we can cast them into one reviewer instead of first name and last name but that's secondary

14
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.240
at the end.

15
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.080
So we have the series title the reviewers name and then the rating they gave it.

16
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.910
So we're basically just trying to take.

17
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.160
Let's do it here take this and fill in the blanks.

18
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.350
So instead of serious ID we're going to get the name of the series instead of the reviewer.

19
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.480
We're going to get the name of the reviewer.

20
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.740
OK.

21
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.990
So let's go ahead and start over here with our handy dandy comment and we are on what is this seven

22
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.940
six Yes seven three tables.

23
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.480
OK.

24
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.160
So we can start off with any of the tables.

25
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.530
We're going to join them all together.

26
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:47.390
But I'll start with reviewers so we'll select start from reviewers just like that except I need from

27
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.250
boring we've done this before.

28
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.650
Blah blah blah blah blah.

29
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.490
So the first step is to join in with the reviews table.

30
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.130
So we'll have review hers along with their reviews along with the series associated with that review.

31
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.300
And we're not going to worry about you know people who haven't written reviews.

32
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.060
That's fine.

33
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.290
We're ignoring that.

34
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.450
OK.

35
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.540
So to do this let's start off first of all by joining it with

36
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:38.480
join reviews on reviewers ID because reviews it and then we need review were ID so fun to write and

37
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:47.290
we do that and we see things like OK Thomas Stoneman gave an 8.0 to some movie or some series idea for

38
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.150
one.

39
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.870
He also gave an eight point one to whatever has a D to and so on.

40
00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:00.910
So we're getting close ish Now what we need to do is also throw on the series data over here and the

41
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.840
first thing I'll do is just make this explicit.

42
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.220
It's an inner join.

43
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.790
So we're going to do another joint and it's really easy at least syntactically it's easy.

44
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.790
We just write inner join again.

45
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.740
So what are we joining on this time.

46
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.110
Well we're now going to join on the only thing that's left which is Series.

47
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.110
So we took reviewers and reviews said Sandridge them together where they intersect.

48
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:33.550
Now what we're going to do is join a series where the series A.D. is equal to series ID here inside

49
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.730
of the reviews.

50
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:48.020
So let's do inner join series on series start ID equals the reviews review Eric dot series underscore

51
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.190
ID such a nightmare trying to speak all this out loud.

52
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.620
But let's step through this.

53
00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:03.620
OK so we have sort of this middle table let's say which is right here we have I.D. rating in series

54
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.130
ID and reviewer ID for our review that every review has that and what we started off was joining it

55
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.280
with the relevant reviewers.

56
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.270
Now we're going to also take the series idea and find all matching series and stick them over here and

57
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.670
it's going to be a messy table.

58
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.990
It's gonna get all collapsed and screwed up.

59
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:36.780
So let's filter out some things so let's only work with the title the rating first name and last name.

60
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.530
OK so we're getting close now.

61
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.040
So we're pretty much there we have all of the data together.

62
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:55.790
So we have Archer has an 8.0 rating from Thomas Stoneman Thomas Stoneman also gave Arrested Development

63
00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.540
at a point one and he gave Bob's Burgers at 7 Pernod and then we can see OK we have Archer again down

64
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.590
here from Wyatt Scaggs who gave it to seven point five.

65
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.990
So we have all of our data synthesized in one table.

66
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.370
Now what we need to do is concatenate things together over here.

67
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:21.110
So that's a simple we need to do is instead of doing first name and last name we'll do a king cat first

68
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.840
name comma space last name as a reviewer I think it's what we called it yep.

69
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:30.490
Okay.

70
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.530
And then there's only one thing that we need to change.

71
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.870
Other than that which is right now things are ordered by a reviewer.

72
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.460
Let's order them by title which is what we did over here.

73
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.780
So that's just a simple order by title.

74
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.540
Now what should be done if I get rid of that extra semicolon.

75
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.160
And here we go.

76
00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.920
So we have Archer all of the ratings for Archer and the people who wrote them are arrested development

77
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:08.270
all the ratings and people who wrote them and all the way down through all of our series that have reviews

78
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.430
so that's important.

79
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.240
It's only where we have reviews.

80
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.480
So to summarize let's go all the way back here.

81
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:22.130
What we just did was basically take the reviewers table smash it with reviews table where they match.

82
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.290
It's an inner join.

83
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.790
Or where's the overlap.

84
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.310
Right.

85
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.330
So we take the overlap between them based off of ID here and reviewer ID then we have that second table

86
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.900
that we then joined with series where the series ID match the idea of a series.

87
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.710
So it's a three way to joint statements but three tables together.

88
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.630
And that's why I decided to do many to many relationships after the simpler one too many.

89
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.570
But hopefully it's not too intimidating.

90
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.610
We did a bunch of exercises with them.

91
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.650
You're probably a bit burnt out.

92
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.130
I know I am from recording all of them so I definitely recommend that you take a break for and move

93
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.660
on.

94
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.200
We're going to continue of course with joints and relationships but we're only building from here on

95
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.520
out.

96
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.840
So I can grab it and making it through this part.
