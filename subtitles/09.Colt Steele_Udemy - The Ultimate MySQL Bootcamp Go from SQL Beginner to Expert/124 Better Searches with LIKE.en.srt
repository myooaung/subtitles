1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,070
All right.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,410
So we have one more video here or at least one more tool for the toolbox.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,510
Before we get to the exercise at the end of this section and that tool is something called like.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,360
And I'll start off by saying like is very useful.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,930
It basically allows us to perform better searching of our data.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,590
So if you think of when we saw how to use where where would allow us to find exact matches.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,830
So I could do things like.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,190
So like star from books where title is exact.

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,980
The Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,140
But what if I wanted to select all Harry Potter books I would want to do something like select star

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,120
from books where Title contains Harry Potter or starts with Harry Potter or something like that.

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:54,510
And we don't have a way of doing that yet until now with like so like allows us to do things like this.

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,210
Imagine someone comes into your bookstore.

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:03,220
If we have a bookshop and they say there's a book I'm looking for but I can't remember the title.

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,010
I think the author's first name is David.

16
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,450
Or maybe it's Dan or or Dave.

17
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,880
And you could go over to your system has a really helpful bookstore employee and you could just search

18
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:23,380
for let's say books written by authors whose first name starts with DA which I guess is a very broad

19
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:30,340
category but you could still do that if you searched for authors at like Barnes Noble or a popular bookshop

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,460
or Amazon.

21
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,210
You can do that type of search and it will work.

22
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,100
It's just not that common.

23
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,210
But we could do the same thing for books like I said Harry potter is a good example where we want to

24
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,270
search for all the Harry Potter books not just the exact one word for word matched her character for

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,250
character matched.

26
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,180
So that's where Ware comes in.

27
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,380
Now I warn you it's going to look a little bit odd when I show it to you but that's OK.

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,170
It's not that complicated.

29
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,110
There's just some weird symbols here.

30
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,840
So here's an example using Like where.

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,350
So this is ignoring the first part of the query the select start from the update or the daily or whatever

32
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,170
it is.

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:23,410
So blank where author name like and then in quotes I have this present sign da present sign.

34
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,310
So I'll tell you first of all what this is going to do is find where the author's first name has the

35
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,410
letters DA in it.

36
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,650
And these little things here those percentage symbols kind of like that animation there.

37
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,130
Those are known as wild cards.

38
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,970
So that's basically the way that we specify We want to find author first names where there is something

39
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:53,050
anything at all it's a wild card so any characters and then these two exact character characters DA

40
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,940
and then anything afterwards.

41
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,770
So it's basically a way of saying whatever blank anything.

42
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,650
DA And then whatever anything else afterwards.

43
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,250
And if we try using this right now actually you'll see what happens if we go over here and we do a select

44
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:24,470
and let's just do a title and author name from books where will do author name like.

45
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,820
And then this is where we need those wild card symbols and we'll put da in between.

46
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:39,350
So once again this is saying anything followed by da exactly DA so can't be d and then S and A.

47
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,730
IT HAS TO BE DA and then anything afterwards.

48
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,420
So if I hadn't heard of you'll see that it works.

49
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,550
We get these authors.

50
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,800
Dave Dave Dave David David Dan and Frida.

51
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,020
And you might notice for Frieda that doesn't start with DA and you would be right.

52
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:04,990
It ends with da but it still meets this queries xpect it still meets the conditions for this query which

53
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,380
is anything.

54
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,130
Da anything.

55
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:19,930
So in this case it's f r e I d or f r e i is meeting this and then we have da And then this wildcard

56
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,990
there's nothing afterwards and that's perfectly fine.

57
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,240
This is not saying there has to be something after the DNA or something before.

58
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,770
As you can see we're matching da V.

59
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,620
So there's nothing before it that's fine then da.

60
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,540
And then afterwards.

61
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,520
So basically this is all about pattern matching.

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,660
And if we wanted to refine this so that we only get author first names that start exactly with Dave

63
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:54,370
or sorry exactly with Da we can do it like this all we do is leave off the first wildcard the first

64
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,020
percent and so on.

65
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:02,830
And that says I want to find author first names where they start with da and then anything afterwards.

66
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,010
So it could be Dana David Dave.

67
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,320
Dan Darwin or whatever.

68
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:15,760
So if we could just make that one small change and we delete that percentage sign you can see Frita

69
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,240
is gone.

70
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,650
I'm sorry Freeda because Freeda no longer fits the pattern that we're matching.

71
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,510
Also it's important to note that it is case insensitive as you can see it is lowercase DNA and it still

72
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,750
matches all these uppercase DS in lowercase A's.

73
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,870
So if I wanted to do something slightly different let's say search all books where the title has the

74
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,610
word the somewhere in there.

75
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,510
It's pretty simple.

76
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:47,520
It's just a select title from books where title like.

77
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:54,130
And if I just say that's only going to give me books where exactly the.

78
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,770
And that's not what we want.

79
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,680
So we want something followed by the end if we just leave it like this.

80
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,930
That's not going to give us anything because this is specifying we want books where the title has anything

81
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,480
and then ends with the letters THG.

82
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,040
That's not really what we want.

83
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,910
So we'll add another wildcard at the end.

84
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:22,230
And now that gives us all the books that have a title has something then THG and then something else

85
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,140
afterwards.

86
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,640
So you can see if we get the namesake a hologram for the king the circle the masing adventure to Kavli

87
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,410
and clay.

88
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,930
Consider the lobster and then Lincoln in the bardo.

89
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,670
Really good book by the way.

90
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,500
I know I've said it like 10 times.

91
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,690
Good work.

92
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:42,360
So that's the basics of using like these percentage signs are very common.

93
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,470
I know it looks kind of odd but this is really really important.

94
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,150
Think of when you're searching.

95
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,420
I don't know if you're on if you use read it if you're ever searching for things on Reddit.

96
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:00,860
Behind the Scenes like is being employed or if you're searching on whatever site you search on there's

97
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:06,280
some form of variation of this like going on where you're query whatever you search for.

98
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,000
It's not being it's not only matching.

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,230
Exactly.

100
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,940
So when I search for you know on Amazon I type in.

101
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,520
Let's let's just go with my let's say Lord Of The Rings I search Lord Of The Rings.

102
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,880
It's not only going to give me books that have a title.

103
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,870
Exactly.

104
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,860
Of Lord Of The Rings.

105
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,040
It's going to give me books that have Lord Of The Rings in the title somewhere.

106
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,600
Obviously their search is much much more complicated where it also searches things like you know through

107
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,900
comments and reviews and related books.

108
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,800
And there's this whole complicated graph network of how the search works.

109
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,210
But the core idea the simplest search that you could implement uses like.
