1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,360
Okay well come back.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,990
So in the last section we saw the syntax to add a single route to an express app our app has one.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,870
You are all that you can request to get a response.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,010
Everything else we get that error message that says cannot get.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,890
And then what if you tried to get whatever you tried to request.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,950
So we'll try fixing that now.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,680
We're going to add some more routes.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,260
So the first one will do.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,440
It's going to be silly it's a joke route.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,670
When you go to slash joke it just gives you a joke rather than just doing hello or high or goodbye or

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,600
doing a joke.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,900
So when we request from a computer or from a phone even to or you are.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,340
And then we have our express app that we're requesting this time.

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,590
Our request is hey I would like the slash joke page.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,910
So that's like this rather than just hitting enter here.

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:58,220
We would go to slash joke and yeah you're usually not you know typing these you URLs manually you're

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,400
clicking on links.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,950
So maybe there would be a link that takes us to slash joke just as there are links down here.

19
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,700
This is an error page for cloud nine but there are links.

20
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,500
Each one takes us to No.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,800
This one is.

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,860
Io slash support.

23
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,220
You can see that in the bottom left very tiny Here you can see slash support.

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,180
So there is code that is listening taking this slash support and it's figuring out oh we need to show

25
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,310
the support page that need help.

26
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,160
All these buttons on support anyways so we're going to ask for Slash joke.

27
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:37,180
Our express app is going to say Sure thing here you go and send back a really stupid joke.

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,610
What do you call a dog that does magic tricks a lab or a cadabra door.

29
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,260
I had to pick something that is politically neutral so I couldn't offend anybody.

30
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,810
So we're just going broke in Labrador.

31
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,600
So to implement that it's very similar to what we've done.

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,350
We just basically duplicate the code we have except we change the route to the string of what we're

33
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,440
trying to match.

34
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:07,060
So basically in our app that J.S. file will have two questions which are pseudo code.

35
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,920
The first one is did the client request a slash.

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,180
That's what we already have.

37
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:17,690
If they did respond with Welcome to the home page then we'll also have the client request slash joke

38
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,390
and if they did respond with Knock knock.

39
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:26,000
So only one of these is going to run every request because you can't send a request that is simultaneously

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,040
to slash and slash joke.

41
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,990
So we get one response depending on what we request.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,930
So without further ado this is all we have to do.

43
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,050
I apologize.

44
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:43,350
It's kind of long because that joke is long otherwise the code is pretty short don't get sloshed joke.

45
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,950
Function request response.

46
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,870
And then in here we just have a joke variable equal to our dumb joke and then we're doing a red dots

47
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,780
and joke.

48
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,830
So if we compare that over here to our existing right it's very very similar.

49
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,360
So we'll get used to typing get.

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,540
You know it's just terrible.

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,770
But you do it a lot.

52
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,640
Apt get and then we'll do joke.

53
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,990
And that's just something I picked arbitrarily right to have a joke about when we're actually working

54
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,890
with her.

55
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,810
We'll talk about the route to need for join us.

56
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,820
But for now we're working with Slash joke request and response.

57
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,990
Once again we can call these whatever we want but wreck and red is pretty standard then in here.

58
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,580
I'm just going to copy that joke.

59
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,970
I don't want to make you watch me type that.

60
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,430
All right.

61
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:42,980
So we have that and what we can do is the same thing you did earlier concert out log requested the joke

62
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,720
route.

63
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,270
Quick quiz what will happen when I run node.

64
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,020
Yes well when I just run it nothing will happen unless we had an error.

65
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:57,830
But what will happen when I make a request to slash joke and the easiest way to do that is if I do preview

66
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:05,300
preview running application and if I change this to slash joke here or I could go over here and do it

67
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,070
in a separate window but if I do a joke and I hit Enter What do you think will happen.

68
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,790
It just keeps spinning and spinning.

69
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,690
We get requests to the joke route which is what we wanted.

70
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,700
We constantly logged that means this route is being hit and we running this code.

71
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,750
But now over here it's still spinning and spinning spinning and eventually it will stop and it will

72
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:31,960
be.

73
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,990
It will give us an error message saying cannot get slashed joke.

74
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,810
Basically that's saying you know I tried we waited and waited waited but there was no response from

75
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,550
the server.

76
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,750
So the server received it and we did something but we never sent anything back because we're missing

77
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,890
the rest sent.

78
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,690
So very simple remedy get.

79
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,810
We can have this come to the log if we want it.

80
00:04:52,990 --> 00:05:00,100
But it served its purpose now it's to arrest send and all we want to send is the joke.

81
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,900
OK.

82
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,920
So I'm going to stop this one.

83
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,080
Well actually I'll just restart the server and that will kill it immediately.

84
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:16,400
Now we'll do node after you again make this bigger I can get it go to slash joke and hit enter.

85
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,490
Now I get this hilarious joke we've never heard before.

86
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,560
What do you call a dog that does magic tricks.

87
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,830
Elaborate cadaver dog.

88
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:24,880
It's pretty good.

89
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,710
Pretty good.

90
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,750
Who ever came up with that one.

91
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,770
And that's it.

92
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,200
We have our two routes now so we could toggle between them.

93
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,290
Well e-bay.

94
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,130
I don't know where that came from.

95
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,830
Here you go.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,470
So I've got the home route slash the route route or slash joke and that's it.

97
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,150
So really the point here is just to show you you can have two routes.

98
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,550
And usually applications have a ton of routes 10 20 depending on how complex the application is something

99
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,010
like Cloud 9 are you to me might have 50 or 100 different things.

100
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,120
Well hundreds extreme but there's a lot of different routes to wrap up.

101
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
Let's add one last route.

102
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,040
This one is a little different but it will do is return a random number randomly generated so it's not

103
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,360
going to be hard coded in like you've reached the home page or what do you call it a dog that does magic

104
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,650
tricks.

105
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,810
Elaborate Labrador ha ha very funny joke.

106
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,910
Rather than that it's going to be dynamically generated.

107
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,040
But everything else is the same.

108
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,950
So it's apt get slash and we're doing random name or number either one.

109
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,550
I did know in the notes come a function request and response again.

110
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,500
So whatever's in here will only be executed whenever someone requests slash a random number.

111
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,270
So we'll do our Epcot's and excuse me redstart send.

112
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,240
And let's just start just hard coding a number like 7.

113
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,500
I'll do it as a string just to be safe if we restart the server.

114
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,840
Now go over here.

115
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,960
Joke still works.

116
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,430
Home still works.

117
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,160
But now we have random underscore Gnome and I get the number 7.

118
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,520
So now all is left is to generate a random number.

119
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,480
And the way we do it in javascript is kind of noxious.

120
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,440
It's much easier in other languages.

121
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,030
So there is a math dot random.

122
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,360
And what this will do I'll actually just show you right now if I copy it over I need to stop the server

123
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,180
I'm going to open just regular node which is not something I've shown you but node has just like my

124
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,300
ass.

125
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:36,900
Q Well has a CLIA where you can type things and get a response immediately can do one post one and get

126
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,790
to know it has the same thing.

127
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,540
If you just type node with a file name then it opens up Node shell.

128
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:51,430
So if I do mapped out random and I don't capitalize that are now I do math at random.

129
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,590
Notice that it gives you a random number between 0 and 1.

130
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,650
It's really annoying that it does it this way in my opinion.

131
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:06,400
So if we want to say something between 1 in 10 there's a couple of steps involved we need to generate

132
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,640
or mapped out random we need to multiply it by 10.

133
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,050
So we'll start with that.

134
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:11,880
OK.

135
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,220
Now we're getting one point seven seven point four eight point six.

136
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,490
Then what we need to do is get rid of that decimal.

137
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,480
So you can either round it's more standard is to do a mass of floor.

138
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:31,320
So what that will do is just chop off the decimals so we end up with 8 9 8 2.

139
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,660
But then we have a problem which is we never actually hit 10.

140
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:40,050
We're doing a number between 0 and 9 which you have to trust me that's how it works.

141
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,280
You can see we have zero here and it's because when we did our original math thought random This is

142
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,610
a number between 0 and 1 non-HD including here not including one.

143
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,090
So up up two point nine nine nine nine nine.

144
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,000
So all we want to do is then shift it by 1.

145
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,370
So it can have a lot of work to generate a random number between 1 and 10.

146
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,460
But now we've got it just to prove OK there's a 10.

147
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,440
We're in the clear.

148
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,450
So now we'll just make that a variable.

149
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,860
We'll just call it X maybe equals.

150
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,680
Well maybe now is a better name make it a little clearer and then we'll just send it back we'll say

151
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,510
or I think I said lucky number is Plus no.

152
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,430
And that will just concatenated in there.

153
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,810
Let's try it.

154
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,230
So to get out of node we just do Control-C twice.

155
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,230
Now we actually execute our app.

156
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:41,780
Now if I go to a random number says Magic Numbers Three out of 10 notes 8 8 again 4 you get the picture.

157
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,690
And of course we still have our home route and refreshing the adorable and hilarious Lauber cadaver

158
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,560
dog joke.

159
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,700
OK we're done here.

160
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,230
Moving on in our next video to actually integrating my ask.

161
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,410
Well with this web app big step.
