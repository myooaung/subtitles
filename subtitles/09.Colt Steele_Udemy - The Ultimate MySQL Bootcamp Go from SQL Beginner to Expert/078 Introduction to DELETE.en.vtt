00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.060
OK so we've made it through the C R and you portions of crud.

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.430
Now we finally made it to D which stands for delete or destroyed depending on who you ask.

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.970
So in this video we're going to see how to do things in my ask you will well and it's pretty straightforward.

4
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.330
It's very similar to selecting things except rather than just selecting something you're going to delete.

5
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.260
So let me show you what I mean.

6
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.970
Here's an example that will delete any cat with the name eg in our database.

7
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:40.110
So imagine first of all that we were selecting all we would have is select from cats where name is equal

8
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.010
to egg.

9
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.650
So if we ran that it would give us the cat or cats with name egg and we can swap out select with delete.

10
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.950
And that will delete it.

11
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.400
So that same rule of thumb from before where I said Make sure you update something that your selection

12
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.270
is correct.

13
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.500
Then do the update because it will I mean there's no undo button unfortunately.

14
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.190
Same holds true and more so with delete because your data is gone as soon as you delete it.

15
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.660
So let's try this will delete.

16
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.490
Eg.

17
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.910
Let's do.

18
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.550
First of all it's like start from cats.

19
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.060
Just make sure we have egg in here.

20
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.610
There he or she is.

21
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.840
I'm not quite sure what I was intending with that name.

22
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.350
Eg.

23
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.360
So what we'll do first is just make sure we can select appropriately before we delete.

24
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.740
So select star from cats where name equals eg.

25
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.760
Remember that this is case insensitive.

26
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.940
Just for now.

27
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.200
I'll do lowercase just to prove that.

28
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.200
All right so we get egg perfect.

29
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.100
So now to remove egg delete from and then we can just copy this.

30
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.670
So before I hit enter I do need to take a moment to address something pretty serious and that is that

31
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.330
no cats are being harmed no cats are dying here.

32
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.290
Yes they're being deleted from this table but in reality deletion doesn't mean death.

33
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.630
It means that they're being adopted.

34
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.710
Perhaps to a loving family that will treat them with the care that they deserve.

35
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.360
So there's no death here and I hope I don't receive any Furius comments about how I'm treating animals

36
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.860
in my course.

37
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.030
I love animals.

38
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.950
I learned from my first course.

39
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.930
I made a mistake.

40
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.320
I will never refer to deleting dogs or cats as killing them.

41
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.250
I'm very sorry for that.

42
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.050
So again these cats are not dying.

43
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.480
So with that out of the way let's hit Enter

44
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:52.210
now let's go back and select star from cats and as he can see eg is now gone.

45
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.850
Also something that does come up sometimes.

46
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.030
Notice that the cat ID's have not shifted.

47
00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.160
They're still the same.

48
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.750
Some of my students in the past have had the expectation that the IDs would alter but they always will

49
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.610
stay the same.

50
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.240
And that's because when something is inserted into a table that unique ID is generated for it remembers

51
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.700
the primary key and eventually will learn about having multiple tables that interact with one another

52
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.460
and will be storing these ideas in other tables.

53
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.470
So if it changed that could be problematic because we'd have to change it in multiple places anyways.

54
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.830
I'm trying to say is that we removed 4 but we still have 5 6 and 7.

55
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.910
This didn't change to 4 and change to 5 and so on.

56
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.440
All right so we deleted that rest in.

57
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.280
I mean enjoy your new life with your happy family eg.

58
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.780
So one last thing here is that if you look at what I've written here delete from Cats.

59
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.330
What do you think that will do now.

60
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.270
I don't run it but what do you think this would do.

61
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.790
And the answer is that it deletes everything.

62
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.390
All cats.

63
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.740
They're all released to their happy families.

64
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.500
So that's important to know that you can do that.

65
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.580
So it's different than dropping a table because dropping a table gets rid of the table entirely and

66
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.190
all data inside of it but deleting from cats just deletes the entries in the cat's table.

67
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.570
But we still have the shell.

68
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.070
We still have the cats table.

69
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.240
There shouldn't be very many times when you need to use this command.

70
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.500
I'm not going to do it just yet because I want us to have our cat's data for a little bit for the next

71
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.730
exercises but just keep that in mind because we didn't specify a WHERE clause over here.

72
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.200
It's the same as selecting without a WHERE clause.

73
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.770
It's like everything so this will delete everything.

74
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.900
OK next up you're going to practice deleting.
