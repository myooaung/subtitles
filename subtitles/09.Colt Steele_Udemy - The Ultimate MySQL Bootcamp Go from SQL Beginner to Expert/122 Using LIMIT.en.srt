1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,420
Next up in our toolbox is limit.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,080
So limit allows us to specify a number for how many results that we want to select.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:16,020
So I could say things like I want the first two best selling books rather than all best selling books

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,760
or the top 10 most recent books.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,410
So we often use it in conjunction with order by sorting because that typically is going to give you

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,770
something meaningful rather than just saying select all books and give me the first two.

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,520
Well how was first defined and we can do that.

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:43,230
I'll show you that if we do a select let's just do title from books the order that we get them right

9
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,040
now and get us the order they were added.

10
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,800
So we have the namesake Norse mythology American Gods and so on.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,380
So I could limit this and the syntax looks like this.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,100
It just adds limit at the end just like we added order by limit.

13
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,470
I'd say three.

14
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,270
Now I just get those first three.

15
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,380
So it's going to limit it to the first three.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,440
Whether they're sorted or not it doesn't care.

17
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,100
It just chops it off right there.

18
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,670
So again it's not that useful or meaningful just to do it on its own like this.

19
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:21,100
But we could do you know Limit 1 limit 10 and so on.

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,140
And that's basically all that there is to limit.

21
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,980
You know we can do it with a select star.

22
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,990
If I only want let's say everything about the first book there we go and you get the namesake and there's

23
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,060
everything about it.

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,170
But more often than not we're using it with order by.

25
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,150
So here's an example.

26
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:48,670
If I want the five most recently released books I'm going to and I only want the title and the release

27
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,640
year in this case.

28
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:56,710
So select title and release here from books then I'm going to order them by the released year descending

29
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,030
and then I'm going to limit it to the first five.

30
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,640
So let's try it.

31
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,220
I'll go ahead and make a new file again.

32
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,490
Limit that as well.

33
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,990
And in there I'll write a select title comma released year from books.

34
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,280
I won't add it yet.

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:22,360
Just make sure our source is working so we'll do a source refining.

36
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,100
Why the name so long finding selections.

37
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,050
Slash limit as kua.

38
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,480
Fortunately you only have to type it once.

39
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,880
OK so that's working.

40
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:41,050
So now what we'll do is order them by that released year so we'll do an order by and we could write

41
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,150
really sure and I will because it's more specific or is it's easier to understand more semantic to write

42
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,120
it out even though it's longer.

43
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,510
But of course we could replace it with two As we just saw in the last video.

44
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,550
So ordered by that release here.

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:02,680
If I do that now that gives us all the books ordered in ascending order based off of their year which

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,560
is not what we want so we can switch that with DGSE.

47
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,820
Here we go.

48
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,270
And now I can limit it to five.

49
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,020
And so that limit comes last as well.

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,750
So it's going to do everything and then chop it wherever you specify.

51
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,790
So that's important to know.

52
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,750
So let's try it now.

53
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,120
Make sure I save and there we go.

54
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,240
The five most recent books and of course we can change this to whatever number you want if you want

55
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:37,570
the one most recent book or if we wanted let's say 14.

56
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,720
We can do that.

57
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,140
So there are a few other ways we can use it.

58
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,240
For example here's the same query.

59
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,560
However I've written it slightly different so everything up until this point right here is the same

60
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,820
limit but this time I'm saying limit 0 comma 5.

61
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,790
So if we just copy this I won't make you watch me type that whole thing out.

62
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,930
And I comment this out and I tried running this.

63
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,060
Now just take a guess.

64
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,400
What do you think will happen.

65
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,670
And here we go.

66
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,540
It does the exact same thing.

67
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:21,390
So this is a syntax that allows us to specify a starting point and then how many we want to go from

68
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:21,830
there.

69
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,780
So basically it's saying and this is kind of confusing because it starts at zero.

70
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,860
So the first row in a table is zero with row.

71
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,510
But then when we're dealing with strings like when we had hello world.

72
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,760
Age is actually the first character in my ask well least.

73
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:46,140
So anyways it's saying I want the first row and I want to go for five rows so we could change that.

74
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,940
I only want three rows this time.

75
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,170
If we rerun it it gives us the first three rows.

76
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,020
But then I could shift it.

77
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,990
Let's say I want to go.

78
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,530
I don't know why but the second row onwards.

79
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:05,600
So it gives us north mythology 10 percent happier and the circle didn't get 10 before when it was zero.

80
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,320
We got Lincoln in the bardo Norse mythology and 10 percent happier.

81
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,050
When I changed this to 1 it shifts the starting point.

82
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:19,100
So it's not that really it's not common at all but you could do things like 10 comma 1.

83
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,490
And what this will do is go to the eleventh book.

84
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,860
I need to save first.

85
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,650
Now if I run it it will give us the eleventh book.

86
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:37,520
And just to make sure that we're right there if we rerun it now we could count down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

87
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,930
9 10 11 and we get fake book.

88
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:48,320
So if you need to access very particular rows based off of order that is a way that you can do it just

89
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,640
honestly not that common.

90
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,310
Pretty much every time that I use a limit it's in a context like this limit one or the first three of

91
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,690
the first five or something like that.

92
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,400
But I'll give you an actual real reason you might use it.

93
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,010
Let's say that you have a blog site that you've created and your blog has thousands of articles in it

94
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,720
already.

95
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,310
When a user visits the blog page you don't show them all thousand or let's say 10000 results all at

96
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,570
once for every blog post that you've written.

97
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,850
That would be overwhelming.

98
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,400
And that's just there's too much information to display.

99
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,900
Most likely what you'll do is have the first 10 posts and then I can click NEXT button and it will load

100
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,270
from post 11 to 20.

101
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,430
And you know I can keep clicking next.

102
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:37,190
And so when you've probably seen that before it's called pagination so you can do that by rather than

103
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,530
selecting everything from your database.

104
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:45,630
You could select from zero and I only want the first 10 and then the next time through.

105
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,900
You could select from 10 and I want 10 more.

106
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,110
And so on.

107
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,350
So that is a situation where you could use that limit and provide a range like that.

108
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,530
But again most of the time I just use this limit.

109
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,840
And then one number the very last thing I'll show you is that this is actually straight from the docs

110
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,660
from my ask you.

111
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,070
I think it's really weird that they even specify this if you wanted to select from one row all the way

112
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,610
to the end of the table.

113
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,170
So I went from Row 5 all the way to the end.

114
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,410
We might have however many thousand rows.

115
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,090
There isn't a nice elegant way of doing it.

116
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,880
This is what you have to do.

117
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:28,160
So Star for whatever you're selecting from whatever table limit and then where you want to start Khama

118
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,710
some gigantic number.

119
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,520
And I'm not kidding you actually have it in the docs here.

120
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:40,820
Ray is right here to retrieve all rows from a certain offset up to the end of the results that you can

121
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,060
use some large number for the second perimeter.

122
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,140
So that's their official suggestion on how to do it.

123
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,680
So let's start from table limit 95 comma some gigantic number that you would know you'd never have that

124
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,530
many rows in your table.

125
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:02,350
So we could actually do that here if we just do a select title from books.

126
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,670
Order by and let's just say I want to go.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,310
We didn't even need the order by honest.

128
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,480
That's just a limit.

129
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,230
And if we just you limit 5 that's going to give us the first five.

130
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,580
But if I want to go from 5 to the end I can do limit 5.

131
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,980
And then some gigantic number.

132
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,640
And in our case it doesn't even have to be that again because we don't have that many books.

133
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:33,430
But if I do that it gives us everything after five or taking 3 6 because it starts at zero.

134
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,230
So I could reduce this down.

135
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,250
I could just do like 50 and give us the same thing because we don't have 50 books.

136
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,910
So just goes until the end.

137
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:48,450
So that's it to limit with all those weird things they showcased the odd situations in ways you can

138
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,020
use it.

139
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:55,660
The most common and the way that almost always said I use it is this just limit and then a single number.

140
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,200
All right.

141
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,570
So that's it.

142
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,940
Moving on to one more.

143
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,070
And then we're done for the section at least.

144
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,560
We're not done with the whole course.
