00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.190
And I'm back here with a solution or multiple solutions to go over these joint problems.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.430
So again this is a one to many relationship students and papers and the first thing we're going to do

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.260
is go over to cloud 9.

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.080
And I'm just going to work in the same database but I'm going to make a new file just because it's getting

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.220
crazy and I'll call this one.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.220
Students papers as well.

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.540
OK so we know we need to create two tables create table students and we're going to leave it empty for

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.260
now and then create table papers also leave it empty.

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.750
Great.

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.000
So next what we put in so we'll start with students simple.

11
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.960
It's an idee that we said as a primary key integer which means it should also auto increment and thus

12
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.640
we want to do it manually but we don't.

13
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.830
And then first name is have our char.

14
00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:06.380
So we have ID Ent. autoincrement primary key and then we have a first name which is just var char and

15
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.230
we'll do 100.

16
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.250
That's a good even nice number.

17
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.640
So that's it for students.

18
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.030
But then we have papers so papers has a title grade and student ID.

19
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:25.710
Let's start with just title grade student or score ID perfect.

20
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.960
And I'm noticing you know I capitalized this.

21
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.210
It doesn't really matter but it's going to be annoying to remember that so I'm just going to put it

22
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.590
back.

23
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.890
This lower case ID.

24
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.210
So you've got title grade student the title is of our char.

25
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.100
So do 100 grade isn't it.

26
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:51.770
And then we have student I.D. and student ID is a foreign key referencing students dot ID.

27
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.210
So it's just an integer and this sometimes trips people up that we just right student ID in.

28
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:07.330
And then the next line is a foreign key the field that is a foreign key is student ID.

29
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.760
This right here.

30
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.360
And when you just say what it references.

31
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.370
So it's referencing Students table the ID field.

32
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.130
OK.

33
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.450
And we could also indented like this because this has to do with this.

34
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:32.390
And then if we wanted to which you did not need to do but this is where we could add on delete cascade

35
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.000
which you may and we saw in the last video or two videos ago.

36
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.970
It's not necessary here we're not reading anything but you could put that there.

37
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.750
OK.

38
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.830
The next step is now just to create them.

39
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.030
So before I go too far I did catch this.

40
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.890
I have an extra semi-colon there.

41
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.620
Get rid of that but we'll create our students table and we'll create our papers table.

42
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.940
Everything looks good and if we do show tables I'm still working in our same database.

43
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.400
I have customers and orders that's fine but I papers and students.

44
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.540
OK.

45
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.860
And we haven't done this a while.

46
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.990
How about we describe students.

47
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.640
So we now have autoincrement and their primary key and that's for students.

48
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.500
And what about papers we do describe papers where you can see we have title and grade and then student

49
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.280
ID.

50
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.320
OK.

51
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.140
So next step is to get our data in there.

52
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.300
And I said that you definitely didn't have to do this yourself.

53
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.000
So I'm just going to put it in this file so you have a solution file.

54
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.680
But it would be annoying to type this.

55
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.130
I totally I mean I had to type it.

56
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.300
I totally get it.

57
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.790
So paste that in.

58
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.350
Perfect.

59
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.850
So now we can do a select star from students and we should see our five students and do a select star

60
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.380
from papers and we see our five papers with student IDs.

61
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.450
Great.

62
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:08.610
So first thing to do was to print this join table where we have first name title and Grade Nothing else

63
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.600
first name title and grade where and what's our joint condition here.

64
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:21.370
Well basically where the student ID is equal to the student id in the paper and this we could accomplish

65
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:27.210
through an inner join would be the easiest way we could also do with the right join if you want to which

66
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.200
will take a look at put an inner join is the simplest way.

67
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.610
And I'm going to do an explicit inner join.

68
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:40.240
So that means select and let's start with Star from and let me put a number here.

69
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:47.840
Exercise 1 select star from let's do it on a different line from students.

70
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:57.850
Join papers on students ID schools papers.

71
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.650
Student ID.

72
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.420
And let's be explicit with our joint just like that.

73
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.310
So if we take a look you see we have the right data.

74
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.160
Right we have Caleb and his two books Samantha or two reports.

75
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.230
Samantha her two SS Carlos and his one essay and we have the grades now.

76
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.180
We don't want I.D. and student ID so we just need to get rid of that.

77
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.330
And the simplest way is just to explicitly say what we want.

78
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.360
So great title and great.

79
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.500
OK.

80
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.450
Now we do it and we're good to go.

81
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:44.000
There's one thing and this is my fault for not mentioning in the instructions I did order this and totally

82
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.580
fine if you didn't do it if you did catch it.

83
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.470
Congratulations on looking at that.

84
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.130
I didn't.

85
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.960
I forgot.

86
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.020
Did this late last night when I created these slides.

87
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.480
I'm recording it the next morning.

88
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.500
So this was ordered by grade.

89
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.840
So that's simple too.

90
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.480
Just going to be order by grade.

91
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.690
And what order is it.

92
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.210
Well it's sending

93
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.750
Now we do it now we have the correct answer.

94
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.220
The other one is correct to a promise.

95
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.230
The only thing that I'll address here is that I mentioned that you could also do a write join and why

96
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.970
is that.

97
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.170
Well let's just verify.

98
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.860
See if I'm crazy.

99
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.330
No it still works.

100
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.290
Good to know.

101
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.170
I'm just kidding.

102
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:33.020
But the reason that it works is because if we go back to our slides way back when we do an inner join

103
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:39.120
here between students and papers all of our papers have a student they belong to.

104
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:49.480
So basically this section is the same as this entire section here the same as this if we pretend that

105
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.180
left join doesn't exist.

106
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.500
Ignore that slide.

107
00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:00.650
This intersection is the same as this because every paper has a student ID in it.

108
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.440
So you could also do it right Turing.

109
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:10.000
Nothing wrong with that but I think the inner join us easiest although it's it's easiest because it's

110
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.700
just this is how I think about joints most of the time but it's not any easier because it's just a single

111
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.310
line or a single word that we're changing.

112
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.810
OK so I'll just write Allt solution.

113
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.810
OK.

114
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.930
Moving on.

115
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.400
Print this.

116
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.380
So very similar right.

117
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.140
Caleb Samantha their respective books.

118
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:39.950
But then we have Raj and Lisa who didn't write any reports or any papers and we have no in place.

119
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.050
So this is a left join.

120
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:49.300
And the way that we're going to do that if we go back to our slides again we're going to grab everything

121
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.260
from students and then any associated papers.

122
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.780
But some of them don't have papers.

123
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.490
And those will then be filled in with no.

124
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.330
So let's do this now call this

125
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:13.240
let's call this problem too and start with select start again and then we'll alter that from students

126
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:26.490
and then we need to do a left join papers on students that ID equals papers that student ID and we'll

127
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:32.380
leave it at that to start and you can see it's working.

128
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.610
We've got Caleb and his stuff Samantha her essays her papers Raj.

129
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.120
No no no.

130
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:41.710
LISA No no no.

131
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:49.440
So we're getting every single student Kalos Samantha Raj Carlos Lisa and if they have a matching condition

132
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.990
in the papers table then we also get their paper data.

133
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.270
But if they don't we have no.

134
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.130
The only thing left is to whittle it down to first name title in grade

135
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.740
just like that.

136
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.770
Varify OK.

137
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.300
And is there any sorting here.

138
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:08.930
No.

139
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.850
And we're done.
