00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.560
OK so we've made it to the end.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.640
The final video solution to our spring cleaning extravaganza problem.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.680
Now we need to do.

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.830
We've covered creating reading and updating.

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.140
Basically inserting selecting an update now we're going to use to.

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.000
So the first thing is to delete all old shirts which really just in this case means last worne is 200

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.520
Exactly.

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:32.280
So when you do or select star you can see there's two shirts that meet that criteria 7 idea of 7 an

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.370
idea of two.

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.390
But we're going to delete them based off of last one.

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:48.970
So we always start with our select star from shirts where last worn equals 200 when we get our two shirts

12
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:58.970
then we can copy this and actually we can copy this entire thing delete from Schertz where last one

13
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.000
is two hundred two rows affected.

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.200
Now for us to Nexstar those two are gone.

15
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.260
You can see it goes from one to three and then from six to eight then there we go.

16
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.000
So the next problem is to delete all tank tops.

17
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.300
We've decided take steps to make it look kind of stupid.

18
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.180
So we're going into the tank tops.

19
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.010
So your tastes have changed.

20
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.750
So how many tank tops do we have.

21
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.160
We've got one and two that are left.

22
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.130
So we'll do a select star from Schertz where article equals tank top.

23
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:48.740
We get to that all we need to do now is delete from Schertz where article equals tank top hit enter.

24
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.240
Now we try and select them.

25
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.020
They're gone.

26
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.890
And if we do a select star from a shirt with NO WHERE clause.

27
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.140
Now we have 1 3 5 6 9 so we've lost our two tank tops.

28
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.920
All we have are T-shirts and polo shirts which leads us to our final exercise here.

29
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.450
So eat all the shirts and I lied it takes me the second to last.

30
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.420
So to delete all the shirts but not the entire table.

31
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.050
It's pretty simple.

32
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.180
We use the SAME WHERE clause which which is to say that we don't have a WHERE clause.

33
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.680
So in this case it returns select star from shirts or turns all shirts.

34
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.100
Well we just replace that delete from Schertz.

35
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.420
I can't spell it correctly with this part.

36
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.300
And Moment of Truth 5 rows affected.

37
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.950
Now and if you select start from Schertz we get nothing.

38
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.960
So sad day not as sad as we need to play to the cats but still sad.

39
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.470
And the last thing is to drop the entire Schertz table.

40
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.260
We're just done with this.

41
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.580
We hated this exercise.

42
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.830
We want to move on.

43
00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.940
So drop table shirts now hit enter.

44
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:11.690
And if I do show tables no tables and if I try and describe Schertz we get an error because there is

45
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.700
no Schertz table to describe and it freaks out.

46
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.130
So we've successfully deleted it.

47
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.430
Now we have an empty database that we don't need anymore and we're done with this.

48
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.290
Congratulations.
