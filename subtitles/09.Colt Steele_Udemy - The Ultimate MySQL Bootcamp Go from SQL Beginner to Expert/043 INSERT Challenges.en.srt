1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,730
All right.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,900
So it's now your turn to give this a try and get some practice using the insert command.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,160
So we'll be working with people this time.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,700
You're going to create a new people table.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,830
So actually this is going to combine both creating tables and inserting data.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,640
So the table you need to define will have three columns.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,890
First name that has a 20 character limit.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,720
Last name also has a 20 character limit and age which is a number.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,140
So once you've defined that table the next step is to insert your first person.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,180
And for this person her first name is Tina.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,230
Her last name is Belcher and her age is 13.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,590
So once you inserted her make sure that you've done it correctly use that select command to see what's

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,060
happening.

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,940
Make sure she's in there the next person will be Bob Belcher who is 42 and it's up to you.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,410
But I would like for you to try and answer this one using a different order for the values.

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,990
So if you had said first name come a last name come of age and the previous one maybe try last name

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,760
come age come first name doesn't make a lot of sense to do it that way but give it a shot just to prove

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,700
that you understand that the order matters.

19
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:22,890
And then lastly write one insert that will insert three different people at once and that will be Linda

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,390
Belcher who's 45.

21
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,950
Philip Fronde who's 38 and Calvin fish owner who is 70 so insert all three of those at once.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,060
And go ahead and give it a shot.

23
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,100
And in the next video we'll have a solution.
