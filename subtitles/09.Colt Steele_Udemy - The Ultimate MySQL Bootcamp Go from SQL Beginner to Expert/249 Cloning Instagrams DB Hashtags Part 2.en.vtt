00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.540
All right.

2
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.230
So this will be a quick video where we just implement the two tables we need.

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.550
They're both very simple.

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.090
So tag's it's just an idea and a tag name photo tags is a photo ID and a tag ID.

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.730
OK.

6
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.420
So here I am in cloud 9.

7
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:24.140
I will start with our tags table create table tags and all we need is an ID which is an integer auto

8
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:36.450
increment primary key and then we'll also have our tag name which is just a VAR char 255 and we want

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.270
to make it unique.

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.480
We don't want to have oh my gosh I can spell unique.

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.560
You don't want to have any duplicates in there.

12
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.380
And then after that you know it would be nice to edit create it.

13
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.380
Like I said so we could store it the first time a tag was used or created and that's it.

14
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.160
So that's our tags table.

15
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.270
This table here.

16
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.820
Now we've got to worry about photo tags.

17
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.690
So we'll do our create table photo tags or tagging.

18
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.580
Which is also nice I guess.

19
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.270
Well it is nice but also works.

20
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.160
We don't need an ID although we need is a photo ID and then the tag ID.

21
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.470
And those are both going to be integer not know

22
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.800
we go.

23
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:35.030
And then on top of that we need to add our foreign key constraints foreign key photo ID is referencing

24
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:47.780
the photos table ID field duplicate that tag ID for his referencing tags table ID field.

25
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.880
We also want to make sure that a user cant tag the same photo with the same hash tag multiple times.

26
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.370
And thats an easy fix.

27
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.060
We just do our same primary key with two items.

28
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.550
Photo ID and tag ID and that just ensures that we can have multiple instances of the same photo tags.

29
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.730
All right don't so my colon looks like I'm missing this comma here and there we go.

30
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.780
Now if we try that

31
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.070
and we look at our tables.

32
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.400
There we go we've got comments for all those likes photo tags photos tags and users.

33
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.790
And that's it for our schema.

34
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.540
We're done.

35
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.100
So in the next section if you'd like to tap out now.

36
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.380
Move on to the next section we're going to give you a massive file with a bunch of data that I created

37
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.050
took way too long to do that.

38
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.960
We'll be able to do some exercises with and get some practice working with a bunch of tables.

39
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.730
But if you want to see me just insert a couple of tags and photo tags to do that now.

40
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.450
So if you're still here going to do that.

41
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.290
Start with inserting a couple of tags and all we have is tag name

42
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.270
and just to verify that you go back up to our tags it's just a tag name that we're inserting.

43
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.140
So let's say I'm inserting the string you know adorable

44
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.310
and we get to more say cute.

45
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.150
And one more would be I don't know.

46
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.840
Sun rise.

47
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.960
OK.

48
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.570
So that will answer our tags.

49
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.350
Can you make sure that that works.

50
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.840
Select star from tags.

51
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.850
There we go.

52
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.500
We've got three tags Now we associate them with photos.

53
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.790
And so you've got three photos.

54
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.750
You know it doesn't matter what they are but they have an idea of 1 2 and 3.

55
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:53.980
So if you want to do an insert into spell answered correctly photo tags will start by taking the photo

56
00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:04.930
ID and then the tag ID OK values and let's say the first photo is tagged with adorable.

57
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.150
And the first photo was also tagged with cute because it has an idea of two and then will say the second

58
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.970
photo is tagged with.

59
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.400
I don't know sunrise.

60
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.260
And then the third photo is also tagged with cute like that.

61
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.650
OK.

62
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.090
So you can rerun this.

63
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.140
Let's do this.

64
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.280
Let's start from photo tags.

65
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.890
There we go.

66
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.270
Looks good.

67
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.310
Now the true test is can we still insert something that shouldn't work like a duplicate.

68
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:45.830
We already have one common one so entered into photo tags.

69
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:54.360
Photo ID comma tag ID values one comma one and we get duplicate entry.

70
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.950
So that's good.

71
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.890
Works perfectly.

72
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.340
But as you can see no other order works fine to come in three or three common two are not the same thing

73
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.150
at all.

74
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.950
This is saying the second tag.

75
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.830
This is saying the second photo should have the third tag.

76
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.590
This is saying third photo should have the second tag.

77
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.030
Quite a mouthful.

78
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.500
All right.

79
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.950
So we're done here.

80
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.310
Next up we're actually going to play around with data.

81
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.440
Like I said I'm going to give you a giant file.

82
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.490
Hopefully it's fun.

83
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.980
And if it's not.

84
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.110
Well we're basically in the course so just hang in there.
