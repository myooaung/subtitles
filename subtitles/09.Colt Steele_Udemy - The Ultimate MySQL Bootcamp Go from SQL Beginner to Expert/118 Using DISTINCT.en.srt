1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,220
Now than that and really like now then all is all right too much.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,980
OK how about up next.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,480
We're going to talk about distinct so distinct is something that we use in conjunction with select So

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,510
when we're selecting data out let's say we're doing something like give me all book titles from the

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,850
database and we may have duplicates in there and we would get all those duplicates because we just asked

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,930
for all titles.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,200
But if I say give me all distinct titles it will do what that sounds like.

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,750
It will only give us the distinct or unique titles.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,690
So without further ado let's take a look at it in use.

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,080
So here's an example.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,580
The first thing that you should notice is that distinct comes right after select.

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,510
So we're saying select author last name.

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,410
So there's a bunch of authors and in our table some books have you know or some authors of multiple

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,150
books.

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,590
So David Foster Wallace for example has two books in there.

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,000
So when we say select author last name we get two results.

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,190
We get David Foster Wallace.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,900
And then again David Foster if we're only doing last name we get Foster Wallace and Foster Wallace.

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:16,440
So if I wanted to know only the unique or the distinct author last names in my books table I would write

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,020
this query here select and the only thing that's different is the distinct.

21
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,020
Select Distinct author name from books.

22
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,180
So let's try to go over here make some space and let's just start just to show you what I'm talking

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:38,470
about by select author with out the distinct from books just like that.

24
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,170
And as you can see you know we have Geymann who's in here twice.

25
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,390
Aggers is in there twice carvers in there twice.

26
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,220
Foster Wallace is in there twice.

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,470
And Harris is in there twice.

28
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,410
However there's something kind of weird about Harris.

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,360
We'll take a look at in just a moment.

30
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:01,980
So if we only want to just get a survey of all the authors in our database but we don't want to duplicate.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:10,220
It's as simple as Select Distinct author name from books just like that.

32
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,510
Hit enter.

33
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,480
Now it's much shorter because those duplicates are gone.

34
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,630
So now we only have one game in one Aggers one Foster Wallace and one Harris.

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,460
And of course we could do that for other things so let's try it for years.

36
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,410
So we have select released year from books.

37
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,970
In C C there are some books that have duplicates.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,480
So for example 2003 there's two 2003's at least I think there's multiple There's always one more.

39
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,540
When I designed this or when I created the data let's just focus on 2003.

40
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,750
So there's two of them there.

41
00:02:48,790 --> 00:03:01,930
So if we do select distinct at least year from books our list is shorter and now we only have 1 2003.

42
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,510
So the reason I show it to you is not just to show you another way if you're another example but also

43
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,360
we're working with numbers here and that's important to remember that released year isn't it.

44
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,120
It's not a Vardar but stinks still works.

45
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,150
There's one more advanced thing that I want to talk about here which has to do with when we did our

46
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,940
select.

47
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,960
Let's start again with author L name from books.

48
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,300
When we did this remember that there's actually lots to author name and name.

49
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:42,770
So when we did this you know remember we have Neil game twice and Dave Eggers and so on.

50
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:50,320
But then there was Dan Harris and Frida Harris two different people two different authors with the same

51
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,040
last name which is a pretty common situation.

52
00:03:53,050 --> 00:04:06,020
So when I do distinct select distinct author name from books it reduces them to just that distinct last

53
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,810
name which is what you would expect.

54
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:15,290
It only gives us Harris once which makes sense we're asking for distinct author last names but what

55
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,760
about distinct full names.

56
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,880
What if I want every distinct author's full name printed out.

57
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,880
So basically what if I just want to know how many distinct authors there are not just based off of last

58
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:33,830
names or just first names but both need to be distinct so that you know Dan Harris is distinct from

59
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,630
Frita Harris.

60
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,260
There are a couple of ways of doing it.

61
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,950
One you already know at this point you can use Concat.

62
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:49,370
So I'll show you that now what we could do is concat author f name and author L name and then ask or

63
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,060
select distinct versions of those.

64
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,170
So if I make a new file this one will be won't be too long but I'll make a new directory first.

65
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,080
And I'll just call it refining selection.

66
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,210
You don't have to do this but I'm getting a little messy in here so I want to make a new file in that

67
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,530
directory and I'll just call it distinct dot as well the most important part.

68
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,480
OK.

69
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:23,610
So in here right now we have our select distinct author L name from books.

70
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,270
So let's start off by just running this.

71
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,310
Make sure that our file is working.

72
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,020
One thing I will point out I don't recommend putting spaces in your directory names.

73
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,860
It's just not a great idea.

74
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,590
So I'm going to edit that.

75
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,760
It won't break anything.

76
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,180
We can still do it but it's just not great.

77
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,630
Let's just do like that.

78
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,130
Refinding elections well that might work too.

79
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,660
But refinding selections already.

80
00:05:51,690 --> 00:06:02,250
So if you want to run it it's a source refining underscore selection's slash distinct dot as well.

81
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,530
Michael and it works OK.

82
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,640
So back to the problem at hand how do we actually get just distinct authors first name and last name

83
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,180
so we could do come at this out for now.

84
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,000
It's a select and then we can concat author first name

85
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:32,120
and author last name just like that from books and if we save and run that now we get this.

86
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,120
And if we try and do distinct on that whole thing

87
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:46,500
that works we get Dan Harris and Frita Harris are distinct and we only have one new game and one Dave

88
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,460
Eggers and so on.

89
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,460
And of course we could go ad the space that we want there and tried doing it again.

90
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,460
And that gives us distinct full names like this.

91
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,520
That's one way.

92
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,540
But there's actually an easier way and that's using distinct.

93
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,600
We just do a select distinct and if you do author we can do name first or name

94
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,970
just separate them by a comma.

95
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:21,600
And we tried running that now you see we only get unique rows back.

96
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,250
So it's basically applying distinct to the entire row.

97
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:31,310
So in this case it's basically saying I want the combination of the first name and last name to be distinct.

98
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,240
So that's why we end up with one new game in one.

99
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,390
Dave Eggers and one Dan Harris and one free to Harris.

100
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,600
So it works in that way.

101
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,560
The only difference here aside from this being longer is that here we're actually just combining them

102
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,120
and checking if it's distinct here.

103
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,830
Sequel's do ambuscades doing that for us.

104
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,020
And it depends how you want your results printed out if you want them combined as a full name.

105
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,620
And this method works better.

106
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,030
And if you just want to keep your data separate in two different columns then this is much easier and

107
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,980
a little bit shorter.

108
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,850
All right.

109
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:07,860
So that's pretty much all there is to distinct and it's chords pretty simple and it's powerful too it's

110
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,160
something we'll use quite a bit throughout the course as our data gets more complicated.

111
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,950
We'll also have more duplicated data which isn't a bad thing but sometimes you're trying to understand

112
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,080
it or work with it you only want distinct data.

113
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,200
So you used to sinked.

114
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:23,770
All right.

115
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,430
I should shut up.
