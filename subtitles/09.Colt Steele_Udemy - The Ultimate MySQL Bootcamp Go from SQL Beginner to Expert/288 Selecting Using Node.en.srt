1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,230
So that's all in there which is great.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,120
Now what we want to do is insert say just two users just so that we have something.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,210
So we'll do an insert into users.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,770
This will be one of the last times we're actually inserting stuff manually rather than using our code

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,000
to do it for us and inserting you know 500 at a time.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,630
So all we're going to do is insert email and we'll leave off created after now we'll just have it be

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,350
the default.

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,930
So that means we'll have what we want to do.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:40,120
Let's do Katie three 4 at yahoo dot com.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:51,440
And then adding another one which will be let's do today at gmail dot com.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,430
Sure just like that.

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,160
So just two users.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,990
I'm not going to source this again unless I commented this out otherwise it would try and create users

14
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,950
again just copy this.

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,720
Do we have any syntax issues.

16
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,600
We'll see.

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,370
OK.

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,270
It looks good.

19
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,810
You can do a quick select star from users.

20
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,500
There we go.

21
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:10,970
OK.

22
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,220
So we have data in here.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,020
That's all we need to start now.

24
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:21,560
Our goal is to come over to this file and rather than doing these silly select her time and her date

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,220
and now we're going to try and select from the users table we want to make sure that not only are we

26
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,410
connecting to the database which we've already established but we want to see if we are able to connect

27
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,410
with that table and query it.

28
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,990
And the syntax is actually the same.

29
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,390
So I have a slide on it but if you notice we're just doing connection queery and then we just have a

30
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,150
query here that we can replace with whatever we want.

31
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,180
So our query is what how do we select everything from users.

32
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,160
Well we just did it.

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,080
It's like star from users.

34
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,910
So we'll save that.

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,450
And you know again you could just copy and paste that right there.

36
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,700
I'm going to get rid of all this because we're not working with time date now anymore.

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:15,350
All I'm going to do is say if there's an error throw the error and then we'll do cancel that log results

38
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,590
just like that.

39
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,630
I mean get rid of everything else here just these.

40
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,020
So this is just set up we're not even using faker can get rid of that.

41
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:31,230
All that I'm doing connecting to a database and I have a q which is just storing our simple select star

42
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,420
from users.

43
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,390
Then I'm doing connection's query.

44
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:41,870
So take this connection we set up run this query which the first argument is select start from users.

45
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,790
The second argument is everything.

46
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,350
Basically it's a function that will be called when our query finishes.

47
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,990
So when it either comes back saying great it worked or it comes back saying hey your database isn't

48
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,990
running or I can't find that table whatever it is.

49
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,370
If there's an error throw the error if there is no error.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,090
This is empty.

51
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,000
There will be nothing there.

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,430
And constantly log results.

53
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,600
So we need to go over to the correct terminal and run it make sure we save it a circle up there.

54
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,800
So save Noad apt.

55
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,320
James OK take a look at that.

56
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,840
We've got two results.

57
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,010
Each one is a row data packet with the email and it created that e-mail and created it.

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,510
So that's looking good.

59
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,800
We are getting our data back and if we want to only and take a look at toone day and his information

60
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,200
we can drill down and just access results 1 their index at zero.

61
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,660
It's an array Javascript.

62
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,750
So this is the zero with result.

63
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,860
And this is the first save.

64
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,830
Run it again.

65
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,930
You can see we now are only dealing with today.

66
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:58,140
And if we only wanted to print out let's say it's email can just do email and there we go today at gmail

67
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,930
dot com.

68
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,760
OK.

69
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,850
So that's the first and most basic thing that we can do as far as selecting.

70
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,200
So now when we're talking about this join us application that we're making we're never actually selecting

71
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,170
all the user information we're going to have five hundred or thousand users ideally more.

72
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,200
We're not selecting all of them.

73
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,080
What we're trying to display to the user is just how many there are.

74
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,010
We're trying to display how many users there are and that is just a matter of counting.

75
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,580
Now we could do it a really kind of bad way.

76
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:36,540
I was going to cursor a really bad way which would be basically select all the users and then just run

77
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,540
results.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,710
Link which will tell us how many results that are which gives us two.

79
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:50,100
So that's a really bad way of doing it because if we have 10000 items in our database we're going to

80
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,420
go select all of them bring all of them back here just so that we can do data length on it.

81
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,980
I don't think that's a good way of doing it.

82
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:05,040
So rather than doing that what we can do instead is just to count its like count start from users just

83
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,960
like we've done before.

84
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,880
Now if we do it you can see we get count is two and a nice.

85
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,710
Remember we can add in as.

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:21,760
So we'll call it as lets call it total this time and it needs over here after the field before the from.

87
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,290
And now if we run it again I can see it stored under total.

88
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,700
And if we wanted to get that it's just a matter of results.

89
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,020
Not total and now we get to.

90
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,950
So this is a much better way because we're asking my as well to count and just give us the count back.

91
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,640
We don't actually need every row.

92
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:44,970
So instead of 10000 results back just give us count and then we can work with that.

93
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,410
So this is what we'll be doing.

94
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,260
We will have a query like this when a user goes to the home page of our application.

95
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,770
Bear with me while I scroll back to probably just edit this speeded up.

96
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,280
OK.

97
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:06,660
But when a user goes to this page this number is the result of our node or no Jasc running that connection

98
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,060
dot query select count star from users and whatever number comes back.

99
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,930
We are sticking in the markup in each team out.
