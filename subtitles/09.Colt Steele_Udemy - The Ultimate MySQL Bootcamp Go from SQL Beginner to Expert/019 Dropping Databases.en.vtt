00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.800
So we have seen how to create a database and the natural next step is to see how to delete one.

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.860
It's pretty simple.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.180
The command is drop database and then whatever the name of the database is that you're looking to do

4
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.970
it.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.810
So we'll come across this term drop here a couple of times in the course.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.020
It's basically the sequel version of delete.

7
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.780
And we'll be able to use it to drop things other than just a database be able to delete tables for instance.

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.110
Once we get there.

9
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.830
So let's try it up.

10
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.780
Back in cloud 9 when I ran share databases here are two that I created.

11
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.560
I'm not going to delete any of the preexisting ones.

12
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.310
I just don't want to mess with that.

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.410
So we will delete both of these though.

14
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.280
Hello world DP and testing D-B.

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.440
So let's do that now.

16
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.760
Drop database.

17
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.530
Hello world TV semi-coma.

18
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.110
And you can tell that it works.

19
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:06.690
First of all because it said queery OK but then also if I recall show database's this time hello world

20
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.430
D-B is gone.

21
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's do the same thing.

22
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.860
Drop database for testing TV.

23
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.070
This time I'm going to leave off a semi-colon not because it's a good idea but just to remind you that

24
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.600
your code will not execute until you had that in there.

25
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.820
Doesn't matter that it's on a separate line.

26
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.870
We'll be writing multi line queries just a little bit.

27
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.160
What does matter is that it's there at all.

28
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.600
It's what indicates that you're done and that it should run.

29
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.760
So we can just double check that it worked.

30
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.230
Now our testing DB is gone as well.

31
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.930
So that's all there is to dropping a database.

32
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.250
Pretty straightforward comment.
