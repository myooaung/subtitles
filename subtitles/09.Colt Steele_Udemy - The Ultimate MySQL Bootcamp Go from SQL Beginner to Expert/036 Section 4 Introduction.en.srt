00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,990
Hey welcome to the next section.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,840
So let's recap what we just saw in the last section.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,100
We basically saw how to make databases and then how to create tables which are currently empty to represented

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,720
by this box here.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,430
Let's say this is a catch table it's empty it has no data in it.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,970
But in this section I'm going to show you the tools to insert data into the cat's table.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,770
Thank you Blue.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,430
That was perfect.

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,210
So we'll see how to do that.

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,130
It's a insert command.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,080
So we'll see that and get lots of practice lots of exercises inserting data into tables and then the

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,010
other thing we're going to see in this section.

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:43,110
It's not the primary focus but it's important is selecting data back out and they won't remove blue

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,920
from the box just yet.

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,990
She's very paranoid.

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,380
She loves this box.

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,680
But the idea is rather than deleting things that's for another time another section.

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,360
How can we retrieve it out.

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,260
How can we read it or search.

20
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:02,880
So let's say insert I don't know 10 cats into a box and they all have different birthdays and breeds

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,780
and names.

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:11,760
I want to be able to run code like select or retrieve the last five cats added or retrieve the names

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:19,610
of the Russian blue cats or retrieve the names of the the last of the oldest cat in your database.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,870
Something like that she's having a lot of fun in there.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,670
So that will be the goal in this section is to show you those two commands.

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,530
Inserting data and then retrieving it back out.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,840
I'm just going to leave her in there I can't can't stand to take her out.

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,660
All right we'll end it there.

29
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,090
Blues and during her box.

30
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,180
I am enjoying whatever this is.
