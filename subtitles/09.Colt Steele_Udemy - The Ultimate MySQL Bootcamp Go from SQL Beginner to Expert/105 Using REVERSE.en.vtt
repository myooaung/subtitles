00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.570
All right moving along to the next function which is reverse and reverse does sort of sounds like it

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.190
reverses strings.

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.920
That's why I said it's super straight forward you know forward reverse to Joe.

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.620
Yep.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.580
So that's what it does.

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.560
It will reverse a string.

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.780
So here's an example.

8
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.600
Select reverse of hello world and we get this or oh oh oh.

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.070
I think it's probably best if I just stop pronouncing them from here on out but you get the reversed

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.280
version of the string same casing and everything same space is just reversed.

11
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.500
And that's kind of all there is to it.

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.590
To be honest I'll show you a couple of examples.

13
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.950
But if you feel like you already have it you know that was enough for you and you understand how it

14
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.710
works and feel free to just move on.

15
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.910
But I'll go over to cloud 9 and show a couple of examples.

16
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.750
So let's do a select reverse and instead of hello world let's just do it meow meow.

17
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.620
Why not just like that and we get what oh I said I couldn't pronounce.

18
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.230
Well we get this right here.

19
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.820
Reverse of Yeah yeah.

20
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.010
So we could do the same thing to find the reverse of every author's first name in our table for instance.

21
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:29.370
So that would be a select reverse author name.

22
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:39.420
And then from books and there we go we get the reverse of Jhoom further a version of Neal and so on.

23
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.650
And that's kind of it.

24
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.160
And just like some of these other ones we can combine them.

25
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.190
So if I wanted to turn something into a palindrome for instance let's say I started with the string

26
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.640
Wolf.

27
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.520
And if you're not familiar palindrome something that reads the same forwards backwards.

28
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.380
So the way I would do that is by adding f o w to that and concatenating them.

29
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.900
So taking the original string plus the reverse string and concatenating them.

30
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.950
So we have two functions we've seen how to do that.

31
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.670
And it's just a matter of concat.

32
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.050
So a select Concat.

33
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.580
And we'll just start with with.

34
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.230
And then what do we want to concatenate it with.

35
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:34.280
Well we want to concat and hit it with the reverse of just like that and that should do it.

36
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.740
Let's try it out and we get this the palindrome version.

37
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.050
I guess we just made this sandwich.

38
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.080
Now let's just try it with authors first names again.

39
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.510
So let's do that now.

40
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.930
All we need to do is replace a couple of things in here so rather than can catting with we're going

41
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.260
to do.

42
00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:05.130
Author f name and then we're going to use the reverse of author name as well.

43
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.690
Just like that.

44
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.160
And then of course we need to say from where.

45
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.270
From books.

46
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.220
Let's copy that.

47
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.740
So just again taking the author's first name the reverse of the author's first name and we're smashing

48
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.970
them together with concat

49
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.370
and there we go.

50
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.800
We get some kind of funny I guess.

51
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:36.910
David Deaver D and I don't think any of them are really pronounceable otherwise but they are valid palindromes.

52
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.970
So I guess we succeeded at something.
