Deploying models with ML flow is really easy.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:09.700
Let's see how we can deploy a modal locally.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.150
Back in them will flow away.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.440
I can see several grants.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.550
I'll pick one of them.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.360
For each running, get a unique line ID,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.760
and go to the command prompt and run this command.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.540
Ml flow models are dash gas,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.475
mortal URL, then runs,

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.625
give the Run AD, which is around 90 that is getting shown here.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:37.275
So you can pick any of you who runs and pick their NAD and deploy it.

00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:40.900
And then you also need to specify a port number.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.265
I've given 1244.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:45.965
So using a mill flow model serving,

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:47.690
we can deploy this model.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.160
And behind this CNET,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.745
which is flask to create a rest API.

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:58.355
Now it is started gunning at port 1244 localhost.

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:03.320
We can send request from a risk land the way we have done earlier.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.945
A few things to note.

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:12.710
Unity have URL port and then you IRAs invocations.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.505
You to specify application JSON in the header format.

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:22.410
And this time you have to send the data in a Pandas DataFrame format.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.750
You got a response one,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.020
that means this customer with age 42 and repeat out it is going to buy.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.780
So these are, we can easily deploy a melt flow model locally and cleared

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.410
an APA and start serving your model.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.715
With the milk flow, you can deploy your modelled easily to various cloud environments.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:50.490
Checkout their documentation for more information.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.680
Thank you for enrolling for this course.
