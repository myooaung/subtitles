00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
We'll be writing JavaScript code using Visual Studio Code,

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.770
which is a very popular Integrated Development Environment or

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.430
IDE for JavaScript tend website development.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.880
You can simply download it and start using it.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.510
Know that it is Visual Studio Code nor the Visual Studio,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.060
Visual Studio code that you need to download.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.790
And once you've downloaded and installed,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.400
then you can open it and start writing your code.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.905
Within Visual Studio code,

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.090
you'll have to open the folder,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.455
go to File Open Folder,

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:39.335
and open any HTML file.

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:44.310
And then you can start editing it using Visual Studio Code.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.795
To this, the simple index.html file,

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:49.790
which is some text.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.225
And we will open that using Visual Studio Code.

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:58.085
You can make changes to the page and thus save it.

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:01.410
You can also configure auto save.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.470
You can make changes and open the HTML page using a browser and see the output.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.369
Can these extensions link and ARD leaps that about extension.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.700
That would give us a local web server to deploy the page.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.150
Click install to install a web server,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.220
it would get installed in a few seconds.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.120
Once it is installed,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.240
let's go back to the explorer view.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.790
Will open index.html.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.275
Make some changes.

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:49.130
Now will say right click open with live server.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.405
The strength to start us out where it port 55 00.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:57.350
We'll allow axis using the leaps that,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.065
or we can have the same experience as a web service.

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:04.520
Now our site is located 127001,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.710
which is the local laws, IP,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.665
then port 55 00 and index.html.

00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:11.255
So instead of opening it,

00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:14.150
specifying the complete file path,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.540
we now have a local web server running which displays the content of this webpage.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.600
As soon as we type something that changes will automatically get that afflicted.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.355
In lifestyle.

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:31.140
Index.html page.
