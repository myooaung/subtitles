00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.340
We lose Anaconda spider for machine learning development.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.930
Search for download Anaconda and go to their website.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.240
Click on pricing. Scroll down,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.760
select the individual edition which is free.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:33.010
Click Learn More. Click Download and pick the right version for your operating system.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.150
Once downloaded, click on the installer.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.750
Except that Thomson condition just means fine selected directory.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.970
Make sure there are no spaces in the directory.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.830
I would recommend selecting both the tick boxes because you can

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.300
make Python NEW dalda environment variables.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.650
Click on install. The installation takes about 20 to 30 minutes.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.590
Once completed, click Next.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.935
We don't need to select this to click Finish.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:34.220
Started for record, our spider had lunch.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.010
Spider will first create a working directory where we will store all the files.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.800
Directory under user engine.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.535
This will be my working directory.

00:01:52.535 --> 00:02:00.485
Go to the top right hand corner and select there directly.

00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:04.865
And that, that would be working directly.

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:08.370
Now let's create a new button.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.630
We'll write helloworld.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.270
File is Python or

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.810
lower

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.620
selected and run it.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.540
You can bend it using recycled.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.620
And we can see helloworld dot console.
