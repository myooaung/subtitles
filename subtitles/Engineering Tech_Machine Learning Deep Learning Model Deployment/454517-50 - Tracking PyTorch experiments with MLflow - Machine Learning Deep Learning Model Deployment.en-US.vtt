00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.420
Let's now see how to track machine learning experiments with ML flow.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.370
Let's copy the pipe neural network code

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.610
for customer behavior prediction to the collapsing.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.040
We need to import two additional libraries,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.800
that is the milk flow and ML flow Pi torch.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.045
Let's give the experiment in Nim.

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:33.190
And when plough by touch demo,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.235
we can not track different parameters, different metrics.

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:43.685
So let's create a code block with ML, deploy, start run,

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:48.470
and then track number of epochs and drag the model.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.650
Before we run it, we need to ensure any existing ML flow r1 is terminated.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.800
So let's invoke ML flow end run.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.275
Then we Tamil PLO start R1.

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:02.340
We can start that on.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.650
Let's run this cell now.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.180
We're running it in the same notebook where we ran the scikit-learn experimentally.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.790
Or you can also create a separate notebook and install NG rocket, run it there.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.740
Let's go to them and flow.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.780
You wait now and we're fiscal page.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.780
We can see the new experiment ML flow, python demo.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.730
And one of the run was executed are layered.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.815
Let's open the recent one.

00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:37.295
We can see the parameter and modal artifact.

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:40.415
Now let's change the number of epochs to

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:49.650
50 and will also change the param value to 50.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:59.390
We'll run it again. Now we

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.720
should see that neuron with param value is 50.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.910
We can also allow different metrics.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.120
Let's drag loss metrics.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.660
Using the log metric method,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.550
we cannot track different metrics.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.420
We'll run it again.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.640
Go to employers, find that neuron.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.810
And we can see that loss metrics is getting trapped.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.670
This is how you can track different metrics,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.880
different parameters for your high-touch model experiment.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.529
On the homepage, you can select multiple runs and do the comparison.

00:02:54.529 --> 00:03:00.150
Hard download the experiment parameters and metrics to a CSV file.
