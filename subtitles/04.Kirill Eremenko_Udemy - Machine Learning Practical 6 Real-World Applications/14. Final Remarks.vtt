Hello everybody.

00:02.550 --> 00:09.120
Welcome to the last video on predicting the likelihood of you signing a loan based on financial history.

00:09.450 --> 00:14.290
In the previous periods we finalized the model building process and we ended up with a Malata gibbers.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.700
Sixty four percent accuracy.

00:16.710 --> 00:19.800
So let's talk about how we can use this model.

00:21.120 --> 00:25.860
Now our model of course has given us the 64 percent accuracy we did.

00:26.040 --> 00:32.660
We have an algorithm that can help predict whether or not a user will complete this e-zines step.

00:32.670 --> 00:38.610
One way to leverage this model is to target those predicted not to reach the same pace with customized

00:38.920 --> 00:40.750
onboarding.

00:40.920 --> 00:47.040
This means that when the lid arrives from our marketplace they may receive a different onboarding experience

00:47.340 --> 00:53.320
based on how likely they are to finish digital or on board in process the original process is going

00:53.360 --> 00:59.490
to help our company minimize how many people drop off from the onboarding on this one of these screens

00:59.490 --> 01:02.640
is as effective as we as a company decide to build it.

01:02.730 --> 01:07.470
Therefore any user drop off in his funnel force entirely on our shoulders.

01:07.530 --> 01:13.500
This is entirely about how we decide is onboarding so we can maximize how many people can reach that

01:13.500 --> 01:14.540
screen.

01:15.300 --> 01:21.750
So we knew Borean screens built intentionally to lead these users to finalize the loan application.

01:21.750 --> 01:26.190
We can actually attempt to get more than 40 percent of those users put in at the finish the process

01:26.580 --> 01:28.830
to actually complete the e-zines there.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.170
And what 40 percent what.

01:31.170 --> 01:35.400
We know that our model has a run a 64 percent accuracy.

01:35.960 --> 01:36.650
Okay.

01:37.020 --> 01:46.620
So eve of all the people who have predicted not to reach the esign step 64 percent of them have been

01:46.620 --> 01:54.450
correctly predict on average of course this means that only around 36 to 40 percent of the subset of

01:54.450 --> 01:59.190
people are expected to reach the esign step into complete it.

01:59.190 --> 02:05.280
So if we can change the onboarding process so we can get more than the 36 to 40 percent number and we

02:05.280 --> 02:09.380
can increase it then we can drastically increase profits.

02:09.600 --> 02:15.480
Many many companies like the ones we are putting into work for prebuy hundreds if not thousands of loans

02:15.510 --> 02:19.080
every day and they get money for each one of these loans.

02:19.170 --> 02:25.440
So if we can increase the percentage of loan takers and we would apply this percentage by all the thousands

02:25.440 --> 02:31.680
or hundreds of people that were given loans every day were increasing profits drastically and all of

02:31.680 --> 02:34.580
this is done with a simple model.

02:34.950 --> 02:42.810
And this is the beauty of this case there is course is that we don't need complex machine learning models

02:42.810 --> 02:45.540
to get Palio into your company.

02:45.540 --> 02:50.850
Many times when they are scientists are joining a company they're going to join with very small set

02:50.850 --> 02:51.930
of experience.

02:51.930 --> 02:54.890
Not everybody is going to have five or 10 years of experience.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.620
So they're only going to know how to build simple models.

02:59.010 --> 03:05.910
But as long as they understand the business context and they know how to leverage this model then the

03:05.920 --> 03:08.790
profits are there for you to acquire.

03:09.510 --> 03:16.050
So they we're afraid if your model can be a little bit simple as long as the results are there well

03:16.470 --> 03:24.000
this is the end of this third case study and Syntec is a entire place to go over all of this case studies.

03:24.420 --> 03:26.560
Thank you very much for watching.

03:26.790 --> 03:30.070
And I hope you enjoyed the next case that is coming up.
