Hello everybody.

00:01.950 --> 00:03.090
Welcome back.

00:03.090 --> 00:08.550
In today's video we're going to jump into the correlation matrix see the relationship between the fields

00:08.580 --> 00:13.420
with each other and try to understand if we need some kind of engineering or not.

00:13.800 --> 00:19.080
We also can use our previous plots that we have used to gauge whether or not we need to do engineering

00:19.470 --> 00:25.110
or we need to remove some columns if not this could always be of course is education not to see the

00:25.110 --> 00:26.880
relationship between our fields.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.650
So let's begin.

00:28.650 --> 00:35.120
The first thing to do here is to just copy paste the code that we have use in the two previous case

00:35.120 --> 00:37.640
studies which is pretty straightforward.

00:37.770 --> 00:41.450
I have it here ready and this is the code for the correlation matrix.

00:41.520 --> 00:46.780
Again we're going to make some changes to this code because this had to work with our dataset ballasted

00:46.830 --> 00:48.490
see what's going on.

00:49.560 --> 00:56.210
So first we of course need to use the dataset to that correlation.

00:56.260 --> 01:02.010
Now this correlation method gives the correlation of each field with each other.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.950
So it is a lot more robust than the core function that we use in the media.

01:07.330 --> 01:11.070
Of course we set up the style of the correlation matrix.

01:11.170 --> 01:13.270
We do a couple of housekeeping.

01:13.270 --> 01:17.770
Again all this has been going over already in the previous case studies and there's no need to review

01:18.130 --> 01:20.700
the seaborne code here.

01:20.860 --> 01:27.220
But all you need to know is that in case you have seen this video of firs is that this will give you

01:27.220 --> 01:30.380
a correlation matrix of the type that you're about to see.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.810
So let's run this and see what we get.

01:34.870 --> 01:35.780
Excellent.

01:35.830 --> 01:42.130
And again if you've seen the previously studies you know that this is my favorite favorite chart so

01:42.640 --> 01:44.020
let's see what we have here.

01:44.320 --> 01:49.090
Now the first column here that we see is the age column.

01:49.120 --> 01:55.370
These also sort of scorch or the age column and the age column is somewhat related to rescore not all

01:55.370 --> 01:59.200
risk course we can see and the relationships are pretty light.

01:59.230 --> 02:08.110
Now if these squares are very colorful like these strong red on the right or strong blue then the correlation

02:08.110 --> 02:09.220
is a little bit stronger.

02:09.340 --> 02:18.250
But it is by stronger I only mean on the level of 0.2 0.3 not too much and you can see that on the lÃ©gion

02:18.310 --> 02:19.160
on the right.

02:19.210 --> 02:26.320
The legend is telling you that that higher number in this entire correlation matrix is 0.3 on the right

02:26.680 --> 02:28.810
and negative 0.2 on the blue.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.040
So if it's very light then it's even less correlated.

02:33.040 --> 02:33.390
OK.

02:33.550 --> 02:38.980
So we can on our part ignore those correlations for the most part unless they are too prevalent.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.880
So age has a very like correlation with all the other columns.

02:44.200 --> 02:49.240
As you go up here they become a little bit stronger so age has a correlation with income in a positive

02:49.240 --> 02:52.770
way is what you expect as well as years employ.

02:52.780 --> 02:58.040
You could only employ a decade if you are at least a decade after 18.

02:58.180 --> 02:59.900
So obviously there's a relationship there.

03:00.130 --> 03:03.660
But for the most part it is not too related to anything else.

03:03.730 --> 03:06.060
And the same applies for homeowner the second column.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.290
It doesn't have too many strong relationship with any of us.

03:09.310 --> 03:14.950
Now the first thing that we see here that is a strong read in something that we should note is the third

03:14.960 --> 03:18.610
call that can have this big red in the middle.

03:18.850 --> 03:24.070
And what this implies is that that they're called and which means the income column is related to this

03:24.070 --> 03:27.190
Rora here that is which is the amount requested Roe.

03:27.220 --> 03:34.090
So the more income you make in the month the more likely you are to request higher amounts of money

03:34.090 --> 03:35.750
for your loan application.

03:36.150 --> 03:36.570
OK.

03:36.580 --> 03:39.050
Seems I guess somewhat legit.

03:39.490 --> 03:41.580
The next three columns are a little bit light.

03:41.590 --> 03:42.840
So for the middle one right here.

03:42.840 --> 03:50.140
So this is column five this column five represents years employed and of course is strongly related

03:50.140 --> 03:52.060
with current IRS years.

03:52.060 --> 03:53.330
And this makes a lot of sense.

03:53.350 --> 04:02.110
For example if you are employed for a decade in the same job that means that odds are you're going to

04:02.110 --> 04:08.430
be living in the same state or city where the job is located for a long time too.

04:08.930 --> 04:09.680
OK.

04:09.700 --> 04:14.920
And from those people who do that a section of them is a subset of them are going to be living in the

04:14.920 --> 04:18.740
same house or the same apartment for the entirety of their experience.

04:19.000 --> 04:26.240
So it makes sense that a subset of them are very equally correlated with the years employed as well

04:26.240 --> 04:27.160
as current year.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.790
So the correlation makes a little bit of sense.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.610
And the next one is a little bit less important.

04:32.860 --> 04:37.900
And the next ones are less less important until we get into the lower right area.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.570
So we swim here in this lower right area.

04:40.840 --> 04:46.960
We're going to see a lot more red and a little bit more blue here and try to figure out why that is

04:47.740 --> 04:52.770
the first column here on the very left is the column amount requested.

04:53.050 --> 04:59.440
So Amaar requested is strongly correlated with the first rescore which makes sense because we know that

04:59.440 --> 05:01.990
there were scores to open or many many multiple features.

05:02.020 --> 05:03.430
And each of them is different.

05:03.610 --> 05:08.490
So it makes sense that at least one of them especially that the first rescore is dependent on the amount

05:08.500 --> 05:14.940
requested so far so good that in the next one the next feel is rescore number one.

05:14.950 --> 05:19.840
And of course risk number one is somewhat related to the other risk course and negatively related to

05:19.840 --> 05:20.660
the inquiries.

05:20.680 --> 05:27.610
Right now the rest are all related to each other in a sense and this makes sense because all the other

05:27.680 --> 05:31.410
resource are built independently and with different features.

05:32.250 --> 05:38.850
The odds are that if your risk core is high beriberi high for one is going to be somewhat higher for

05:38.850 --> 05:40.710
the other ones as well.

05:40.780 --> 05:46.470
They may be exactly the same but there may be some correlation because if you're a flat or horrible

05:46.470 --> 05:52.260
applicant and you just have the worst financial history ever then you're going to be failing or getting

05:52.260 --> 05:58.380
low scores on a lot of these risk cores even the ones that come in from the marketplace.

05:58.380 --> 06:04.590
So even if you're a good good performer like a quality applicant odds are you're going to get good grades

06:04.620 --> 06:06.250
on multiple those scores.

06:06.390 --> 06:07.400
So that's why there.

06:07.650 --> 06:09.990
You can find here they're correlated.

06:10.470 --> 06:14.660
So there's nothing here that forces us to remove fields because they're too correlated.

06:14.660 --> 06:15.470
We chose there.

06:15.630 --> 06:23.040
We see the correlations the strongest ones aren't up 0.3 level not too much and only the ones that make

06:23.040 --> 06:24.840
sense to be correlated are correlated.

06:24.840 --> 06:29.730
There's nothing here that is too fishy that makes us reconsider whether or not these variables are truly

06:29.730 --> 06:30.370
in the Bend.

06:30.510 --> 06:31.080
OK.

06:31.350 --> 06:37.200
So now that we have finished this quick eyeballing analysis of the dataset we can finalize the edia

06:37.200 --> 06:42.120
process and we can begin the actual data pre-processing process in the model building part.

06:42.330 --> 06:47.190
And that's going to help us remove some of the things that are like overlapping things things are defining

06:47.190 --> 06:51.100
correctly specific for this case study that's going to be the feature engineering.

06:51.420 --> 06:54.900
And we're going to discuss a little bit more of what we're engineer and we're going to do is going to

06:54.900 --> 06:59.030
be only one column but it's going to be is going to make a lot of sense.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.890
Anyways thank you very much for watching.

07:01.890 --> 07:03.350
I'll see you in the next media.
