00:03.390 --> 00:07.740
Know we're going to apply some under sampling techniques.

00:12.170 --> 00:20.750
We'll start by locating a word for lunch on such an index as you know word that wasn't

00:27.880 --> 00:43.000
will also be interested in counting how many fold the lead indexes up.

00:43.110 --> 00:48.440
Now we will do the same for the non fraudulent transactions.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.950
Everything will be the same except for the class that we will be searching

00:59.080 --> 01:09.340
now from then non fraudulent indexes will just select random sample matching the same amount of fraudulent

01:09.430 --> 01:27.120
transactions that we show up.

01:27.170 --> 01:31.000
We also need to charge for adults to buy like

01:35.640 --> 01:36.660
now to verify.

01:36.660 --> 01:46.810
We'll check the length of the you know fraudulent transactions select the oh we just create your rating

01:46.960 --> 01:55.980
with all the indexes of de-lurked and John suctions just bike and 18 holes in that is

01:59.760 --> 02:05.020
DuBose you will check these lens and tell you you are right.

02:08.670 --> 02:14.070
Now that we help this select that in the Access forum there's something we just select the corresponding

02:14.130 --> 02:14.560
Rowse

02:23.450 --> 02:29.630
will do the same as before just to split our data into x and y by Apples

02:55.930 --> 03:02.290
Contini We'll also split tower data into trying on test data sets.

03:23.980 --> 03:29.170
Now we're just just swarming everything once more to buy a device

03:45.320 --> 03:49.670
with just verify that our model remains unchanged.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.950
We can do that with some ID function say must before

03:57.450 --> 04:02.750
K in my chest and we'll also be copying the training code.

04:02.870 --> 04:03.300
OK.

04:03.470 --> 04:06.840
Now you can see that this time it runs faster.

04:06.950 --> 04:11.980
It costs less to train than before we trained with the entire data set.

04:11.990 --> 04:15.640
Now only with the under some sampled information.

04:16.490 --> 04:21.400
Now it's time to plot out a future matrix to understand how we can perform

04:52.320 --> 04:53.430
notice.

04:53.460 --> 05:00.830
Now we help a lot of less information available in our Confucian matrix but that's because we come under

05:00.830 --> 05:03.000
some sambal our data.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.080
It would be interesting to understand how will this perform on the entire data set.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.340
And that's what we're doing now.

05:11.340 --> 05:12.670
So what we're.

05:12.870 --> 05:15.000
But still there's a long way to go.
