Hello everybody.

00:02.010 --> 00:03.060
Welcome back.

00:03.060 --> 00:08.930
Today we're going to review the data say that we're working with horder the rent and customer description

00:08.940 --> 00:10.330
products product.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.730
The first call that we see here is the user identifier.

00:15.390 --> 00:22.320
In some sense this may be in e-mail but in this particular set this is a numerical ID that represents

00:22.380 --> 00:31.390
each party use the first open call that base the day in time that the user first opened the app.

00:32.190 --> 00:36.700
This is a very good measure to see when the user joins.

00:37.440 --> 00:45.570
They are the week represents the day of the week and with zero meaning Sunday and six median settling

00:47.240 --> 00:51.330
hour means the hour of the day when they first opened yet.

00:52.020 --> 01:00.630
As you guys may have seen here is a correlation 2:14 a.m. meets the second hour 1:16 a.m. the first

01:00.630 --> 01:12.120
power 7:19 p.m. means the 19 hour because in PM and so on and so for the next deal that we're working

01:12.120 --> 01:15.750
with speech which is simply the nature of the use.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.570
The next field is green lit.

01:18.720 --> 01:23.660
Now this is perhaps the most important feature that we're going to be working with.

01:24.300 --> 01:28.810
This is Christ every single screen name they use user has it.

01:28.890 --> 01:31.060
In those first 24 hours.

01:31.110 --> 01:33.790
The Commerce is a concept for a.

01:34.140 --> 01:41.730
And we're going to be processing these data a lot more in that home because no screens means the number

01:41.730 --> 01:45.750
of screens that appear in the screen.

01:46.170 --> 01:53.650
For example if a person has seen 15 screens in those 24 hours means that the person glasses on it three

01:53.680 --> 01:54.790
less flash site.

01:54.890 --> 02:03.000
The law does not screen usually very many game is very specific to the status in the product that we're

02:03.000 --> 02:04.320
working with.

02:04.730 --> 02:07.770
They have a little media game that the players can play.

02:07.770 --> 02:13.260
These are just a players play the game they get to either.

02:13.260 --> 02:15.700
Players will not play at all in the first 24 hours.

02:15.720 --> 02:21.700
You get a certain life is also a feature that appears in the app.

02:22.260 --> 02:25.700
Many pages use the app have a life.

02:25.800 --> 02:30.990
But if they use sites like any particular feature you will get one.

02:31.300 --> 02:33.940
They use it not like any feature whatsoever.

02:33.940 --> 02:37.620
They'll get to use Preview.

02:38.220 --> 02:47.160
Now many times a user and rolls in a free trial but end up using only the features that are available

02:47.220 --> 02:53.070
free version meaning that they don't think advantage of all the premium features that they could and

02:53.290 --> 02:55.840
that person has never used any premium feature.

02:55.860 --> 02:58.760
You may have the free trial they get you.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.040
They have.

03:00.160 --> 03:06.870
You know finally the roll call Tulsa's the response variable for this product.

03:07.230 --> 03:13.630
This is what indicates whether or not they ended up evolving into the end product after the trial if

03:13.650 --> 03:20.910
they are willing to pay probably why otherwise to go see and roll the Tulsa's when they roll into the

03:21.080 --> 03:21.500
pros.

03:21.570 --> 03:29.670
If they see this column right here and they is the only one that is not restricted to the first frappes

03:29.940 --> 03:36.690
meaning that is involved it can happen any time that they can vote the year after two years after.

03:36.780 --> 03:39.850
And this is what it measures.

03:39.990 --> 03:42.520
So this is what we're going to be working with.

03:42.540 --> 03:47.580
So in the next two videos we're going to do some easy hey we're going to find some very interesting

03:47.610 --> 03:49.370
trends these days.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.800
I hope you join me and until next time see you at.
