00:00.970 --> 00:01.810
Hello everybody.

00:01.810 --> 00:03.010
Welcome back.

00:03.010 --> 00:09.500
Today we're going to create the histograms of each friend Mary feels so that we can get a nice new husband

00:09.510 --> 00:17.410
these distributed and we can get Again a good sense of what I will emphasize in these projects.

00:17.470 --> 00:25.260
Every aspect of our model which extremely You build many models you realize the process we're building

00:25.650 --> 00:27.090
is there throughout.

00:27.310 --> 00:32.180
But what changes is the EPA what changes is how it is structured.

00:32.410 --> 00:36.630
So we're going to put a lot of emphasis now to begin.

00:36.670 --> 00:44.110
First we're going to get a new leader said too in which we drop all the columns that are not good or

00:44.440 --> 00:50.600
we don't care about building historians in this case we're going to drop columns.

00:50.970 --> 00:52.490
You sir.

00:52.560 --> 00:52.900
Geez.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.910
Are you ready to fire again.

00:54.920 --> 01:02.970
We don't care about this but call it we're going to drop church which is our response for great.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.450
So let's run this.

01:04.810 --> 01:05.160
Great.

01:05.170 --> 01:07.730
So we dropped it not listed below.

01:08.970 --> 01:15.850
As you remember in the previous videos for the initial project we built a for loop to plot every single

01:15.850 --> 01:22.810
histogram do what we each were going to do the same here and we're going to leverage that code that

01:22.810 --> 01:24.570
we use in the last three years.

01:24.610 --> 01:25.450
So here we go.

01:25.630 --> 01:31.170
This is the same code except that a couple is having me for our particular needs.

01:31.300 --> 01:37.630
So we begin with plotting the figure of Jesus Fieldy figure is the figure size couple inches.

01:37.630 --> 01:44.380
Then we build a supertitles cheese using the subtitle function with that histograms and the make calls

01:44.440 --> 01:50.170
again what it is and then iterate over each of the cops.

01:50.170 --> 01:57.280
So these columns are supposed to start at 1 and we go all the way to the number of columns plus one

01:57.820 --> 02:05.510
because as you remember piking indexes always keep us in there with block that particular column which

02:05.510 --> 02:08.690
we're in at the moment in a six five five meetings.

02:08.740 --> 02:17.240
Of course this is going to have six rows and five cops maybe six rows of plants in five column supply.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.040
So they went up to 30 plus minutes each.

02:20.050 --> 02:24.460
So this won't work here because we were working with around 30 cones a little bit.

02:24.920 --> 02:33.560
So we figured we've built the GCA then we get rid of the widebodies pretty much the Y level levels for

02:33.560 --> 02:36.320
each column because we don't want to overwhelm the block.

02:36.560 --> 02:44.960
And then when 13 then we get each individual platform pile which is achieved by selecting the columns.

02:44.960 --> 02:50.600
We need it to call the values and of course indexing that particular column though working with the

02:50.600 --> 02:52.060
time.

02:52.400 --> 02:59.840
Finally we use the boss the boss Mirable that we're created here so that we create as many things as

02:59.840 --> 03:00.280
we want.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.140
In each circle.

03:02.360 --> 03:07.970
So we're going to use just an item in four minutes and then we increase that we query all the rows for

03:07.970 --> 03:13.490
that particular column which we are at the moment we apply unique so that we only isolate the unique

03:13.490 --> 03:15.740
values of the row composed of the whole.

03:15.980 --> 03:23.760
And we tell piping how those policies the list of files in that's how many beans are e-cigarettes we

03:25.640 --> 03:26.200
great.

03:26.460 --> 03:29.930
And then finally we splot with BLT that his is to.

03:30.030 --> 03:31.750
We get that call that we want.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.120
We give the veins we create it and we select this color.

03:36.130 --> 03:42.810
I've selected three five the seven The is one they prefer because it looks nice but you can select the

03:42.810 --> 03:48.720
final step is the letter because it's possible that on your particular screen the plaques may be a little

03:48.720 --> 03:52.110
bit put together because of your resolution.

03:52.110 --> 03:57.240
Things look different with this rectangle function that tightly.

03:57.570 --> 04:03.220
You can use a rectangle size for each sampler and then everything's going to fit perfectly in Athens

04:03.230 --> 04:04.000
with overlap.

04:04.010 --> 04:10.550
Does the reason the right side to avoid overlap not the dimensions of this particular plot and also

04:10.670 --> 04:13.060
the figure size the originally 8.

04:13.320 --> 04:19.250
It's very depending on your particular in his own mind this will work if they don't work when your string

04:19.500 --> 04:22.620
playing around with numbers and they're working years.

04:23.010 --> 04:26.010
So not that's right and see what we have here.

04:28.720 --> 04:29.810
Excellent.

04:29.810 --> 04:30.420
Here we go.

04:30.610 --> 04:37.050
So we have the blocks that we first look at the top then there is the H-block and the distribution of

04:37.150 --> 04:39.620
H but seems to be pretty right.

04:39.660 --> 04:46.030
But it is fake everybody is about 8 years old because that's what you need to be to strike that particular

04:46.030 --> 04:46.800
product.

04:47.170 --> 04:49.600
You have a distribution that is right.

04:49.660 --> 04:53.900
Because the majority of the people don't use these services.

04:53.980 --> 05:03.740
So this is not the house housing it is to buy or ownership of housing renting them housing and undisclosed.

05:03.790 --> 05:08.080
We see that your people are not owners.

05:08.120 --> 05:14.000
That's a good amount of them are renters and most of them are unclassified.

05:14.470 --> 05:20.600
Now for deposits we drawers in purchases here on the right we see that is true you should be very right.

05:20.860 --> 05:24.340
That tells us that the majority of people happy zero value.

05:24.420 --> 05:31.510
We know deposits that we're working with is usually for the first couple of months of rocks.

05:31.660 --> 05:35.900
So in the first couple of months activity could be low.

05:36.040 --> 05:41.570
And then once the person has trusted the system for many many months maybe they will start it possibly

05:41.590 --> 05:43.800
more we join more and so forth.

05:44.140 --> 05:50.110
Also the engagement of the product may not be shown by the positive withdrawals shown by how people

05:50.110 --> 05:51.530
use it.

05:52.090 --> 05:56.380
Now as you think it is telling us that we don't have that in 0 or 1.

05:56.830 --> 05:59.270
So this is not to be here.

05:59.290 --> 06:04.320
Would you recommend that a lot of them have been recommended a lot of different screens.

06:04.540 --> 06:06.560
So it's a little more evenly distributed

06:09.690 --> 06:13.480
forces see this like they might already have 0 or 1.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.750
The same forces elect 0 or 1 seems to be the majority here.

06:16.780 --> 06:24.350
Is or can we here for SEE application that we see a lot more spread and distribution because it is more

06:24.350 --> 06:27.870
often the case that people in.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.420
Now we're we're moving next.

06:30.440 --> 06:32.720
Is this fine copies the columns.

06:32.730 --> 06:36.400
Well there's only two bars in the plot.

06:37.070 --> 06:40.990
This means that there's only two values either 0 or 1.

06:41.030 --> 06:44.490
I've downloaded is mostly one.

06:44.680 --> 06:49.900
Very few have not downloaded the app for the following You can see similar distributions.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.910
One Hounsou are built than the one and so and so or so to see them better.

06:55.030 --> 06:55.930
We're going to do it.

06:56.020 --> 06:59.040
I tend to visualize the percentages.

06:59.050 --> 07:03.140
From here we can see the distributions but it's not too many.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.420
It's the fact that they are binary versions.

07:05.680 --> 07:11.200
So we know what to expect and we can see some of them have very extreme distributions and we're going

07:11.200 --> 07:17.050
to use those two explorative as well because we've got to make sure that for example like this one right

07:17.050 --> 07:25.270
here where we got to make sure that one is not so big such that the small population doesn't have both

07:25.420 --> 07:30.430
the response variable options either will want to move in the next video.

07:30.550 --> 07:36.340
For now we should only focus on the ones which have many categories for example register phones.

07:36.400 --> 07:41.880
The majority of people are going to have one phone registered meaning that they have this big party

07:41.920 --> 07:44.800
here and some of them will have to.

07:44.820 --> 07:50.900
Very few of them have three in almost none of them are for for payment type.

07:50.970 --> 07:56.910
We can see that bi weekly is by far the most common one and it is very common to have bi weekly or for

07:56.910 --> 08:03.490
people nowadays monthly seems to be kind of rare but it is really just the same for everybody else except

08:03.490 --> 08:05.970
for weekly Weekly has a higher bar as well.

08:05.970 --> 08:09.810
So these two are obviously the most popular ones.

08:09.870 --> 08:11.260
These are more binary ones.

08:11.280 --> 08:20.490
Now we have so exciting so exciting is even distribution because there's not and still is that out one

08:20.490 --> 08:24.370
month or one set of Days is going to have a lot more children.

08:24.390 --> 08:30.240
The other by here we see that Capricorn is not so highly represented.

08:30.600 --> 08:36.480
So we can maybe do some exploration for them but it's just interesting to see.

08:36.480 --> 08:41.160
So in the next video we're going to focus on the actual pie chart to see the distribution of these binary

08:41.160 --> 08:48.040
variables and remember that the point of this entire image is for you to get a feeling to feel that

08:48.080 --> 08:53.560
the feeling of how it is that you will do what you can expect which ones look fishy and which you should

08:53.610 --> 08:57.550
explore a little more which areas are very even which fields are not.

08:57.770 --> 09:03.450
So right now we see that there's a lot of binary ones and the distributions have happened to be for

09:03.450 --> 09:10.050
the most part are right skewed way the majority of them be concentrated in the first couple of elements

09:10.550 --> 09:14.260
of it in the next week we're going to go into the title for this by.

09:14.340 --> 09:17.040
And then we're going to continue that after that.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.960
Thank you very much for watching and see you in the next week.
