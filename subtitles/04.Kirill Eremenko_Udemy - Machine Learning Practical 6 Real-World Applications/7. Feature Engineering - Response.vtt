00:00.780 --> 00:02.900
Hello everybody and welcome back.

00:02.910 --> 00:08.230
Today we're going to begin the feature engineering process of the machine learning model building.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.380
The main part of the teaching process for our model is fine tuning the response.

00:14.730 --> 00:22.190
Is important because of the fall off that we need to set a limit on when we speak a user to convert

00:22.280 --> 00:23.910
a tape measure.

00:23.930 --> 00:28.500
This is because we want to have a way to Beldi tomorrow in future datasets.

00:28.700 --> 00:35.420
For example if we have a time limit or one week for enrollments to consider then we only need to wait

00:35.420 --> 00:41.300
one week or so to check if the model was accurate in predicting that use.

00:41.980 --> 00:48.770
But model was to protect an all time enrollment then we will have to wait until the end of all time

00:49.040 --> 00:50.920
to see if the money was accurate or not.

00:51.080 --> 00:58.400
So that is why it is important to have a particular date range limits on our responsibility to understand

00:58.400 --> 01:00.450
what time limit is optimal.

01:00.620 --> 01:07.640
We're going to plot our differences between the first open and the broad mandate to do so.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.250
We need to do some feature engineering which is what we're going to start in this period.

01:11.540 --> 01:12.890
Let's start by looking at the data

01:17.900 --> 01:20.940
to see the data types of each feature in the data frame.

01:21.020 --> 01:26.490
We're going to use that data set that we run this and we see all of that.

01:26.780 --> 01:29.310
Most of them are in the field in my optics.

01:29.330 --> 01:37.070
So what we want is to convert those dates into actual date time updates so that we can subtract hours

01:37.730 --> 01:39.600
from our data.

01:39.720 --> 01:46.520
So to do so we're going to use the Platonic version of loop and we're going to parse each particular

01:46.700 --> 01:48.550
date in that whole.

01:48.920 --> 01:55.290
So we're going to use the farcy function which we call for day two of the beginning and work with a

01:55.300 --> 01:57.340
pole line to each front.

01:57.620 --> 02:03.930
So we're going to call it wrote ADA and it's going to be full roll data.

02:04.450 --> 02:16.280
They said that first open this is Tell us that this is actually going to convert everything into a data.

02:16.490 --> 02:21.330
So if we run this we're going to see that there you go.

02:22.040 --> 02:24.180
Everything has been pulled very 20 time.

02:24.230 --> 02:27.540
So we're actually going to apply to the actual call.

02:27.620 --> 02:32.140
They say that first open and the changes going to happen.

02:32.930 --> 02:33.840
Here we go.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.340
It's changing is changing.

02:35.390 --> 02:41.950
And should we think we're going to do the same for the and roll call.

02:42.290 --> 02:52.740
So to do that we just copied it and we changed the name of the column all day sales here and all that

02:52.960 --> 02:53.660
great.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.130
But there there's a little catch.

02:56.210 --> 03:03.020
Not every row is populated in this particular color and we give a nobody to parse the parse function

03:03.590 --> 03:04.680
through an error.

03:04.970 --> 03:09.530
So what we want is to only apply this to the roster.

03:09.530 --> 03:12.990
Actually our streets so to do so.

03:13.130 --> 03:25.550
We want to add a statement and it's going to be it it's is in a sense for instance the road map which

03:25.550 --> 03:31.370
is what we're working with and testing pretty much these checks in each of those rows are issuing or

03:31.580 --> 03:37.620
if we are just going to return the actual road itself and the finish will pass.

03:37.670 --> 03:42.270
So let's run it it's run it's running and the eagle Istor.

03:42.310 --> 03:49.170
And if we run this place again we should be able to see that not those two days are actually the time.

03:49.480 --> 03:49.990
Great.

03:50.210 --> 03:54.380
So next we'll actually go into calculate the difference between those hours.

03:54.410 --> 03:59.550
So we're going to create new the acid defense.

04:00.050 --> 04:04.480
A It's going to be just a simple subtraction of those two calls.

04:04.490 --> 04:19.550
So they say that roll the great minus dataset that first open as you can expect and we're going to convert

04:19.640 --> 04:30.420
all of that into high time that okay because we can get the difference in minutes seconds days.

04:30.530 --> 04:31.250
We don't know.

04:31.460 --> 04:40.550
But if we just tell it to be a time delta of ours then we can forget specifically and we do so by creating

04:40.550 --> 04:46.630
that time down to 64 bracket's age these cells to convert it to just hours.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.860
So we run this great.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.620
We now have that different strip.

04:50.960 --> 04:57.710
So now we can start plotting a little plot of the distributions to see what is the best hour to select

04:58.070 --> 05:02.060
for a cutoff time for the response there.

05:02.060 --> 05:04.300
So let's do it.

05:04.340 --> 05:05.750
We're going to start histogram.

05:06.050 --> 05:10.610
We're going to call it a difference which is what we want to plug.

05:10.700 --> 05:11.740
So far so good.

05:11.900 --> 05:18.640
And then we're going to get the index because we don't care about the rules that are in the actual There

05:18.680 --> 05:19.990
are actually probably.

05:20.150 --> 05:25.560
And we got a caller just to be complete and the caller that we used is the quote that we always been

05:25.560 --> 05:29.800
using which is three and five the seven.

05:30.160 --> 05:30.750
Great.

05:30.780 --> 05:32.100
So let's run it and see what's up.

05:32.160 --> 05:32.620
Oh.

05:32.880 --> 05:33.650
One more thing.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.740
This is really nice.

05:34.750 --> 05:40.000
I'll never forget a beautiful plot always has a nice night.

05:40.080 --> 05:44.850
So let's go back here and give are beautiful.

05:44.930 --> 05:54.810
Well going to quote We're going to should of time sense since it all works just fine.

05:54.810 --> 05:59.130
And then one last thing we want to show the great.

05:59.220 --> 06:03.530
So the trend is excellent.

06:04.080 --> 06:11.690
So we see in a distribution plan that the majority of people enroll within the first I would say $500.

06:11.790 --> 06:13.710
So zero to 1000 is right here.

06:13.710 --> 06:15.420
So 500 is cut of course.

06:15.510 --> 06:18.210
So everything pretty much falls off right here.

06:18.210 --> 06:26.280
But because there is a right of distribution here maybe this all happened not actually in the first

06:26.290 --> 06:35.190
500 hours but in the first 100 hours or maybe less so to do so we're going to copy this Baystate do

06:35.190 --> 06:36.460
it just once more.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.480
But in this case we want to change one little thing.

06:39.750 --> 06:42.850
We're going to actually reach here.

06:42.900 --> 06:48.450
This is going to all the values that is within these rich 0 to 100.

06:48.840 --> 06:54.950
So we saw that the major population was lying on 0 to 500.

06:55.260 --> 06:57.110
If we only plotted one hundred.

06:57.120 --> 07:05.820
What happens is and again the distribution you say right tail meaning that actually everything happens

07:05.850 --> 07:07.980
within the first 10 hours.

07:08.330 --> 07:14.800
OK but we still see some events happening in the hour 20 hour 30 much less.

07:14.800 --> 07:20.520
And of course I remember a lot of that happen to the very right there.

07:20.640 --> 07:27.880
So to include the majority of that people were going to restrict ourselves to the first 50 hours a year.

07:28.020 --> 07:32.910
But to be more exact let's do it 48 hours because 48 hours are two days.

07:32.910 --> 07:33.960
Exactly.

07:33.960 --> 07:41.940
So today is a good day based on the distributions to pretty much pull put us of time to our response

07:41.940 --> 07:42.920
fear.

07:43.110 --> 07:44.270
So let's do it.

07:44.310 --> 07:50.180
We are going to change every single response variable which is large.

07:50.250 --> 07:54.460
That data set that difference greatly.

07:54.570 --> 07:55.540
48.

07:56.010 --> 07:57.680
And we're going to say that equal share.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.930
So what does this mean.

08:01.160 --> 08:07.530
And we're going to say for every person who can never roll is ZERO say sorry.

08:07.530 --> 08:12.270
So for those people who actually didn't know we're going to put them to 0 9.

08:12.330 --> 08:18.930
If they are about the 48 hour mark if there are 48 hours or less we're still going to leave them as

08:18.950 --> 08:19.300
a rule.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.320
But if they're hiding that they're going to be removed.

08:22.350 --> 08:23.710
So we run this.

08:23.790 --> 08:26.620
Now they're all removed and that's it.

08:26.970 --> 08:33.120
And now that we have utilized the date features and we have created that difference we don't really

08:33.120 --> 08:34.750
need to use them anymore.

08:35.100 --> 08:40.260
So what we do do is when you we're then with for work we're going to drop the columns and we no longer

08:40.260 --> 08:46.850
need in this case it's going to be a quarter differential which we no longer have use for.

08:46.980 --> 08:52.110
We're going to use the raw data of course because we have this that again.

08:52.590 --> 08:58.480
And finally we're going to use the first open which also is use.

08:58.980 --> 09:02.480
So we run this that's it that's finished and that's it.

09:02.570 --> 09:05.890
That is the totality of the future.

09:06.090 --> 09:11.820
When it comes to the response for the next video we're actually going to explore some extra features

09:11.830 --> 09:15.870
engineered fields and until next time next we.
