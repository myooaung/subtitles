00:00.720 --> 00:02.160
Welcome back everybody.

00:02.160 --> 00:05.360
Welcome to this final video of our model building process.

00:05.550 --> 00:13.920
In this video we're going to combine the Brinley the results the actual results and the identity of

00:13.920 --> 00:16.620
the users that we have run the model.

00:16.910 --> 00:25.050
So let's begin by making sure we label what we're doing.

00:25.470 --> 00:35.280
So we want a data frame that has all the three columns access features meaning the user and the fire.

00:35.280 --> 00:41.040
The actual result that they use are produced and the predict the result then you start to see if the

00:41.510 --> 00:46.740
most accurate are the final results.

00:46.920 --> 00:59.280
Beaches concatenation out of verse that use or identify or the white test which is the actual value

00:59.280 --> 01:00.930
for the results of these users.

01:01.080 --> 01:08.770
And of course like I mentioned that you said and if I just just identify grey.

01:08.830 --> 01:11.390
So what's next.

01:11.650 --> 01:19.210
We are going to get these on access number one meaning that we are going to make each of these eight

01:19.220 --> 01:25.880
call Fred and that route and we just drop in a force cure for this from this.

01:26.010 --> 01:27.180
Good work.

01:27.460 --> 01:36.160
And then finally we read the final column which is going to be that predicting which or predict the

01:36.160 --> 01:44.860
result either is fine and we're going to call this Wipro again.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.060
So far so good.

01:46.240 --> 01:54.210
And let's just reordered this so that it looks clean and has a sensical order so we can keep it in that

01:54.210 --> 02:01.860
ray of the order that we want which is usurped which comes from that they're going to fire the enrollment

02:03.160 --> 02:11.200
which is the actual result of whether or not the growth and of course the predictor results which is

02:11.200 --> 02:15.230
what we just create.

02:15.940 --> 02:21.500
We're going to reset in this because now that we have joined by in this we don't care anymore so we

02:21.520 --> 02:28.810
sit in next and of course by tropicals true meaning that we're not going to have to returning.

02:28.840 --> 02:32.480
So we run it and there you go.

02:32.760 --> 02:39.560
So let's look at the results that you searched to do 976 and rope.

02:39.810 --> 02:45.420
And actually it was predicted in Robert Wells that the same happens for the second user that 30 years

02:45.420 --> 02:46.780
or the fourth or fifth.

02:46.980 --> 02:53.500
And it is until the sixth usurp index number five that prediction does not match the actual.

02:53.910 --> 02:54.680
That is fine.

02:55.020 --> 03:02.460
So anyways there is always the final step is so that we can show you guys how to combine the results

03:02.490 --> 03:08.400
with the original source many models and many glasses that the pill bottles would just give you the

03:08.400 --> 03:10.360
results and you'll be happy with it.

03:10.560 --> 03:17.660
But of course in industry you need to know who you are predicting so that you can turn it to them specifically.

03:17.880 --> 03:22.100
And in this case is that you certain defier in other data sets it could be an e-mail.

03:22.140 --> 03:24.240
It could be a name or whatever.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.260
Why would you identify that.

03:26.670 --> 03:28.860
Anyways we have finalized our resolve.

03:28.860 --> 03:33.100
We have finalized entire world in process and this is the end of the problem.

03:33.450 --> 03:36.560
Thank you very much for joining me to this entire process.

03:36.570 --> 03:42.720
It was very fun to do from beginning to end and it was very fun to show you guys how these particular

03:42.720 --> 03:45.950
projects call when you're working in the real world.

03:46.640 --> 03:52.860
And the next video we're going to finalize that conclusion Gooding remarks and we're going to get ready

03:52.860 --> 03:54.840
for a coming up projects.

03:55.210 --> 03:57.010
Again thank you very much for watching.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.920
And see you in the next medius.
