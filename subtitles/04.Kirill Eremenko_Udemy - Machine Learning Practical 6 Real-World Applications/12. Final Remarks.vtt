Huckaback everybody in the last video we ended up finishing the modeling aspect of this particular project

00:08.100 --> 00:15.150
we ended up with a model that gave us a 76 to 70 percent accuracy in our predictions.

00:15.450 --> 00:21.150
So we can actually utilize these to bring a lot of value to our company.

00:21.960 --> 00:28.140
Our efforts are skewness a model that we grow every user as highly likely or unlikely scrap based on

00:28.150 --> 00:34.650
those products we get for Timbaland the results by running our model on daily installs and see whether

00:34.650 --> 00:37.210
the accuracy is consistent or not.

00:37.230 --> 00:40.940
From there we can narrow our marketing efforts only to those users.

00:40.950 --> 00:42.750
Let's try it.

00:42.870 --> 00:48.760
Increase or subscription ring decrease in Lobello subscriptions can measure the benefit of this of the

00:48.860 --> 00:52.320
company record and those are really likely to strike.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.570
We'll do so.

00:53.730 --> 01:00.410
And although we can still target them with offers we don't have to go up on the other hand uses correlated

01:00.420 --> 01:08.730
to the make break to pay subscribers if we give them enough for the fuse for example offers can come

01:08.730 --> 01:14.390
in the form of the first three or 50 percent of the crush.

01:14.850 --> 01:22.800
This offers show that even though this great offers cost us some money he can overall benefit the company

01:23.040 --> 01:29.640
because he will be locking in our users for a long from the first month free will lock our users for

01:29.640 --> 01:35.850
a first month which is now much better 50 percent of your description will for sure love any user for

01:35.850 --> 01:37.000
at least the year.

01:37.080 --> 01:42.800
So the benefit to us is still there is just some of the benefits that you get from running your model

01:43.050 --> 01:49.720
and I'm pretty sure you can find many more that on the industry or the company your work I'm very happy

01:49.900 --> 01:56.710
we were able to work with this project and get so much results that will make any company happy to have

01:56.730 --> 01:57.820
us more.

01:58.480 --> 02:03.820
Thank you very much for watching all of these videos and I hope to see you in the coming years for the

02:03.820 --> 02:05.490
new coming profits.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.500
Have a great day everybody.

02:07.730 --> 02:08.020
The.
