00:01.530 --> 00:02.320
Hello everyone.

00:02.370 --> 00:03.500
Welcome back.

00:03.510 --> 00:09.540
Today we're going to be exploring the medical fields but we're going to emphasize on the binary columns

00:10.110 --> 00:15.700
in the last video we saw of these two groups from many binary variables that we're not able to explore.

00:15.990 --> 00:23.200
Today we're going to dig deeper into those values by using Pinelands by charts are not the most descript

00:23.210 --> 00:26.920
employer out there to use but they do serve is just fine.

00:27.240 --> 00:32.750
The reason we care about these binary columns so much is because we must make sure that neither of them

00:33.280 --> 00:39.670
that is so high that the smaller set is too small because of their response.

00:39.680 --> 00:49.030
For example we don't want to have say only 50 rows which value zero and after 50 not have both possible

00:49.060 --> 00:51.050
values that the term variable present.

00:51.210 --> 00:57.210
For example you may just have on the series press there is a problem because it reached a milestone

00:57.260 --> 01:04.240
in the binary column column of importance because no matter what the other feels is play.

01:04.490 --> 01:10.480
If that column is value at zero it will force their response to also be zero in the prediction.

01:11.010 --> 01:17.070
So the kinds of problems we want to make sure that the binary columns are useful to us and that they

01:17.070 --> 01:18.870
can actually use them.

01:19.350 --> 01:20.180
So let's be

01:23.640 --> 01:25.170
the first step to getting the pie charts.

01:25.200 --> 01:31.010
Each to subset the we cannot set for only the data sets that have the binary cause.

01:31.260 --> 01:38.210
So I have the code right here which is a list of all the binary columns that we have when original data

01:38.220 --> 01:43.620
set is a total of 17 of them and their housing is refer to it.

01:43.620 --> 01:44.730
And so and so forth.

01:44.740 --> 01:49.390
So I say that you are going to run it just fine.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.080
Great.

01:50.100 --> 01:56.010
The next step is going to be to actually copy the same code that we use for his to rest but instead

01:56.010 --> 01:57.210
use it for questions.

01:57.360 --> 02:02.920
So we go up here we copy code and we're going to make slight changes to the code.

02:02.940 --> 02:06.150
Now the figure is still going to be the same figure for my screen.

02:06.150 --> 02:13.050
We're going to rename that chart to Pitre distributions which use a little bit more clipboards doing

02:16.230 --> 02:17.000
great.

02:17.190 --> 02:24.160
Then because we only have 17 binary columns in question we don't need a 6 5 5 image.

02:24.270 --> 02:29.350
We can use a six way three image which holds all of the 70 comes great.

02:29.580 --> 02:37.260
And then we again plot it get rid of the y axis give it and subtitle for each of the pie charts and

02:37.290 --> 02:40.780
we don't need the bouse bearable anymore.

02:41.340 --> 02:44.780
So we get it now instead of the guilty.

02:44.810 --> 02:47.580
Hey we're going to use a PI.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.940
So this is how it works.

02:50.040 --> 02:57.000
You wait for the first argument distribution's pretty much what the size of each slice of pie it's going

02:57.000 --> 02:57.630
to be.

02:58.050 --> 03:04.680
And those who are going to call out the first argument to the next we also want the labels we will then

03:04.680 --> 03:08.690
make sure that each slice of the pie is lame.

03:08.910 --> 03:15.480
So we're going to use the labels argument and we'll go set a to a variable.

03:15.540 --> 03:24.260
So we're going to the point in this is when we use the PC argument that tells the Pitre how to display

03:24.300 --> 03:32.820
the traditions and we won in distribution there is this play has a 1.1 meaning if Sloat or one this

03:34.500 --> 03:35.060
actually.

03:35.240 --> 03:41.520
So now you start getting the values in index for the balance each of the distribution of the column.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.470
Question.

03:42.630 --> 03:50.490
So we created by setting values because they say that suit which is the place that we're working with

03:50.790 --> 03:57.480
we're going to subsetting using AILA who go all the rows and only call them question we're going to

03:57.480 --> 04:00.310
get a distribution using value counts.

04:00.810 --> 04:05.410
But we want the issues to not be numerical absolutes.

04:05.430 --> 04:07.510
We want them to be percentages.

04:07.530 --> 04:10.610
That is a very scriptural issue which is great.

04:10.890 --> 04:18.540
So to get percentages instead we're going to use the argument normal US and we have to say to get this

04:18.540 --> 04:23.010
gives the percentages and the final step or just to get the balance of this.

04:23.020 --> 04:27.860
So now we can use this exact same code for.

04:28.080 --> 04:34.950
We only have to replace values or index because this will give us the labels or the two different levels

04:34.950 --> 04:36.370
of the binary scores.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.670
Here's what we can say next.

04:38.810 --> 04:45.800
And we are to the final step of the pie chart building process is just when we use the axes function

04:46.320 --> 04:50.020
and say Augusta we all know what it does do.

04:50.190 --> 04:58.530
This makes you that no x or y axis are shown on that image often but you can be displayed with X and

04:58.530 --> 05:04.560
Y labels which is just a original picture that we want display by itself.

05:04.560 --> 05:11.870
So that gets rid of that and we're ready to start running these both to see how you search.

05:11.880 --> 05:17.490
So Scott OK and here's the result.

05:17.820 --> 05:19.280
Excellent.

05:19.290 --> 05:25.010
So we have a more descriptive pie distributions now and explore what this means.

05:26.650 --> 05:33.160
The housing price tells us the distribution of the undisclosed versus the Disclose results.

05:33.230 --> 05:41.980
The results are o rent or owner and the lower 48 percent maybe a little less than the undisclosed place

05:41.980 --> 05:43.510
which is the one.

05:43.780 --> 05:49.870
So the situation looks nice but there's nothing we are about as a percent it's not a small subset of

05:49.870 --> 05:53.110
the population that we worry about.

05:53.110 --> 05:59.890
Now we look at what user Andrew user is preferred in any of the other pictures that we find in this

05:59.950 --> 06:06.920
image that are quite evenly balanced meaning that is a 50 or 30 distribution.

06:06.960 --> 06:12.880
There is again nothing to worry about those traditions the ones that we really care about are the ones

06:12.940 --> 06:21.970
that have a subset that is very very small of these those particular charts are waiting for own rejected

06:22.110 --> 06:24.570
on left for one month.

06:24.790 --> 06:28.820
By cancer alone and we have one or two more.

06:29.350 --> 06:31.590
And why do we care about this right.

06:31.930 --> 06:39.790
Well like I mentioned before we don't want these small subset for example the 0.1 percent way for them

06:40.420 --> 06:49.660
to be so small such that there is not enough results for either both roles where the term variable is

06:49.660 --> 06:55.580
zero and rather the term variable is one and the same can apply to the other small cells.

06:55.960 --> 07:01.330
So we can explore this further to make sure that these columns are actually useful fields that we can

07:01.330 --> 07:02.690
use in our model.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.860
So let's explore those.

07:05.470 --> 07:08.070
So we're done with the Pitre for a moment.

07:08.600 --> 07:15.270
And we can explore those variables by subsetting them and doing a body chemistry as well.

07:15.530 --> 07:16.840
Churn responses.

07:17.290 --> 07:19.180
So this is how it works.

07:19.600 --> 07:24.900
We will select the original dataset because that is the one that has the term variable included.

07:24.910 --> 07:30.400
We're going to use this as a tool to index their results and in this case we're using the waiting for

07:30.400 --> 07:37.520
them feel we're going in this when they were waiting for this one.

07:37.690 --> 07:44.030
Those small subsets that we saw in the pie charts that we're going to extract from that do I value them

07:44.360 --> 07:50.500
and that's what tells us all these rows we're waiting for is one what is the distribution of churn.

07:50.960 --> 07:58.270
If there is a case in which there is only or 0 and 0 1 then these particular field is going to be a

07:58.290 --> 08:01.940
fishy one and we may decide to skip it or use it.

08:02.020 --> 08:05.420
So this runs great.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.080
There are socialists.

08:06.180 --> 08:13.170
There is a twenty seven to eight ratio here which is nothing crazy it's not even 50.

08:13.330 --> 08:19.540
But it is not crazy to assume that there's going to be a bias in this particular deal.

08:19.540 --> 08:26.550
Now when we talk like this seeing lines of code to the other fields that were in question.

08:27.310 --> 08:32.640
Now instead of waiting for the phone in the second overvalues canceller.

08:33.100 --> 08:37.130
And of course we're going to run it and we get that.

08:37.210 --> 08:43.240
Now what happens if we Renton's they are on something like.

08:44.580 --> 08:45.610
We both receive no.

08:45.700 --> 08:47.160
Run it again.

08:47.440 --> 08:48.410
Pretty straightforward.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.560
But we will catalysis what we reject.

08:51.640 --> 08:58.870
Which is the one that we found to be a little bit more and again both response variables are shown in

08:58.870 --> 09:04.090
these letters also meaning that we don't have any reason to assume that he's going to be showing the

09:04.090 --> 09:05.880
bias.

09:06.400 --> 09:12.790
Finally the final one that we're going to chip is going to be left for one month.

09:13.870 --> 09:18.450
And here we go again this is a pretty bad situation nothing in the world.

09:18.780 --> 09:19.950
Good.

09:20.200 --> 09:24.740
Now we're finished with the church building process of this project.

09:24.810 --> 09:29.910
This was built for the sole purpose of identifying those columns in which the distributions are 2 or

09:29.960 --> 09:31.070
even higher.

09:31.120 --> 09:39.090
And even then and see whether or not those are small and even subsets contain both bodies that there

09:39.090 --> 09:40.020
is proper.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.300
And we have.

09:41.590 --> 09:47.980
So we are very happy with our columns and we're going to move forward instead of the EPA which is looking

09:47.980 --> 09:51.940
at the correlation of these independent fields with our response there.

09:52.390 --> 09:53.910
Thank you very much for watching.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.940
See you guys on the next.
