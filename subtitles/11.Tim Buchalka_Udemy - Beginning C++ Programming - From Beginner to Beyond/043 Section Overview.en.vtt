00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.810
In this section of the Course will learn about variables and constants.

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.740
It's virtually impossible to write a C++ program without using variables.

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.050
Variables are a fundamental concept in programming languages.

4
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.690
First we're learned variables are in how to declare them so we can use them.

5
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.520
There are rules for how we name our variables and there are also styled issues to discuss as we go along.

6
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.250
Then we'll go over some of the primitive types in C++ such as integers floating point numbers booleans

7
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.510
and characters.

8
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.630
We'll also learn how to determine how much storage is allocated to variables by using the size of operator.

9
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.160
Then we'll add about constants what they are and what they're used and why they're so important to keeping

10
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.960
our code correct and modifiable.

11
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.200
We learn how to declare and use constants understand literals and constant expressions.

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.320
This section is very straightforward and easy to understand.

13
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.320
However the concepts you'll learn in this section serve as fundamental building blocks in C++ programming

14
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.850
since nearly every program you write will have variables and constants get started.
