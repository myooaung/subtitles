00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.880
In this section of the course we'll take a quick tour of the code like ID interface.

2
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.020
It's important to feel comfortable with the environment that we're using to create our C++ programs.

3
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:22.030
So I'll walk you through the major functionality of the code like ID so you can get up and running quickly.

4
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.210
All write our first C++ program.

5
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.890
It will be a pretty simple program that simply ask the user for their favorite number and then displays

6
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.070
it on the console.

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.820
We'll use this program to look at the build options provided by code like.

8
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.510
And I'll show you how they work and what they do.

9
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.220
Finally we'll introduce some problems into our program so that you can see some of the typical errors

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.320
and warnings that you'll probably encounter as you write C++ programs and understand them and know how

11
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.500
to fix them.

12
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.150
That's it.

13
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.640
This section short it's simple but very very important since it lays the foundation for writing building

14
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.540
and running C++ programs in the code like I.T..

15
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.580
Let's get started.
