00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,560
In this video we'll talk about linker errors and why they can happen.

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,600
Linker errors occur when the linker is trying to put all the pieces of a program together to create

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,330
an executive will and one or more pieces are missing.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,160
Typically this can happen with an object file or libraries can't be found by the linker.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,270
Fixing linker errors can be tricky.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,240
Sometimes it's just a matter of getting the paths correct so that the linker knows where the missing

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,280
pieces are.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,100
Let's head over to code light and we'll force a program to have a linker errors.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,560
You can see what the error message looks like.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,040
So I mean code light and I've created a project called linker error based on the template that we use

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,650
so all I've got is a main C.P. file that says Hello world.

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,700
Now we're going to force a linker error here.

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,420
This is not something you want to do normally but I'm going to do it to show you what the error looks

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:53,820
like.

15
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:59,690
So what I'm going to say is I'm going to say extern and C but let's just say X and I'll explain all

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,240
this to you in just a second.

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,200
And then in the body of the main I want to try to use that X right there.

18
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,250
It's just an integer and let's say I want to print it out.

19
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,420
I just want to print out x.

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,450
Simple as that.

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,240
I'm going to save this.

22
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,550
Now you see if I compiled this program you'll see what happens and what a reichlich compile I get a

23
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,580
clean compile there's nothing wrong with the program.

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,530
But when I try to build and run it

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,120
you could see the linker error.

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,790
This is classic linker error undefined reference to something in this case it just happens to be X..

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,930
Also you'll notice that the linker returned one here L.D. returns one which is the next status.

28
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,310
So something was wrong with the link.

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,620
Obviously the compile was fine because we got no compiler errors that we do that again there's the compiler

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,040
no errors no warnings.

31
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,530
So let me explain to you what's going on here.

32
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,280
Let me grab my stylus here real quick.

33
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:07,550
And what's going on here is I've got my main CVP file here and it's going to be compiled to make oh

34
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:14,950
let's say or made object in here we have a reference to an X..

35
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,190
You can see it right there.

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,770
You could see it right there.

37
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,380
So in here I've got a reference to an X which I'm going to use.

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,750
Now we also have our IO stream libraries.

39
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,110
So the linker needs to grab those libraries and I'll just type IO stream here.

40
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,400
You know what I'm talking about.

41
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:37,000
The linker needs to put these two together to create my main you see or in this case I believe it would

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,590
be linker error.

43
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,060
But you know what I mean.

44
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,340
So the compile is fine we've created our object file this library exists.

45
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:53,130
The problem is that I've told the compiler here that this X is not in me it's somewhere else.

46
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,020
It's defined by somebody else.

47
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,320
Well obviously it is defined by someone else because that kind of forced the issue here.

48
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:05,620
So now the linker needs to resolve that X and saying OK where do I get that value to print.

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,510
Because that's what you asked me to do right here right.

50
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,720
I wanted to print the value of x where where is X but can't find it.

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,900
That's the linker error.

52
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,640
That's exactly what's going on.

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,900
And let me build this again so you can see the error message one more time.

54
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,330
And it's build it run it

55
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,120
and there's the error message it's saying undefined reference to X..

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,620
You can see Zackery what's going on.

57
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,200
Can't find x.

58
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,870
Now this is not a compiler error.

59
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,840
This is a linker air that's really important.

60
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,060
Understand linker errors are tricky to fix.

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,010
A lot of times the files that you need to link are missing they're in the wrong places.

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,380
You don't have to worry about that using code lightning in this course we're going to basically do everything

63
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,740
ourselves.

64
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,560
But if you're using libraries from third parties this is the kind of thing we'll talk about in a more

65
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,990
intermediate or advanced course.

66
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,530
But I just wanted to show your linker errors in case you do come up with one posted in the forum and

67
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,800
we'll work through it together.
