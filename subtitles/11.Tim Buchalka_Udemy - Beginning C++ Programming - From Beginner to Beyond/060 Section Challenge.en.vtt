Welcome to the section 7 challenge the purpose of this challenge is not to solve a specific problem

2
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.200
but to give you a chance to practice with vectors.

3
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.290
Declared two vectors and we'll add these vectors to a two dimensional vector that will declare as well.

4
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.110
You'll get a chance to work with the vectors at pushback and size methods and also work with a two dimensional

5
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.290
vector.

6
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.960
Then at the end of this challenge I'll ask you to modify a vector element and analyze the effect it

7
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.680
has.

8
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.110
You might be surprised by the result.

9
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.040
Please go through the challenge in order and implement each of the directives in the challenge.

10
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.900
Let's go over the details of this challenge together.

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.350
First I'd like you to declare two empty vectors of integers named vector one and vector to respectively.

12
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.350
Then add 10:22 vector one dynamically using the pushback method.

13
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.750
Display those two vector elements using the ATM method as well as the size using the size method.

14
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.620
Do the same thing for vector too.

15
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.000
Except we're going to add 100 and 200 this time.

16
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.880
They don't want you to declare an empty two dimensional vector called vector to D.

17
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.940
Remember a two dimensional vector is a vector of vectors.

18
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.680
Then I want you to add vector 1 to vector to d using pushback then add vector to vector to d using pushback

19
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.770
as well.

20
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.520
Then display the elements and vector to d using the method.

21
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.130
Now comes the interesting part.

22
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.850
I want you to change vector ones first element using the zero method and I want you to change it to

23
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.560
a thousand.

24
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.870
They don't want you to display the elements in the 2d vector again using the app method just like you

25
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.810
did before.

26
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.740
And then finally display the elements in vector 1.

27
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.720
Take a look at the results and see if it's what you expected and see what you think happened.

28
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.340
That's it.

29
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.880
Good luck.

30
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.480
Have fun once you've finished the challenge extended it any way you wish.

31
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.770
Remember the more you practice the easier programming becomes.

32
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.710
Once you finish a challenge join me in the next video and we'll go over my solution.
