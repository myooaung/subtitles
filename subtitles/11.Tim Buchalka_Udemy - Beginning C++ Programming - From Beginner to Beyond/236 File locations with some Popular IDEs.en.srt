1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,880
It is go over some of the popular ideas and where you should place the input files that you're going

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,590
to read from code like I won't do because we're been using it throughout the course but we've got Windows

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,530
Visual Studio code blocks Sea-Lion the next code and I do a really short video on all of them it's the

4
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,840
same little program that all it tries to do is open a file called testee XTi.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,950
And what I found was that in code like we need to do a dot dot slash test that text in Windows Visual

6
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,710
Studio is just a filename and code blocks is also just the filename in sea lion just like in code like

7
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,540
we need to go up a directory and then provide the name of the file and X code is a little different.

8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,860
So please watch the video if you're using X code and I'll show you how to set it up so that you can

9
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,110
use input files.

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,900
Ok so first let's start with your studio.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,340
So this example I've got visual studio and you can see when I run this sample it says error opening

12
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,670
file because the founders exist.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,600
So what we want to do is create the file so we can click the resource area and click add new item and

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,720
then select text file and give it the name test.

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,760
T x t it's lowercase

16
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,250
and press add.

17
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,680
And at this point that files Banat and we can go back to our C++ file and executed at this point.

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,110
And notice we're just using tests he exceeds the filename and we should get good to go.

19
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:38,720
There we go.

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,560
Good to go.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,460
So it's all set.

22
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,530
So that's the way you would create an input file in Visual Studio.

23
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:52,020
So now let's see how we can get this to work using the code blocks ID for this example I mean the code

24
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,520
blocks ID and you can see I've got the same file here where I'm trying to open an input file stream

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,050
name test that TXI T.

26
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,570
It's not here right now so if I try to run it says problem opening file to 6 we expect.

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,150
So what we'll do is we'll come up here.

28
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:16,060
So what we can do is we can come up here to select our project and say file new empty file.

29
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,790
Do you want to add this new file to the active project.

30
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,800
I'll save the project first.

31
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,770
And all we're doing here is we're just creating that file.

32
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:30,820
Test Dot T S T and make sure that it's in the file test directory or whatever the project directory

33
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:38,970
is and where basically where you see your source file right here save that it's going to ask me to select

34
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,890
a target so that's important make sure those are checked selected and at that point you can see it creates

35
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,280
this folder called others with the test in it.

36
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,980
And now if we run this we're going to go.

37
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:58,510
OK so that's how you would create a file for input in code blocks.

38
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,390
Next up is Seelye And let's see how we can get the input files to read using Sea-Lion.

39
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,540
I mean the sea lion ID on Windows.

40
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,190
And you can see I've got a real simple program that's going to test opening a file the file name is

41
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,100
test TXI.

42
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,540
If I run this.

43
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,500
He just clicked that little green arrow right here.

44
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,680
Or I can click the green arrow up here.

45
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,340
I'll just do it right here.

46
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,680
You'll see that what we'll have is we'll have an error says problem opening file just as we expect because

47
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,020
the file doesn't exist.

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:36,050
So I'm going to come up here to the project right click and say new file the file name would be.

49
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,480
Test t x T.

50
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:47,210
I'll save that and will try to run it again and I'll click the CBP file again.

51
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,410
Again we're seeing a problem opening file.

52
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,590
And if we look at the directory structure you'll see the problem is that the file is being created in

53
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,010
here you can see it right here.

54
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,750
File tests are easy.

55
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,100
So it's a level up.

56
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,280
So you need to do the same thing with didn't code light we just basically say dot dot slash will save

57
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,980
it.

58
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,600
We're running again and we're good to go.

59
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:21,450
So that's how you do this in Sea-Lion and we'll finish up this section with X code x code is a little

60
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:21,980
bit different.

61
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,450
So what's the value of using X code and you need to have input files.

62
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,350
Ok so I'm on a Mac running X code and I've got that simple program here I'm trying to open a file and

63
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,790
text 16.

64
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,650
If I try to run this I'll get an error out here same problem opening file.

65
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,540
So that part of the file is not there.

66
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,090
So let's add the file.

67
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,270
So let's right click here.

68
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,190
Will say new file.

69
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,120
So like Mac OS and Austro all the way to the bottom two says empty

70
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,880
and we'll create test that T.

71
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,930
That sits the files there now.

72
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:11,020
So if we run again it still won't find it will have a problem opening files the way the tax code works

73
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,320
and Mac works is that you see file that app is stored in some derived data directory really really far

74
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,620
removed from the project.

75
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,470
So the best way to do this on a Mac is to come up to product

76
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:35,040
then select scheme and end it's game and then look for this working directory right here.

77
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,800
It's under options on run debug.

78
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,860
You select working directory and you select.

79
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,330
You say use a custom working directory.

80
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,730
And what we want to choose is we want to suits that one to and what you want to do is select the working

81
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,960
directory where those files are humane CVP and your test he Eckstine you selected.

82
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,790
We closed this up now and now we run.

83
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,010
We should be good to go.

84
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,830
And we are and it will find the file just fine.

85
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,090
Most of the other IDs will also allow you to change the working directory but it's much easier just

86
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,570
to change the file path on those but on a map.

87
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,940
This is the best way to do it.
