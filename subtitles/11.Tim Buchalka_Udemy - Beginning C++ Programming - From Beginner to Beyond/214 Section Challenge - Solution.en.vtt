00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.600
OK welcome back.

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.660
This is my solution to the Section 18 exception handling challenge.

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.640
I'm in the Section 18 workspace in the challenge solution project.

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.050
And again this is my solution.

5
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.920
There's different ways to do this.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.430
If you did it a different way that doesn't mean it's wrong it's just different.

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.790
Post it in and we'll get some comments from everyone.

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.910
So in this case let's take a look at what I did.

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.470
I've created the illegal balance exception that we had earlier but I changed it a little bit because

10
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.180
what we want now is we want the class illegal balance exception to be derived publicly from stood exception.

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.490
OK.

12
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.520
So that takes care of that part.

13
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.620
So now remember an illegal balance exception now is a state exception.

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.450
I've got my public modifier here here's my constructor.

15
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.500
I'm just using a default constructor and I'm guaranteeing no exceptions being thrown from it.

16
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.340
I've got a destructor here again a default destructor and here's my virtual what function.

17
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.140
And here's a prototype for it it's virtual it returns a pointer to a character which is a C-style string

18
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.090
and it's Konst the function itself is consomme won't modify anything.

19
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.520
And again I'm guaranteed no exceptions being thrown from here and all I'm returning here is any kind

20
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.470
of C to be a C-style string.

21
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.660
In this case illegal balance exception.

22
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.280
And this is what we're going to print out.

23
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.580
On the other side when we catch this exception and print out the message.

24
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.330
So that takes care of illegal balance exception.

25
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.930
Now let's take a look at insufficient funds exception which is right here.

26
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.900
And neither one of these needs a CPV file because we're doing everything right in here.

27
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.530
So here's the insufficient funds exception.

28
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.810
Pretty much the same pattern.

29
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.660
My class is insufficient funds exception it's derived publicly

30
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.850
from stood exception and I've got an insufficient funds exception.

31
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.930
Again no except default constructor default destructor.

32
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.700
And there's my what virtual function which simply returns insufficient funds exception.

33
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.780
That's it.

34
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.400
Now if I go to my account CBP file you can see here in my account constructor if my balance if I'm trying

35
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.090
to create an account object with a balance that's negative I'm throwing illegal balance exception and

36
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.740
down here my withdraw method if the balance goes below zero.

37
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.060
I'm throwing an insufficient funds exception OK.

38
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.770
That is pretty straightforward.

39
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.270
Now let's take a look at the Main where we can test some of this.

40
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.750
So here's the main.

41
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.970
And what I'm doing here is I'm creating two unique pointers one to Moez account one to Larry's account.

42
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.200
And then the first thing I want to do is I want to try to create Larry's account with a negative balance.

43
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.270
Right now I expect this to throw an exception and I want to catch it right here.

44
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.920
I want to catch the illegal balance exception and just simply print it out.

45
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.010
What right that's going to call my virtual function and hopefully it'll say that I've got a negative

46
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.550
balance or an illegal balance.

47
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.630
So that's one test case here in this case.

48
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.380
I'm going to try to create Mo's account as both savings accounts by the way I'm pretty Moez account

49
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.640
as a savings account with a thousand dollar balance.

50
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.120
And then I'm displaying it.

51
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.860
I expect that to work then I'm withdrawing $500 and displaying it again.

52
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.340
I expect that to work.

53
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.610
Now I'm withdrawing a thousand dollars.

54
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.080
I don't expect that to work.

55
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.270
I expect that to throw an exception because that would create an account now with negative 500 I'd be

56
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.210
overdrawn.

57
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.640
So I don't expect this to display OK.

58
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.960
And this Larrys account here we really don't need.

59
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.710
Sorry about that.

60
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.740
It was a carry over from before.

61
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.700
OK.

62
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.660
So that's better.

63
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.400
So in this case we're going to catch both these exceptions in the legal balance exception and an insufficient

64
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.050
funds exception of either one of them throws then I catch them and just display them.

65
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.010
OK so let's run this.

66
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.310
And here's my output.

67
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.960
First one is I've got an illegal balance exception that's what I expected because I tried to create

68
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.740
Larry's account here with negative balance right.

69
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.440
Then down here remember at this point I don't display Larry's account because it hasn't been created.

70
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.410
So what I do is I just skip down to here and now I'm in this piece of code here.

71
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.300
So the first thing I want to do is I want to try to create Moze account with a thousand dollars and

72
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.990
display it and you could see right here Mo's account with a thousand dollars is no interest rate because

73
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.920
I didn't supply one.

74
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.640
Then I'm willing to withdraw $500 from most account and display it again.

75
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.890
So now you can see my account now has five hundred dollar balance right here.

76
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.330
Now I'm going to try to withdraw a thousand dollars.

77
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.750
That should not work.

78
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.110
So I shouldn't see Mo's account displayed again.

79
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.440
Instead I should get an insufficient funds exception being thrown.

80
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.490
And that's exactly what happens here.

81
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:09.860
This catch block fires a second catch block and stop what is displaying insufficient funds exception.

82
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.020
That's it.

83
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.540
Most likely your code is very much very similar to mine.

84
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.370
Your test cases may be different but that's OK.

85
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.640
You can test this by using nested trys statements as well you can have one try inside another.

86
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.330
You can try to create the object and then once you've created the object you can create tri statements

87
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.140
within that try statements that are exercising some other withdrawn methods.

88
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.480
So that's it.

89
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.510
Hope you had fun in this section and in this challenge.
