00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.360
Hello everyone welcome back to the section 19 challenge.

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.550
One solution.

3
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.730
I mean the section 19 workspace and I mean the challenge underscore one underscore solution project.

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.720
I hope you found this this challenge challenging.

5
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.350
There was probably a couple of pieces that were kind of tricky.

6
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.490
One of them had to do with displaying the country right next to that city the first time around and

7
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.290
I'll talk about that in a second the role might have been trying to center that title so we'll go over

8
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.260
both of those here the structures again.

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.960
Here's a city my country and my tours.

10
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.340
I've got this simple function called Ruller which I'm just going to use one time at the very beginning

11
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.370
just so we can look at our alignment.

12
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.190
And then I've got my structure which has been initialized here exactly like I gave it to you.

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.830
So the first thing I want to do is I want to look at my data and I want to kind of look at the sizes

14
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.480
of the data and make sure that there's nothing like a city and it's got 30 or 40 characters in it.

15
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.750
That way I can gauge what kind of field widths I want.

16
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.710
So that's what I did and what I've done here is I've decided to go with a total with a 70.

17
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.060
And the reason I did that was just purely console based because some terminal windows and some DOS Windows

18
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.010
and some shell Windows which is where we're running these programs are 80 Macs.

19
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.510
So I didn't really want them going over the HD and then rapping over and really making it ugly.

20
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.520
So what I decided to do was keep the total width of the entire report to 70 characters.

21
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.730
OK so 70 is our goal here.

22
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.990
And then we've got four fields right.

23
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.310
We've got the name of the country the name of the city the population and the costs and obviously we

24
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.970
have a title appears centered somewhere and I'll talk about that title in just a second.

25
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.280
So the way I decided to do this was to create four field with 10 I'm going to make constants from all

26
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.650
of these guys that way I don't have to use my numbers everywhere and I just use these names.

27
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.230
And if I ever need to tweak anything I could just come here and tweak them and it should be good to

28
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.790
go.

29
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.710
So 70 is the total with my first field is a with a 20.

30
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.210
So let's said that this is my first one here that say that this is another 20 here.

31
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.070
And then my last two are 15 which are a little bit smaller.

32
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.150
This isn't to scale but you get the idea.

33
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.360
So this would be the country's name.

34
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:23.580
Right so this would say let's say Columbia would display here and then the city would be over here the

35
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.680
population and both these guys I'll just draw arrows here will be left justified in that field with

36
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.750
then I've got the population which is a number which will be right justified here.

37
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.560
And I've got the costs which would be some number with two decimal points on the end and that's want

38
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.180
to be right justified here as well.

39
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.670
OK I've got a header over here which is going to say country city population will be right justified

40
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.370
over here.

41
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.860
So it lines up and over here costs will be JEA right justify.

42
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.700
So that's sort of the structure that I've got in my mind that I can tweak this as I go.

43
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.480
OK so that's really pretty much.

44
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.430
Here in my field with that I've defined so again 20 20 15 15.

45
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.740
We had them up to 70.

46
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.420
So I know that I'm in the ballpark.

47
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.190
Let's deal with that title.

48
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.270
So how many racist's real quick.

49
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.890
And scroll down just a bit.

50
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.570
And what we want to do is we want to display the type of mail notice on line 71 down here.

51
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.220
I'm just playing the ruler.

52
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.090
That's just going to display that series of numbers so that we can line things up.

53
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.790
But let's talk about the title and what kind of algorithm we want.

54
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.360
Again we've got seventy four our field our total width of our report.

55
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.610
And suppose I wanted to display something well obviously the center here is 35 right.

56
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.120
That's pretty clear.

57
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.340
And suppose I wanted to display something that was 10 characters wide a string that's 10 characters

58
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.980
wide.

59
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.760
The idea would be that I want to display five of those characters on this side and five on this side

60
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.370
right.

61
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.530
That would center that string if the string was 20 characters wide.

62
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.580
I wanted to split 10 over here and I'd want to display 10 over here.

63
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.820
That way we know that that string is always centered.

64
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.370
So we've got to do the math that lets us do that.

65
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.350
And it's pretty straightforward if you think about this.

66
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.190
Notice here if the if the string is 20 large right we want 10 on this side 10 on that side and if 35

67
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.070
was the center that means we really want to start printing that guy at 25.

68
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.800
I call him 25.

69
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:33.430
And if the string was 10 characters big we want a printed at 35 minus the 5 which is 30 right here so

70
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.350
that's really what my algorithm is going to be.

71
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.350
Let me clear this because it's a little messy and I'll do it one more time with an actual example.

72
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:48.470
So here's the 70 we know we're at 35 and I want to display a string that's 40 characters wide.

73
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.810
OK so what do I do.

74
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.690
How do I figure this out.

75
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.860
Well I want to display 20 of them and 20 of them and I want to line those up right at 35 minus 20 gives

76
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.070
me 15.

77
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.400
And that's where I want to start displaying that string.

78
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.620
So how do we do this.

79
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.780
You take the total length which is 70.

80
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.360
You subtract from it the length of the string that you want which is 40.

81
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.360
That gives you a 30 and then you divide that by two.

82
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.030
Now give it to 15.

83
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.480
That gives you exactly where you need to start displaying the strengths what century.

84
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.650
OK let's do another example suppose the string is 20 big.

85
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.120
I need 70 minus 20 divided by two gives me 25.

86
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.370
Does that make sense.

87
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.340
Well let's see if it's 20 I want to do 10 on this side and 10 on this side 35 minus the 10 is 25.

88
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.100
Exactly right.

89
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.150
So my algorithm makes sense.

90
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.480
And it's really easy to implement.

91
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.100
Let me show you how to do it.

92
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.760
I'm going to scroll down just a little bit and we'll do the head right here.

93
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.190
So what I'm doing here online 72 is I'm determining what is the length of that tidal string.

94
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.590
Well where where's the title string.

95
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.740
It's Intourist dot title.

96
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.460
I just want the length of it whatever that length is I'm going to subtract it from the total with.

97
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.610
Divide it by 2.

98
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.020
That's where I want to start displaying towards that title but how do I do that.

99
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.470
Well it's really easy I can set it with two that that amount and just display an empty string remember

100
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.890
that the set with applies to the next item that's being put on the stream.

101
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.310
There it is.

102
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.150
I'm not putting anything it's just an empty string but it's still going on the stream.

103
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.580
OK.

104
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.030
So that should take care of centering that and then the rest is pretty easy in this context which is

105
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:42.760
what we're doing here is I'm setting my field with for the country to field one which is 20.

106
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.970
I'm justifying left and I'm displaying country.

107
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:52.150
So field with one which is 20 is going to be left justified and right there is what I'm putting on the

108
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.740
stream so country that string is going to be left justified then feel to is 20 again.

109
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.130
Then I've got 15 15 I'm doing the two left to right.

110
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.960
Just like I did before.

111
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:09.970
And then I've got a new line so that should display the title centered and my headers those four names

112
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.340
right where I want them and they say I need to do is I need to do a line of dashes right to separate

113
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.580
my my head from the content and I want 70 of those dashes.

114
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:26.530
I could just say see out a big string of 70 dashes right but if I ever change my total width and I've

115
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.380
got to change that as well.

116
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:35.410
So what I can do here is I can simply say set the field with to the total with that will be 70 Cetaphil

117
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.970
character to the dash.

118
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.620
And that's what I want to display which is just an empty string but it doesn't really matter because

119
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:47.250
it's going to fill up everything with the dashes and then give me a new line of 10.

120
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.540
That's it.

121
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.000
Let's run this and we'll see where we're at

122
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.600
and there we go.

123
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.560
You can see tour ticket prices from Miami that's centered.

124
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:07.180
I've got my country left justified in 20 my city left justified and 20 my population and my price both

125
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.330
right justified here and 15.

126
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.920
And if you count them you can actually see that that's all lining up just right.

127
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:20.170
And there's my Dasch mind of 70 in this case 70 if I change total with to 80 it'll do 80 if I change

128
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.760
it to 40 it'll be 40.

129
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.040
That's the nice part about using those concepts.

130
00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:25.450
OK.

131
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.130
So that's it.

132
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.630
Now we need to get into the body of the report before we do that.

133
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.890
Let's do a couple of things here.

134
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.550
This is important right here.

135
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.770
I mean go back to where I was.

136
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.520
Here we go.

137
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.090
I want to uncomment these two lines out.

138
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.700
Let's talk about these for a second.

139
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.640
I want to set my Phil back to blank.

140
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.020
Right.

141
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.660
Remember I changed the feel right here and that's persistent.

142
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.210
So I don't want to keep it that way or those I'm going to get dashes all over the place.

143
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:03.620
So I want to send it back to a blank character and I want to set the precision to two and fixed.

144
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.340
And that's basically for this guy right here for the price I want to be able to make sure that I've

145
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:15.010
got two digits to the right side of the decimal I'll need to do that one time and then we're good to

146
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:15.510
go.

147
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:20.050
And now comes the logic freshy displaying the data.

148
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:20.740
And this is it.

149
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.460
This is all there really is to it.

150
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.730
There's a couple of tricky parts here and I'll talk about that in a minute but let's just talk about

151
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.270
the outer loop first.

152
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.440
Here's the outer loop.

153
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.100
My collection is tures dot countries right.

154
00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:39.910
So each time I go through there I'm going to grab a country structure and each one of those country

155
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.750
structures has city structures within it.

156
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.150
Right.

157
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.040
So that's the idea vector of cities.

158
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:54.200
So in this case for each country in tures country I want to actually do this inner loop and this inner

159
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:59.640
loop we could have done this a lot more complicated a couple of different ways to do this.

160
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.910
I chose to do it a simple way with just one standard out statement right here once out statement that

161
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.650
kind of does everything but the only thing that's different here is and let me make a little room down

162
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.660
here so I can show you what I'm talking about in the report.

163
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:24.670
We could have done something like this we could have said Columbia and then the cities down here Bogota

164
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:31.560
the population the amount and Ghali in the population and the amount I didn't want to do it that way.

165
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.930
I wanted to do it where this guy is down here right there right next to the first cities which looks

166
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:42.240
more like a report here it kind of just leaves all this empty space here which I didn't like but in

167
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.510
order to achieve this you've got to do a little bit of extra logic to do it.

168
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.260
So let me show you what I did.

169
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:55.530
For each one of those cities remember outer loop is the country inner loop is we're looping through

170
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.470
the cities vector in the country.

171
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.850
So each time we loop in here we're going to get a city.

172
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.990
So what we're going to do is the only time that we want to display the mere fact that again the only

173
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:16.130
time that we want to display the city and the country is that first time right that very first city

174
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.780
is going to be different.

175
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.970
The second city.

176
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.600
I just want to display it like this.

177
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.530
I don't want to display Columbia again or I don't want to see this play Argentina again makes sense.

178
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:26.330
OK.

179
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:31.450
So what we're doing here is we're looping through the cities vector.

180
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.970
And I've got my wits set exactly like we did before.

181
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.310
Left left right right.

182
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.640
None of that changes.

183
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.370
The only difference here is this one line of code right here.

184
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.080
This is using the conditional operator.

185
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.120
Now if you remember the conditional operator it's an if else statement built right into an expression

186
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.330
which is kind of cool.

187
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:57.770
So here I am I've decided to use a for loop nunna not a arranged based for loop but a regular for loop

188
00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:03.540
because I need to know when I get the first one the first one will be when I'm zero.

189
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.230
So notice what's happening here when I's equal to zero.

190
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:11.120
I am displaying the country's name.

191
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.110
That's what I want.

192
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.820
When is not equal to zero.

193
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.400
That means that I've already displayed the country and am not supplying cities now.

194
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.910
Then I just don't want to display anything on that line.

195
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.300
Makes sense.

196
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:29.180
So the first time through I'm displaying the country and then the city the population and the costs

197
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.620
the city population costs the next time around.

198
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.560
I will not be equal to zero.

199
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.300
Right so I'm just displaying a blank so I'm not displaying anything here but I am displaying these three

200
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.430
so it's just a nice little way to do this.

201
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:48.940
That way you don't have to write multiple out statements depending on all kinds of conditions.

202
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.180
So that's that first one the rest are really simple right.

203
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:56.100
Grab the city at II or the name of the city at I.

204
00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:01.580
The population in the COS were just looping through that vector grabbing the fields that we want and

205
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.020
simple as that.

206
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:08.120
Now there are different ways to do this and will learn how to do this in when we talk about the standard

207
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.010
template library using iterators which is much nicer than using these loops but when we get there we

208
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.290
get there.

209
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:14.870
That's it.

210
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:19.090
Let me run this and will verify that it works.

211
00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:21.420
And there you go.

212
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.680
And you can see right here this is exactly what you want and you can see Columbia's here.

213
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:31.430
Then I'm printing out that city right next to it and then on the second city I'm not displaying Columbia

214
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:32.770
again.

215
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.170
If you did it this way.

216
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.660
Great if you didn't do it this way you just wrote a blank line here and then you started with the cities

217
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.380
underneath.

218
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.220
That's fine too.

219
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.950
I just think that this report looks nicer this way.

220
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.640
All right so that's it.

221
00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.850
You've got a whole bunch of stuff to look at here.

222
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.070
Hopefully your solution was close.

223
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:54.860
If your solution was better or quicker or more efficient or you used a different kind of looping construct

224
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.400
posted in the forums you'd have to post the whole program just post this.

225
00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.450
Just post this piece here.

226
00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.510
This loop right here because that's really the interesting part.

227
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.300
The rest of the data is all same for everybody.

228
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.530
OK so in the next video we'll start talking about files.
