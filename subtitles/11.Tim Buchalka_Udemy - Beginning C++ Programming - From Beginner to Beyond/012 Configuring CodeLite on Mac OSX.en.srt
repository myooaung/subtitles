1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:11,000
This video will run and configure code light on Mac OS 10 and we've already installed the compiler tools

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,680
and we've installed code like.

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:19,160
So let's run code like will come up to Spotlight search and type code light and double click on the

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,610
icon

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,330
will allow it to run.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,600
Now the first time that code light runs a couple of things will happen.

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:42,160
You get the small code like windows show up and then you get a setup wizard we just leave that window

8
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,890
smallest will make it larger in a minute it's not really going to get in our way right now.

9
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,950
What's important is that we run this set up wizard if the setup wizard does not start come up to code

10
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:58,760
lights menu and go up to help and then run the setup wizard and run it manually.

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,420
OK.

12
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,120
But here in this case it did pop up.

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,450
So let's select next

14
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:11,550
code like uses a bunch of plugins to allow support for HP and know it and other technologies.

15
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,710
We don't really want all that.

16
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,170
We only want the C++ plug.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,430
The rest are just going to clutter up our interface.

18
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,740
So what we can do here is we can press clear and then just toggle the C++ plugins that way.

19
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,050
Only some of these will show up which is exactly what we want.

20
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,660
We just want to concentrate on C++.

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,380
So like next.

22
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:38,690
Now we can scan our computer for any installed compilers we can press this button here and you can see

23
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,860
it's found GCC clang and across GCC we're going to use gcc.

24
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,300
They're really the same but we'll use gcc here and press next.

25
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,950
Now the customisation of the theme is really up to you.

26
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,320
This is your personal preference the moniker dark theme is real nice and easy on the eyes but it doesn't

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:05,660
show up too well on video so I'm going to select the classic eclipse theme and select next will keep

28
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,850
these defaults and press finish.

29
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,230
Now what we can do here is we can say Save and Exit you want to be sure that you save so we can save

30
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,290
the changes we've made

31
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,880
and we can run code light again.

32
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,020
OK so this time I want to make this window nice and big

33
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,720
and we've got a couple of options that we still need to contribute.

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,490
But before we do that we need to create a workspace.

35
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:49,470
You can create a workspace by clicking this button here or by coming up to file new workspace.

36
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,230
Either place works fine.

37
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:57,290
A workplace is just an area where we can have our C++ projects so we can have multiple projects in a

38
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,150
workspace.

39
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,400
So I'm going to select a new workspace and the workspace name could be anything you like.

40
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:11,810
I'm going to say the workspace don't use any spaces here just keep it all together and I want to create

41
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,790
the workspace under a separate directory so I can keep my files organized.

42
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,650
Select OK and you can see that it's created the workspace over here on the left pane.

43
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:30,020
Now we need to create a C++ project so you can right click on that and select new project or you can

44
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,640
select the workspace and then come up to file new project.

45
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,620
Either way now we've got some options.

46
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:47,840
We're going to create a console project and simple executable plus plus right here and that's the compiler

47
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,370
we're going to use and we'll select next the project name again don't use any spaces here just create

48
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,860
your name the name for your project whatever you'd like.

49
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:07,160
Again I'm going to create a separate directory for each project and I'll select next as far as the compiler

50
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,410
would want to use the gcc compiler but the debugger we don't want to use the new debugger we want to

51
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,290
use the l l DB debugger.

52
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,220
That's the apple divider.

53
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:21,890
So let's finish and you can see over here on the left that we've created a project called Test 1 and

54
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,860
it's just short directory and it's got a file there called main C.

55
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,130
Now before we run that file there's a couple of things that we need to set up.

56
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,920
First click on the project.

57
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:40,280
In this case test one right click and then come down to settings and select that then done here to toward

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,180
the bottom where you see global settings come up to compiler options and select the right side and then

59
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,880
you'll see this little button right here with the three dots select.

60
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,970
And what we want to do here is we want to check a couple of options when we scroll all the way up and

61
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:03,220
I want to like enable all compiler warnings wall and I want to enable C plus plus 14 features.

62
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,990
That's the latest standard that's modern C++.

63
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,260
Want to make sure that that's enabled.

64
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,930
And this guy doesn't come on but you can see that it is there.

65
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,070
Sometimes it doesn't check on.

66
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,670
You can see that the command line is correct.

67
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,070
So just click OK I'll apply and click OK.

68
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,700
Perfect.

69
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:29,090
Now go to the workspace select it right click on it and come down to workspace settings and you'll see

70
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,200
we have environment and code completion slide code completion.

71
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,230
And check the Enable C++ 14 standard.

72
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,240
The integrated development environments.

73
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,120
Use code completion they try to figure out what you're typing and what you want to do and where you

74
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,060
want to go and really help you out with suggestions.

75
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,890
In this case we're simply telling code like to use the C++ 14 standard for those suggestions click OK

76
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,610
and that's it for the set up.

77
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,380
Now let's modify this C++ file and run it.

78
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,700
That's double click on that and that's font is really small so I'm going to do is I'm going to make

79
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,020
it a little larger so it shows up better on the video.

80
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,960
Most likely you won't have to touch it at all.

81
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:20,240
But I'm just going to come to settings colors and fonts and I'll set the font to let's say 18

82
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,490
I'll apply that and that should be much more readable.

83
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,630
OK so now let's modify this file.

84
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,940
This is actually C-code Nazi posts plus code.

85
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,570
So let's get rid of all this and we'll type a simple C plus plus program that will test our installation

86
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,960
during this course.

87
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:46,050
Will go in detail through the anatomy of a C++ program and everything I'll be typing here will be explained.

88
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,650
But for now just follow along type along to make sure we've got a clean install.

89
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,230
So the first thing you want to do is win a type pounde include and we want to put IO stream in angle

90
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:06,770
brackets and press Enter then int space main left and right person then we want to open up a left Kerley

91
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,170
and you can see that the IEEE has closed it for me.

92
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:17,000
And then what I want to do here is I just want to say as T.G. to call in side by side no spaces and

93
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:26,700
then seek out the insertion operator which is to signs again together with no spaces and anything you

94
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:33,090
want to type here as far as hello testing we want to type of string inside double quotes and a semi-colon

95
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,180
at the end and then next line will be returned 0.

96
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,630
That's it.

97
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,250
That's the entire program.

98
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,990
When we run this program what we want to do is we want to display hello testing to the console.

99
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,410
That's all it's going to do.

100
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,500
I'll save this

101
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,960
under File at this point on your end you may want to do.

102
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:58,830
You toggle minimal view and that will display.

103
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,400
We do that again that will display some buttons and things up here which you might find useful.

104
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:11,190
I'm not going to do that because it clutters up the screen and I don't want any distractions when I'm

105
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,460
teaching the class to toggle that away.

106
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:20,090
And what I'll do is rather than click on the buttons I'll be really explicit as to click on build run

107
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,720
build clean and so forth.

108
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,810
That way you can see exactly what's going on.

109
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,610
Once you get familiar with the ID you can use those buttons.

110
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,110
That's it.

111
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,230
So I've saved it.

112
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:35,970
Now I want to run this first thing I want to do is I want to go to build and clean the project when

113
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:41,010
we clean a project we're basically just wiping out everything that's been done in the past except the

114
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:41,830
source code.

115
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,550
So the project is in a state that's ready to go so I'm going to clean it and then I'm going to come

116
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:53,610
back up to build and I'm going to say run now it's going to give me an option that says Would you like

117
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,120
to build the active project before executing it.

118
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,260
Of course I do because I haven't built yet in this case so I'm going to select build and execute and

119
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,310
that will compile the program and open up a window and there's the output right there.

120
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,580
Hello testing.

121
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,150
So this terminal window is running the program that I just wrote.

122
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,910
That's it.

123
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,770
It's as simple as that.

124
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,530
Some things could go wrong though.

125
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:27,090
Suppose that you forgot this semi-colon here and I'll say it and then I'll do the same I'll do run build

126
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,850
and execute and you can see if I move this window just slightly up you can see that I've got a compiler

127
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,160
error and this is what compiler errors look like.

128
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,570
You see the read text here and it says error expected a semi-colon after an expression.

129
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,940
Also you'll see that little red arrow right here telling you just something wrong here.

130
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,450
And basically what you need to do is put a semi-colon there just type the program really carefully exactly

131
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,420
like I did and you won't have any problems.

132
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,760
But you know you could have things missing like this.

133
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,910
Quote The first quote is missing.

134
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,820
This time I have three less than signs.

135
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,140
There's all kinds of little things that could go wrong with the program but if you'd just be very careful

136
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:11,850
type it in save it and come back up to build and run build and execute and you can click on there if

137
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,330
you like that we don't have to keep doing it all the time.

138
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,290
And there's a run.

139
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,240
That's it.

140
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,280
We're all set on Mac.

141
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,840
We've installed the command line tools we've installed code like we've configured code light and we're

142
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,160
good to go.

143
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,330
Now let's start learning C++.
