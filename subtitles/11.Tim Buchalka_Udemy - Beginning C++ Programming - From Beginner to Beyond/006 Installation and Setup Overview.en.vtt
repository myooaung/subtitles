00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.420
In this video I'd like to go over the content in this section of the course.

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.580
This is a very important section since we describe the installation of the tools necessary to create,

3
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.430
build, and execute C++ programs.

4
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.790
We wanted to make this course accessible to as many students as possible

5
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.450
who want to learn C++.

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.020
So, if you're running Microsoft Windows, Mac OSX,  or Ubuntu Linux, we have videos detailing the steps

7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.510
necessary to get set up and running on your platforms.

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:38.730
The following section includes videos for installing the C++ compiler, the CodeLite IDE and how to configure

9
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.320
the CodeLite IDE for each specific operating system.

10
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.970
Then we go over how to create a default CodeLite project template that you can use when you want to

11
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.520
create a new C++ project.

12
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.990
This makes it really easy to start new projects quickly since all the required settings will be ready

13
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:02.100
to go. In all the videos we use are a real simple C++ program to test the installations. All of the elements

14
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.510
of the C++ program will be explained in detail as we progress through the course.

15
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.720
In this section, just type along and follow along to ensure that your installation is complete.

16
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.900
In addition to using the CodeLite IDE,  we want to be sure that students can learn and build C++ programs

17
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.050
even though they may not be able to install an IDE due to hardware limitations.

18
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.740
So we created a section that uses just a simple text editor and the command line tools to do just that.

19
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.620
If you're unable to use an IDE then please don't let that stop you from learning C++.

20
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.150
You could still use the command line just fine.

21
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.280
So we created a video for the command line for Windows , for Ubuntu Linux, and for Mac OSX.

22
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.870
Finally, we include a video that uses a web site that has a C++ compiler available that you can use to

23
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.050
write and execute basic C++ programs.

24
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.520
This has some limitations, but it's great if you're on the road or away from your own PC.

25
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.940
All you need is a web browser and you can run much of the code presented in this course.

26
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.930
As the Course evolves we'd like to include videos for Xcode on Mac, Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows,

27
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.860
Eclipse,

28
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.580
NetBeans, and other major IDEs.

29
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.920
We want this to be the most complete beginning C++ course available.
