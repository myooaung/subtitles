00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.850
This video we'll go over the steps necessary to install the command line tools which includes the C++

2
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.490
compiler on the Mac OS 10 platform in order to do this we need to have a terminal window.

3
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.490
So let's go over to spotlight's search and type in terminal and we'll get a terminal window running

4
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.630
at this point.

5
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.910
We want to type X code dash select dash dash install

6
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.280
and press enter.

7
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.740
If you get a dialog box that pops up as I do that means that the command line tools and the compiler

8
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.990
are not currently installed.

9
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.760
If you get a message saying that they are currently installed then you're done and you can move on to

10
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.960
installing the Integrated Development Environment.

11
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.300
In this case I have the choice of installing the full X code integrated development environment or simply

12
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.280
install the command line tools.

13
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.090
I'm only going to install the command line tools which again includes the compiler.

14
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.700
So select install all agree to the license agreement

15
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.680
and that software will be downloaded and installed.

16
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.440
It's a pretty quick process.

17
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.900
After a few minutes you'll see a message saying the software was installed and the installation is complete.

18
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:31.610
You can test out the installation by simply typing G plus plus dash dash version at the terminal and

19
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.290
you'll see the version number of the C++ compiler.

20
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.510
Which means it's all set.

21
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.580
And good to go at this point you'll keep the command line tools up to date through the App Store so

22
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.810
you could select AppStore

23
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.430
updates and you can see your command line tool update to appear here.

24
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.480
Right now I've got no updates available because I just installed the latest.

25
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.020
That's it.

26
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.100
We've installed the command line tools our compilers are all set up and we're good to go.

27
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.910
The next step is to install the Integrated Development Environment.
