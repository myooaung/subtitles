00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello and welcome to the Section 20 second challenge.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,690
This challenge is all about using a stood list a doubly linked list.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,690
What we're going to do in this challenge is we're going to simulate a playlist.

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,970
So imagine you've got a CD and you want to put it in your car or you want to play it and move to the

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,910
next song in the previous song in the beginning and so forth was going to be able to add songs to this

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,590
so that's the idea here.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,180
We're going to model that playlist using a doubly linked list of song objects.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,580
So I mean the Section 20 workspace and here is the challenge to project and then there's the challenge

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,040
to solution project which her has my solution and I'll go over that in the next video.

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,660
So let's talk about this challenge a little bit.

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,200
The idea here is that you want to learn how to use a stud list and that's what we're going to use in

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,190
this challenge.

13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,200
We want to create a menu driven application.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,330
This would be really cool to do graphically but we haven't learned how to do that stuff.

15
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,790
So what we want to do is we want to simulate the user selecting the first song in the playlist and then

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,630
going to the next the previous playing forward and backwards through the playlist.

17
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,030
Simple as that.

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,450
We're also going to allow users to add new songs to the playlist and every time we add a new song it's

19
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,650
going to be added prior to the currently playing song.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,130
OK.

21
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,450
So here's the menu.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,150
And I've got a sample run coming over here on the right and I'll get that in just a second but here's

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,440
the menu.

24
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:26,020
Play the first song play the next song play the previous song and play a new song at the current location

25
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,810
and then just list the current playlist in that it lists the playlists.

26
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:35,410
In other words the songs that are out there and it will also list the currently playing song and q to

27
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,330
quit.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,080
So that's it.

29
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,080
It's real simple.

30
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,890
The available play list is modeled as a list of song objects.

31
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,210
I'll provide the song class and I'll go over that in just a second.

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,290
And these are the songs that I put into playlists just by default.

33
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,000
I just grabbed a bunch of them from the pop charts.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,600
You can change these to whatever you like or just put on one song two song Three to keep track of them.

35
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,560
I got kind of bored doing song one song too I wanted to see some real song names so here they are.

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,670
Drake Kamila Kameo and Maroon 5 Imagine Dragons a bunch of popular songs.

37
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,660
That's it.

38
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,550
So let me go over the run first and then what I do is I go over the sample code that I'm giving it will

39
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,270
be here on the right.

40
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,870
You can see the program running the first run it just displays the playlist right here that's the playlist

41
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,900
so you can see these songs right here are showing up right here and the current song that's playing

42
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,230
is the one by Drake which is the first song on the playlist.

43
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,620
You see it right up here.

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,370
So by default that's that's our starting point.

45
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,370
When we first run the program the first song will be played.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,560
Imagine you're putting a CD in your car.

47
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:45,480
Here's the menu played the first song so when the time you press F is going to jump to Drake's song

48
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,200
and play it next.

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,290
Obviously it's pretty straightforward happening.

50
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,930
If I'm playing Drake song and I press next then it's going to go to Kamila song and if I press next.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,800
Again the weekend Zed Maroon 5 imagine dragons and so forth.

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,220
Now since we have a doubly linked list these songs are modeled as the linguists right.

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,210
You've kept your links coming back and forth and then I've got something called current song and that's

54
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,350
an iterator that is pointing to the current song.

55
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,310
So when you press next All we're doing is we're moving the iterator over here and the press again.

56
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,050
Next we're going to move it over here.

57
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,210
Now what's going to be interesting is if I'm right here the first and I press previous I want to wrap

58
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:31,740
around to here and if I'm over here and I press next I want to wrap around to here.

59
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,260
So I always want to be in that playlist.

60
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,050
OK.

61
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,820
So let's walk through this a little demo right now.

62
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,090
When we first start the program you can see the play list and you can see that drake song is playing.

63
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,440
That's the very first song on the playlist.

64
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:56,450
If I press and or next it says playing next song and it says now it's playing the song which is this

65
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,200
guy right here.

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,730
Never be the same if I press next again and I'm going to scroll up so you can always have this in context

67
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,470
here.

68
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,140
Now it's playing the PRAY FOR ME song which is the third song I'll press next again.

69
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,890
Now I was playing the middle when I pressed necks again it should be wait.

70
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,330
And then whatever it takes.

71
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,390
So I pressed necks again.

72
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:18,790
Wait.

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,210
Is playing by Maroon 5.

74
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,260
One More Time.

75
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,370
And now whatever it takes by Imagine Dragons is play now I'm at the end of my playlist if I press next

76
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,820
again.

77
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,530
I wanted to wrap around back to the drake song so let's do that.

78
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:40,360
I'll press n and you could see that we scroll that up we could see that drake song is now playing.

79
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,810
Now if I'm here at the beginning and I press P for previous It should wrap around back down to the Imagine

80
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,080
Dragons song so I'll press P for previous Now I'm right here and right at the end here.

81
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,750
Imagine Dragons is playing.

82
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,260
Let me move that up for you.

83
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,640
You can see a little better.

84
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,910
OK.

85
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,190
So that's it.

86
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:06,360
Now of course if I press previous here it's going to go to the Maroon 5 song and you can see it's just

87
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,840
a linked lists and I'm able to go around it which is pretty cool if at any point you can press l and

88
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,540
that will list what's currently happening.

89
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,950
So you could see the play list right here.

90
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,760
That hasn't changed because we haven't modified it at all but you can see the play list right here and

91
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,860
the current song is The Maroon 5 song.

92
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,860
So any time you want some information you press l.

93
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,720
All right so now let's get to the good stuff.

94
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,250
Let's add a song and we're going to scroll up just a little bit.

95
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,810
I'm going to press OK.

96
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,440
And when I press a it says adding I'm playing a new song called.

97
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,840
So what's the song name I want to add.

98
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,910
I say I want to add imagine who's the artist.

99
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,400
It's the Beatles.

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,990
What's my rating for the song.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,430
I'll give it a five.

102
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,740
Now when I press enter that song will be added before the current song.

103
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,910
And if you remember the current song was wait that's the one that's currently playing.

104
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:10,310
So imagine will be added between the middle and wait so I'll press enter and it will play it will be

105
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,080
the current song.

106
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,410
I'm going to press enter and you can see now it's playing imagined by the Beatles.

107
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,320
And if I listed me scroll up a little bit if I list my playlist now you can see that imagine is right

108
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,980
here.

109
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:28,030
Me Mark that for you with my pen and see that imagine is right here now and it's between.

110
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,300
Wait in the middle.

111
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,400
So what I wanted.

112
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,690
Now suppose I want to press F and I want to go to the first song.

113
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,460
So when you hear the drake song then I want to insert a new song before that.

114
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,120
So let's do that now.

115
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,740
So the first thing I'll do is clear this real quick and I'll scroll up.

116
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:49,430
So I'm going to go to the first song which is the drake song when I press F right here.

117
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,510
I'm playing Drake song now I want to add another song so let's add.

118
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,770
What's the song's name.

119
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,250
That say it's New York and let's say that this is Frank Sinatra.

120
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,260
And I'll give it a 5.

121
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,820
I'm giving everybody fives.

122
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,650
That's it.

123
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,190
Now it's playing New York.

124
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,760
Remember we were at the beginning.

125
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,180
So if I display my playlist you can see that New York has now been added at the beginning of the list

126
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,310
and it's playing right here current song New York.

127
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:18,720
That's it.

128
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,280
That's the program you press Q to quit.

129
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,850
Now there's a couple of interesting things here that you can extend.

130
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,260
Once you get this basic functionality going.

131
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,170
Notice that in my menu I have no way to play the last song in the list or the ending song in the list

132
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,810
you could certainly add that you could add a whole bunch of other things you could save this to file

133
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,920
you can read this information from a file so you can extend this program in a bunch of different ways.

134
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,460
OK so now let me show you the source code that I'm giving you and that is right in here.

135
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,920
I've gone ahead and included the include files that you're going to need and let me show you what the

136
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,660
song class looks like.

137
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,740
It's a real simple class.

138
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:02,910
Obviously this is what we're modeling the name of the song The Artist and the rating which is an integer

139
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:09,390
in this case I have a friend function here which is my overloaded insertion operator so that I can display

140
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,990
this kind of stuff over here real easy.

141
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,200
I've got a default constructor.

142
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,410
I've got an overloaded constructor here that allows me to create whatever I need using name artist and

143
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,370
rating.

144
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,160
Then I've got some getters that I'm only in think I'm using the getters but I put them in there anyway.

145
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,220
Now the most important thing we need to do here is and it's not so important in this program but it's

146
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:36,600
just best practice to always do we need to overload these operators the less than operator and the equality

147
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,360
operator.

148
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Those are the only two operators that we must overload if we're going to use our own custom classes

149
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,620
with the SPL.

150
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:52,350
So in this case less than just defining less than as this name of this song is less than that name of

151
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,290
the other song.

152
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,150
And the same thing with the quality of the two names are the same then I'm considering them equal.

153
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,190
OK.

154
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,170
So that's that's that here I'm overloading the insertion operator as I mentioned.

155
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,890
I'm giving you the code for the display menu which is really really easy.

156
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,120
And then I've got a couple of methods here her functions I should say that you're going to implement.

157
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,790
One is play the current song and all this does is it does this right here.

158
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,910
Here we go.

159
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,120
So I just went forward it says playing and the song that's playing.

160
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,710
That's all it just displays that.

161
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,120
And the song it's being played has passed into it so it's a really one liner right.

162
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,000
You basically just have to put that to an up and stream display playlist.

163
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,210
Here we're getting an entire playlist and the current song and this is the one that you're going to

164
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,470
call from the list functionality it's just going to display all those songs.

165
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,430
So in this case we're going to see something like this right here all that good information is going

166
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:55,710
to display and that here's the main probably just what you expect.

167
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,600
Here's my playlist.

168
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,730
That's my object and it is a list of song objects and I'm initializing it right here.

169
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,780
So that's done and I'm setting my current song this is the most important piece here.

170
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:15,870
That object right there that current song is an iterator to that's pointing to some object in that in

171
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,250
this playlist and I'm setting it to the beginning of the list.

172
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,150
I'm setting it right there it's going to start right there from that point on.

173
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,640
It's your logic to display the menu get the input from the user depending on what they select.

174
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,600
This is the guy that you're going to have to increment or decrement depending on how you want to walk

175
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,730
across this list.

176
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,610
That's it.

177
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,350
Have fun.

178
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,070
Get the basic functionality working before you extend it and then you can extend it like I said a bunch

179
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:47,830
of different ways you can go to go to the yen go at the beginning save it to a file so next time you

180
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,210
run this you can just load the information the song information from the file because remember as it

181
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:57,580
is now every time I add a new song to the playlist it's not being persisted so the next time I run this

182
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,910
it's not going to be there.

183
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,260
So be kind of nice to be able to save that and then load it up again.

184
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,840
OK so that's it.

185
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,500
Have fun.

186
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,540
It's a nice little challenge project.

187
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,550
It's simpler than you would think.

188
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,060
Think iterators think as T.L..

189
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,330
Don't don't think about you know I's and J's and looping variables and things like that.

190
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,710
Let us do the work for you.

191
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
All right have fun and I'll see you in the next solution video.
