00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.360
In this video we'll talk about logic errors and why they can happen.

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.250
Logic errors or errors or bugs in your code that cause your program to run incorrectly.

3
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.430
Logic errors are mistakes made by a programmer.

4
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.560
Sometimes the mistakes are careless other times mistakes are because the programmers have incomplete

5
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.170
or incorrect information other times mistakes occur when one programmer modifies another programmer's

6
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.140
code to fix or add something and they introduce an error as they do this.

7
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.950
There are many many causes for logic errors.

8
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.780
It doesn't matter what the cause is though.

9
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.140
They need to be corrected.

10
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.400
We need to test our code and debug it to find and correct errors.

11
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.420
Suppose we have a program that determines if a person can vote in an election.

12
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.840
And you must be 18 years old or older to vote.

13
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.410
We haven't talked about statements yet in this class but they're very intuitive and I'm sure you'll

14
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.800
follow this little piece of code.

15
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.740
First we test to see if the age is greater than 18.

16
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.270
If it is then we execute the code that's inside those curly braces.

17
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.900
Do you see the air.

18
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.190
It's pretty easy to see it here because the code is isolated.

19
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.040
And I told you there was an error.

20
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.920
However in reality this much more code typically involved in this may just be a small part of a much

21
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.110
larger program.

22
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.570
The problem in this code is that the test conditions should be greater than or equal to 18 or greater

23
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.590
than 17.

24
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.270
Either one will work as it's written now.

25
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.840
18 year olds would not be able to vote.

26
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.550
What talk about testing throughout the course in the context of learning C++ and best practices.

27
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.930
Well that wraps up this section.

28
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.070
Next you can take the section quiz and attempt the challenge exercise to see how you do.

29
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.340
I'm sure you'll do great if you have any questions please post them to the Course forum.
