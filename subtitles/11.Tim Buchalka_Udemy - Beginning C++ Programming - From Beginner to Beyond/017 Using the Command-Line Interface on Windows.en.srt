1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:13,490
In this video we'll use the command line tools to compile and run our C++ programs on the Windows platform.

2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,260
Now obviously we need some sort of editor to type in our code.

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,930
I'm just going to use Notepad which is built into Windows and it's really really easy to use.

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,060
Couple of things first.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,250
I've created a folder on my desktop called C.P. projects in there.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,400
There's another folder called Project 1 inside Project 1 is where we're going to put our C++ file our

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,350
source code.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,850
Now there's nothing in there right now.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,530
I just wanted to show you where I'm going to be putting everything.

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,360
OK so the first thing I want to do is I just want to open up Notepad

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,200
and as you know Notepad is just a real simple text editor and I want to type in my C++ program right

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,170
into this textedit.

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,680
I'm just going to make a little bit smaller and open up another window in a moment.

14
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,340
So let's type in that main program that we should probably know by heart now.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,630
So I'm going to say include IO stream

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,280
that I'm going to say int main.

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,710
Open and close parentheses.

18
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,350
Open curly bracket.

19
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,660
I'll close the curly bracket at the bottom.

20
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,980
Remember this is not an integrated development environment so it's not really getting help me with syntax

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,840
or with you no closing open brackets automatically and so forth.

22
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:30,270
I'll indent over a couple of spaces and I'll say c d to Kolins C out

23
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,160
to less than signs next to each other.

24
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:42,000
Which is the insertion operator and will say hello Windows command line.

25
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,640
It will close the string then we can also print a new line at the end.

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,140
That's all just say CD.

27
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:57,080
Colin Colin E and D L semi-colon that are just print a new line the precursor to the next line in the

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,840
output.

29
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,440
Here will say return 0.

30
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,700
Like we always do and then we just clean this up a little bit.

31
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,720
That's it we're done.

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,010
We don't need to save that program into that CPV projects projects one folder that I mentioned a minute

33
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,700
ago.

34
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,830
At this point you have to be a little careful because notepad works with text files so it's going to

35
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,300
use to fix the extensions.

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:28,640
We don't want to see extensions we want p extension so I'm going to go to File Save As and then I'm

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,520
going to go to my desktop.

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,640
My C-p projects and my project one folder Lolas here was this file named stardate text that's what I

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,310
don't want.

40
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,930
So I want to save as file type or just say all files that gets rid of the extension.

41
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:50,800
Now we could just Semaine that C-p that's going to save my file as main data.

42
00:02:50,940 --> 00:03:00,050
And I'm going to save it so if I go to my directory structure now you'll see I have C.P projects projects

43
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,040
Project 1 and there's my main.

44
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,980
Now we need to compile and run this the way we do that and I'm going to leave this window open on here

45
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,120
on the left for a moment.

46
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,460
The way we do that is with the command shell or a command prompt and all you need to do is just run

47
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,420
command and you'll see where it says command prompt.

48
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,020
That's what we want to do.

49
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,850
We'll just press enter and run it and we get this window here and I'm just going to move it over here

50
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,570
on the right.

51
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,360
That way it's nice and big.

52
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,970
I notice first of all I'm in the wrong directory when the users Frank directory.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,920
I want to be in that folder that I created so we can use the CD command to change directory.

54
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,600
This case I want to change directory to desktop and press enter.

55
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,290
And now you can see that I'm at the desktop.

56
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,560
They don't want to change into CPP projects and you can press tab and it will autocomplete for you someone

57
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,650
to press tab or to say CPV projects and then I want to go into project one.

58
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,580
There we go there and see if I want to see what's in that folder or just have Deodhar for directory

59
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,390
listing and you could see right there is my main TPP.

60
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,870
At this point I want to compile the way we compile is and then make this a little bit bigger so the

61
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,640
whole line will fit on here.

62
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,950
We want to use the C++ compiler the GWC plus plus compiler that I'm assuming is already installed.

63
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:27,460
We need to have that compiler installed plus plus that's the compiler.

64
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:38,010
Now we need to have those options Dasch w capital W all that turns your warnings on then s t d equals

65
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:47,920
sorry dash as to the equals C plus plus 14 that's using the C plus plus version 14 standard and then

66
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:53,940
the file we want to compile which in this case is main CPB that's it.

67
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,810
Now when I do this if there are no errors it's going to create an executive file called a doc xes.

68
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,130
So let's do that then we get a clean compile member.

69
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,140
No news is good news.

70
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,680
So no messages that's a good thing and we'll do Deodhar again.

71
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,050
You can see right here we have a file.

72
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,080
A dot see that's our executive.

73
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,210
I can run it by just typing.

74
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:22,110
And it says hello Windows command line which is exactly what our program is supposed to do if you want

75
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,580
a different name for the output.

76
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,340
We could just put another option on the command line.

77
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,350
And what I'm doing here now is I'm pressing the up arrow and it's going to go back through everything

78
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,050
I typed that went off to type everything again.

79
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,530
So we can go up or down you see up and down arrows.

80
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,640
So what I'm doing here is same thing I'm saying call my compiler turn on all warnings use to see post

81
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,970
plus 14 standard.

82
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,450
Compile this file right your main C.P and then you can use the dash.

83
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,340
Little o lowercase O.

84
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,130
And then the name of the file that you want to create the executive.

85
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,830
So let's say you want main got the X-C or whatever you like press enter and let me clear the screen

86
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,820
you can clear with CLX and I'll do it and the directory listing.

87
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:13,100
So now you can see I have an ADHD X-Sea and a main body X-C and I can simply run man that say this is

88
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,530
really really straightforward.

89
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,030
If you have issues with IDS if you have issues with hardware resources that you can't run an idea you

90
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,760
just don't like ideas.

91
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,630
You could certainly run C++ programs this way.

92
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:36,050
One thing to remember here when you type your program into an editor such as Notepad you may have syntax

93
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,680
errors.

94
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,480
So the way syntax errors will show up and let me get rid of that semi-colon there.

95
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,530
Now if I just say

96
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,340
compile again.

97
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,190
Notice I got a clean compile.

98
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,610
How can that be I took off a semicolon that shouldn't compile.

99
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,210
I forgot to save it.

100
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,280
You've got to be sure to save one of the things that the IDs do as they kind of do that automatically

101
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,870
for you so you don't have to think about it but when you're working in a workflow like this you've got

102
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,030
to be sure that whenever you edit your file you come up to a file save or control less.

103
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,820
Now you can compile again and there's your air.

104
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,830
So this is the way that you would work in this environment.

105
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,950
Obviously since it's not an integrated development environment it's not going to get a little arrow

106
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,000
here that says red and shows you where the error was because he thinks that two separate programs that

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,490
really aren't talking to one another.

108
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,650
But there's the air you can fix your error if you make another error let's say you forgot this quote

109
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,720
mark right here.

110
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:39,720
Again I'm saving the program I just did a control S and I can compile again and it says warning missing

111
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,550
terminating quote character.

112
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,130
OK you can fix that.

113
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,440
I'll save again and compile one more time.

114
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,520
We've got a clean compile.

115
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,250
We run main.

116
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,060
We get the output OK.

117
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,800
That's great.

118
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,390
So that's pretty much what there is to it.

119
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,320
It's not a big deal.

120
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:05,340
Obviously if you type G plus plus and this is a normal message right here fatal error no input files

121
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,110
it's you know it's asking me what you want to compile.

122
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,210
You haven't told me what you want but if you get a program not found error then go back to the installation

123
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,490
video from GW that I created and make sure that your path is set correctly because what's happening

124
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,870
is that Windows can't find C++.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,760
OK so that takes care of Notepad.

126
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,260
Now there's another editor out there and I'm going to close this real quick.

127
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,010
There's another editor that's free it's called notepad plus plus and I've installed it on the system

128
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,330
on my computer here and you can see it's right here notepad plus plus on Precentor.

129
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,500
This is a programmer's editor.

130
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:48,630
And let me open the file I had a previous one opened all up it up and you can see file open you know

131
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,430
and open that C++ right here.

132
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,940
There you go.

133
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,590
So you can see that this is doing syntax highlighting it's doing code filtering it's got line numbers.

134
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,120
This is a programmer's editor and again it's called notepad plus plus it's absolutely free.

135
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,830
You can install.

136
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,340
You could do a google search and install it on your system.

137
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:12,320
Again it's not an I.D. but it's a more advanced programmer's editor which is really really nice.

138
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,910
And it's actually it's a lot nicer than Notepad Notepad was never intended to write code with but you

139
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,800
can certainly write code with it.

140
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:26,150
I'd recommend you use something like Notepad or bracket's or atom or one of the paid ones like sublime.

141
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,570
There's a lot of really good text editors out there that you can find.

142
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,050
OK so that wraps up this video.

143
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,100
As you can see if you've got issues with an idea or if you've got issues with hardware resources don't

144
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,390
let that stop you.

145
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,650
You can still learn C++ and you can still get your programs to compile and run really easily.
