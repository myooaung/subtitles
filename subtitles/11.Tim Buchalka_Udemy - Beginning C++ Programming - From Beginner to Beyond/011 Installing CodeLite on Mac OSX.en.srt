1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:11,480
Now that we've downloaded and installed the command line tools and the C++ compiler will now install

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:19,170
the code light ID code light as an integrated development environment that's cross-platform open source.

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,990
It runs on Mac OS 10 Linux and Windows in this video we're going to install it on Mac OS 10.

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,690
So open up your favorite browser and go to code light dot org.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,370
That's Cod LITV dot org and you'll see a web page similar to this.

6
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,880
You want to find the download link.

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,070
You can see one here at the top bar menu and there's also this big blue button which is the one I'm

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,500
going to click on select that.

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,410
And you take you to a page where you can contribute to the developers if you wish or you could just

10
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,630
go straight to the downloads and I'll do that.

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,960
So I said I tried here not now.

12
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,520
Take me to the download.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,200
Now here we've got some options that we can install for Windows for Mac for Linux and so forth.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,310
We're interested in Mac in this example.

15
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:09,470
So the third one down says code like 11.0 app bundle for OS 10 that's the one I want and I'm going to

16
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:15,950
select the direct link to begin the download.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,660
The file is not very large but the download quite slow from the site.

18
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,130
I'll post a video of the download occurs once the download is complete.

19
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,590
You can see that it's downloaded a compressed archive file.

20
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,440
So what I'll do is open that

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,380
and I'll double click on it to compress it.

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,790
There is my code Light App which I just drag to my Applications folder.

23
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,830
That's it.

24
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:54,340
Code lights now on our system in the next video will run code like and configure it to use C++ compilers

25
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,280
on Mac OS 10.
