00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.290
In this video we'll see some of the stream formatting options that are available that work with any

2
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.440
type of data.

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.430
These are very powerful and easy to use.

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:21.060
They give you the ability to define a field with and then display the next data item either left justified

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.300
or right justified within that field.

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.340
We can also specify the Phil character that will be used to fill up any unused space by default.

7
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.780
There is no field with defined in all output occurs right after the previous output as we've seen already

8
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.400
in this course.

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.430
If you do set a field with then the next data item displayed will default to right justified within

10
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.060
that field with it's important to understand that if you set the field with and justification they're

11
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.340
only applied to the next data item placed on the output stream.

12
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.220
When we set the Phil character that will persist until you change it.

13
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.930
Again this all might sound really complicated but it's pretty easy.

14
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.790
And a few examples will show you exactly how it works.

15
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.680
But first let's get the defaults.

16
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.960
Here's an example that uses absolutely no stream manipulators or methods.

17
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.920
This is the default behavior when you put data on a stream.

18
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.340
As you can see we're displaying the floating point number one two three four point five six seven eight.

19
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.140
And then the string hello.

20
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.680
The number will display with six digits of precision and it all round and then hello is displayed immediately

21
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.870
following the number.

22
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.710
If we modify this program slightly so that it prints the number and the string each on a new line then

23
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.840
we get the number displayed as before on the left side with no padding up front followed by the string

24
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.980
on the next line.

25
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.520
So far this is what we've seen.

26
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.880
And it should be pretty clear.

27
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.260
So now let's set the field with the next data item placed on the stream using set W.

28
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.460
In this case we're using set W with a tennis parameter.

29
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.540
This will create a field with of ten for the next data item only.

30
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.970
In this case that data item is numb.

31
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.730
Notice that none will be displayed right justified by default in a field with of 10 I'm displaying a

32
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.570
ruler of numbers just above the actual display.

33
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.610
So you can see the alignment this ruler is displayed by the code is only there so you can better follow

34
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.050
the examples.

35
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.350
Notice that the last digit in number seven in this case is displayed in position 10.

36
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.820
That's the rightmost side of the field with.

37
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.510
We said earlier but now look what happens when we display halo.

38
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.660
It just plays right next to the number starting in column 11.

39
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.570
That's because the field with the justification only apply to the next data item placed on the stream.

40
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.980
In this case that data item was numb.

41
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.310
So Halo has no field with associated with it and it uses just the defaults in this example we set the

42
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.370
field with of each of the three data items to 10.

43
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.160
And remember when we have a field with the default justification is right.

44
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.590
So in this case no is displayed right justified in a width of 10.

45
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.070
The first Halo is displayed right justified.

46
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.270
Also in a field of ten in the last Helo's also displayed right justified and with of 10.

47
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.220
And you can see from the display in the ruler exactly what's happening

48
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.480
this example shows how the field with only applies to the next data item put on the stream.

49
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.410
In this case we set up a field with of 10 and we want left justification for the next data item which

50
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.280
is numb and we get what we expect is displayed in a field with of 10 and it's left justified.

51
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.100
Now we want to display halo.

52
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.280
Notice that halo has no field with associated with it.

53
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.040
So it will display starting in column 11.

54
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.670
In this example we'll set the field widths for all three items displayed.

55
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.620
None we'll have a field with of 10 and it will be right justified by default the first Halo will have

56
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.150
a field with of 10 and we're explicitly setit right justification.

57
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.320
We don't have to do this since it's the default.

58
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.740
But we can do it to be very explicit.

59
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.560
And the second Telo have a field with a 15 and it will also be right justified.

60
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.410
You can see the output is exactly as we expect.

61
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.930
Numb is right justified in a field with of 10.

62
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.370
The first Halo is right justified in a field with of 10.

63
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.320
And the final Halo is right justified in the field with a 15.

64
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.400
Now let's take a look at the set Phil for formatter.

65
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.700
This only works when a data item has a field with associated with it.

66
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.580
We supply the character that we want to fill any empty space in the given field with here's a simple

67
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.970
example we're setting the fill character dash with the set filled manipulator and we're setting the

68
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.730
field with to 10.

69
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.090
This will apply only to numb which is the next data item on the stream.

70
00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.210
So we expect not to be right justified in a field with of 10 and the remaining space in that field to

71
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.570
be filled in with dashes that's exactly what we see.

72
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.590
But what about the halo that we display next.

73
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.070
We said that set Phil was persistent but we don't see any dashes with that halo.

74
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.010
That's because that Halo doesn't have a field with associated with it.

75
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:23.190
So says Phil only applies when we've set the field with so let's look at one final example.

76
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.740
In this case we're setting the Phil character to an asterisk and then setting the field width of numb

77
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:36.070
to 10 we expect him to be displayed right justified in a field with of ten and asterisks to fill in

78
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.270
the remaining space.

79
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.820
And you can see by the output that that's exactly what we get.

80
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:47.710
Now we said to Phil character to a dash in the field with 10 for the first hello we expect hello to

81
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.620
display right justified in a field with of 10 and the blank space filled in with dashes.

82
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.920
Again that's exactly what we get.

83
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.670
And finally we set the field width of the last talo to 15.

84
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.520
We expect halo to display right justified in a field with 15 and since set Phil is persistent and the

85
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.710
last haloed does have a field with.

86
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.900
We expect that those blank spaces will be filled in with dashes and as you can see that's what we get.

87
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.340
So you see it's really not that complicated and the rules are very consistent using the formatting manipulators

88
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.260
that we've seen in the last few videos.

89
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.980
We can have a good amount of control over how our output looks.

90
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.890
Now let's head over to the idea and we'll see the stream formatters in life code.

91
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:37.970
Ok so I'm back I'm back in the IDM in the section 19 workspace and I'm in the manip underscore fields

92
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.620
project and what we'll do here is we'll play around with the field with the justification and the set.

93
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.390
Phil you'll notice on line 7 here that I've got a function called ruler and on that function does is

94
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.300
just display a line of numbers and that way we can line up our columns easier when we see them.

95
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.760
OK.

96
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.740
You don't have to do this but it just makes it easier to learn exactly what's going on.

97
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.190
And then I've got these three data items here that amusing.

98
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.770
Amusing number one which is an integer and it's one two three four.

99
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.150
I've got number two which is a double.

100
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.640
One two three four point five six seven eight.

101
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.340
And just a simple string hello first thing we'll do is just like we did in the slides it's just due

102
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.360
to defaults.

103
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.850
So all we're doing is we're putting number one number two and hello on to seek out and when we run that

104
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.910
you'll see everything just runs up together.

105
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.500
So let me build and run.

106
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.250
And then we see one two three four.

107
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.270
That's the integer.

108
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.220
And then one two three four point five seven rounded six significant figures here that's her precision

109
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.150
and then the halo everything jumbled up together at one right after the other.

110
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.070
That's exactly what we expect.

111
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.980
OK.

112
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.840
We can obviously comment this code out.

113
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.570
We can obviously display one on each line and sure that will help us read a little nicer because now

114
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.180
we'll see each one on each line.

115
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.890
But remember the defaults are being applied.

116
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.160
So we're getting one two three four is the integer.

117
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.560
One two three four point five seven which is round into the sixte precision for the digit.

118
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.750
And hello again.

119
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.960
Now let's play around with the field widths and here's a simple example.

120
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:14.200
What we're doing is again we're displaying the ruler and then we're setting the field with to 10 for

121
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.090
the next data item that's being put on the stream which happens to be numb in this case right here.

122
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.420
So numb will be displayed in a width of 10.

123
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.080
And if you recall number is that integer 1 2 3 4.

124
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.280
So that will be displayed in the width of 10 and the default is right justified.

125
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.770
But then when Number 2 in hollower displayed there is no field with associated with them that field

126
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.010
with only associates with the next item.

127
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:42.310
So these two should print right next to each other and right next to them one.

128
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.550
So let's take a look.

129
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.120
And there you go you can see one two three four right here.

130
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.440
And let me grab my pencil and I'll draw in white.

131
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.430
I think it'll be easier to see.

132
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.820
You can see right here the one two three four right there.

133
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.010
That's our integer and that's the tenth right.

134
00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.180
The tenth column.

135
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.500
So it's being right justified in the tenth column.

136
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:08.630
But then after that we're seeing are both double and our string all printed run right next to the other

137
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.970
no formatting applied.

138
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.750
Now let's do one more example actually actually do a few more examples.

139
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.430
Let's do this one here.

140
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.910
And the source code is available to you I encourage you to go in there and play around and change things

141
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.670
around that's really the best way to learn it.

142
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:29.260
OK so now look what we're doing we're setting the width to 10 for number one and for number two.

143
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:33.180
So now we expect someone to be right justified in a with the 10.

144
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:38.870
Number two to be right justified and with a 10 and then hello with no formatting just put right on the

145
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:39.190
end of it.

146
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.980
Number two.

147
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:46.690
So let's run this and here down at the bottom you can see that that's exactly what happens here.

148
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:51.460
There's my field of 10 and there's one two three four right justified in there.

149
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.170
Here's the other with of 10 right here the next field and you see one two three four point five seven

150
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.720
right justified in there as well.

151
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:06.190
And there's my hello I'm going to put a couple of new lines at the end just so that you will separate

152
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.960
that time message a little bit.

153
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.430
So be a little bit easier to see what's going on.

154
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.160
And there they are at his hadn't commented out.

155
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.280
So uncomment them OK.

156
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.450
So let's take a look at this example now.

157
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.110
I will uncomment this code and notice what's happening here.

158
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.280
I'm starting to feel with 10 for each one of those items by default.

159
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.320
We're going to right justify everything.

160
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:36.500
So number one number two and Hella will each display right justified in a field of 10 and let's give

161
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.250
that a run.

162
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.520
And there you go you can see one two three for the integer in the field with 10.

163
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.350
One two three four point fifty seven in its own field with them 10.

164
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.020
And hello you can see the zero right there right.

165
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:53.230
That would be the 30th column the third field with of 10 and it's right justified.

166
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.500
Comment this out and see what this is doing.

167
00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:00.850
Now this is doing exactly the same thing except we're left justifying each one of these.

168
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:07.210
Remember we have one left justified then we have to say it explicitly right justified is the default.

169
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.810
I always like to put in left and right that way.

170
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:15.440
Whoever's reading my code afterward understands exactly what's going on even though we know it's the

171
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.270
default.

172
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.700
Somebody might have forgotten so it's nice to see that there.

173
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:24.890
So here with the ten left justified number one with of 10 left justified number two and with the ten

174
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:25.870
left justified.

175
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.530
Hello.

176
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:31.910
So let's give them a run and you'll see the difference between this guy right here where they were right

177
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.620
justified and now down here were the left justified.

178
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.130
So you can see that one two three fourths displaying in column one.

179
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:44.800
One two three four point fifty seven in column 11 and hello in column 21.

180
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.690
Just like we expect.

181
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.860
OK so now let's do a couple with the set.

182
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.860
Fill in or comment this out.

183
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.260
We'll walk through this in a minute.

184
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.580
So notice what I'm doing here.

185
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.300
I'm setting the Phil character to the dash.

186
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.940
Now this is a persistent set in this persistence a light change.

187
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:06.400
And what I'm doing here is I'm setting the width to 10 left justified.

188
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.390
Number one.

189
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.540
Now number one was only four digits right.

190
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:15.910
So the rest of the space in net field of ten is going to be padded or filled with that Dasch character

191
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.390
and the same thing will happen to these guys.

192
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.880
Remember if we don't have a with set then the set feel doesn't apply.

193
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.870
It only applies when we set in the field with.

194
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:33.010
So in this case we expect to see all three of these guys left justified in a field with of 10 and all

195
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.600
the spaces that are left over other blank spaces in that field of 10 filled with dashes.

196
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.840
So let's take a look.

197
00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.870
And you can see right down here you see one two three four and then dashes all the way to the tenth

198
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.720
position.

199
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.870
And then one two three four point five seven dashes all the way to the 20th position and then below

200
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.090
and dashes all the way to the 30th position.

201
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:58.910
OK had we justified them the dashes would have been on the left who would fill any empty space in that

202
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.970
field with.

203
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.940
And the last example is we're doing now is we're using different set fill characters.

204
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.690
So we're setting the go filled with 210 for each one of them again and we're left justifying.

205
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:17.580
And in this first example for numb I'm using asterisk as the fill character for number two.

206
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:23.200
I'm using the hash mark or the pound symbol and for Hello I'm using the dash.

207
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.790
We should see three different fill characters filling up all that space.

208
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.560
Remember once this statement is done this is the Phil character that sets and that's going to persist

209
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.460
until I change it otherwise.

210
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.860
All right so let's run this.

211
00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.700
And there you can see that I'm using the asterisks for the first field.

212
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:46.730
The pound sides of the hash symbols for the second field and the dashes for the final field.

213
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:47.260
OK.

214
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.640
So that's it for this video in the next video.

215
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:54.070
We've got a challenge where we're going to put some of this stuff together to display a table.

216
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.120
Now you get a chance to play with them and put them together and understand how you can use your precision

217
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.260
your left your right your fixed and so forth all together to create a table of tour prices for trips

218
00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.040
to South America.

219
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.110
So that's the challenge coming up the next video.
