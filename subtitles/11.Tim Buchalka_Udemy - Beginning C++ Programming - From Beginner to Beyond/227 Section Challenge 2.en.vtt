Hello everyone welcome to the section 19 challenge to project in this project.

2
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.040
What I'd like you to do is write an automated grader let me explain what that is.

3
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.890
We want to write a program that reads a file and this file is called response's dot text which I'm providing

4
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.740
for you that file contains the answer key for a quiz that some students have taken as well as the responses

5
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.770
from the students for that quiz.

6
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.970
The structure of the file is really simple.

7
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.530
The first item in the file is the answer key and it's just a simple string with a bunch of letters in

8
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.490
it.

9
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.520
Then you've got student pairs as far as student response student response and so forth.

10
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.020
So here's a sample file you'll see right here on online 17 is the very first line of the file.

11
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.790
That's the answer key.

12
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.010
So in other words the correct answer to this quiz are A B C and D.

13
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.780
Now we've got student response pairs here as you can see there are five students here.

14
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.850
Frank's answers are ABC DNA.

15
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.050
So Frank got five out of five.

16
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.280
Larry got a B C A and C so when they got the ABC part right.

17
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.400
So Larry got to three out of five.

18
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.280
Moe got the B C D E.

19
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.550
He's got a four out of five.

20
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.640
Curley's got the B and D E.

21
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.010
He's got a two or five.

22
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.150
And Michael's got all but the first one so he's got four out of five.

23
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.840
That's it.

24
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.630
So what you have to do is basically read this file process the data and then display the output of the

25
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.890
output display is pretty straightforward.

26
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.770
You can formatted so it looks nice but it looks something like this.

27
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.020
So it'll say student and score it'll display this it'll display the score that they got out of five.

28
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.520
And then at the very end you'll have a little footer that shows the average score in this case 3.6.

29
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.360
You can assume that the data files properly formatted you're always going to have pairs you're not going

30
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.930
to have missing data and you always have at least one student in there.

31
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.390
OK.

32
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.130
So let me give a sample run so you can see what it looks like.

33
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.610
So there's a sample run given this data right here.

34
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.900
And as you can see here I've got the student the score Frank Larry mo Curley and Michael.

35
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.270
And there's a score out of five.

36
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.910
And the average in this case is a 3.6.

37
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.890
So here you'll get a chance to read a file to do some processing and you'll get a chance to use your

38
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.830
manipulators to line this up so it looks nice.

39
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.980
Let me show you the file itself it's called responses not text.

40
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.940
And there it is.

41
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.600
You can add data to this and test it all you like.

42
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.210
There is no test case right now with a 0 so you might want to add that as well.

43
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.850
And that's about it.

44
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.140
You can find it in the section 19 workspace in the challenge underscore to project.

45
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.230
There's also a challenge underscore to underscore solution project which is when we're going to talk

46
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.230
about in the next video where I'll show you my solution.

47
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.200
So have fun add fields to it if you like.

48
00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.810
Change the length of the answers right now the quizzes only 5 questions can change that around if you

49
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.250
like.

50
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.130
Like I said to the base challenge and then just have fun and learn from it.

51
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.420
All right.

52
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.390
So I'll see you in the next video and I'll show you a solution.
