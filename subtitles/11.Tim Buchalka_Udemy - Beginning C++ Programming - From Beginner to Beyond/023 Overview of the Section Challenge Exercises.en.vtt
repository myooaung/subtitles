00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.390
In this video I'd like to take a few minutes and talk about the challenge exercises in this course.

2
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.420
Most sections of the course will have a challenge exercise that you can attempt to solve the challenges

3
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.990
will range from simple at the beginning of the course to very very challenging toward the end of the

4
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.680
course.

5
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.670
These challenges are programming challenges in which will typically be given a description of the challenge

6
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.610
and the project files to start you off.

7
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.830
In addition to the challenge description I'll also explain the challenge and video and walk you through

8
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.530
the expected output these challenges are a great opportunity for you to apply what you've learned in

9
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.160
each section and Kotas C++ solution that works and solves the challenge once you complete the challenge.

10
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.480
You can watch a video of my solution to the challenge so you can compare to your own.

11
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.540
Remember there are many many ways to solve the same problem and my solution is just one way but it will

12
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.370
provide a solution to the same problem that you can learn from.

13
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.450
I encourage you to make up self challenges as well.

14
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.740
The more code you write and the more you practice the more comfortable you'll become with C++ and the

15
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.480
better your code will become.

16
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.240
It's OK if you can't fully complete the challenge.

17
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.100
They're not called challenges for nothing.

18
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.950
Do the challenges at your own pace.

19
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.100
No pressure.

20
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.400
Have fun experiment and keep trying.

21
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.300
Even if you get frustrated before you know it you will be solving complex problems and creating your

22
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.920
own Object-Oriented programs.
