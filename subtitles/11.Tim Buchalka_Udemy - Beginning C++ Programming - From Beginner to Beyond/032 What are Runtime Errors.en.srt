It this video.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,450
Talk about run time errors and why they can happen.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,360
As the name suggests runtime errors or errors that happen when the program is executing these types

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,810
of errors can be difficult to predict when we're writing our program.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,820
These areas include divide by zero errors.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,510
File not found errors out of memory errors and many many more.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,230
Some runtime errors can cause your program to crash.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,750
We use exception handling to help us know when runtime errors happen so we can try to recover from them.

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,790
We'll see examples of runtime errors later in this course when we work with files will also work with

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,040
exception handling toward the end of the course.
