00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:13,030
In this video we'll see a simple example of multiple inheritance in C++ multiple inheritance occurs

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:18,470
when a derived class inherits from two or more base classes at the same time.

3
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,800
The base classes may belong to unrelated class hierarchies.

4
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,100
The class diagram on the right shows an example of multiple inheritance.

5
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:34,080
In this case the class department chair is derived from both faculty and administrator classes.

6
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:40,390
So if we use public inheritance then a department chair is a faculty member and a department chair is

7
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,620
also an administrator.

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,830
The C++ syntax for multiple inheritance is simple.

9
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,670
We declare our derived class and then provide a comma separated list of the base classes that it's derived

10
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,670
from.

11
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:00,550
In this case department chair is our derived class and its base classes are faculty and administrator.

12
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,530
We're only showing public inheritance here but we could also use the other types of C++ inheritance

13
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:12,690
multiple inheritance is beyond the scope of this course and it can be very very complex in practice.

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,650
There are some compelling use cases for multiple inheritance.

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,340
However in many cases we can refactor our design so that the multiple inheritance can be avoided and

16
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,030
many times we end up with a better design.

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,810
This isn't because there's anything wrong with multiple inheritance.

18
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,810
The problem with multiple inheritance is that because it can be so complex.

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,550
Many developers don't fully understand it and therefore may mis use it more often.

20
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,870
You see multiple inheritance in class libraries and frameworks that you might be using.
