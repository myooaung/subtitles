1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,010
Now that code light is installed we need to run it configure it and then run a little test program to

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,220
make sure our configuration is correct.

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,080
So the first thing we want to do is we want to find code like.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,140
And you could just type code in the search and you'll find code light and DoubleClick.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,490
Now the first time it runs you make it a small window like this and it's probably a good idea just to

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,230
make it a little larger.

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,660
OK now sometimes when you run it the first time you'll get a setup wizard that runs.

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,690
Sometimes you don't.

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:41,310
We'd like to run the setup wizard so if it doesn't show up you can go to help run the setup wizard and

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,070
select that and you get a window that pops up.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,920
So I'll select next now here.

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,330
Code like supports ph and node and a few other technologies.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,440
We really don't want all that clutter on our ID.

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,290
We want to strictly concentrate on C++.

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:04,430
So I would suggest that we clear all the plug ins and then turn on only the C++ plug ins.

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,820
So you can see now that not everything is checked.

17
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,000
Only the plus plus plugins are checked and will select next.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,540
Now we'll scan our computer for any installed compilers so we'll scan the computer and it's found GCC

19
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,560
across GCC.

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,150
I'm going to select GCC.

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:28,830
Gcc stands for the new compiler collection which includes C C++ Fortran ADA and a few others.

22
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,490
Select next as far as the editor theme.

23
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,720
This is really a preference for you.

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,010
This dark monocoque theme is really easy on the eyes but it doesn't show up too well on video so I'm

25
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:47,270
going to select the classic eclipse look for the videos you can choose whatever your preferences not

26
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,360
pressed next.

27
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,020
I'll leave these defaults as is and press finish.

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:04,170
OK now sometimes it opens up to Windows like you see here so I want to save an exit and I want to shut

29
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,750
down all the versions that I've got going.

30
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,600
I don't know why it does this but does it a few times and I'll save and exit again.

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,600
All right so now let's.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,470
Now we're back to normal Let's try that again.

33
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,550
So run code like

34
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,370
and it's make this full screen again.

35
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,460
Perfect.

36
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,200
OK.

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,910
So now what we need to do is we need to create a workspace.

38
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:34,730
A workspace is an area where we can have our C++ projects so we can have many C++ projects in one workspace.

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:43,640
We can do that by selecting this button here called new workspace or we can go up to file new new workspace

40
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,860
either place some of us like this button here and it's going to ask for the workspace name.

41
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,260
This could be any name you like.

42
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:57,860
I'm going to say BPP workspace and I'm going to put this on my desktop.

43
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,660
You can store it anywhere you like as long as you remember where it's at.

44
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,240
So going to put this on my desktop

45
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,200
I want to create the workspace under a separate directory that help me organize my files better and

46
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,500
press OK.

47
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:14,720
That's it.

48
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,070
Now we've got a workspace which you can see here on the left side.

49
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,160
I can right click on that now and create a new project.

50
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,350
Again I can also go up file new project.

51
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,720
So I'll do that.

52
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,850
Now we've got some options here as to which template to use to create the project.

53
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,140
We're going to stick to the console template which is just basically a terminal window and we want a

54
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,960
G plus plus that's the C++ compiler.

55
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:49,530
It's called C++ because it's the new C++ compiler I'll select next.

56
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,640
What's my project name.

57
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,450
It could be anything you like.

58
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,140
Don't use spaces for any of these project name so I'll just say test one.

59
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:06,170
And again I want to create a project in a separate directory under the workspace so I select next.

60
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,420
Now I was going to ask you which compiler do you want to use.

61
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,150
You may have a lot of different compilers on your system.

62
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,110
Just select the one that you used in the setup wizard and you'll be fine.

63
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,190
And these defaults are perfectly fine.

64
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:25,070
Select finish and that creates a test project under the C.P. workspace and you can see it's called it's

65
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,310
created a source directory and in there it's kind of main CGP file.

66
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,720
That's our C plus plus source code and we'll get to that in a second.

67
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,190
We need to do a couple of bits of configuration before we do anything else.

68
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,480
Let's go to our project test one in this case and we'll right click and we'll go down to the bottom

69
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,200
where it settings will select that and then we'll get to where it says compiler options.

70
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,490
And notice I mean the global settings that's pretty important I mean the global settings compiler options

71
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,790
and then I'll select these three little dots here on the button and I want to make sure that w all is

72
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:08,870
selected that way we always get warnings and I want to make sure that the C++ standard C plus plus 14

73
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,740
is selected.

74
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,110
That's the latest standard for C++.

75
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,710
That'll make sure that we're using the modern C++ compiler at that point.

76
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,280
You can click OK apply.

77
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,010
OK good.

78
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:29,900
Now we can go to our workspace and right click on that and come down to workspace settings and you'll

79
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,090
see environment and code completion.

80
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:39,410
Go to the code completion and select enable C++ 14 standard code completion is a tool that the integrated

81
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,650
development environment uses that tries to figure out what I'm typing and what I want to type when it

82
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,850
helps predict what I want to do so it can help me so I don't have to type so much and it can do some

83
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,400
checking as it goes.

84
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,530
In this case I'm just telling you to use the modern C++ compiler.

85
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,790
I'll select OK and that's it.

86
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:05,910
Now I can run a simple test program will double click the main CGP file and this is actually C-code

87
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,690
not see post post code so we'll delete this in a minute but that aunt is a little small so in my case

88
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,810
since I'm doing this on video I'm going to get a settings colors and fonts and I'm just going to set

89
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,040
that to about 16

90
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,140
and see

91
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,320
that's much better.

92
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,260
You should see that much better.

93
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:41,200
OK so let's delete all of this and we'll write a really simple C++ program as we go through the course.

94
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:46,040
I'll talk about the anatomy of a C plus plus program and will go into detail as to what everything I'm

95
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,360
going to be typing here means.

96
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,700
But for now just type along and let's get a clean run so that we know our environments are set up.

97
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,490
So the first thing we want to write is we want to write.

98
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:07,010
LB include and I O stream inside angle brackets and we'll press Enter then we'll say int main and open

99
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:13,940
and close friends that will create them will typeless left curly and the Integrated Development Environment

100
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:24,070
will automatically close that for me and here want to do a say as T.D. to Colon's and seek out the insertion

101
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,250
operator which is two less than signs with no space in between.

102
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:36,370
And just some strange saying hello testin or anything else you like that has to be in double quotes.

103
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,510
And then finally we'll put a semi-colon on the end of that to terminate.

104
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,940
And then finally the last statement will be returned zero.

105
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,450
That means that the program terminated correctly.

106
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,150
That's it.

107
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,530
That's our first really simple C++ program.

108
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,060
And like I said in the beginning of the course I go through what all of this means and we'll go through

109
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,760
the anatomy of a C++ program and in great detail I'll save this.

110
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:07,570
Another option you may like is if you come up here to the menu you say view and say toggle minimal view

111
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,870
and you can see it's putting a bunch of buttons up here if you like this.

112
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,540
This is great because you know you can run and compile and do all kinds of things just by clicking on

113
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,530
a button.

114
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,290
I'm not going to use that because I find that pretty distracting to the video.

115
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,170
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to shut that off on my end.

116
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,050
But feel free to use it.

117
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,120
I'm going to use command keys and I'll also just come up here and say you know build in that with very

118
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,110
explicit what I'm doing rather than just clicking on a button.

119
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,740
So that's it.

120
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,550
So let's run this.

121
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,280
Now what we'll do is I say build.

122
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,590
First thing I want to do is I want to clean this project that way there's no remnants of anything left

123
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,160
over.

124
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,770
It'll put it into a stable state that's good to go.

125
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:54,130
So I clean the project all the messages will show up down here then I'll say build and I'll just say

126
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,670
run and it's going to ask me do I just want to run it or do I want to build it and run it.

127
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,740
Well in this case I have to build it and run it because I haven't built it yet.

128
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,630
So I select to build and execute.

129
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,720
And if all goes well we'll get a window that pops up that says Hello.

130
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,430
Testing exactly what we typed here.

131
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,950
Press any key to continue Osaki press enter to continue which I'm going to press now.

132
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,040
The window goes away and we're done.

133
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,590
Now several things could go wrong here.

134
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,910
You may have an error in your program you might have forgotten to type this exactly right.

135
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:34,060
So you may have forgotten the semi-colon in which case when you go to build and run.

136
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,370
You'll see this red line here that's a compiler error.

137
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,940
You'll also see a red arrow over here telling you there's something wrong here.

138
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,440
And the compiler is telling you that it's expecting a semi-colon before the return.

139
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,160
So put it in there.

140
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,490
Just be really careful.

141
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,830
Talk about debugging and fixing syntax errors throughout the entire course.

142
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,810
But at this point save it make sure it's right.

143
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,960
Again be very careful you may have extra quote marks and the compiler won't like it.

144
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,220
You might only have a single less than sign here and it's not going to like it.

145
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,970
So just be sure it's exactly like this.

146
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:15,000
Once you've got it set up build run build and execute.

147
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,910
There's a clean run and there's my terminal.

148
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,410
