00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,300
Historically,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,890
ledgers were used to keep track of information that

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,340
needed a verifiable history of changes.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,410
For example,

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,010
a financial account could just show you the current balance, but what

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,840
if the balance was different than you expected?

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,960
You'd want to know what happened to arrive at that

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,940
current balance or what was the history.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,580
While far from foolproof,

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,440
older ledgers employed a few measures to preserve data integrity.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,510
For example,

12
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,010
writing in pen instead of pencil made it difficult to remove or change an entry.

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,500
The books were usually locked up in a safe when not in use.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,080
The handwriting style of different individuals could sometimes,

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,920
but not always, be detected, so if an unauthorized person tried

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,140
to change the books after hours, it could be easy to detect.

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,530
Modern systems no longer rely on handwritten books as

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,650
systems of record, but how can you solve the problem of

19
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,540
data integrity in cloud systems?

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,840
Some systems create audit logs using a traditional database.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,040
These can be error prone, hard to scale, and they are not immutable.

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,640
Given the right conditions,

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,940
the data could be changed or deleted without detection.

24
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,930
Blockchain solves the immutability problem,

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,040
but adds additional overhead since it operates on a

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,990
decentralized model best suited to maintain a single

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,840
record for multiple untrusted parties.

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,300
Amazon Quantum Ledger Database, or QLDB, is a fully‑managed ledger

29
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,540
database owned by a central trusted authority.

30
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,540
By using a central trusted authority instead of a decentralized model,

31
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,090
QLDB can perform operations much faster than other blockchain networks,

32
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,830
making it easier and less resource intensive to scale, in

33
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,690
addition to providing predictable completion times for

34
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,180
operations. As a managed serverless service,

35
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,110
you get automatic scaling, high availability, and continuous backups.

36
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,010
QLDB has a document data model that allows you to store structured or

37
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,350
semi‑structured data that you can then query using particle,

38
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:21,200
which is an open source SQL‑compatible query language. QLDB creates an

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,710
immutable and transparent ledger of every change to your data.

40
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,730
In other words, every operation is stored and cannot be changed,

41
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,760
and you can view the entire history at any time.

42
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,140
That history is cryptographically verifiable,

43
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,540
meaning you can always verify the integrity of the ledger

44
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,030
and detect if something you're looking at is different than

45
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,240
what was recorded in the ledger.

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:56,000
QLDB is a good fit for financial, manufacturing supply sourcing, chain of custody, and other system of record applications.
