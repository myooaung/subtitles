00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.210
Identity and Access Management, or IAM,

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.440
is the core security construct for all AWS services.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.040
The core components are policies, users, groups, and roles.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.640
At a basic level, policies define what actions can or cannot be taken.

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.720
You can then assign policies to users, groups,

6
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.640
and roles to manage account permissions.

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.040
When you create an IAM user,

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.630
you can decide what credentials you want to allow for that user.

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.840
You can allow a username and password for console access,

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.340
as well as AWS access keys for programmatic access.

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.050
You can also configure an MFA device for the user or

12
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.420
require them to set one up when they log in.

13
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.510
As an IAM user administrator, you can disable or reset passwords,

14
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.740
as well as generate, deactivate, or delete AWS access keys.

15
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.230
You may also use AWS Security Token Service,

16
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.920
or STS, to request temporary limited privilege credentials for IAM users.

17
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.860
These tools can help you manage user access as your organization

18
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.640
changes or if a user account is compromised.

19
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.200
An IAM role is similar to an IAM user in that it is an AWS identity with a name

20
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.640
and policies to determine what actions it can and cannot do.

21
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.440
However, roles do not have permanent credentials,

22
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.750
and they cannot make direct requests to AWS services.

23
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.530
IAM roles are meant to delegate access to a trusted entity without

24
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.140
having to share long‑term access keys with that entity.

25
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.680
When a trusted entity assumes a role,

26
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.040
that entity gains a temporary ability to perform actions authorized by the role.

27
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.960
For database services that are instance‑based,

28
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.130
you'll be working with instances inside of a Virtual Private Cloud,

29
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.240
or VPC.

30
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.180
Security groups belong to a VPC and are assigned to

31
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.440
instances as a virtual firewall to control inbound and

32
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440
outbound traffic for that instance.

33
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.740
You can use the same security group in different subnets in the same VPC,

34
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.140
and the same subnet can also have different security groups.

35
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.890
If you're using instance‑based databases,

36
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.670
there are several networking components involved to

37
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.870
get traffic to your instances,

38
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.340
so let's do a brief overview so you understand what is involved.

39
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.240
First, you'll have an internet or VPN gateway.

40
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.740
Next, a router and a route table, followed by a network access control list.

41
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.040
Finally, you'll reach the security group and your instance.

42
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.040
For finer‑grained control of instance access,

43
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.010
you'll likely use a combination of security groups

44
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.720
and network access control lists.

45
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.540
Let's compare the two.

46
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.250
Security groups operate on the instance level,

47
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.940
whereas network access control list is on these subnet level.

48
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.940
One provides allow rules, while the other can provide both allow and deny rules.

49
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.890
Security groups will evaluate all rules before allowing traffic,

50
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.940
whereas NACLs have rules processed in numeric order.

51
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.460
A security group is stateful,

52
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.790
meaning that return traffic is automatically allowed regardless of any rules,

53
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.230
whereas your NACL is stateless and return traffic

54
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.840
must be explicitly allowed by rules.

55
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.320
A security group applies to an instance only if it is

56
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.840
associated with that security group,

57
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.830
whereas your NACL automatically applies to all instances

58
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.620
in the subnets associated with the NACL, so you can't

59
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.140
accidentally forget to assign it.

60
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.340
Way to go.

61
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.560
You've seen how AWS Key Management Service helps you maintain

62
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.740
encryption keys for encrypting your data.

63
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.620
You've also seen how CloudTrail, Web Application Firewall,

64
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.340
and GuardDuty can help with account auditing and avoiding vulnerabilities.

65
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.080
Finally,

66
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.250
you saw some additional ways you can manage security

67
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.360
including IAM users and roles, security groups,

68
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.340
and network controls.

69
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.540
Great job completing this course.

70
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.140
You now have a better understanding of the different AWS

71
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.950
database services and the roles and responsibilities to

72
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:49.000
consider as a database specialist. I hope you found this valuable, and thank you for watching.
