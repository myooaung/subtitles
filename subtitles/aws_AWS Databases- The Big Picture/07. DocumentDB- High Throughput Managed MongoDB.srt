00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,670
Amazon DocumentDB is very much like the other services

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,490
we've covered in that it's a managed, highly available,

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,740
low latency, fault tolerant, selfâ€‘healing service.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,060
You can easily scale the cluster up and down, there are continuous backups,

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,790
and you can encrypt the data with keys you generate

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,940
using Amazon Key Management Service.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:28,550
The key feature is that DocumentDB is MongoDB compatible. This

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,120
allows you to use existing MongoDB tools and application code

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,970
with a managed cloud service. DocumentDB makes it easy to store,

10
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,890
query, and index JSON data.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,840
This allows you to persist the data using the same document model

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:54,000
format used in application code without having to perform transformations every time you read or write data.
