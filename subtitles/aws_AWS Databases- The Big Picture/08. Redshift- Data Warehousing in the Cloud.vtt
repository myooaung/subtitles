00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.080
When you hear the word warehouse, you may picture something like this.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.390
A building that is very large with tall shelves holding pallets of items.

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.060
These items arrive and leave by the truckload and require special

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.640
equipment to move around due to their size and weight.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.770
Warehouses serve an important function of holding items until

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.260
they are shipped to a final destination.

7
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.240
Data warehouses serve a similar function.

8
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.100
They hold data that is needed to perform comprehensive analytics

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.810
for organizations and they operate on a much larger scale than

10
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.940
other databases within the organization.

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.660
When dealing with data warehouses, some common pain points that arise are size,

12
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.630
scale, and storage.

13
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.000
The sheer volume of data needed for data warehouse activities exceeds the

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.040
maximum operating capacity of some database engines.

15
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.890
A data warehouse needs to have a storage system capable of

16
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.790
scaling up to handle very large amounts of data.

17
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.010
Performance,

18
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.850
operating on extremely large datasets can magnify problems that are

19
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.540
sometimes hidden when working with smaller amounts of data.

20
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.380
A data warehouse needs to be able to query and analyze the data

21
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.840
fast enough to provide value to the organization.

22
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.040
For example,

23
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.000
if you're trying to make decisions each day based on

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.960
insights from your data warehouse,

25
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.510
but it takes a week for the reports to complete,

26
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.780
you'll always be acting on stale information.

27
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.940
Cost, this goes back to providing value.

28
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.430
If it costs more to run your data warehouse than you can gain

29
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.030
in value from using the data warehouse,

30
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.410
then why bother creating one in the first place?

31
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.270
Ideally, cost should also be predictable and correspond to your actual usage.

32
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.080
Security,

33
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.400
many organizations are subject to certain audit and compliance requirements

34
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.630
that don't go away just because you're using a data warehouse.

35
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.140
A security breach on a data warehouse could have a much larger

36
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.060
impact than other database compromises due to the volume and variety

37
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.040
of data contained in the data warehouse.

38
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.240
Finally, management,

39
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.160
how many resources are you going to need to dedicate

40
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.340
to managing your data warehouse?

41
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.150
Are you going to have any resources left over to actually use the system,

42
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.640
or is most of your budget going toward just keeping the lights on?

43
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.580
Amazon Redshift is a cloud data warehouse designed to address the pain

44
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.190
points of data warehousing by leveraging the scale,

45
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.320
flexibility, performance, and cost savings available in the cloud.

46
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.880
Let's go through some of the features of Redshift to see how it addresses size,

47
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.660
speed, and storage, performance, cost, security,

48
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.010
and management.

49
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.940
You'll often hear data warehouses measured in terms of petabytes.

50
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.700
A petabyte is equal to 1024 TB.

51
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.100
It would take over 3.4 years of full HD video recording to fill 1 PB.

52
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.850
With managed storage,

53
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.040
Redshift can automatically support workloads of up to 8 PB of compressed data.

54
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.690
The Redshift Spectrum feature allows you to run queries against Amazon

55
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.050
S3 without having to load or transform any data,

56
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.350
as well as writing data back to S3 in open formats such as Parquet,

57
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.040
JSON, and CSV.

58
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.210
This gives you the flexibility to store highly structured,

59
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.470
frequently accessed data in a Redshift data warehouse

60
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.350
while keeping other structured, semi‑structured,

61
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.040
and unstructured data in S3.

62
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.580
Federated query is another feature designed to reduce data movement.

63
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.860
This allows you to query live data from your Amazon RDS and Aurora

64
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.410
databases without moving that data into Redshift. Redshift concurrency

65
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.340
scaling adds transient capacity in seconds.

66
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.240
In other words, as the number of concurrent users increases,

67
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.060
Redshift can automatically scale up your resources to provide

68
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.640
consistently fast queries to all of your users.

69
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.440
Redshift allows you to scale compute and storage separately.

70
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.830
This saves you money by not having to provision unneeded compute

71
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.760
capacity as your data grows. Some Redshift instances further help you

72
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.210
optimize cost and performance by automatically moving less frequently

73
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.120
accessed data to S3 and holding more frequently accessed data on local

74
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.370
SSDs. AWS has developed a high‑bandwidth connection between these

75
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.160
instances and S3,

76
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.040
so you're able to save on storage costs without a

77
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.740
significant impact on performance.

78
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.590
Overall,

79
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.650
Redshift costs up to 75% less than other cloud data warehouses

80
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.740
while delivering up to three times the performance.

81
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.190
Redshift has several security features built in and

82
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.530
integrates with other AWS services to give you a wide

83
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.480
variety of security options. For example,

84
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.170
you can have end‑to‑end encryption of your data to

85
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.140
secure it both in transit and at rest.

86
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.650
Your instances can run inside a VPC for isolation from other resources

87
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.000
or be able to connect to your existing IT infrastructure using a VPN.

88
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.910
You can enable CloudTrail to track all Redshift API calls, and Redshift

89
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.780
also logs all SQL operations, including connection attempts,

90
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.530
queries, and changes to your data warehouse.

91
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.140
You can also set row and column‑level security controls to control data access.

92
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.140
Redshift simplifies many management tasks to lessen the resources required to

93
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.780
set up and maintain your data warehouse. Infrastructure is automatically

94
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.430
provisioned, and backup and replication is automatic,

95
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.400
including the option to replicate data to a separate region.

96
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.010
Fault tolerance is also built in. Redshift will automatically

97
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:16.000
re‑replicate data from failed drives and replace nodes is necessary to keep your data warehouse running.
