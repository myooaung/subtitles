00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.710
Estimates and milestones.

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.370
I am sure this is your favorite topic,

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.380
but developing basic estimates and milestones yields

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.620
critical information required to best optimize your order

5
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.240
of work that we just talked about.

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.570
Are estimates and milestones always needed?

7
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.310
Well, let's see.

8
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.510
If milestones and estimates are not needed for your project,

9
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.690
then just begin work based on the order and

10
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.850
prioritization your teams have determined.

11
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.020
Now,

12
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.440
orderings and priorities may change based on the

13
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.180
needs of your downstream partners,

14
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.920
and you'll be making ongoing adjustments accordingly.

15
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.640
That never changes and shouldn't.

16
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.290
But usually, the bigger the project or maybe the bigger the organization,

17
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.840
the more likely you'll have one or more full‑time project managers and

18
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.720
executives asking for estimates of milestones for your backlog work.

19
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.670
Your estimates are important,

20
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.610
since project managers and others are looking to you to

21
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.010
meet or deliver on project milestones and,

22
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.950
of course, to ensure that teams are within budget guidelines.

23
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.640
Now let's see an example of how to make estimates a less tedious process.

24
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.580
So when will that work item be done?

25
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.920
You might be asked this question by project managers or executives,

26
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.810
and you should have an approach to help you do just that.

27
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.940
Let's look at a basic way to make estimates.

28
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.320
Estimates should not be from the hip, nor should they take a ton of time.

29
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.460
For this example,

30
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.900
let's assume you're a functioning Kanban team with all of your

31
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.840
historical data captured in a Kanban management tool.

32
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.250
First,

33
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.740
you want to consider a period of historical time to

34
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.250
help forecast your estimates.

35
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.850
We will use a 4‑week or a 20‑workday period. Determine the number

36
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.510
of tasks or work items completed in that period.

37
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.790
So let's say we had 80 tasks, so divided by 20 workdays, that

38
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.380
would give us about 4 tasks per day on average. You have

39
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.970
likely picked up on what I'm doing.

40
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.710
I am not estimating each task literally,

41
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.220
but instead simply counting the number of tasks it

42
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.700
would take to complete the work.

43
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.670
So it is important to have a cohesive team working together for a while

44
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.320
in order to have enough empirical data to be relevant.

45
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.860
Next, estimate the new work by determining how many tasks it'll take.

46
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.040
So let's say our estimate is 16 tasks for the new work.

47
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.870
Calculate the estimated time for the new work item to be complete.

48
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.390
So, 16 divided by 4 tasks per day yields about 4 days.

49
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.640
That will be our estimate.

50
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.020
Counting tasks saves time versus estimating each and

51
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.640
every task the old‑fashioned way.

52
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.460
So if your Kanban team has been running for a while, then

53
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.150
you'll have lots of empirical data to draw upon to help you

54
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.800
make these types of estimates.

55
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.000
Your digital Kanban board will track all of this for you, so it should be relatively easy to crank out estimates.
