1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,680
Now let's go through an example of using a version

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,940
control system with a kanban board.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,120
Let's first get a firm understanding and importance

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,160
of done rules in a kanban board.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,350
The work in progress is done only when the done rule is satisfied.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,310
A card is only moved from left to right through the value stream steps

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,340
when it satisfies the definition of done for that step.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,360
So the resource in the next step cannot pull the work forward unless the

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,110
done rules are satisfied by the previous step's resource.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,260
The definition of a work item being done is in fact the done rule.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,300
The done rule is also known as the pull criteria.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,770
That is,

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,910
it is okay to pull the work forward into my step and begin working

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,740
on it only if all the done rules are complete.

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,670
Each step should have at least two columns, work in progress and done.

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,840
This is the real reason why we have at least two columns per step,

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,150
so it makes it absolutely clear what work is in work in

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,350
progress versus what work is done.

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,070
Now I apologize for the term pull because Kanban has the

20
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,650
term pull to pull to work forward, and, of course,

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,620
a version control system has a term pull or pull

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,240
request for doing the merging up.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,440
Just make sure you have both of those clearly in mind,

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,140
and they are in fact different.

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,860
Here is our typical value stream from left to right: Backlog,

26
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,620
Specify, Implement, Validate, and Deliver.

27
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,890
And, as I just mentioned,

28
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,530
before any work item can be moved to the DONE column

29
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,860
from the WORK IN PROGRESS column, all done rules must be satisfied.

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,740
In this example, we're going to focus on the Validate step,

31
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,370
and I'm sure you have noticed that each step has a WORK

32
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,340
IN PROGRESS column and a DONE column.

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,840
Now let's expand on the Validate step.

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,240
Let's look at how we may modify the value stream to incorporate the important

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,800
features of a version control system into our kanban board.

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,940
So we have R4 as a branch off of the mainline and three

37
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,170
work item branches as well off of R4, 345,

38
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,940
346, and 347.

39
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,440
Here is a close‑up view of the Validate step.

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,880
Remember,

41
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,950
our Validate step is our last step to be sure everything is

42
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,180
perfect before we give it to deliver.

43
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,610
Okay, let's drill in.

44
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,520
We have our WORK IN PROGERSS column.

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,930
This is our DONE column.

46
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,510
The work items have met all of the done rules.

47
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,740
That is, the complete pull criteria is satisfied. Now first,

48
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,110
I have labeled the column DONE and PR,

49
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,610
which represents the pull request has been made.

50
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,450
So I have basically added one additional done rule,

51
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,140
and that is the pull request.

52
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,500
And to make it more explicit, the column is labeled DONE + PR.

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,290
I have set up an area to collect the done work items targeted for release

54
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:48,220
4, and so far I have work items 346 and 347 in that area. And I have

55
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,210
another release, R5, and even one more for hotfixes that may be flowing

56
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,150
through our value stream as well. When the target branch owner of R4 has

57
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,260
merged up into the target branch,

58
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,460
I move the work item to the right in the DONE + M‑UP, or merged up, column.

59
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,400
And at some point,

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,350
when all of the work items, 345, 346, and 347, are complete, then,

61
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,420
and only then, will R4 be done because those were the

62
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,110
four work items targeted for release 4.

63
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,130
I did this to provide greater visibility into a typical DONE column.

64
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,760
I wanted to see things that were done and a pull request made,

65
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,240
and I wanted to see things done by releases.

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:34,000
Remember, you can set up your steps, columns, or areas in any way you want to better manage the flow of work.
