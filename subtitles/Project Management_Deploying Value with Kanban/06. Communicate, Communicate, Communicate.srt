1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,730
I know everyone has heard the real estate phrase,

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,990
"It's all about location, location,

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,570
location." And in large companies and especially large,

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,030
complex development efforts, the phrase is communicate,

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,600
communicate, and communicate.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,340
To me, you can never communicate enough.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,970
Here's a quote: "What we've got here is a failure to

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,780
communicate." It's a famous line from a classic movie,

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,910
Cool Hand Luke.

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,500
So even if you think you are communicating,

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,190
be sure you can determine if it is, in fact, effective.

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,140
And if you have a chance, check out the movie.

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,940
It's a classic.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,450
The larger the organization,

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,270
the more complex the communication challenges can be.

16
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,370
It's a given, so be ready for that.

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,350
You can use many of the same tools listed throughout this course to

18
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,750
manage status information about backlog items,

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,230
work in progress, tasks, the order of work,

20
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,940
priorities, and milestones.

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,370
If you are using more than one tool in your organization,

22
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,560
say one for Kanban teams and one for enterprise project management,

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,080
you will likely have to integrate the data or simply manually update

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,140
the enterprise data that relates to your team.

25
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,950
Nonetheless, the better the automated integration of data,

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,490
the better quality of project status communication.

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,030
Not only is communication skills critical,

28
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,140
but also leadership, so check out my most popular Pluralsight course,

29
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,050
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers.

30
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,450
You won't regret it.

31
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,430
Communication via push events.

32
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,930
It is important that you as the Kanban team leader or member

33
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,320
communicate significant events of your backlog,

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,030
its ordering, and your deliveries to other teams.

35
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,190
Since it will be likely that more than one project management tool is used,

36
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,200
and since the tools tend to be more precise and detailed,

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,690
you will need other creative ways of communicating the

38
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,020
events of completion of backlog items, ordering and prioritization,

39
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,970
the breakage of backlog items, bugs, delays,

40
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,040
etc.

41
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,690
Consider using email, text messaging, Twitter,

42
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,880
Facebook, or other ubiquitous tools to push information

43
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,930
about the state, health, milestones,

44
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,720
deliverables, or any breakage by your Kanban team.

45
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,340
Of course,

46
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,130
there should only be one communication process for the entire enterprise

47
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,510
project. That would make life much easier, but don't count on it.

48
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,680
Be proactive and push your status events out to others.

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,750
Don't wait for them to ask you.

50
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,420
It's important to note with waterfall or scrum,

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,120
for example,

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,370
there are distinct events by which you can be reminded to publish

53
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,850
your results and statuses. But with Kanban,

54
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,480
you are continuously delivering, and hence, you need to be

55
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,430
communicating with others probably even daily.

56
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,640
So why not have a status dashboard updated daily?

57
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,120
The bottom line is communicate proactively; push events to others.

58
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,330
People need to know information. Again, this is a complex network problem.

59
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,000
You have your backlog being fed from multiple teams, and

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,780
you're delivering to multiple teams.

61
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,340
It can get very complex.

62
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,240
The more information, the better.

63
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,830
With large projects and large organizations,

64
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,580
I strongly recommend a focused project management level of effort.

65
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,550
Why? Dev teams are doing what they do best, and that is develop great systems.

66
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,620
In my experience,

67
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,740
they're not always the best suited to also communicate project activities.

68
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,440
Therefore,

69
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,420
you may need a fullâ€‘time and dedicated project management team to manage

70
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,170
all the planning, requirements management, integration,

71
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,860
etc.

72
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,050
Do not shortchange the project.

73
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,680
If you are the lead or a Kanban team member,

74
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,950
this choice will likely be at a higher IT or leadership level.

75
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,280
But trust me, if you can lobby for resources to focus on enterprise planning,

76
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,380
then you'll have more time to do your job,

77
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,340
and that's write great software.

78
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,590
Project management is not just for big companies or projects, either.

79
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,780
Even if you have only three or four teams,

80
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,030
there will be a lot of project activities to handle in coordination,

81
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,140
planning, budgets, resources, issues, customers, and you name it.

82
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,980
Wouldn't you rather have a group of professionals handling that?

83
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,780
I sure would.

84
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:59,000
I want my team focused on the developing of the best software and not be distracted by project management activities.
