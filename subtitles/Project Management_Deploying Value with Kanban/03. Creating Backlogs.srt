1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,870
Let's begin with looking at how backlogs are created

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,740
in both Kanban and Agile Scrum.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,680
How are Kanban and Agile Scrum backlogs different?

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,230
Well,

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,910
they're pretty close to the same thing. Their backlogs are in

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,040
organized, prioritized lists of pending features and tasks for

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
delivering a complete product.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,440
So, no surprise there.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,250
Now let's look at backlog management.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,990
In the case of Agile Scrum,

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,360
it's the product owner who defines the product or the backlog,

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,550
which is a collection of features, use cases, et cetera. And the

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,240
process is typically facilitated by the Scrum Master.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
The Scrum Master is ensuring that the process by which requirements

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,140
are gathered, added, and prioritized are followed.

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,920
Keep in mind,

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,810
the Scrum Master usually does not perform any analysis or backlog ordering,

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,610
but ensures the process is managed and run well.

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,440
Of course, there are exceptions to everything.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,630
It is not uncommon for a project manager or business analyst to play this

21
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:02,040
role, as well as to provide other support to the Scrum team.

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,680
Now let's look at Kanban backlog management. In the Kanban framework,

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,710
there is no dependence on this rigid division of labor,

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,830
so contributors to the backlog may be project teammates,

25
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,150
customers, end users, you name it,

26
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,600
and this could evolve according to the project's needs and preferences.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,550
Now, I'm going to put product owner on my list.

28
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,660
I like that term.

29
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,270
It is well understood by the Agile Scrum community,

30
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,340
and though Kanban can be more flexible, which I like a lot,

31
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,340
but having too many cooks in the kitchen,

32
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,080
that is, too many sources providing requirements,

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,240
may be a bit too much.

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,840
I prefer a smaller group, but that's me.

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,430
Remember,

36
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,860
Kanban is flexible to handle anything that supports the flow of work, so you

37
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,410
can decide what makes the best sense, and that is why I use the phrase

38
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:48,200
"facilitated by Kanban," because it is your choice on how best to handle it

39
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,220
with no rigid rules. Let's recap backlogs.

40
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,340
So when it comes to creating backlogs, they are similar,

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,640
and Kanban promotes a more open and flexible approach to who can represent the

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,700
customer base. That is nice, but season to taste, please! Too many

43
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,140
'requirements' cooks in the kitchen can be unproductive,

44
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,540
so just be aware of your customer environment.

45
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,580
I really do like the product owner concept,

46
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,440
and the term is widely recognized and understood,

47
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,870
and there can certainly be more than one product owner.

48
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,820
You have to use your leadership and interpersonal skills,

49
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,000
whether Kanban or Agile Scrum, to form a creative approach to backlog management.
