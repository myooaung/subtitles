Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,470
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,080
I will be presenting the module Adapting Kanban within Larger

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,760
Organizations in the course Deploying Value with Kanban. The outcome of

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,890
this module is to provide you the necessary knowledge to help you employ

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,010
Kanban techniques more effectively in larger organizations or multiple

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,240
interconnected development teams.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,910
First,

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,630
let's see where Kanban usage falls relative to other agile or

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,830
lean techniques in companies today. Kanban, in some capacity, is

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:42,380
used in 61% of all companies surveyed, so Kanban is pretty widely used.

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,110
You might want to check out my reference,

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,840
the 13th Annual State of the Agile Report.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,340
It's a very interesting read, so check it out.

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,830
Here are the topics we'll cover in this module: complexities of large

16
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,730
organizations, adapting to large organizations, the order of work,

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,790
estimates and milestones, communicate, communicate, and communicate,

18
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,690
dealing with late dependencies,

19
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,810
handling buggy dependencies, and leveraging fakes,

20
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:15,000
stubs, and mocks. And lastly, point of view and the module summary. Okay, let's get started.
