00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,590
Now that we have our projects moving forward,

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,040
that is our work in progress, what are the things that could get in

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,700
the way, or another way of saying it, what are the constraints or

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,220
issues that would impede our workflow?

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:19,240
So let's compare and contrast how we will handle those with Kanban and Scrum.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,900
Let's first define some terms for what I'm calling the

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,440
three Bs of workflow constraints.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,500
A bottleneck in a process flow is anywhere that an accumulation

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,110
of work builds up waiting to be processed.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,890
Sometimes you might hear the term constraint as well.

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,510
A blocker is a blocked or impassable work item that is restricting the flow

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,790
of work, it is the work item itself that is the blocker.

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,920
Now it's important to get our terms right, a

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,780
bottleneck is not a blocker. And lastly,

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,460
a buffer.

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:55,000
Now a buffer has a totally different meaning between Kanban and Scrum. Okay, so we will drill into these and their implications.
