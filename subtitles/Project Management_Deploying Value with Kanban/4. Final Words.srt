00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,840
Here are my final words and closing remarks for this course.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,720
Wherever your career path may take you, with or without Kanban,

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,550
always remember the bottom line is your ability to deliver business value.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,750
Do not forget that! It is going to be one of your

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,940
biggest assets as a professional.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,450
Thank you very much for taking my course.

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:25,880
I,

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,330
like you, have been challenged over the years in how best to provide

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,390
value to the business. I hope and trust that this course has been able

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,670
to provide you with the essential tools,

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,350
methods,

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,220
approaches, and renewed confidence to help you be more

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,940
successful in delivering value with Kanban.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,680
Lastly,

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:50,000
I hope to see you again at one of my other courses, and I wish you the best in your professional journey, and never stop learning.
