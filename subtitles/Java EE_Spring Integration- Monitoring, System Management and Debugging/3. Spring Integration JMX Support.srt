00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,870
[Autogenerated] As you know,

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,950
the way that components communicate with each other in spring

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,540
integration is fire messages on message channels.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,340
Spring integration provides many channel adapters and gateways to

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,560
connect other systems to the messaging infrastructure.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,500
So it's probably not a surprise that for working with J M X,

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,340
there is also a set of channel adapters and gateways.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,890
We can group these spring integration J M X components into

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,640
three groups for working with J M X operations,

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,740
attributes and notifications.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,930
I'll first give you a quick overview, and then we'll do a demo again,

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,240
where we will use some of them.

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,510
First, the components for Working with J.

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,740
Maxx operations.

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,380
These are the operation invoking channel a matter on the

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,840
operation invoking Outbound Gateway.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,050
These error both message handlers that can receive messages

18
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,960
from a message channel and then called J M X operations based

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,340
on the messages that they receive.

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,770
The difference between the channel adapter and the gateway is

21
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,200
the same as the difference between channel adapters and gateways

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,240
in general inch ping integration,

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,450
which is that the channel that there is one way so it doesn't produce a

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,610
response message while the gateway can produce a response message containing

25
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,740
the result off the call to the J M X operation,

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,840
which can be sent to another message General Next Starter

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,640
Components for Working with J M X attributes.

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,880
These are the Attributes polling channel adapter and

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,540
the tree polling channel adapter.

30
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,800
Both of these components are message sources that you have to attach a poll

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,340
are two to produce messages to be sent to a message general.

32
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,610
That way you can, for example,

33
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,440
read the value of a J M X attributes at regular intervals.

34
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,040
The attribute polling channel adaptor reached the value of one specific J.

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,000
Maxx attribute,

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,240
while the tree polling adapter can read more data from J M X at once,

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,240
it reached the attributes off part of the tree off ambience and

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,940
put all that information into a single message.

39
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,240
Finally, there are components for working with J M X notifications.

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,580
The notification publishing channel Adaptor is a message hander that receives

41
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,440
messages from a channel and produces JPA Max notifications.

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,900
The notification listening channel adaptor does Thea a Pa's it.

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,980
It listens for J.

44
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:36,340
Maxx notifications and produces messages that it sends to a message General.

45
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,320
That's the quick overview offspring Integration J MX components to

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,050
quickly summarize them for working with J M X operations.

47
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,380
We have the operation invoking channel adaptor and operation invoking

48
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,510
Outbound Gateway for working with J M X attributes.

49
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,500
We have the attribute polling channel adapter and the tree

50
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,000
polling channel adapter and for working with J.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,360
Maxx notifications,

52
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,650
we have to notification publishing channel adaptor and a

53
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:13,000
notification listening channel adapter. Let's now see how we can use them in practice.
