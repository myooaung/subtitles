[Autogenerated] Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.280
My name is yes, very young and welcome to my course spring integration,

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.640
monitoring, system management and debugging.

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.190
I'm an independent software developer with a lot of experience

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.040
designing and building software with the spring framework.

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.950
When you want to create software that's ready for

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.830
mission critical operation in production,

8
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.800
then it's very important that you design and build it

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.740
with monitoring and management in mind.

10
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.370
This will help you greatly to quickly and effectively deal with

11
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.040
disturbances once your application is out there.

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.070
In this course,

13
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.460
we're going to explore the features that spring integration

14
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.290
provides to you as a developer for building software that can

15
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.250
be effectively managed in production.

16
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.940
Some off the major topics that will cover include managing

17
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.500
your application with spring Bootstrap curator using micro

18
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.740
meter to record application metrics,

19
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.260
managing and controlling your spring integration application via J M X and

20
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.040
using spring integration features for analyzying and debugging.

21
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.630
By the end of this course,

22
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.610
you will have the skills and knowledge offspring integrations,

23
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.710
monitoring management and debugging features needed to develop a

24
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.740
robust production radish spring integration solution.

25
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.590
Before beginning the course,

26
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.410
you should be familiar with the core spring framework and the basics.

27
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.570
Offspring integration.

28
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.220
From here,

29
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.620
you should feel comfortable diving to more advanced spring

30
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.840
framework and spring integration subjects.

31
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.430
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn more about spring

32
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:57.000
integration with the spring integration Monitoring System management and debugging course at Pluralsight.
