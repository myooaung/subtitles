[Autogenerated] When you want to learn how to swim,

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,080
you know you'll have to get into the water.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,940
And with yourself,

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,020
you don't really learn how to swim just by reading a

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,840
book or watching a presentation.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,920
The same thing goes for programming.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,260
So I highly recommend that you download the example code that goes along with

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,840
this course and work with it yourself on your own computer.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,350
You don't need a lot of software, and if you're Javadi helper,

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,370
you'll most likely already have all the tools you need.

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,940
But for completeness, I'll quickly mention the tools that you should have.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,140
First of all, you off course needed you have a development kit.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,730
You can download it from Oracle or from another provider,

14
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:48,410
such as Adopt Open JD Gay real use Jaedicke 11 for this course,

15
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,240
which is the current long term support version of Java.

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,560
All the examples in this course are may even projects.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,700
So to build them from the command line,

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,740
you'll need Apache may even you are free to choose your favorite i e.

19
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,840
I will be using IntelliJ IDEA.

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,740
Finally, we will use Docker in this course to run some software.

21
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,340
Docker is very convenient for software development as it enables you to run.

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,100
For example, database is email servers,

23
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,960
message brokers or whatever other software you need in a container so that

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,640
you don't have to install and manage it on your machine.

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,180
I'm running Ubuntu Linux on my machine,

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,040
but almost everything I'll show will work the same way on Windows or macOS.

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:43,000
If there are any operating system, specific differences for the demos, I'll mention them.
