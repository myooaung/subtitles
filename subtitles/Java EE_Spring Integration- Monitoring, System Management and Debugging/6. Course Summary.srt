00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,840
[Autogenerated] Now we are at the end of this course about monitoring system

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,940
management and debugging offspring integration applications.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,440
Before we finish, let me summarize what you've learned in this course.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,910
We started with a short recap off enterprise integration

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,840
patterns and spring integration messages,

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,440
message channels, message endpoints, message transformation and message routing.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,980
I explained the prerequsites and where this course fits in

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,730
with other courses in Pluralsight Library.

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,530
We took a moment to set up the software you needed to

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,940
follow along with the examples, and I introduced you to the demo application.

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,780
The first major topic that we discussed was how to monitor and

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,340
gather metrics for spring integration applications.

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,640
You've learned about spring Bootstrap, actuator and micro meter.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,480
We did a demo with Influx DB and Grafana to show you how

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,820
you can gather metrics in the Time series database and

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,640
visualized them in the dashboard.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,240
Next, we focused on managing and controlling spring integration applications.

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,740
You learn that spring integration provides a number of components that form a

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,840
bridge between the G M X and spring integration worlds.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,860
You also learn about the control,

21
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,260
bus pattern and spring integrations implementation off it and how you can shut

22
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,140
down in spring integration application in a controlled way.

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,840
Finally,

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,080
you've learned about the tools that are useful for analyzying

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,440
and debugging spring integration applications.

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,740
This is the end of the course.

27
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,280
I hope that you are found it interesting and useful and that it

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:49,000
has inspired you to build great software. And I wish you success with using Splain integration in your own projects.
