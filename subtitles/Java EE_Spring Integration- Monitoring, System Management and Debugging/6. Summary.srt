00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,380
[Autogenerated] you are now ready to dive in, but let's do a quick summary.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,740
First,

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,970
I refresh your mind about the most important enterprise integration patterns.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,390
Concepts, which are messages, message channels,

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,740
endpoints, transformation and routing.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,500
Spring integration provides implementations off these concepts,

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,140
which are ready for you to use in your own spring based applications.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,070
For this course,

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,670
I expect that your Javad developer and that you are already

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,460
familiar with the core spring framework and that you also know the

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,650
basics offspring integration to follow.

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,340
Along with the examples, you'll need a few tools.

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,250
Obviously, A J D K, A.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,070
Java IDE and Maven and Docker will be convenient for

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,640
running software like greenmail.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,920
I showed you the demo application that will start out with,

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,420
and you should be able to run it on your own machine.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,640
Now,

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,440
the first major subject that will work on is adding

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:09,000
features for monitoring and metrics. Let's see what that is all about in the next module
