00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.340
[Autogenerated] this course does not stand on its own.

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.560
It's part of the spring immigration learning path here at Pluralsight,

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.690
which contains a series, Of course,

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.640
is let's take a look at the prerequsites and see where this course fits in.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.540
First of all,

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.410
I assume that you are a Javadi developer and that you are

7
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.490
familiar with the spring framework in general and that you

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.400
also already know the basics.

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.440
Offspring Immigration.

10
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.980
If you are new to spring migration and enterprise integration

11
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.910
patterns or the spring framework in general,

12
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.840
then I recommend that you follow other courses first.

13
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.110
If you are new to the spring framework,

14
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.140
then there is a core spring learning path available on Pluralsight,

15
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.190
which contains courses that cover many aspects off

16
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.650
the spring framework for beginners,

17
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.340
as well as for intermediate and advanced learners.

18
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.880
To follow this course,

19
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.420
you don't need to be an expert in everything that

20
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.440
the spring framework has to offer,

21
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.640
but it is important that you understand the core concepts.

22
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.740
It also helps if you know something about spring boot and spring data.

23
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.240
JPA a.

24
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.160
I also highly recommend that you follow my course,

25
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.770
bring immigration getting started before following this

26
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.880
course in the getting started course, you will learn the basics,

27
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.840
offspring integration and enterprise integration patterns,

28
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.440
which is knowledge that you will need for this course.

29
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.130
Of course,

30
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.770
there are more courses in the spring integration learning

31
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.590
path that you might want to follow.

32
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.840
If you want to learn more about spring integration,

33
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.660
for example,

34
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.200
you can take a look at spring Integration Message System Designed

35
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.270
Patterns By Stephen Haines At the end of this course,

36
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.170
and with the knowledge you gain from the other courses on spring integration,

37
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.950
you will be ready to design and implement your own

38
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.900
spring immigration applications,

39
00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:01.000
and you'll know how to AD FS features for monitoring, controlling and debugging that are important for production ready applications.
