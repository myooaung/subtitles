[Autogenerated] in this module,

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,340
you've learned about a few useful tools that spring integration

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,240
provides for analyzying and debugging integration flows.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,530
We've looked at the wiretap and message store patterns,

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,740
which we've used in a demo where restored the incoming

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,640
registration messages in a Mongo DB database.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,930
Even though the Enterprise Integration Patterns book describes the

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,670
message store pattern as a way for reporting on messages,

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,670
spring integration uses it in a more general way as the backing

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,240
store for components that can buffer messages.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,580
We also looked at how you can enable message history,

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,940
which will cause all messages to have a history had at it.

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,140
This will show exactly which path a message has

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:54,000
taken through the integration flow, which is often very useful information for analyzying problems.
