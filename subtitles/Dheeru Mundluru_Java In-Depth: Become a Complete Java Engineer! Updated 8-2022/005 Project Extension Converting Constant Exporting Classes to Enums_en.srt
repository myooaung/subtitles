1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,650
Hi there.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,490
This is the de la.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,710
And welcome back.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,900
Now it's time to extend our project.

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,350
In our project, we use few constant exporting classes.

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,320
Book John Ray and movie John Ray are two examples.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,290
Now that we know the advantages of enemies, let's go ahead and convert those classes into enemies.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,760
So this is a three year project.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,510
Source.

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,710
And here we have the constants.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,800
So there are five constant exporting classes.

12
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:37,480
Now this is book genre, gender, and for three of them kid friendly status, movie genre and user type.

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,840
I have already converted them into enemies, so we will take a quick look at them.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,690
But first, let's go ahead and convert these into enemies.

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,350
And these three are also very similar to them.

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,480
But we will still take a quick look at them.

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,530
So first, let's look at book genre.

18
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,810
Here is the book genre.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,100
Let me do a control shift G just to see where it is accessed from.

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,500
Now book genre.

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,790
So let me go ahead and just make it into Enum.

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:11,210
So the first thing here has to be the enum constants and these are the constants, so we need to convert

23
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,660
them.

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,540
So first, let's knock this off.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,950
From here.

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,820
Let's replace all.

27
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,120
Have.

28
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,180
Open parenthesis.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's be smart about it.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,230
So we are done with that.

31
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,890
Now.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,530
Let's take this piece.

33
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:52,710
Okay.

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,760
Let's do that.

35
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,710
Replace all.

36
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,560
The only thing is, we need to convert this.

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,700
This.

38
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,350
So we are done with that piece.

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,330
So those are the constants.

40
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,210
This needs to be double codes.

41
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,150
Okay.

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,220
So that's it.

43
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,960
And here, let's call it name.

44
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,150
So that's the actual name.

45
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,270
And let's introduce a private variable.

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,710
And let's have a better.

47
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,410
That's it.

48
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,150
So we are done with this.

49
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,090
Okay.

50
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,790
So now let's go ahead and make our changes.

51
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,030
Here is one.

52
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,370
So this is book John Drake's philosophy.

53
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,580
This is the kid friendly, eligible method.

54
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,080
And here we have this variable genre.

55
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,150
So let's see.

56
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,380
It should be a string.

57
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,690
So we are now supposed to convert this.

58
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,300
So this is a book, class book to Java.

59
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:28,660
Okay.

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,670
So let's go ahead.

61
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,760
And so it's one of the entities make it.

62
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:34,710
John.

63
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,560
See.

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,340
This is.

65
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,270
Genre and setter.

66
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,250
Butch Andre.

67
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,710
So we are good with this.

68
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,920
Now here.

69
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,010
So this is the create book method.

70
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,230
So let's go here.

71
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,530
So in the create book.

72
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,640
So this is book genre.

73
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,890
And this has to be John Right.

74
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,200
So this is in a bookmark manager class.

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,660
So there is this method called create book.

76
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,210
Which creates instances of book.

77
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,520
John Ray.

78
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,330
Okay.

79
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,820
So that's imported.

80
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,770
No.

81
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,420
Now here there is some compilation error in the data store.

82
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,630
So let's go here.

83
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,010
It's load box.

84
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,380
So here we are passing.

85
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,580
This is the one.

86
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,670
So here we are.

87
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,870
Here we are loading.

88
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,510
So this is the data store class and we are loading the books.

89
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,750
And if you recall, we were loading the data from the file.

90
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,480
And let's open that file here.

91
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,510
So here is the genre.

92
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,320
So the genre is here and it's a string.

93
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,560
And in the datastore class we are reading that and we are passing that string.

94
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,830
But the method is expecting a book genre that is the enum type.

95
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,120
So we need to convert this into that.

96
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,120
So one thing is we can make use of.

97
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,580
The value of method.

98
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:43,240
And we know that the value of method takes the name of the enum constant and returns the enum constant.

99
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,380
Now.

100
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,790
But the problem here is.

101
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,450
If you look at this.

102
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,790
The name that we have here is it has the title case.

103
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,780
So it's philosophy.

104
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,510
But the P is in caps.

105
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,750
But here.

106
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,010
Philosophy is in all caps.

107
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,360
So in the value of method, it would be expecting this.

108
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,830
Now we have these values and these values are mainly used for for let's say, for display purpose.

109
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,040
But the actual constant name is this.

110
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,600
And it is better to represent the name, the name over here.

111
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,970
And the when we are reading this data, it's better to represent it using this name.

112
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,690
So this is the name of the constant as it is declared.

113
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,200
And this one is just for the display purpose or for for some other purpose, mostly for display purpose

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,070
in the UI.

115
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:47,090
But this is the actual internal representation, because if we use this name, it's going it's not going

116
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,310
to return the constant.

117
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,540
It will throw some some exception.

118
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,730
So only if we pass this value, then it would work.

119
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,300
So let's just make that change here.

120
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,980
Let's call it philosophy.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,560
This is also a philosophy.

122
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,340
And the fourth one is technical.

123
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,110
Fourth and fifth are technical.

124
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,570
So let's go ahead and do that.

125
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,300
Okay.

126
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,710
So that's the thing.

127
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,380
Now, let's go ahead and just run this.

128
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,200
Since we made this change, I don't think there are any other compilation errors.

129
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,200
So it's loading the data from the files.

130
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,270
And it's also doing bookmarking.

131
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,880
So I hope you'll recall how the how the soft how the application is working.

132
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,480
So we are done with that.

133
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:55,090
So we have successfully converted book genre from a class into Enum and we know the benefits of Enum

134
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,390
and it's good to have Enum.

135
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,340
Now let's go ahead here.

136
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,140
This is gender.

137
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,500
Let's do the same thing.

138
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,040
But here it is using this value of zero.

139
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,730
It's an int value, so zero, one and two.

140
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,160
So we will also do the same thing and we will have a new constructor here.

141
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,920
So first, let me remove this.

142
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,240
Let's make this enum.

143
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,930
So here we have semicolon.

144
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,040
It's needed.

145
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,390
Let's call it as value.

146
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,510
Here it is.

147
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,650
Load users.

148
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,510
So this is type mismatch.

149
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:23,790
Okay.

150
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,100
This is this has to be gender.

151
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,810
Now we are good.

152
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:33,770
Okay.

153
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,860
Create user.

154
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,280
The should accept.

155
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,730
Gender.

156
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,460
So it was an internal pattern.

157
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,540
Now.

158
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,800
Importing it.

159
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,570
And this.

160
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,330
As a user.

161
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,680
No, Java also has to be changed.

162
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,710
This guitar also has to change.

163
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,890
Okay.

164
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:15,790
So that's it.

165
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,310
So let me just rerun this.

166
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,310
Just to make sure that it's working fine.

167
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,030
And it is working fine.

168
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,090
So we are done with that.

169
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,540
So I have done the same thing for movie genre too.

170
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,000
So this is the movie genre.

171
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,390
It's already converted to Enum.

172
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,010
And these are all the things.

173
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,250
These are all the enum constants.

174
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:48,060
And just like book genre, we have this constructor which is taking name and we have the name here and

175
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,940
we are having a getter just like the book genre.

176
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,990
So four movies also we are reading from this file.

177
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,770
So it has been changed into the constant names here.

178
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,850
So this is the only change from what we have seen earlier in the earlier demo of the project.

179
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:14,980
So I'm going to upload these four files that we file and the book file in the resources section, and

180
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,200
we also have the user type here.

181
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,250
Here it is.

182
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:25,540
So that's also converted to enum and it also uses these values and user dot text from where we are reading.

183
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,160
The data is also changed to user user editor.

184
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,060
So these are the enum names.

185
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:39,580
And the one other thing was this kid friendly status and that has been changed to get friendly status

186
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,710
and then the variable name is still name.

187
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,480
So wherever there is name, we are just having it as a name and get a name.

188
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,390
So that's about it.

189
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,790
And so go ahead and make these changes.

190
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,560
And when you convert them into enemies, you will definitely see some compilation errors.

191
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,360
So you can go ahead and fix them just as we have fixed for book genre.

192
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,830
Book gender and gender.

193
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,480
It will be pretty straightforward.

194
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,780
You just need to keep changing the types from int or string into the corresponding enum type.

195
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,360
That's about right.

196
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,690
And thank you and happy coding.
