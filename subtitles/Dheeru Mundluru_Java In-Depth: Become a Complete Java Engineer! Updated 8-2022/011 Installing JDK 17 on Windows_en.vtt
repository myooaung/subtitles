00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.540
Hello there.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.690
This is De de La Rue.

3
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.710
And welcome back.

4
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.580
In this lecture, we will look at how we can install the latest version of Java on a Windows operating

5
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.060
system.

6
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.450
If you're using some other operating system, then you can skip this lecture and view the lecture corresponding

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.890
to that particular operating system, which should be one of the follow up lectures.

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.910
Demo in this lecture is shown on a Windows ten operating system, and the process would be very similar

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.400
on other Windows operating systems.

10
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.190
Now this demo involves two parts.

11
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.040
In the first part, we will install the latest version of Java, which is very easy.

12
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.590
And in the second part we will set an environment variable called path and that is needed if we have

13
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.970
to use the different development tools that come with the JDK.

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.050
So we are going to get into the details, a lot of detail configuration details and it is very important

15
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.780
to be aware of them as a good engineer.

16
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.990
It's not enough if you just install and start writing programs.

17
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.630
So we need to be aware of the configuration details like the pattern environment variable.

18
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.670
So let's just get started.

19
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.500
Search for JDK download and the first link is from Oracle and here are the Java downloads these versions.

20
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.500
If we are learning, then we can use them here.

21
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.560
We can use these installations that JDK installations, but you cannot use them for commercial purpose.

22
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.260
If you want to use for commercial purpose, you will have to pay.

23
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.500
But for learning it is fine and this is what we are going to use.

24
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.190
But if you want to use a completely free version for commercial purposes too, then we need to use the

25
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.790
open JDK as mentioned earlier for that.

26
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.810
Just search for open JDK download and here is the link.

27
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.770
You can click this one and here in the downloads.

28
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.060
The latest version as of today is Java 17.

29
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.710
So we just click that and download the zip version and you would just unzip and extract the folder and

30
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.910
you will have to store it on your file system and we will see where it needs to be done.

31
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.940
But for this demo we are not going to do this.

32
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.300
We will use the version from the Oracle website.

33
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.060
So JDK 17 has been released very recently.

34
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.300
So this is the web page, the downloads web page on Oracle.

35
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.730
So this is Java 17 and here it says that it is Lta's.

36
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.620
Ltsc stands for long term support.

37
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.430
So this particular Java 17 release is called as a long term support release and it will be supported

38
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.140
for almost eight years.

39
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.990
So if there are any bugs, then they will have new releases, new updates which will fix those bugs.

40
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.780
So that way it is supported for a long time and hence it's called as a long term support release.

41
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.370
The last long term support release was Java 11 and all the releases in between were non ltas.

42
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.370
So they were being released once every six months and they would be supported for only six months.

43
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.220
So here we have these three different versions.

44
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.680
So this is the latest version.

45
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.420
And when you are viewing this particular lecture, if you are seeing a different version, go ahead

46
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.700
and install the latest version that you see.

47
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.710
And the UI might also be different, but you should be able to get to the latest version.

48
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.630
Now, let me just scroll down here.

49
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.770
So here we have Java 16, Java 11, which is the previous LPs on Java eight two.

50
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.330
Now if you are using a 32 bit OS, which means that you are using an old machine, then you cannot install

51
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.400
any of the recent releases.

52
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.780
The last recent release that you can install is Java eight.

53
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.490
So that is that 32 bit OS and Java eight in general is good for this course because when this course

54
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.340
was first developed, Java eight was the latest release.

55
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.070
And so most of the programs will work with Java eight.

56
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.330
But the thing with Java, with Java is they ensure that the recent releases are backward compatible.

57
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.930
So if you install Java 17, then the programs that are compiled with Java eight will also run on that.

58
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.390
So backward compatibility is a very important priority and they guarantee that.

59
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.519
Now here Java eight, let me click that and there are the different operating systems.

60
00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.750
Let me click on Windows.

61
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.660
So if yours is 32 bit, then you need to install this particular installer.

62
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.020
So you would click that you would download and when you double click it you would just follow the instructions

63
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.730
and it would be very straightforward.

64
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.430
So for 64 bit you would use this one.

65
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.950
Now if you are not sure whether you are using 64 bit or 32 bit, then we can easily find out.

66
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.790
If you're using an older machine, it would be 32, but it can be 32 bit.

67
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.170
So here under search, just search for system here.

68
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.250
So system here, this is the best match.

69
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.790
So in this particular screen, it says system type 64 bit operating system.

70
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.170
So that's mine.

71
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:10.320
But if yours is 32 bit, we'll show us 32 bit operating system and you will have to download that 32

72
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.980
bit version.

73
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.660
All right, so let's go back and.

74
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.300
Under Java 17 click on Windows and here.

75
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.120
So these are the this is the zip file and these are the two installers.

76
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.490
Just go for this x 64 installer, so download it and you can just execute it.

77
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.050
So I have already downloaded this one, so I'm just going to execute it.

78
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.230
Now in some older versions of Java release, they might ask you to create an account, so just go ahead

79
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.700
and create an account for Oracle, give your user email and password and then you can download.

80
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.850
But that's only for certain releases.

81
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.680
So I have already downloaded.

82
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.240
Just go ahead and do that.

83
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.200
So in my case here it is under downloads.

84
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.010
Just double click this one and hit the yes.

85
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.100
So this is the installation with that next.

86
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:15.800
So it says that it is JDK 1764 bit includes a private jetty and it's just a jetty within the development

87
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.100
kit with the folder and it includes the source code and it requires this much space and it is being

88
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.390
installed here.

89
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.650
So that's the standard location program files Java.

90
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.230
And within that this folder called JDK 17 gets created.

91
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.430
So you can just leave it as this.

92
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.140
And that's less than 30 seconds close.

93
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.080
Now, this was the open JDK that I downloaded.

94
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.560
Even here, if I double click it, it shows the JDK 17.

95
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.090
I can just copy it to that location, which which I have just shown under program files.

96
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.620
Java.

97
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.880
So you can just copy that.

98
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.230
But since we are not using that so we don't have to worry about this.

99
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.750
Now, let me minimize this.

100
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.250
Let's go ahead and look at what we have in JDK 17 folder.

101
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.080
So here it is under C Drive Program Files.

102
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.470
Let me click on See.

103
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.390
So this is program files.

104
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:20.450
If you are installing 32 bit for 32 bit, then it goes under program files x 86.

105
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.000
There you will see a folder called Java and within that you will see the JDK that you have downloaded

106
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.830
for 32 bit, but for 64 bit.

107
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:33.120
Here it is, program files, java and it got installed here.

108
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:41.120
So this is the directory of my JDK and I already have JDK 11 and JDK eight.

109
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.280
So let me click here.

110
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.000
So it has these let's go into bin folder.

111
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.500
So that's where we will have all of the executables, like the Java compiler, Java interpreter and

112
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.380
all the development tools that we need.

113
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.580
So here we have let me show you Java here.

114
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.910
So that's for compiling our programs.

115
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.720
Then there is the Java interpreter.

116
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.310
So this is another executable.

117
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.230
So that is for running our programs.

118
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.140
Java P is for it's called as a disk assembler.

119
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:20.930
If you want to look at the Java bytecode that your compiler generates, your compiler generates a dot

120
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.970
class file which has the Java bytecode.

121
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.280
If you want to examine that, you would use this tool.

122
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.600
Then the Jar tool is used for packaging your software.

123
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.640
So once you have the software, you can create something called as a jar file.

124
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:39.380
So that's a unit of release and that jar file, you can give it to your clients or partners.

125
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.510
So that's the Jar tool.

126
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:47.510
So these are all the development tools that you have here in the directory.

127
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.700
So now let me go ahead.

128
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.700
And so that's all there is to installation, but we need to set the path also.

129
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.890
So click search for CMD, the command prompt.

130
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.120
So the terminal on windows here.

131
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:05.990
So let me type in Java and version.

132
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:11.540
So this will execute the Java executable that we have here.

133
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.500
It uses that.

134
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.060
It says Java 17 is the latest version.

135
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.350
So similarly, if you say Java minus version, Java is the interpreter.

136
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.320
So it still gives the same information.

137
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.490
On both of these are here inside the Bing directory.

138
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:35.490
Now if you say Java P hyphen version, then it's not working.

139
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.270
C although java p is under bean here.

140
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.220
For this.

141
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.850
It's not recognizing, but for the other two commands it is doing it.

142
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:53.520
So that's because in the later releases, in the recent releases of Java, the environment variable

143
00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:03.540
is being edited by the installer because we used an installer and it is copying the location for only

144
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.420
these two executables and I will show you that.

145
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:13.170
But for this we need to set the reset the path environment variable and that's the next thing that we

146
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:13.950
are going to do.

147
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.250
So let's go ahead and do that.

148
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:23.610
So to set the environment variables, what you can do is just search for system here.

149
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.000
So this is the one which we have done already.

150
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.360
We have because in order to see whether we are using a 32 bit OS or 64 bit OS, we have done that.

151
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.920
So that screen is here.

152
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.200
So in the screen, just click on this thing called Advanced System Settings.

153
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.830
Right.

154
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.190
Now here we are under the advanced tab.

155
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.590
So we clicked on the advanced system settings.

156
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.930
It opens this window called system properties and we are inside this advanced.

157
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.340
Here we have environment variables.

158
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.530
Click on that.

159
00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.470
Now there are two sections here user variables for view and system variables.

160
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.550
So we can set it here or we can set it here.

161
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.500
If you set it here, it will be applicable only for this particular user who is using it.

162
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.890
And that is my account, which is zero.

163
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:19.560
But if it needs to be you set for all the users who are going to use this machine, then it needs to

164
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.420
go under system variables and I prefer to do it here, so we will do it here.

165
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:29.880
But the first thing I will do is before editing, you can see here the path environment variable.

166
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.050
It's also here.

167
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:38.730
But here what we are going to do is we will also add another environment variable called Java underscore.

168
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:46.470
It's called as Java underscore home and it's the root directory of where Java was installed and it will

169
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.590
be clear why that is needed here.

170
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.670
It's not here.

171
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.290
So we need to create a new one.

172
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:58.120
So just hit new button and we will say Java underscore home.

173
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:04.290
So we need to give the location of this Java underscore home and we know where it got installed.

174
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:08.490
So it was installed in Java and JDK 17.

175
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.420
So just click here in this address bar.

176
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:20.940
You will, you will see this path just say control C and go back to system settings and plug it as a

177
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.140
value for this.

178
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:27.000
So this is your home directory for Java or the root directory of Java.

179
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.710
So this is where it has been installed.

180
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:29.610
Click.

181
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.420
Okay.

182
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.500
Now for Pat, click on path here.

183
00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.060
Click on Edit.

184
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:44.190
So the environment variable has all of these different values, so they are all actually internally

185
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.320
separated by semicolon.

186
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.550
So these are the paths and we need to add a new one.

187
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:59.400
And that new one would have to point to this JDK 17 and the bin folder because this is where we have

188
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.410
all the executables like the Java ACC, Java, Java, P and so on.

189
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.770
So it needs to be here.

190
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.250
So here now.

191
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.990
So we need to create a new one.

192
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.810
So just say new here.

193
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:24.400
Instead of copying that entire path, what we will do is we'll just say percentage Java, underscore

194
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.850
home percentage slash bin.

195
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:34.120
So what this is going to do is we already have the Java underscore home environment variable which we

196
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:34.960
have just set.

197
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:41.890
And because of using these percentage symbols here, it will act as a placeholder and it will take the

198
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.980
value of that and it will copy it here.

199
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.840
And we can also or we can copy the entire path, but we can just do that.

200
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:55.570
So this Java underscore home environment variable is acting as a placeholder here.

201
00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:02.080
Now the next thing I want to do and important thing is to click on this move up button.

202
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.320
But this, this.

203
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.590
To the very top.

204
00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.420
So among all the parts so this is the part.

205
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:11.840
This is the first part.

206
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:18.800
Now, what happened earlier was we you can recall that, you know, it worked on the command prompt.

207
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.750
It worked for Java Sea and Java Java Command, but not for Java.

208
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:32.600
P And the reason for that is the installer actually edited this pattern environment variable and added

209
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.320
this thing.

210
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:41.780
And here in this location, it made a copy of Java, Java and a couple of other executables, but not

211
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.300
the Java IP, the Java executable.

212
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.960
So let me just show you that location.

213
00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.700
So it is also under program files, common files here.

214
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:58.820
This there is this oracle and then click on Java and here there is Java part.

215
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:06.290
So here are the different executables that it copied from the JDK 17 directory.

216
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.270
So it has only a few of them.

217
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:12.860
And that was the reason it worked for Java and Java C, but it did not work for Java P.

218
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.870
So this is a burn.

219
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:19.210
This happens only from Java 11 onwards, I believe.

220
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.570
But if you are using an older version, then you will not see this.

221
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.620
So which means that you must set a pattern environment variable.

222
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.420
It's only from Java.

223
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.040
11 onwards it started.

224
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.010
They started to do this so that.

225
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.610
So this is the path and it would have the latest version.

226
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.170
So we want to.

227
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.990
So this is something that we have set manually.

228
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.540
Say, for instance, you have installed Java 17, so you will have those things here.

229
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:55.010
Then if you want to use Java eight, which you have also installed, then you would have to you need

230
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.770
this and it needs to be the first one.

231
00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:04.220
Otherwise what happens is for some of the executables, it will use this part and since this will come

232
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:11.600
later, if you did not move it to the front and it is for some other executables like the Java it would

233
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.560
pick from here.

234
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.010
So it is picking the executables from two different installations.

235
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.120
So the best thing is this is one this is the one that we want to use.

236
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.880
So just we will move it here and click.

237
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.600
Okay.

238
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.320
Now, one thing I want to mention here is so I clicked on path and I clicked on edit and we have seen

239
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.040
that screen.

240
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:37.790
Now if you are using Windows seven, it will not show this, but it will show a different screen where

241
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:44.870
all of these paths will be shown in one box and they will be separated by semicolons, in which case

242
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:49.130
you would have to go into the front of the path and add this one.

243
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.590
Maybe it would look something.

244
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.630
Yea, it would look something like this.

245
00:16:54.350 --> 00:17:00.770
So you would go in the friend like I have clicked home and you would add this followed by semicolon.

246
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.530
So that's for Windows seven.

247
00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:05.720
So let me click.

248
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.980
Okay, once again.

249
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.750
So Java underscore home has been created, path has been edited.

250
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.819
Now one of the thing is Java underscore home acted as an placeholder.

251
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.839
But there are some tools like Tomcat.

252
00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:26.900
If you know, Tomcat is a web server for Tomcat to start the Tomcat Web server, it will also use Java,

253
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.060
underscore home environment variable.

254
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.130
Just to start it, we need that.

255
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.920
So Java underscore home environment variable is also useful outside of Java.

256
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:43.970
Now here, so we have this environment and the command prompt and but we made some changes in the environment

257
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:44.750
variable.

258
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:50.750
Now for those environment variables, they will not be reflected in this particular command prompt.

259
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.880
So we need to open a new prompt.

260
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.650
So always remember that.

261
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.120
And if you are doing this with me, make sure your opening.

262
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.340
A new command prompt.

263
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.520
Now, Jack, as usual.

264
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.660
It should work.

265
00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:15.010
Now the other one, which did not work earlier, is Java, P and Java will also work.

266
00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:16.720
Okay.

267
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.880
As you can see, all of these have been set.

268
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.720
Right.

269
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.860
So the.

270
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:27.410
So the command prompt is looking at the pattern environment variable and it is looking at that first

271
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:33.230
part which we edited, which we added, and it is able to look at all of these executables.

272
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:41.030
Now, one important thing I want to mention is so here Java underscore home is here and Patty's here.

273
00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.890
Just make sure that both of these are here or both of these are here.

274
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:52.520
If you put Java underscore home over here and Path is edited here, then it's not going to work.

275
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:58.820
So both of these have to be here or here, and my recommendation is to add them here.

276
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.160
So that's that.

277
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:08.450
So now if you want to switch it to Java 11, because I already have Java 11, let me also show you that

278
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.260
and Java.

279
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.080
So this is what I have.

280
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.290
So let me click that to change it.

281
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.180
All we need to do is go back.

282
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.770
Environment variables.

283
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.270
Click on Java, underscore home, click edit this time because it's already there.

284
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.810
So this one has to be changed to JDK 11.

285
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.190
All right.

286
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.260
Okay.

287
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.060
We need to open a new command prompt now.

288
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:38.870
And now if I say Java hyphen version, it will give us Java 11.

289
00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.570
So that's what it is.

290
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.120
So it got installed here.

291
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:46.500
Right.

292
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.630
We have these three different versions now.

293
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.380
If you want to uninstall, what you can do is over here.

294
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.660
Search for control panel.

295
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.440
Here it is.

296
00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:03.830
And under control panel, we have this call, this link called Uninstall a Program.

297
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:09.070
And if you're here, you can see that I have Java eight, Java 11 and Java 17.

298
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:16.970
Click on Java 17 and say Uninstall and it will get uninstalled in just a few seconds.

299
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.930
It's gone.

300
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.960
And I already mentioned about the open JDK, which you can unzip.

301
00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.460
You can take this Java 17 and you can copy it.

302
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:34.340
To this particular path where we have all the Java installations.

303
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.980
So that's open JDK.

304
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.310
Now the final thing that I want to show is.

305
00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.650
Because some of you might be using Java eight.

306
00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:52.450
So as mentioned in one of the earlier lectures until Java ten, the Java platform was also providing

307
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.710
this thing called as public.

308
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.930
So this is called as a public git.

309
00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:02.320
So when you install, you get this JDK just like JDK 11 or JDK 17.

310
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:08.320
But additionally, they will also provide this JIRA, which could be used by some other programs like

311
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:08.860
a browser.

312
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.130
If it has Java, it can make use of this.

313
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:17.440
This continued from Java 11 onwards and within JDK also.

314
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.020
So this is the private Giri.

315
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:25.090
So this Private Giri, if I click here, there is this folder called LEP.

316
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:26.800
And here.

317
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.360
So this is JDK eight.

318
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.490
There is this thing called as Arti Jha.

319
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:38.620
Art stands for runtime and it's a jar file and that has most of the Java library classes.

320
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:47.710
I'm showing you this because this art jar is there in JDK eight, but it has been removed from JDK nine.

321
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:53.770
And from JDK nine onwards, they use this thing called as feature called Java module system.

322
00:21:54.160 --> 00:22:00.010
So they changed the entire layout and this article has been removed.

323
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.130
It's just that it is packaged in a different way.

324
00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.840
They call it as modules.

325
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.070
So that's the thing.

326
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.360
So you wouldn't see this private jar.

327
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.370
It is there.

328
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.590
It is just that it has been laid out in a different way.

329
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:19.960
So if you go into JDK 11, you will not see that private jar is there, but our PT jar is not there.

330
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:27.460
It's just that those files in our PT jar, the Java Library, have been packaged in a different way.

331
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:35.470
So no article from Java nine and no public Java from Java 11 onwards.

332
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.390
So that's a lot of information and good information that you need to know.

333
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.560
But using just the JDK 17 is very easy.

334
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:48.730
As we have seen, we installed it and we have set the path environment variable and we opened a new

335
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:54.040
command prompt and we can see the changes we made and we can compile and run our programs.

336
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.660
So that's about it.

337
00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.000
Thank you and see you in the next lecture.
