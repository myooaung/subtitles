00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:07.230
So we look at the demand through your system not let's get started with the work history.

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.260
Let's begin by looking at the different types of users that the system supports along with what those

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.780
users can do.

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.030
There are groups of users.

5
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:22.110
One is the regular user and the other is a staff member a regular user is the one who simply uses a

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.570
system for bookmarking like the one we have seen in our Demel.

7
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.430
Staff members are part of our company and they have all the privileges of a regular user but they can

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.960
also have some additional capabilities.

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.050
So let's review the capabilities of both these types of users Just type of user is the regular user

10
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.360
.

11
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.370
And let's look at the capabilities to this class diagram.

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.210
So you are using the methods in the class diagram to describe the user's capabilities not that class

13
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.870
diagrams.

14
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.450
Simply describe the classes that make up a software on a class diagram is a human concept and gives

15
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.410
you don't know what you are Melas it stands for unified modeling language and it is used to visualize

16
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.410
the design office system.

17
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.720
So he you to have a regular user who can bookmark an item since trillionaire lost three types of items

18
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.900
to be a mugger.

19
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.720
We have a separate method for bookmarking each one of those items.

20
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.300
That is same web link same more we unsavable.

21
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.770
Additionally a user can also rate bookmark a user can also review a particular bookmark.

22
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.270
However the review will not be published on the Web site until it is approved by one of the editorial

23
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.040
staff members.

24
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.860
Next type of user is an email administrator who is a staff member email admin can do everything a regular

25
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.120
user does.

26
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.430
Hence you can see that email admin has all the methods that a user has.

27
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.410
Methods that are unique to email admin are emphasized in green.

28
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.540
You can see the most posted a view is also shown in green.

29
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.770
All the user class has that.

30
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.780
And that's because email admins posted a few works slightly differently.

31
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.760
Unlike user email admin does not need any approval for posting a review email admin also has a new method

32
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.500
called handle mail campaign to periodically rants email campaigns with large numbers of emails are sent

33
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.050
out to its users.

34
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.870
And sometimes these email campaigns might get stuck and it would be the responsibility of image admin

35
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.730
to fix the issue.

36
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.420
So this new method is related to handling of such problematic email campaigns.

37
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.510
Next type of user is a continuity teacher who is also the staff member unlet email admin a continuity

38
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.700
there can also do everything a regular user does and does not need any approval for posting a review

39
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.170
.

40
00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.200
Additionally Khond continued results are responsible for approving and rejecting reviews posted by regular

41
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.180
users so use the separate methods for both these activities.

42
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.960
If a review is rejected then it will not show up on the website.

43
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.810
Continuity itor is not responsible for handling problematic email campaigns and hence you don't see

44
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.020
a method for that.

45
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.670
Undefined final type of user is a chief content editor who is also a staff member.

46
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.770
It Chief Content Editor can do everything a content editor does and in addition is also responsible

47
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.230
for managing the homepage content that is he or she decides what goes on the homepage.

48
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.730
Most recently book martyrdoms are the ones that go on the homepage hollower some of the book martyrdoms

49
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.090
may not be appropriate to be shown on the homepage unswitched Chief Content Editor acts as a moderator

50
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.490
and makes the final judgment on what can be pushed on to the homepage.

51
00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:03.200
So basically a chief editor can do everything as a regular user does and also everything a content or

52
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.250
network can do.

53
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.720
And that's about it for now.

54
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.920
And it would help us to get started the next chapter.

55
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.620
New features will be introduced later as we learn some more topics.

56
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.550
Thank you.
