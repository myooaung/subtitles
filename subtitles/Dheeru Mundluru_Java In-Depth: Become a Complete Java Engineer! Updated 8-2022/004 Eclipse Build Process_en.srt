1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello there.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,160
This is De La Rue.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,100
And welcome back.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,010
Let's look at something called build process.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:15,300
A build process is, simply put, the process of translating our source code into compile code.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,420
And that's nothing but the compilation process.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:26,850
In the last lecture, we saw that this compilation process was happening automatically and instantaneously.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:34,320
We saw that as soon as we were saving our source code, that source code was getting automatically compiled.

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,450
So that's the build process.

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,180
And even before we were using Eclipse, we were doing this build process.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,820
Only thing was, it was very tedious.

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,760
We had to open our command prompt and we had to execute the Java command manually.

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:58,260
So that was very tedious because every time we made our changes in the source code, we had to execute

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,310
the Java command.

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,780
But with Eclipse, it is being done automatically and that's the cool feature of using an ID.

16
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,360
So in this lecture we are going to learn about Bell Process.

17
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:19,790
Now, before doing that, we will also discuss about how to use multiple versions of Java with an eclipse,

18
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,340
and that will lead us into understanding Bell process.

19
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:31,190
And we are going to learn about a few concepts around Bell process, like the Bell Path and something

20
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,390
called Bell Tool.

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,010
So let's go ahead and get started.

22
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,120
So this is the Hello World Program.

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,860
We were using Java 14, so because I had Java 14 here.

24
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,790
Now let's go ahead and add an interface.

25
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,970
We still did not discuss interface, but interface is something like class and it will be discussed

26
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,590
later.

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,210
But for the sake of this discussion, let's go ahead and create an interface.

28
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:04,530
So this is the Eclipse Test Project and this is the Eclipse Test package which has this dot java file.

29
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,530
Hello, world class.

30
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,479
So within the same package, let's create an interface.

31
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,310
So I have right clicked on the package eclipse test and new.

32
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,380
And here we have this thing interface right beneath the class.

33
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,560
So click on that.

34
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,500
Let's just name it as test I for interface just to keep it simple.

35
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:32,290
And here in the interface, let's add something called a private method.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,110
Private methods are allowed in interfaces only from Java nine onwards.

37
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:43,420
So that's an let's just call it as a test with an empty body.

38
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,160
So that's that.

39
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:51,520
So this is there from Java nine and since we are using Java 14, so there are no issues in terms of

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,390
compensation.

41
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,090
Now let's assume that this is your you have let's assume that you have just joined a company and this

42
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,340
is some test code that you're writing.

43
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:07,000
But let's assume the company itself is using an older version of Java, and let's assume they're using

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,310
Java eight, which means that you also have to use Java eight for your projects.

45
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,050
So let's go ahead and install Java within this eclipse.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,380
So for that, just go into Windows.

47
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,200
So we are going to add.

48
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,630
Java eight into this.

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,540
So here we have all of these options.

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,060
Just click on Java here, drill down and there is this option called installed git.

51
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,220
So here we can see the JDK 14, which is already there.

52
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,500
So this is what is being used for launching Eclipse two.

53
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,990
So here we are going to add a new one.

54
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,560
So click on Add here standard VM.

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,620
Just see next and we need to select our JDK.

56
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,960
So click on directory.

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,910
Now, here I am.

58
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:03,680
In my C dry program files Java and this is where I have all of these different Java versions.

59
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,870
So I'm going to select this JDK 1.8.

60
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:16,410
There is also Java eight, but I'm going to select this JDK 1.8 here folder and next thing is hit finish.

61
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,370
It got added.

62
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:23,170
Now select this one JDK 1.8 instead of JDK 14.

63
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,150
Now say apply.

64
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:33,580
Now here it says by default the check git, which is nothing but this one is added to the build path

65
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,370
of newly created Java projects.

66
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,130
Build path is something I'm going to discuss in a bit, but it is essentially the class path.

67
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:48,520
But the key here is it says it's going to be added to the build path of newly created Java projects.

68
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,310
So this is an existing project.

69
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,040
So this will apply only for new projects.

70
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,540
That's what this message says.

71
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,990
So that is done.

72
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,030
Now, another thing that we need to do is this is installed git.

73
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,420
Now right here we have something called compiler.

74
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:13,540
So here we need to specify that we want to compile using a compiler compliance level of eight because

75
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,190
right now it is using 14.

76
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,860
So which means that it is using like a Java compiler which comes with Java 14.

77
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:28,750
But we want to use this 11.8 because that's the Java version that which that we just installed that

78
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,710
we just added.

79
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,160
But the thing to remember is this compiler that Eclipse is using is a different compiler.

80
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,150
It uses its own compiler called Eclipse compiler for Java.

81
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,740
So just keep that in mind.

82
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,220
Now hit apply.

83
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,330
It says we will do a full rebuild.

84
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,680
And later, I will explain what that is and just hit.

85
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,310
Yes.

86
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,960
So we are done with that.

87
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,200
So it is now added.

88
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,470
Now let's go ahead and add a project.

89
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,990
So let's say you are dealing with code that does some credit card processing transactions.

90
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,530
So which means that let's create a project for that.

91
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:12,480
Say New Java project and let's just name it a c p for credit card processing.

92
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,090
Here it says Use Default, Java, JDK 1.8, which is what we just added.

93
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:18,750
Right.

94
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,790
And once again, this is the same one.

95
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,420
Create separate folders for sources and class files.

96
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,100
Hit next.

97
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,030
Now here, if you recall, when we were using JDK 14, this option was being selected and we unselected

98
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:41,140
it or D selected it, but now it is grayed out because it is JDK eight and this is to do with the modules

99
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,540
feature which is not there and Java eight and older versions of Eclipse.

100
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,810
You wouldn't even see this option, but here it is grayed out.

101
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,560
So we are good.

102
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,400
So just click finish and the project got created.

103
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,310
And here let's add a new package.

104
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,300
Right click.

105
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,700
See package.

106
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,120
My company name and let's say test.

107
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,230
That's good enough.

108
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,110
Now what we will do is we'll just copy this one Test II, which is an eclipse test.

109
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,700
So this eclipse test is using Java 14 and this is using Java eight.

110
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,930
Just copy it, say control C and click on this package.

111
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,080
Name the new package we created and just say Control V.

112
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,550
And you can see that test I got added here and it has its own package.

113
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,520
So that's one way in which you can copy files from one package to another.

114
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:45,310
But we are having the compilation error because Java eight does not support private methods, private

115
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,120
methods within interface.

116
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,700
So interface is here.

117
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,020
It has its own keyword.

118
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,730
So that's the thing.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,280
Now, as part of this company, if you want to test something using some latest features, you can always

120
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,630
use this package.

121
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,060
But for your company, you can write here.

122
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,200
Now, let's assume that after some time your VP comes up VP Vice President, or your manager comes up

123
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,620
and he says that we want we should migrate from Java eight to Java 14.

124
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,240
So for that, what we will do is we need to change to Java 14.

125
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:23,890
So for that, what you can do is just click on SIP here and right click and it will show all of these

126
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,280
options that are specific to this project.

127
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:34,539
Now here you can go into this thing called as build path and select Configure Build Path.

128
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:43,450
Or another way to get to that screen is click on this properties and you will see this Java build path.

129
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,390
And here under libraries.

130
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,910
So we have this thing JDK 1.8, which is what this project is using.

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,240
And just remove it and let's add a new library.

132
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,200
Click on this one.

133
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,640
Add library and it says Git System Library hit next.

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,280
And here earlier it is using 1.8 click on alternate JIRA.

135
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,170
So it gives us two options JDK 14, which is and JDK 1.8.

136
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,710
We want JDK 14, so hit finish.

137
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,600
Apply now.

138
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,120
That's not enough.

139
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,310
We also have to set the Java compiler, also compiler compliance.

140
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,080
Here it is.

141
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,660
So change it to one point.

142
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,420
214.

143
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,900
If you see that this is grayed out, then click on this one.

144
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,170
If you click on this, sometimes it may be grayed out.

145
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,230
So you if you click on this, then it will enable you to change it.

146
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,550
All right.

147
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,680
Now, once again, say apply.

148
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,920
It says we'll do a full rebuild, which is good.

149
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,780
And that's it.

150
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,650
It's done.

151
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,230
So the compilation error has gone away because we are now using Java 14 now.

152
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,010
All right.

153
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,960
So that's how you can use this.

154
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,920
So now it's time to talk about the process.

155
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,280
So this is how this is what we did.

156
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,590
Another way was to get here using this build path.

157
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,440
So this is the Java build path.

158
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,920
And Java build path is nothing but the class path.

159
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:20,270
So when we are compiling in the traditional way outside of Eclipse, so we had two things.

160
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:25,610
One is the Java Java compiler and the other one is the class path environment variable.

161
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,240
Right.

162
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,380
So that is what is used to locate class files like the third party libraries or any other packages that

163
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,310
we are using.

164
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,890
So similarly for Java, build path is similar to class path.

165
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:48,530
So here under the source tab, we are saying that the source code is here, CP is the project and within

166
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,920
that there is a source folder within which we have our source code.

167
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,810
So this tells the compiler where to find the source code.

168
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:04,010
Similarly, there is this libraries tab and here don't worry about this module path and it is related

169
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,230
to the modules concept.

170
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:14,540
Now here we are saying that we are using JDK 14 and we may also have other Java files that we may use.

171
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:21,470
For instance, we may be using some third party libraries and those third party libraries in Java.

172
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,990
Like if you are using a Java library, the Java libraries will be packaged as Java files.

173
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,540
So you can add those external jars.

174
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,760
For instance, if you are using Google go.

175
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,070
It will be in the form of Java file.

176
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:39,350
Or if you are using some G unit test case, it will be in the form of Java file and we can add those

177
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,500
external jars so that our source code can use them.

178
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,150
So that's the libraries.

179
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,070
And you can also have this.

180
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:52,610
We also have this project tab, which is telling us that there may be multiple projects, especially

181
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,660
if you're dealing with like complex software, you will have multiple projects.

182
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,410
And the SIP, the credit card processing project might be using some other project code.

183
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,760
So we are saying that we also want to use code from that other project.

184
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:12,590
So this is essentially telling us what all our source code needs, the source code that is residing

185
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,680
here, what are the things that it needs?

186
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,980
It needs certain libraries and certain projects within our eclipse.

187
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,130
So that's the class path, the Belle path.

188
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:28,760
And for compilation I said that we are using this eclipse uses its own compiler.

189
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,520
So for class path we have built path and for compiler we are it is using its own this its own compiler.

190
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,620
That's the Belle process.

191
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:43,550
But the Belle process needs to have a certain tool to actually perform this compilation and that's called

192
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,420
as a build tool.

193
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:50,030
And Eclipse uses this build tool called US Java Builder, which is a class in Eclipse.

194
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:58,280
And this Java builder uses the build path here and it uses the compiler and generates the class files,

195
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,330
the compile code.

196
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,600
So that's the Java builder.

197
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,910
And in professional, when you are working on professional code, you will also be using other builders

198
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,920
like Maven, which also does the does the building for you.

199
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,110
So this is the Java builder.

200
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,930
So let me just say a plant close.

201
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:24,470
Now, the Java builder here, if you're going to project here, we have this option called build automatically.

202
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:31,340
So the Java builder is essentially building our code in an automatic way, which means that it is compiling

203
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,320
automatically.

204
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:39,650
So as soon as we save our file, make a change and save our file, the build tool will automatically

205
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,820
compile our code.

206
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,670
But it's not going to compile all of the files that we have written, but it only compiles the ones

207
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,740
where we have made the change, the file where we have made the change.

208
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,810
So in that sense, it's going to compile in an incremental way.

209
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,110
So for instance, here we have this warning also here.

210
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:05,950
So let's me put a pen statement and here I, I still did not save my file.

211
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:13,020
So if I go into hard drive here, so I'm here under did eclipse test is the project within which we

212
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,340
have the bin folder and bin has this eclipse test package.

213
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,360
And here you can see that the timestamp is 1220.

214
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,000
Now here let me save it.

215
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,010
And it changes to the current time, which is 1230.

216
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,070
So as soon as we saved the build tool has recompiled this particular class.

217
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,250
So it is doing it in an incremental way and in an automatic way.

218
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,870
And that's the cool feature of Eclipse.

219
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,350
Now, sometimes you might want to do a full rebuild.

220
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:55,540
So full rebuild as you're going to project and click on this option called clean here and it says whether

221
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:02,680
we want to clean all our projects, if you say clean all projects, then it is going to delete all of

222
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,680
the dot class files and recompile the source code.

223
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,140
So it's going to regenerate the class files.

224
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:14,430
So here we can see that it is 1230 right now and this one is still 1220.

225
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,530
So let's go ahead and simply say clean and it will rebuild everything.

226
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,590
So that's the process of rebuilding and that's it.

227
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:29,650
You can see that both of them have to all 31 So the old files were deleted and a new dot class files

228
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,550
were generated.

229
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,460
So that's the full rebuild.

230
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,220
If you see some issues, sometimes you can do the project and clean and do a re full rebuild.

231
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,610
So that's about it.

232
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,380
Thank you.

233
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,030
And I will see you in the next lecture.
