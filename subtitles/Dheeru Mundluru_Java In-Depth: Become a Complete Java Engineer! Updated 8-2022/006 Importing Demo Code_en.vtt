00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.030
Hello there.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.220
This is the De La Rue.

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.160
And welcome back.

4
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.850
Let's now go ahead and import the code that we wrote as part of our demos into our eclipse environment,

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.470
into the workspace.

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.990
It's going to be a very simple process.

7
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.590
So the first thing is let's go ahead and create a Java project here.

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.480
Let's call it a demo.

9
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.740
Just make sure that you have your latest version here and you can leave everything as this say next.

10
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.930
And here make sure that you are selecting the module info java say finish so the project is created.

11
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.870
Let's also ensure that the compiler compliance is the latest one.

12
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.190
So here we are.

13
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:54.260
We went into window preferences, Java, Java and within Java we have compiler.

14
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.210
Let's just select the latest one.

15
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.740
In my case, it's 14.

16
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.210
Yes.

17
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.650
Apply and close.

18
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.720
So that's it.

19
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.769
Now here.

20
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.340
Let's go into our explorer.

21
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760
So we have Java in depth here.

22
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.130
So this is where we wrote our code go into Z.

23
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.530
Com semantic square basics.

24
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.140
First thing I want you to do is just delete all of these class files.

25
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.740
We only need the source code.

26
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.340
Now go into SIRC.

27
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.050
Copy this comm.

28
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.920
From here.

29
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.740
Now let's go into our workspace, which is geared.

30
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.860
Here it is.

31
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.980
And Gid, we just created this demo project.

32
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.450
Go here and into RC and just copy it here.

33
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.740
Now let's head back to our editor.

34
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.430
And right click on demo and say refresh and that's about it.

35
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.270
Our code is imported.

36
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.300
Now, here it is.

37
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.610
Com semantic squared basics.

38
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.430
This is a package and it has all of these.

39
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.970
Hello.

40
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.090
World just does not have the package statement.

41
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.900
So hover over here on this icon and it says.

42
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.990
Okay.

43
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.440
Just just add this package.

44
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.730
So when you double click it, it is giving us the option to add the package.

45
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.290
So just do that.

46
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.030
Compilation error is gone now.

47
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.380
So we have everything.

48
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.470
So we can also run this here.

49
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.950
It's printing.

50
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.550
Hello World.

51
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.470
So that's about it.

52
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.090
That's how you would import it.

53
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.720
Now there is also an alternate way to import.

54
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.070
So for that, what you would do is so once we create the demo project and we have the CRC folder, what

55
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.800
you would do is just right click here.

56
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.060
So this is an alternate way and say import.

57
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.760
And click on General.

58
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:59.020
Now this one is for importing existing eclipse projects into workspace, so you shouldn't select that.

59
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.870
You have to go for this because it's a non eclipse project.

60
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.650
Say next from Browse here that's going to our seed drive.

61
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.300
And go into Java in-depth, right.

62
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.640
And select this RC and select folder.

63
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.430
And all you would do is just click on this one and you would hit finish.

64
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.870
That's how you would.

65
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.090
That's how you would import.

66
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.850
That's an alternative way to import import our code and you don't even have to refresh in this case.

67
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.160
In the earlier case, once we copied we we did a refresh on the demo.

68
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.000
We right click on data refresh.

69
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.890
So in this case, we don't even need that.

70
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.480
So that's about it.

71
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.850
That's how you would, how you would import.

72
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:56.250
Now let's also delete this these two let's say delete and say delete project contents on disk.

73
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.340
Let's also select that so that it will be deleted on the disk.

74
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.950
Same goes with eclipse test delete.

75
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.710
And you're done now.

76
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.900
Just to be on the safe side, let's do a project clean.

77
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.800
Sometimes when we delete, it can give us issues.

78
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.720
Say clean all projects.

79
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.950
So it's all deleted now.

80
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.079
So if we go into our JID, we see only demo.

81
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.020
So that's how you would import non eclipse project code into Eclipse.

82
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.390
Thank you and I will see you in the next lecture.
