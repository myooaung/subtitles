1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,100
Hi there.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,260
This is De La Rue and welcome back.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,200
So we have learned about both comparison as well as logical operators.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,830
And these operators, as we know, help in building logic.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,600
So you have started learning about how to build logic.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,990
And let's go ahead and put these both operator types into action.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,910
So we are going to implement a simple coding exercise.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,150
And in this coding exercise you would implement a method which would calculate the price of a used car.

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:40,410
So if you have a used car and if you want to sell that car, then you would like to know what the best

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,660
price is for selling that car.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,210
Now different countries have different websites for such a functionality.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,620
For instance, in United States we have this site called us Kelley Blue Book and the URL is CVS.com.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,380
And using this site, you can know what the price would be for a used car.

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,769
Similarly, different countries have their own websites.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,920
Now, if your country does not have a website, then probably it's an opportunity for you to build something

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,550
like this.

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,090
So by the end of this course, you would have the basic skillsets for building such a site.

18
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,570
But of course, you would have to do some follow up courses to learn some advanced technologies, some

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,950
follow up technologies, and then you can use them to build something similar.

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:34,170
So in this coding exercise, you will implement a basic version of what we see here, a very basic version.

21
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,180
So this is Kelley Blue Book, and here it says, Kelley Blue Book, Price Advisor.

22
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,050
So that's what we are going to do to we are going to calculate the price of a used car.

23
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,540
So here we can click on this.

24
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,610
Let's look at what they have.

25
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,140
Now we need to enter some basic information about our car, which we want to sell.

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,400
So let's pick this.

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,690
2018.

28
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,670
Make Ford the model.

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,620
Let's pick this particular car for Ford.

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,970
It's a Ford EcoSport.

31
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,010
A very nice car.

32
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:13,420
Let's say we have driven 15,000 miles in the one year.

33
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,950
We have driven 15,000 miles.

34
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,220
In another country we would be using we would probably use a metric like kilometers, but this is miles

35
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,630
and this is the location where we are staying.

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,360
So this is essentially zip code in United States.

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,070
They call it a zip code and another country in some other countries they call it US Postal code.

38
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,990
So this is where we live.

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,210
So let's go ahead and hit next.

40
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,130
So which style is your car?

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,450
So there are four options.

42
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,540
Let's select this one and hit next.

43
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,260
So it is once again asking for a few more options.

44
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,630
It says Price with standard equipment.

45
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,160
Select your options.

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,420
So what?

47
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,250
Which options are on your vehicle?

48
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,930
So something like security features and convenience features.

49
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,550
So those may be some features in the car.

50
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,770
Select the colour, let's say red.

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,530
And what is your vehicle's condition?

52
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,460
Is it very good?

53
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,060
Excellent or good, let's say?

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,760
Very good.

55
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,930
So the car is in a very good condition.

56
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:24,590
So now it is calculating and this is the logic that you're going to write whatever is happening here.

57
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,730
Here it is.

58
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:35,680
And it says the car can be sold at this price at $17,036.

59
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,260
So let's go ahead and look at the code.

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,320
I have some template code for you to sell.

61
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,330
So let's go ahead and look at that.

62
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:52,420
This is a class that will be given to you in the next lecture, and it is appropriately named as car

63
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,850
price estimator as we want to estimate the price of the car.

64
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,310
And this class has two methods.

65
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,510
The first method here is called us get sale price.

66
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,760
And this is the main method that you need to implement.

67
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,690
It has some template code and you would implement it.

68
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,690
And the second method will be used from this method and it is already implemented.

69
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,840
It's called a get price.

70
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,940
So you wouldn't do anything with this method.

71
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,399
But we will also discuss this particular method.

72
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,010
So this class will be given to you in the next lecture, which is a coding exercise, and you would

73
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,850
go ahead and implement this method and submit your solution.

74
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,180
So the first method is get sale price, as the name indicates.

75
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:40,200
It would return the price of the car given the values related to the car.

76
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,360
So we have certain attributes of the car.

77
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,960
And based on those attributes it would estimate the price and it would return that.

78
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,630
And the return price is a double value.

79
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,430
So we have the return type as double.

80
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:57,700
Now here also we have the main method and we know that the main method is just used for testing purpose.

81
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,500
So that's what we are going to do here.

82
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,350
We are creating an instance of car price estimator here and we are invoking the get sale price method

83
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,910
with some sample data.

84
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,150
So we know that main method is used only for testing purposes.

85
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:16,900
But when you submit your solution, your solution would be automatically evaluated for correctness and

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,300
it would test it with different kinds of data.

87
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,330
And it will say whether the method passes the whether your solution passes the test or not.

88
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,860
So here we have some sample data and this is my Eclipse editor.

89
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,280
And if I hover over this particular method, gets a sale price, it shows the method signature and let's

90
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,800
look at the parameters of the method.

91
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,630
So the first one is make and model.

92
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:49,000
Now, if you recall from the website earlier, the both make and model were two different parameters.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,600
Make was Ford and model was EcoSport.

94
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,210
And those are two different values, which we were which we were submitting from the dropdown menu.

95
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:06,070
But in this particular case, we have them represented using a single field and the next one is E are

96
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,240
manufactured.

97
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:14,140
And this is the year in which your car has been manufactured and we are passing a sample value 2018

98
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,600
third one is miles driven.

99
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,100
So the distance that has been traveled since the car was bought.

100
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,130
So these are the miles driven in this case we are using miles.

101
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,300
Now for the rest of the field.

102
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,120
Let's just go to the method here and look at the rest of the fields.

103
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,020
So we just discussed the first three parameters.

104
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,490
The next three are related to security.

105
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:44,570
So the first one among the security features that the car has can have as a background and it is end.

106
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,120
Second is ABS.

107
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,670
And third is EBD.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,680
So a B as here, both of these are boolean fields.

109
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,450
They have the Boolean data type.

110
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,520
Now, airbags, you may know about airbags.

111
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,490
Some of the cars come with airbags.

112
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,250
They may have either two or six airbags.

113
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,220
And an airbag is simply installed in the dashboard.

114
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,010
And in the event of an accident, a serious accident, a collision, the airbags would be blasted out

115
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,940
from the dashboard and they would protect you from any injury.

116
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,060
So that's the airbags and it is an infield.

117
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:26,200
And ABS stands for anti-lock braking system and EBD stands for electronic brakeforce distribution.

118
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,640
And both of them are security features related to brakes, applying brakes.

119
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,150
And just don't worry if you're not familiar with these with these words, with these terms, and because

120
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:43,930
they are not relevant here, it is sufficient if we know that these are related to security features.

121
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,420
And if the car does not have these features, then we reduce the price of the car.

122
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,030
Now the next three features here are related to comfort, comfort features and we will look at them

123
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,450
later.

124
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:04,230
And all of these are Boolean fields and the final one is has accident history, which is also a Boolean

125
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,210
field Boolean parameter.

126
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,980
So if a true is passed, it would mean that the car was involved in an accident.

127
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,370
And based on that, we further adjust the sale price.

128
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,430
So this is the method that you need to implement.

129
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:24,830
So as I said earlier, this method returns the price of the car and that is represented using this variable

130
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:30,500
called sale price and it is of type double because we need to return a double and that's what we are

131
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,100
returning.

132
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,549
At the very end of the method we are saying return sale price.

133
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:43,520
Now it is initialized with some value and once it is initialized, we have all of these different conditions.

134
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,280
The logic here, different factors.

135
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,330
And those factors use these different parameters.

136
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,840
And based on that, the price would be adjusted.

137
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,150
It keeps adjusting with each of the factor.

138
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,630
So we have five factors here and we will look at all of them.

139
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,770
But let's look at the initialization.

140
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:08,350
Initial initially it would be initialized with the price of that car.

141
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,520
Based on the air manufactured.

142
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,280
So we are just invoking the second method called get price, which is already implemented and we are

143
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,180
passing the make and model and we are also passing the EER manufactured.

144
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:27,510
Now in the main method we passed Ford, EcoSport and we passed here manufactured as 2018.

145
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:33,270
So this method will return the price of this particular car, that car, Ford, EcoSport.

146
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,550
So that's there is certain price for that and that is the price that would be assigned to this method

147
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,300
sale price.

148
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,120
So let's look at this get price method.

149
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,630
So here it is.

150
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,390
So it is taking the two parameters and there is some logic here, just don't even worry about this.

151
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:55,310
So all it is doing is if Ford, EcoSport is passed, it is passing, it is returning 20,000.

152
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,680
But if the car make and model is Honda City here, then it returns 25,000.

153
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,340
And if this of the car is Toyota, then it returns 30,000.

154
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:10,180
If the car does not match any of these values here, then it would return 20,000.

155
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,660
So this is an if statement.

156
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,350
Just don't worry about it and your manufactured is not even used.

157
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:21,230
So this is just to kind of make it like a real world case.

158
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,170
But we are not going to use the air manufactured at all and that is perfectly fine since this is just

159
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:27,830
an exercise.

160
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,490
But we just wanted to mimic the way it is done in the real world.

161
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,600
So get price would be the price of the car.

162
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,770
In the year that it was manufactured.

163
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,880
So that's what we have.

164
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,940
And this will be further adjusted in the method based on the logic that we are going to right now.

165
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,140
Next is current year.

166
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,010
So the current year is calculated in this way and you can simply ignore this.

167
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,300
So this would return the current year when the program is being executed.

168
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:02,650
So local date is a class that is in the Java library and it is from the date and time library within

169
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,670
the Java library.

170
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,260
And later in the course we will look at date and time API.

171
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,470
It would be much later and at that time you would understand the statement so you can just ignore it.

172
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,450
But currently the year is 2019, so this would get assigned to 2019.

173
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:25,630
And in the next statement we are calculating the age of the car, which is the current year minus year

174
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,160
manufactured, which is passed to the method and we are adding a plus one.

175
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:38,170
So if the current year is 2000, 19 and a year manufactured, is passed is 2018, then it would be one

176
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,050
here, 2019 -2018 and plus one.

177
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:48,340
So that would make it to age of the car would be two now if manufactured is 2019 so it is manufactured

178
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,470
in the same year as the current year.

179
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,730
Then this would be zero and only a one would be assigned to age of the car.

180
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,070
So the car is manufactured within the current year.

181
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,810
Then age of the car would be one.

182
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,320
Then we are printing this value.

183
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,110
Then we have the different factors.

184
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:10,190
So the first factor that will reduce the price of the car is based on the early depreciation value.

185
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,290
Now, with each passing year, the car price would reduce.

186
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,240
By default, it would reduce.

187
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:23,780
And the condition here is if the age of the car is less than or equal to ten, if it was manufactured

188
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:32,120
within the last ten years, then the price would depreciate by 5% off the original sale price, which

189
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,980
is this price every year.

190
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,170
So for each year we would reduce it by 5% off the sale price.

191
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,580
So we have a simple example here.

192
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:48,500
If the price is 10,000, so let's say if the sale price is 10,000 and if it is three years old, then

193
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:58,160
the price depreciated would be 1500 because if it is 10,000 for a given year, since we are saying 5%

194
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,220
of the original sale price, if we multiply this 10,000 with 5%, it would be 500.

195
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,670
And since we are saying three years, it would be 1500.

196
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,780
So the total price depreciated is 15,000, 1500.

197
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,020
And subtracting that from 10,000, we get 8500.

198
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:24,010
So once this logic is executed, sale prices 8500, and then next we have other factors which can further

199
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,010
adjust the price.

200
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,520
Now, there is also an LZ block here.

201
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:34,100
So if the car is age of the car is greater than ten, then we simply return this value.

202
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,730
So this is 10% of the current sale price.

203
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:44,150
So if the current sale price is 10,000, then we simply multiply it with 10% here, 0.1 and we just

204
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,970
directly return that value.

205
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,970
We don't have to.

206
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,490
The method does not execute anymore.

207
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,030
So you can just copy this particular statement into the block.

208
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,040
But if it goes into this block, then we would continue adjusting the value.

209
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:05,880
So the next one is based on security feature and it says that the car, if the car does not have at

210
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:14,240
least two airbags and ABS and EBD, so it says that it needs to have at least two airbags.

211
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,600
So if you see here it is an airbag count is an eight.

212
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,440
So we can pass an int value like one, two or so on.

213
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:31,020
So if if it is less than two, then it means that it does not have the security feature and we have

214
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,480
to reduce the price by 1000.

215
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,020
We would reduce the sale price by the same sale price that we had here after this, after executing

216
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,480
the first factor.

217
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,410
So that's sale price would be further reduced by 1000 thousand.

218
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,570
So that's just one condition.

219
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,720
But we also need these two conditions, ABS and EBD, EBD, to also be true.

220
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:01,440
If all of these conditions are true, then we then we just then the condition would fail and we will

221
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,950
not execute the if if block will not be executed.

222
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,880
But if any of these you can see that we have and here.

223
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,360
So if any of these conditions fail, then only we reduce the price.

224
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:23,910
But if the car has two airbags and if it also has abs and if it also has EBD, which means has EBD is

225
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:29,760
true, then we never reduce the price and the price would remain as is.

226
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,450
That is a whatever price we had here that the same price would be would be there and we would further

227
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,970
process it here in the next factor.

228
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,510
So the next factor is comfort features.

229
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:48,450
Now here we are simply printing the sale price after checking for the security features and we are also

230
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:55,200
doing that here after checking for the year, after applying the early depreciation logic.

231
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,110
And here we have the comfort features.

232
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:05,280
Here we are saying is the car has a rearview camera and one of these to sunroof or auto AC.

233
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:11,520
So rearview camera is whether the car has it or not is represented by this parameter here.

234
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,440
So rear view camera is the camera that could have been installed in the car.

235
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:23,580
And when we reverse the car, there would be a we would have a screen which would which would show the

236
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:29,670
the rear view of the car, whatever is behind the car, we can see it the in the screen.

237
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:34,800
So if a true is passed, it means that rear view camera is there in the car.

238
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,090
Similarly, sunroof.

239
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:43,110
Sunroof is the window that we have on the roof of the car, which is also electronically controlled.

240
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:52,230
So if you click a button, the sunroof would open and close and auto AC is used to set the temperature

241
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,170
in the car at a certain value.

242
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:01,860
If it is set at 22 degrees Celsius, then the feature would ensure that the car will always have that

243
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,030
the temperature.

244
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,400
So both of these are boolean.

245
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:12,300
So if a false is passed four has auto ac, then it means that the car does not have that that particular

246
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,829
auto AC feature.

247
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:21,210
So here we are saying if the car has rear view camera and either sunroof or auto AC.

248
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:26,970
So one of these then in that case increment the price by $500.

249
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,590
So you would increment you would increase the sale price that we had.

250
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:38,550
After executing the security features related logic, we would increase the price by $500.

251
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:46,050
Now next is price past accidents for the accident we had this final field call has accident history.

252
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,890
Now if a true is passed for that then we are.

253
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,130
Then it means that the car was involved in an accident and we have to reduce the sale price by another

254
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,090
$500.

255
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,140
Simple.

256
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,600
And once again, we are printing the value here.

257
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,840
And the final one is based on additional miles driven.

258
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,220
So here we know that the age of the car is there.

259
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,740
And typically in a given year, a car would be driven 10,000 miles.

260
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,380
But if you drive more than that, then it means that you have overdriven the cars.

261
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,940
And because of that, we can reduce the price of the car.

262
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:30,180
So here the expected miles driven is nothing but age of the car, times 10,000.

263
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:37,200
So if the if the age of the car is three years, then 30,000 miles would be a reasonable distance travel.

264
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,570
But if you if you have traveled 40,000 miles, then it means that you have overdriven the car and that's

265
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,010
what is computed here.

266
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,560
So additional miles is miles driven.

267
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,220
So if you have.

268
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,420
40,000 miles and expected miles driven was 30,000.

269
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,380
Then additional miles would be 10,000.

270
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,030
And based on that, we are going to penalize here.

271
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,350
So we are going to reduce the price.

272
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,580
And here are the conditions.

273
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,550
It says we have three conditions here, three statements.

274
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:11,740
It says F number of miles over driven is greater than 1000 and less than or equal to 10,000, then reduce

275
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,300
the sale price by 500.

276
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,370
Similarly, we have two more conditions.

277
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:22,030
If miles driven over driven is greater than 10,000 and less than or equal to 30,000, then reduce by

278
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,780
this amount.

279
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:30,610
And if the additional miles driven is greater than 30,000, then you would reduce by 1500.

280
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,630
And finally, we are preventing that and we are retaining the value here.

281
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,010
So that's about it.

282
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,940
That's the exercise.

283
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:43,570
And in the next exercise we will actually you can actually find this template code and you can implement

284
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,380
and submit it.

285
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,800
That said, thank you and happy coding.
