00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:08.720
Let's look at something called Skip sequences an escape sequence is basically a Carriker preceded by

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.000
a backslash it helps in using certain special characters in stringin character literals.

3
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.320
We know that staying in character letters represent x but to include certain special characters we need

4
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.850
to use the corresponding escape sequences.

5
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.840
On here are the eight as give sequences the Djala supports the first five which are emphasized in green

6
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.230
are probably the only ones you will ever use.

7
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.270
So let's not worry about the last three the fastest Gip sequence is for inserting a double chord.

8
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.990
Second is for inserting a single chord.

9
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.620
Third one is for inserting a newline Fortius for inserting it up and first as for inserting it back

10
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.620
slash yourself.

11
00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.480
So what you see here are the only valid escape sequences so you follow the backslash with any other

12
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.630
character other than what you see here.

13
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.770
Then you get a compiler

14
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.280
however you can follow a backslash with you -- and followed by some hexadecimal number to represent

15
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.650
the Unicode number.

16
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.260
We already know this from our discussion on characters.

17
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.680
This particular Unicode number Bentz character in uppercase.

18
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.700
However if you have just a backslash followed by you get down to following Unico number then we get

19
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.800
a compiler error.

20
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.830
Finally just know that it is not required to use an escape sequence to insert a double quote getting

21
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.380
a character written so you can use it directly.

22
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.150
You can still use an escape sequence if you want to but it's not just mandatory similarly does not require

23
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:56.020
to use an escape sequence to insert a single court within a string Latron OK let me know pull up my

24
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.310
Eclipse and we can look at the first five or skip sequences.

25
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.350
OK here we are in the basics to a class in the main matter.

26
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.729
And here we are declaring a string Esben and it is initialized with the string letter.

27
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.639
Hello Mr. John.

28
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.760
How are you.

29
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.890
And we are simply printing a string here and here we have a variable s2 which is of type quarterly and

30
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.210
it is initialized with the text.

31
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.230
Hello.

32
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.640
So let me just run this so it prints the string here.

33
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.010
Now let's if you want to insert or double quotes here we want to gross this text Mr. double quotes.

34
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.770
So as soon as I entered the court here we can see that we have a compiler error.

35
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.210
Ok so since it's a special Carriker we need to skip it by inserting a backslash.

36
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.150
Same here.

37
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.050
Now let me compiled or let me just say it.

38
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.580
And now when I run it you can see that the text Mr is enclosed in double quotes.

39
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.690
Now let's try a single quote here.

40
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.250
And the second declaration.

41
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.710
So if I put a single course here if I replace each with a single court it gives a compiler error.

42
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.360
So because single quotes is a special character.

43
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.090
And so you need to skip it.

44
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.900
So that's good.

45
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.960
Now let's say if you want to insert a double quote here you can either do this.

46
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.880
You can escape it are like like we like men like we mentioned earlier.

47
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.000
You can just put the double use of double quote Also it's fine.

48
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.750
OK.

49
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.750
The same goes here also so you can use either a single code display by skipping order you can just use

50
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.220
a single code directly if it does it string letter.

51
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.810
OK.

52
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.860
So we already discussed that.

53
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:48.030
Now let's say we want to insert a newline here so just put a new line on Iran.

54
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.680
As you can see how are you as in the second line.

55
00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:00.640
Now if you want to insert a tab here just put a slash beat and as you can see there isn't Hardies on

56
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.460
top here.

57
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.230
OK.

58
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.280
So how does Underdark sort of especially useful if you're writing somebody who files iron especially

59
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.840
if you're writing some product based off for example.

60
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.440
So you might help out I mean a description and other stuff product you order and stuff like that.

61
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.370
So that kind of data you might find useful to use tops over there.

62
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.740
So that's just one example.

63
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.030
Let's see if you want to replace this with a backslash.

64
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.240
Then you can just put do backslashes here I skip sequence one a backslash and as you can see there is

65
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.250
a backslash here.

66
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.240
So those are the only main ones which you will most frequently use the double chords single chords new

67
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.200
line tab on a backslash.

68
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.090
OK.

69
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.480
And that's about it.

70
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.720
Understand that is to escape sequences.

71
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.360
Thank you.
