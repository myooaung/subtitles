WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:07.590
OK now let's convert the remaining part of the share functionality and before doing that let's just

2
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.480
boost like refactoring your far the previous feature which is marking as kid friendly.

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.400
So we have some logic here.

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.680
So let's actually do some changes here so that we move some of the logic into into controller and also

5
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.160
into our manager classes.

6
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.090
OK.

7
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.540
So we have this here.

8
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.670
Here's where the get friendly functionality starts so let's do this.

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.450
Copy it from here.

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.350
OK so here we are testing if bookmark is easy kid friendly eligible.

11
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.950
And if the status is the status equals unknown for the kid friendly status then we are getting the kid

12
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.500
friendly status information.

13
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.930
So which means we are using randomisation but you can think that the user is actually giving giving

14
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.730
his decision his or her decision.

15
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.700
Now let's move this particular fart's functionality here.

16
00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:11.360
It's a very simple statement but let's do this and controller actually in manager.

17
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.690
OK.

18
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.330
So we are doing it in the view which is not right.

19
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.580
So to do it the right way needs to be done in the back and not in the front.

20
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.750
So let's So that's the reason why I want to refactor this.

21
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.790
So let's just do that.

22
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.720
Let's call them a second term illustrators let's use the same name

23
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.330
and let's pass it friendly status

24
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.510
as well as the bookmark.

25
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.980
Now that's added automatically.

26
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.090
So create matter.

27
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.420
No let's just simply relayed this in to our manager because we shouldn't have too much of business logic

28
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.720
.

29
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.870
In fact we shouldn't have any business like logic here.

30
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.920
So let's say

31
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.940
.

32
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.510
So in this year.

33
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.930
And let's ontogeny that template.

34
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.320
Now let's go back and go.

35
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.920
View-Master let's just copy this whole thing.

36
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.440
And that's just simply more work.

37
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.780
So that said.

38
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.490
So we are good with this.

39
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.460
Me Yes we are good with this.

40
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.900
And just you're on this

41
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.280
seems fine.

42
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.910
Now let's just do one more tang.

43
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.040
So let's also do some bookkeeping.

44
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.890
So here there is this user who is marking your desk friendly.

45
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.830
Let's also save this information.

46
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.180
Typically when you are implementing any software or any web application you would this kind of an application

47
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.390
.

48
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.900
You would also save who the user is who who though who is the user that has performed this action.

49
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.900
So in this case there is a certain editor or a chief editor who is marking this particular item as kid

50
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.530
friendly and it would be nice to him to also save that information who that particular users who's doing

51
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.430
the marking action.

52
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.850
So let's just go into the bookmark class here.

53
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.760
So do a control shift our bookmark.

54
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:54.550
So let's just either a new free or irate user let's call it does get friendly mocked by.

55
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.510
So this will have a red card of the user who has performed this particular action.

56
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.340
And that's also create get in and sergers

57
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.560
reduce.

58
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.790
So we are good with that.

59
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:20.890
And so now from the weblink in the view class let's pass this information to the controller.

60
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.420
So let's just see user.

61
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.900
So let's pass this information user.

62
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.300
But knowing how to accomplish compulsion Urso that this set change the let's pick this option set kid

63
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.040
friendly status and parameter user.

64
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.550
So eclipse is going to do the job for us.

65
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.760
So let's also do the same for this with a manager class.

66
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.250
And once again we will to the same option.

67
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.650
So eclipse then automatically update the matter signature here.

68
00:04:51.680 --> 00:05:04.450
Now let's say Mark Dodds said he currently MMOG by it's supposed to be user here that's it.

69
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:13.720
Now let's bring this information it into status here let's call it does mark by.

70
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.240
Let's bring the user's e-mail.

71
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:33.190
And let's also print just the book mark information and also do a control shift.

72
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.300
So that's it.

73
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.850
Now let's just go ahead and run this short of you though here.

74
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.210
So the 30 was at first and second users are not staff members.

75
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.520
The third is a staff member here and here it is.

76
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.610
So this is rejected.

77
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.620
This particular item is rejected and it is marked by this user user too.

78
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.160
And this is of eyeblink information.

79
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:10.480
Now there is a new item that's bookmarked and that item is approved as kid friendly and it was marked

80
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.800
by once again the same user.

81
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.240
So that's bookmarking and that's bookkeeping information.

82
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:25.950
So now here in the bookmark manager we are simply we are not invoking that Dolliver are typically people

83
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.650
invoke the dollar on past this bookmark and then store that information in the database.

84
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.910
But in this case let's it's fine because bookmark is an object reference.

85
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.540
So the value whatever value is set is is reflected.

86
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:48.200
So just assume that it's also reflected in the database because this and to did it presents arrowing

87
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.050
the database just think that it is also.

88
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:58.300
So there is a reference to that particular object in the database anyway so it's not required.

89
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.750
That really required that we save it.

90
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.200
But you know we can in reality we would actually save it.

91
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.910
But for now it is definitely fine.

92
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.370
So that's about it.

93
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.240
So let's just go ahead and continue our implementation of the shared functionality and let's complete

94
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.770
data.

95
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.330
So let's go back into our real class.

96
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.010
OK so that's marking us get friendly now Ed..

97
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:32.520
One of the staff members have has to do the sharing operation also so the staff member gets to bookmark

98
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.660
.

99
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.730
I'm also Marcus kid friendly and not share any bookmarks.

100
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.710
So here lots.

101
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:46.030
Since the condition is already here that if the user is an editor or the chief editor or need then the

102
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.790
user will be able to market get friendly.

103
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.130
Only then the user will be able to perform the shading operation.

104
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.670
So let's have the sharing functionality here.

105
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.250
And we know that there are some constraints for sharing.

106
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.460
And one of them is that the get friendly status has to be approved.

107
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:08.470
So if it is a bookmark that is approved only then we will be able to share it it needs to be a good

108
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.740
friendly bookmark.

109
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.740
So for that.

110
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.770
So we already have this bookmark.

111
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:20.140
Copy this on your differences died instead of unknown.

112
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:24.490
It's supposed to be she approved.

113
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:26.600
OK.

114
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.070
So instead of on and on.

115
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.950
This is this has to be a pro.

116
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.770
No it means that it's a good friendly bookmark.

117
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:36.960
OK.

118
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.679
So now the second condition so this is only one of the conditions that it needs to be a good friendly

119
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.260
bookmark.

120
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:49.570
But the second constraint is that it needs to be either a book or eyeblink only then it can be shared

121
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.400
which means that they are implementing those two kinds of items are implementing shareable.

122
00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.080
OK.

123
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.720
So and this gives the bookmark.

124
00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:03.050
So here is a bookmark it needs to be an instance of Shater right.

125
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:07.890
Because both book and weblink are implement being shareable.

126
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.700
So.

127
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:17.490
So the way we can ensure that is by using an instance of operator.

128
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:26.970
So now we know that the bookmark is an instance of shareable and only then we will do the shading.

129
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:34.460
So if the bookmarked on site will be movie then we won't do an end run into this if block.

130
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.140
Import important.

131
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:45.100
So even after it can be shared it may be that the editor the staff member does not want to share it

132
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:50.210
so it's up to it's up to the staff member whether he or she wants to share it or not.

133
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:59.070
So once again to use randomisation for that and it's good that it's hard to generate this

134
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:18.560
that to use just a simple The same one here this is hybridize Boullion.

135
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.230
So not to assign this

136
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:33.610
to a variable called E share not the best name here but I guess it's OK.

137
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:44.850
Now let's see if we share only then we would share it with the third party site.

138
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.060
OK.

139
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.320
So let's introduce a new method.

140
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:55.560
So let's just assume that a user wants to share this idea he has clicked on the link shared with good

141
00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:06.200
snips and then a control will be sent back to the controller so that the necessary actions will be taken

142
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.230
in the Bakken.

143
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:14.060
So let's say Get instance and that's created a share here

144
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:23.940
and we would also be doing some bookoo bookkeeping just like the way we have done for kid friendly status

145
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:24.100
.

146
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.510
So we want to know which user is sharing the item.

147
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.640
OK so we're going to do that.

148
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:36.880
So let's also pass that and let's pass the bookmark.

149
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:38.430
OK.

150
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:43.240
So we are sharing this you this user is sharing this bookmark.

151
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.150
OK.

152
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.280
So it is.

153
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:57.450
And as always this one simply release to the bookmark manager

154
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.570
and let's all go create this method.

155
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.390
OK.

156
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:19.830
So let's go back into this bookmark class and for bookkeeping Let's introduce a new variable which is

157
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:24.520
of type user and let's say shared by.

158
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.160
So it's very similar to good for me my bye.

159
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:34.140
And let's also generally the getters and setters.

160
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.680
OK there you go.

161
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.050
Save it.

162
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.630
Go back to manicure.

163
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.800
Let's just say.

164
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.430
So that's the user's information that's who's sharing.

165
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.260
And let's put a system not a out statement here

166
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:10.940
.

167
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.610
So here is a bookmark but we don't know whether it is an instance of book of eyeblink.

168
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:16.900
Right.

169
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:23.220
We need to get the data that we need to invoke to get some data so far that we need to do or don't cast

170
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.830
cast here.

171
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.240
So because we need to share that we need to get that data and then we need to share it with the third

172
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.380
party website.

173
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:37.980
So let's just do this first let's check whether it is an instance of book or whether it's an instance

174
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:45.060
of eyeblink sofort is an instance of book.

175
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:55.830
You know we can pass the we can get item didn't diameter we can do this we can see a book bookmark so

176
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.540
we can type.

177
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.860
And then we can invoke the get item radiometer

178
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.640
here and into this.

179
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:17.400
So in this sense we there is not a real third party website it's just a fictitious website but we don't

180
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.210
have it.

181
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:24.240
So we are all we can do is let's just print it here probably in future we can just write it into a file

182
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:31.690
so that some other you know some kind of a job of some kind of a scope will actually send that information

183
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.450
to the third party website.

184
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.360
Sometimes it's done that way or sometimes you may.

185
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:42.600
The third party website might have a web service and we may pass this information directly programmatically

186
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:49.330
using that web service soby but pass this information to that Web site was in a program category.

187
00:14:49.440 --> 00:15:01.350
Now let's also do as of just copy this here let's copy the whole thing in sternal instead instance of

188
00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.730
weblink.

189
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:09.340
And here also eyeblink get our number.

190
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.620
So we're invoking the get item radiometer.

191
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.200
So that's right here.

192
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:17.730
And it's just time to run this.

193
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:24.820
It's just go ahead and run the launch.

194
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:30.280
Let's just look at the 30 user here to get friendly straight as is proved.

195
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.210
But maybe that the data will be shared.

196
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:39.600
The randomisation function maybe or did not or did not it done True which means that they should not

197
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.210
be share on Hensick was not shared.

198
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.060
So in this case it was movie.

199
00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:49.390
It was rejected movie approved but movie is something that we should not be shared.

200
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.260
So we don't have that now.

201
00:15:51.320 --> 00:16:00.120
Here you can see that this is a book and it is approved and that is here is the day that is to be shared

202
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:00.200
.

203
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:07.140
So this is the XM string which God created and that thing that we are passing this information to our

204
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.360
partnerships right now here is the term user.

205
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.130
Same thing your good friend Mr. does is approved.

206
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.040
And it is have a blank.

207
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:21.420
And I share so only book and book and ramblings can be shared.

208
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.660
OK now

209
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:33.510
so in future we are going to extend this right now the decisions are made by RR and a musician but in

210
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.020
future we will get that we take the input.

211
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:41.490
These methods will take input from the user itself and we will do it after completing the Iowa chapter

212
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.570
so we can write it to here.

213
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.100
Which means that we will be doing that in future.

214
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.570
So I will say below methods thats

215
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:58.390
simulate user and book score.

216
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.600
I also read the book.

217
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:03.510
Wow.

218
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.450
Answer.

219
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:06.060
OK.

220
00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:07.750
So thats a good Dudack.

221
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:16.359
But the nice thing about this is this Dagget itself as something that Eclipse keeps track of.

222
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:22.690
So if you want to see what all you do ask you how are unique gurus going to Windows show you and set

223
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:28.920
tasks and he added this is here this is the one which we just brought.

224
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:36.410
So that way you can easily find all the clues that you how it will show all the clues here.

225
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:42.680
And that way you can go back and look at what youre interested in and then now.

226
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.980
So if you think you're ready you can just go ahead and fill in the new implementation.

227
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:55.900
Okay so that's a nice thing about to do and you may note is that we did not implement DDT for the last

228
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.190
two features at least for this feature.

229
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.580
We have done it for IIS good friendly eligible.

230
00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.440
That's because the logic is too simple here.

231
00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.790
For example in this case we are just taking an input from the user order.

232
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.000
Here we are using randomisation.

233
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.930
And it's just too simple process.

234
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.380
In fact it doesn't even fit well for TDD.

235
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:24.700
So we that's why we did not have DDD and the rest of the logic also and bookmark manager are very very

236
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.340
it's very simple logic.

237
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:31.940
So since it is so simple we did not use TDD approach.

238
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:37.890
So we were used to really only if it is really required because if you think if we think that it's going

239
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:44.840
to be you know the logic might break it has a possibility to break on lead then we would use DDT.

240
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:50.700
But if it is very simple simple setting and you know using a set or Gurjars then we don't have to use

241
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.600
DDT.

242
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.530
OK so that's about it.

243
00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:58.070
And that's the final feature which we have implemented.

244
00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:05.160
And please go ahead and implement whatever we have implemented in this lesson.

245
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:05.700
OK.

246
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.430
Happy coding.

247
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.520
Thank you.
