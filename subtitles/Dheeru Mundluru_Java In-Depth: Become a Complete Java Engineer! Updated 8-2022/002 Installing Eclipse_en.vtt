00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:02.930
Hello there.

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.050
This is the new Lulu and we'll come back.

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.580
Let's now go ahead and install Eclipse.

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.000
So just Google for Eclipse Download.

5
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.149
And the first link here points to the downloads and it's from the website Eclipse dot org, which is

6
00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:23.380
the official website of Eclipse Foundation, which is the organization which is actively developing

7
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.780
Eclipse IDE, which is an open source project.

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.720
So apart from Eclipse IDE, they also are developing other projects.

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.970
But Eclipse IDE is the main project, so they're all open source projects.

10
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.860
So here the latest version of Eclipse IDE is 2020, hyphen or six.

11
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.340
And here this will help you to download an installer using which you can install eclipse IDE.

12
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.510
But let's not do that.

13
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.640
Let's download from here.

14
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.380
From here you can download a zip file which has the eclipse ID.

15
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.180
So let's do that.

16
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.320
And here there are eclipse IDs for different purposes.

17
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.120
So this is for Java developers.

18
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.380
Using this you can develop simple Java SE applications and here is the eclipse IDE for enterprise Java

19
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.190
developers.

20
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.720
So using this particular version, you can develop Java EE applications and this is a superset of this

21
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.360
one, which means that you can also do whatever you can do with this, so you can develop the core Java

22
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.350
C applications or you can also develop Java EE applications.

23
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.700
And this is what we are going to download and there are also eclipse IDs for other purposes for C and

24
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.610
C++ developers, for PHP developers and so on and so forth.

25
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.690
And you can check it out.

26
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.990
So but what we are interested in is this one.

27
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:52.240
So in future you may see the layout may be different, but your goal will be to download this particular

28
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.690
one.

29
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.460
So the path may be different.

30
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.500
The way we reached here could be different, but you should be able to easily figure that out.

31
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.700
And here we have downloads for different operating systems, so we are going to download a 64 bit eclipse.

32
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.000
In my case it's Windows and I have already downloaded that.

33
00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.320
So Eclipse is essentially a Java application and it needs a JVM, which we already have.

34
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:26.170
But if you are using a 32 bit JVM, which is very unlikely in that case, you need to install a 32 bit

35
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.860
eclipse.

36
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.620
So for a 64 bit JVM, we need a 64 bit eclipse, which is what we are going to do here.

37
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.980
But if it is a 32 bit JVM that you have, then you need to install a 32 bit eclipse.

38
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.390
Now, the latest version of Eclipse here does not offer 32 bit eclipse.

39
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.010
So what you need to do is you need to install an older version of Eclipse.

40
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.620
So here are the older versions.

41
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.760
What we have, what we are installing is 2020, hyphen or six.

42
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.400
Then the next older version.

43
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.380
The first older version is this one.

44
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.840
So this is older than this one.

45
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.890
So these are all the previous versions and this is the oldest version.

46
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.470
And you also have older versions than that.

47
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.640
But here this particular one two 2018 hyphen zero nine is the recent, most recent version which is

48
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.190
offering a 32 bit eclipse.

49
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.740
So you can use this downloaded from here.

50
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.990
So it's just a zip file.

51
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.940
So if you click here, you can download it and it essentially downloads a zip file and you just need

52
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.780
to unzip it.

53
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.810
So let me show the drive.

54
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.870
So in the C drive, I have three versions of Eclipse.

55
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.360
Eclipse, and these are two other versions.

56
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.120
And this is the latest version which we just saw.

57
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.130
So this is the oldest version.

58
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.470
So once you unzip it, you will find a folder called Eclipse.

59
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.310
You just need to extract extract that particular folder.

60
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.190
Now, that's what I did when I installed this one.

61
00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.490
But now I have two more versions, so I cannot just extract the Eclipse folder because it's going to

62
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.360
override this.

63
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.600
So I created this particular directory called 2020 hyphen or six, and within that I extracted the eclipse

64
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.170
folder.

65
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.340
So this is Eclipse, and if at all, I want to uninstall it.

66
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.240
All we need to do is just delete this particular folder and we are done with it.

67
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.529
Now here, let's go into eclipse.

68
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.920
So this is the executable.

69
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.520
This is what you will click on in order to launch Eclipse.

70
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.610
Now, like I said earlier, Eclipse is written in Java.

71
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.920
So it's a Java application.

72
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.310
And in order to run it, we need to have JVM installed on our machine.

73
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.660
So if you click here, this particular launcher will look for JVM.

74
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.240
It has a lookup process and the last step is to look up in the path environment variable.

75
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.880
So let's not worry about the lookup process itself.

76
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.500
So it looks for that path in a couple of places, but let's not worry about it.

77
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.640
But since we already have it here and we have it on the we have set the path in the in the path environment

78
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.870
variable, we are good.

79
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.290
Now on my machine it is here.

80
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.090
So I have the JDK 14.

81
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.070
So that's the latest version here.

82
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.220
So you must be having one of the Java versions.

83
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.540
Now for this eclipse, we at least need this particular eclipse.

84
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.040
We at least need Java eight.

85
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.440
Now once we launch it, we can change to a different Java two.

86
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.760
But in order to launch this, we need at least Java eight.

87
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:32.060
Now, if your company is using an older version of Java, let's say Java seven, then what you can do

88
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:39.110
is in order to use this eclipse, download a later version of Java like Java eight or Java 14, like

89
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.890
in my case.

90
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:48.110
But once we launch it, you can still use an older version of Java like Java seven or any other version,

91
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.900
and that I will show in one of the subsequent lectures.

92
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.640
So that's it.

93
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.790
And in the next lecture I will will launch this Eclipse application, and we will write our first Java

94
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.300
program and we will also explore a few features of Eclipse.

95
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.550
Thank you and I will see you in the next lecture.
