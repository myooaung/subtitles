00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,020
Hi there.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,130
This is the Motley Crew.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,070
And welcome back.

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:11,630
So we installed Java, but before we write our first Java program, we need to take a look at an environment

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,250
variable called class path.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,080
An environment variable is simply a variable whose value is visible to the entire environment.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,720
That is, to all processes running within the system.

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,300
So it is like a global variable.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:33,380
And class spat, as the name implies, is simply a path on the file system for locating Java classes.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,440
And it can include more than one path to.

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,750
It is used during both compilation as well as execution of Java programs.

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,620
So class but environment variable is specific to Java.

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,770
For instance, if we run a program by executing the command java space.

14
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:57,220
Hello, then the Java interpreter needs to know where it can locate the helo program, which is nothing

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,720
but hello dot class.

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,320
And to locate the program, it may use the class path.

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,600
For instance, let's say that this is the class path, which includes two paths.

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,350
Then it would first look for a load of class within the directory full within C drive.

19
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,040
So that's the first part.

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,850
And if it is not found there, then it would search in the second part, which includes the bar directory.

21
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,370
And in this case, it finds under bar directory and it would then execute.

22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,280
Hello dot class.

23
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,610
Note that this class path is needed only when we are compiling and running our programs from the command

24
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,030
line.

25
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,860
And it would not be needed if we are using an ID like eclipse.

26
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,670
ID stands for Integrated Development Environment.

27
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:49,030
Initially, we will write our programs in a regular text editor and we will compile and run those programs

28
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,410
from the command line.

29
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,380
But later, we will switch over to Eclipse for writing our Java programs and I will discuss more about

30
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,640
this in the next lecture.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,300
I did discuss about it in the lecture that is specific to installing Java on Windows operating system,

32
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,960
as we had to set a couple of other environment variables.

33
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,130
And those environment variables were not needed for Mac and Linux.

34
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,770
And so we did not discuss it in those lectures.

35
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,320
But in the next lecture we will discuss a little bit about why we are using a text editor initially

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,360
instead of using Eclipse.

37
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:23,560
Now.

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,000
I also don't want to get into any of the details of class path as class part is a little bit more complicated

39
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,160
and we will do that in a later section.

40
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:38,410
But for now we are interested only in finding out whether we need to modify the class part or not.

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,690
First thing we would do is check if there is a class part among the list of environment variables.

42
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,220
If it's not there, then we are good and there is nothing to do and we can move on.

43
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:59,180
And we can also move on if class path is there, but it also includes a dot as a separate path.

44
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,590
It means that either you or somebody else has already added class path.

45
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:11,110
However, if class pod exists but it does not include a dot, then we need to insert one.

46
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,110
And DOT employs current directory.

47
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,870
So if we execute java space hello, then the java interpreter would look at the class path.

48
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:26,950
And the dot in the class path tells Java interpreter to look for class within the same directory where

49
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,200
the Java command is being executed.

50
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,870
And like I said earlier, initially we will run our Java programs from command line before we switch

51
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:40,360
to Eclipse and we will run those programs from the directory where those programs exist.

52
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,100
So Dot should be there in the class path and if it is not there, we need to insert one.

53
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,240
Also, if there is no class pot then it is defaulted to current directory.

54
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,650
So Java interpreter would look for the program in the current directory.

55
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,020
But if last part is there then it overwrites this default property and dot needs to be present.

56
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,400
If Java interpreter has to search in the current directory.

57
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,990
Now let's go ahead and look for class, but I will show it to you on Windows and Mac and Linux.

58
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,860
It is identical to Mac and so I will not be showing it on Linux.

59
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,089
Here we are.

60
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,320
On my windows machine.

61
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,570
So this is the terminal, the command prompt.

62
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:30,520
So let's just execute this command set, and it displays all the environment variables so we can see

63
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:37,660
that there are a lot of environment variables here, and each environment variable has the variable

64
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,190
name and the value.

65
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,500
Now here this is the path environment variable and this is the class path.

66
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,590
You can see that we have the class path here and.

67
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,040
Here it is.

68
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,720
This is my entire class part.

69
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,310
So it is class part.

70
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,470
And it also has this value.

71
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,830
And as we can see, there is a dot here.

72
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,800
And dot is followed by semicolon.

73
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,680
Semicolon is the separator between the paths.

74
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,490
So in this case, we don't have to do anything.

75
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,670
We can just move on.

76
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,930
But in your system, if you do not see class path, then just move on.

77
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:21,170
Or if you see class path, which means that either you or somebody else has set it, then just ensure

78
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,490
that there is dot here.

79
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:29,390
Now if dot is not there, but class path is still there, then we need to set it and to set it we just

80
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,250
have to go into control panel.

81
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,660
And system here.

82
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,360
Click on advanced system settings within the advanced tab.

83
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,080
Click on Environment Variables.

84
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,040
Here we have these two sections, so within system variables.

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,720
So there is this class path.

86
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,290
Just click on that class path and click edit.

87
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,750
Go in the friend and you can add Dot here and follow it with a semicolon.

88
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,600
On unique systems it would be a column, but here it is semicolon.

89
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,240
Just head.

90
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,710
Okay, okay.

91
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:12,030
And open a new command prompt because the old one will not be able to see the change that we have just

92
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,360
made.

93
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:17,070
Just open a new prompt and you will be able to see the the change that we just made.

94
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,360
So that's with that.

95
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,900
Now, let's go ahead and look at the Mac machine.

96
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,920
So this is my Mac.

97
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,010
And I have the terminal open here now.

98
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,280
Just like set on windows here.

99
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,800
We will say E and V and it displays all the environment variables.

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,010
And here also there is class path, but in this case there is no dot in the class path.

101
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,350
So we need to set it now.

102
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,820
So here I'm in the home directory on my Mac.

103
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:59,500
So in order to set it generally we the, the class path will be set either an dot bash, RC file or

104
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,870
dot bash underscore profile.

105
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:08,800
In my case, it has been set in dot bash, underscore profile and you can also do the same on both of

106
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,370
these files.

107
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:16,810
Generally you will find them within the home directory or you may also find them within the etc. directory.

108
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,340
That is, you need to type CD, slash etsy CD and.

109
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:30,240
Slash Etsy and that's where you will you may find in my case it is the bash RC file is here in Etsy

110
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,380
but bash underscore profile file is in the home directory.

111
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,990
So let me just show it to you in the in the bash underscore file and you can also do the same.

112
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,270
So if there is no class path, we are good.

113
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:48,090
But if there is a class path or if you want to add a new class path, then you would have to you can

114
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,700
write it in dot bash, underscore profile.

115
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,530
So let's see.

116
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,620
I'm in the home directory.

117
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:03,050
In order to look at the DOT files, we need to use hyphen a ls space hyphen A and this is the batch

118
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,890
underscore profile.

119
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,940
So let's open it.

120
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,130
So this will open the tax credit.

121
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,520
Now, if you are on a Linux machine, you can use Git.

122
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,550
So you would just say g space dot.

123
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,240
Here it is.

124
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,470
So the command is export space class path equal to the path.

125
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,180
Now, if you want to put a dot here, so put a dot and put a colon here.

126
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,250
So colon is four unique systems, UNIX based systems in windows, we use semicolon.

127
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,950
So that's all there is and just go ahead and save it.

128
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:46,000
Now in order to reflect that we can say source, otherwise it will not be reflected.

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,200
Or you need to open a new terminal and just say Dot.

130
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,580
That's it.

131
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,240
And we can see the dot here.

132
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,870
So that's all there is to setting the class path.

133
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,770
And if bash underscore profile is not there, just go ahead and create it.

134
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,900
And you would say touch space, dot bash, underscore profile and it would create it.

135
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:16,240
And that's the same command you can also use on Ubuntu or other Linux machines.

136
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,960
So that's it and thank you and see you in the next lecture.
