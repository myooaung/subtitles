Hello there.

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.410
This is Lulu and welcome back.

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.560
So we are now done with this course and I hope you have enjoyed learning Java.

4
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.610
Now, if you have done everything systematically, all of the lectures, then I'm sure you have set

5
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.040
a solid foundation in Java and that should be helpful for a very long time.

6
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.580
And on top of that, we have also learned how to use Java in an effective way.

7
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.870
That's because we have learned tons of design principles, best practices and professional coding conventions

8
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.600
that are really very important when you are building large, complex software.

9
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.910
So if you are not sure about something, please do go back and review the concern lectures and make

10
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.680
sure you have learned all of those design principles in a proper way.

11
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.080
I hope you have enjoyed learning it and I would wish you all the best and thank you and happy coding.
