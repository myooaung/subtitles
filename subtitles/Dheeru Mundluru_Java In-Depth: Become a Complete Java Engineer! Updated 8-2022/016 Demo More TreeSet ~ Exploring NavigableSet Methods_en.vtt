00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.950
Hi there let's hope you don't research them all in the previous and I'm off to reset did the competitor

2
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.360
on comparable interfaces which helped in sorting the immense entry said.

3
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.140
All right so now let's go ahead and look at the other that's in research.

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.370
And we will look at the methods in the navigable set interface which are trees or implements and we

5
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.690
know that navigable set extends sockets.

6
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.500
OK.

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.180
So let's go ahead and do that.

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.150
I'm for this we are going to write a new metric called Reset Ahmadu.

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.000
In the last demo it was Tresor demo.

10
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.400
So now let's call it d'esprit said Ahmadu.

11
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.600
Let's go on for this method.

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.860
So let's go ahead and create an instance of research on that referenced I'd be navigable setting because

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.490
we want to use some stats from navigable SEC.

14
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.180
So it's going to be an amicable set of integers.

15
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.470
And let's just use the same numbers which we have used when we discuss navigable set.

16
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.830
So first thing that we are going to test is the methods like lower floor ceiling and higher.

17
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.310
Let's start with that buckets are the elements now.

18
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:34.440
Code space lower and just said Dot lower.

19
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.510
And if you recall the search target was this element and before.

20
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.260
Now let's just go ahead and copy this.

21
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.730
What are log on methodes

22
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.850
or

23
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.670
rocks on this.

24
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.500
So far lower it is returning Gandhigiri because it is less than someone before.

25
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:17.310
So the search target is 74 what floor it is it are getting 74 because it has less than or equal to someone

26
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.040
before the highest the grid system but that is less than or equal to something before unforeseen.

27
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.110
It does it or doning seben be for which is the lowest number which is greater than or equal to 74.

28
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.280
I'm far higher.

29
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.680
It has to be strictly greater than 74.

30
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.290
So it does bending.

31
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.890
We're just running eighty nine here.

32
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.510
OK.

33
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.780
Now let's go ahead and try the first our last methods.

34
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.180
So this would get done the first Iron

35
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.300
last

36
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.160
.

37
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.940
So that's right.

38
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.310
So the hostile Mendez fight on the last element is 89.

39
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.130
OK.

40
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.200
Now that says go ahead and bring the aliments offset all the elements of second.

41
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.860
So here they are.

42
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.240
Now let's invoke the descending set method.

43
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:32.480
Descending set method would have done the reverse few of those Socred sing or dance and nuker dance

44
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.930
and now we get all set so that of pure year can be negligible set or any off that's super interface's

45
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.370
so it can be slaughtered set do what let's just keep who does not have a global set score that does

46
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.070
disinterring said Walts go ahead and burn this

47
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.590
and run it.

48
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.440
So it's going to rain the elements in the reverse order.

49
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.080
So that's the descending second straight forward.

50
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.640
Now let's try out headset.

51
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.040
I'm subsegments.

52
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.660
So let's go get a headset.

53
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:27.540
Say SEC dark headset and let's use this version of headset which comes from navigable circuit and who

54
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:36.050
element let's say 74 and in blue zero Nipissing falls for now.

55
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:44.100
Which means that we want to exclude someone before and it seems it's

56
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.630
the

57
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.800
that school I wouldn't print this.

58
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.850
So as you can see it is you're doing five and 23.

59
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:03.240
OK.

60
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.360
That meant the ultimate goal 74 so soon before it was excluded.

61
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.500
Now he changed it to drew

62
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.690
sword or Dun's 5:23 and 3:53.

63
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:23.760
Next we said does this turn set is back by the origin Utterson which means that if we add anything here

64
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.870
it gets reflected in the order Nosek and vice versa.

65
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.960
So let's go on.

66
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.040
I'd only meant to hurt set

67
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.450
at 6 and next grand

68
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.550
set.

69
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.840
So it should have got reflected.

70
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.970
As you can see it is it occurred here and set looks also print head circles so

71
00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:02.240
that you are 6 iron though it got added in the original set.

72
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.790
Also nexta let's just add one more element

73
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:15.380
you'll see we said that it throws an illegal argument exception if it's if it is outside the range.

74
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.830
Next I'd fall because the elements hard fight starts from fight but should not throw an exception because

75
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.990
we are still within the range because we are talking about headset here on the headset.

76
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.880
Anything less than 7 before is fine so that would be the range on 4 is within that.

77
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.520
As we are fine with that.

78
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:41.160
But let's say if we added 75 then it will generate run by exception.

79
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.350
I know it says a legal argument exception.

80
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.290
He is out of range.

81
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.180
OK so it's got to be either someone before or less than 74.

82
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.910
On any integer below that should be fine.

83
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.990
So let's just call this out next.

84
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.030
Let's try a subset sort of suspend the set elements here.

85
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.460
One more time because four has united and let's say subset

86
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:19.300
on let's get let's get all the elements between 5 and 7.

87
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.240
For now let's see.

88
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.520
So traipsing

89
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.310
in subsetting now.

90
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.010
So we have a subset.

91
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:42.230
So let's just go ahead and ired to do this iron.

92
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:48.680
This should also give any legal argument exception because two is not within the range of 5 274.

93
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.930
Subset will have the elements between 5 and 7 4 but when we add(2) the are 2 it is outside the range

94
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.120
on Soquel.

95
00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:01.170
So an illegal argument exception at line Summerbee Since line 76.

96
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.710
Yes here it is.

97
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.620
So that's what it this.

98
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.590
So let's just change this.

99
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:13.970
And let's finally lifts something in the order you know the set should get reflected in the return set

100
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.960
so it should get reflected in the subset.

101
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.760
So let's go ahead and Bugarach.

102
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.610
I'd say set.

103
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.780
I had something I wanted three under.

104
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.140
Now let's print subset.

105
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.289
So you are adding in the original set and with adding a number between 5 174.

106
00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:44.059
So it should also reflect an subset because the return set here subset is back by the origin of second

107
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:44.490
.

108
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.310
OK so you do this so as you can see.

109
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.170
It also includes 5 6 and 23.

110
00:08:51.200 --> 00:09:00.050
Earlier when a subset was created here it showed how Heidel only 5 and 6 they actually can do 3 was

111
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.470
already there so let's actually add something as undefined.

112
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:11.420
So maybe you go quantify 5 6 1 to 3 unquantified earlier it had only 5 6 and only 3.

113
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:18.710
Now we added 25 and so on we added 1 to 5 in the main set and it got reflected in the subset also.

114
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.510
OK so that's about it.

115
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.590
I think those are the main metrics and they're also not that frequently used.

116
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.070
But if you need it.

117
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.610
So we now know how to use them.

118
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.860
We know that they exist within these methods.

119
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:31.890
So that's about it.

120
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:37.020
And if there are any few other matters like like last ball first so you can just go ahead and try them

121
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.240
out if you're interested.

122
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.480
But these are the made matters.

123
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.210
Thank you and you can find this code in the resource section.

124
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.060
Happy coding.

125
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:45.590
Thank you
