00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.490
Hi there.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.540
This is the Manila Room.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.560
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's now see how we can install Java on a mac operating system.

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.900
So the first thing I want to do is I want to open the terminal.

6
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.600
So just go here in the finder.

7
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.930
Go.

8
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.520
Here you have the go menu item.

9
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.880
So just click on that and click on utilities.

10
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.260
So this is how you would open the terminal.

11
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:33.100
So here, let's just type in Java C, Java C is a Java compiler and it is hyphen version.

12
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.440
So this is to see if Java has been already installed on this machine.

13
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.190
So it says that there is no Java here, so we need to install it.

14
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.030
You can either do Java C hyphen version where Java C, as I said, is the Java compiler, or you can

15
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.400
do Java hyphen version two and Java is the Java interpreter itself.

16
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.730
So that's what you would use if you want to run a Java program.

17
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.019
So even for this, it says that Java is not installed, so we can use either of these two commands.

18
00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.880
So there is a hyphen conversion.

19
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.790
So let's go ahead and install Java on this machine.

20
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.760
So let's open the browser.

21
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.140
So I have already done that.

22
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:24.320
And here just Google for JDK download and the first link is the Oracle website and it shows all the

23
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.100
downloads.

24
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.750
So let's just click this one.

25
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.490
So here are the downloads.

26
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.180
So the latest version as of now is Java ten.

27
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.380
So you might see some other version.

28
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.020
So at the time of this recording, it's Java ten.

29
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.350
So if you see some other version, just go ahead and install that particular version.

30
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.970
Most of the programs have been have been tested using Java eight.

31
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.610
So you can also install Java eight.

32
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.230
Java eight is here.

33
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.010
But I would suggest you can just go ahead and install the latest version.

34
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.090
So here we have JDC and Jerry's.

35
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.990
Since we'll be developing the Java programs, we need to install a JDC so we cannot install Jerry.

36
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.500
If you install Jerry, we cannot develop Java programs.

37
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.190
In order to develop Java programs, we do need the Java development kit.

38
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.890
So let's go ahead and click here on Download.

39
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.790
And in this page.

40
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.320
So here we are.

41
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.400
First thing is you need to accept the license agreement and you need to click here.

42
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.890
This is the link for Mac operating system, so you need to click on this particular link in order to

43
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.910
install Java.

44
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.800
So you would get the the software would be downloaded the installer.

45
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.450
So I have already done that.

46
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.470
So just click on the the DMG file here on the link and it's already downloaded on my machine.

47
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.990
So I'm just going to double click this thing.

48
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.010
And it's a very simple process.

49
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.030
Installing Java on a mac operating system is a very simple process.

50
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.660
So here on this pop up, just click on this icon here.

51
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.850
Okay.

52
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.440
And click continue.

53
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.570
Say install.

54
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.930
You need to enter the password.

55
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.950
Say install software.

56
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.690
Installed, succeeded.

57
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.230
And it says, do you want to move the the JDK 10.1 installer to the trash.

58
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.320
So you can also do that move to the trash.

59
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.820
And that's it.

60
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.150
It has been installed.

61
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.020
Now let's go back to our.

62
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.120
Let me also minimize this.

63
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.110
To the terminal.

64
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.090
And let's now say.

65
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.680
That's it.

66
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.490
So the Java ten version has been installed.

67
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.380
So that's about it.

68
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.180
Now, if you want to uninstall this Java, then what you can do is.

69
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.670
He's here and the go.

70
00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.660
Go to folder.

71
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.800
Here you have slash library.

72
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.170
Just type in Java.

73
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.560
So if you do that here we have these folders, Java, virtual machines, and here it is.

74
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.390
So if you want to uninstall it, just right, click on this and move it to trash.

75
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.120
And with that, it will be uninstalled.

76
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.860
So that's about it.

77
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.560
We have learned how to install Java on a mac operating system.

78
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.300
Thank you.
