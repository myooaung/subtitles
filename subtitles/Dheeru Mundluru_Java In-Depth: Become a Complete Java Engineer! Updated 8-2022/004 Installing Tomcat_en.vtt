00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:02.840
Hi there.

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.950
This is the De La Rue.

3
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:04.850
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.930
Let's now go ahead and install Apache Tomcat, which we said is a servlet container and can also act

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.100
as a web server.

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.660
So we have to go here, Tomcat dot, Apache dot org.

7
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.820
So this is the Apache Tomcat site and it is offered by the Apache Software Foundation, which also has

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.630
many other open source projects.

9
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.650
And Apache Tomcat is one of them.

10
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.670
As we can see here.

11
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.770
It says it's an open source implementation of all of these specifications, like the Java servlet,

12
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.870
Java server pages, Java expression, language and so on.

13
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.810
And here at the left, we have the different downloads.

14
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.640
So Tomcat nine is the latest version.

15
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.650
Here it is if we scroll down so we can see the different versions here.

16
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.280
So mine is a 64 bit windows.

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.970
So I have clicked on this and I have downloaded the ZAP.

18
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.230
Now if you're using some other operating system like Linux or Mac OS, you can click on this one.

19
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.670
That should be good.

20
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.810
Now.

21
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.160
I have already downloaded that.

22
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.590
So once you zip, once you download the zip, just unzip it and you will see a folder there.

23
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.800
Tomcat folder of Apache Tomcat folder.

24
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.680
So just copy that folder into onto your hard disk.

25
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.860
So I have done that.

26
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.440
In my case I have copied into my C drive.

27
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.460
So here it is.

28
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.420
This is the latest version, 9.0. 12.

29
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.580
And I also have different versions here.

30
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.950
The older ones too, like Tomcat seven.

31
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.720
So this is what we have.

32
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.720
And if I double click on this, it has many other subfolders, so we need to start Tomcat in order to

33
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.480
access any websites hosted on Tomcat.

34
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.910
But before we do that, before we can start it here, there is the bin folder.

35
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:08.100
In the bin folder, there are different executables and you can see here that it says Startup Dot,

36
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.169
batch, windows batch file.

37
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:15.150
So this is what we will click in order to start Tomcat on Windows.

38
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.130
Now if you're using Mac or Linux, you would use the startup shell script.

39
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.970
This is the one.

40
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.830
But the thing that is important is before you do this, you have to ensure that the Java underscore

41
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.260
home environment variable is set.

42
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.680
Now in one of the earlier beginning sections, we have shown how that can be done on a Windows machine,

43
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.220
how Java underscore home environment variable can be set.

44
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.560
So I'm sure you know that.

45
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.850
And for Linux and Mac also, we had a lecture where we have shown how to set class path environment

46
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.450
variable.

47
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.900
So for Java underscore home also it would be a similar process.

48
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.430
We have shown it for on Mac, but it's the same process for Linux too.

49
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.640
So in my machine it's a window.

50
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.490
So if I go into control panel and.

51
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.850
Here system.

52
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.610
I'm just showing you once again, advanced system settings.

53
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.350
Here it is under the advanced tab.

54
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.180
Click on environment variables.

55
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.640
And here it is.

56
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.560
So I have Java underscore home.

57
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.350
If it's not there, go ahead and click on new and enter Java underscore how home and also the path to

58
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.250
the JDK, the root directory of JDK.

59
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.220
So that should do.

60
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.300
If you do not do that, then you cannot start Tomcat.

61
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.150
So that's it.

62
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.940
So this is the bin folder and it has all of these different executables.

63
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.980
In order to shut down, we click on this shutdown batch file executable.

64
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.840
So let me just go back.

65
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.430
So that's the bin folder.

66
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.280
Then we have the conf folder which has some configuration files and we are going to edit one of them.

67
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.430
Library will have the different jar files.

68
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:12.180
For instance, here the servlet API is for the servlet library and if you also need any other third

69
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.250
party libraries, you can also add it here.

70
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.240
And the important one here is web apps.

71
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.310
So within the Web apps folder, we will deploy our web applications.

72
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.090
So if you create a web application, you would copy it here.

73
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.060
And if you have more than one web application, all of those web applications will be copied here.

74
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.180
Later, in a subsequent lecture, we will see how that can be done because we are going to deploy a

75
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.110
web application.

76
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.850
So that's what the web apps and like we have all the libraries and losses.

77
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:55.470
If there are any errors on Tomcat, then you can find those error messages in the log files here.

78
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.370
So that's what it is.

79
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.320
And let's not worry about work for now.

80
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:06.990
So one thing I would say is let's go into conf and let me open this file called server dot xml.

81
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.650
Let me open it with notepad plus plus.

82
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:20.580
So here it's an XML file and if we scroll down here under server here, so there is this connector port

83
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:29.340
is 88, you can leave it as 88 but looks like how some other version of Tomcat which is running on 88

84
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.720
on this port number.

85
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.580
So this is the TCP port number.

86
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.600
So I'm going to use this four nines.

87
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.080
You can also do that on a production system.

88
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.550
You can have it as a RT, which is the default port for HTTP.

89
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.260
Now if you use this number, you would have to include the port number in the web address.

90
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.420
So let's keep it like that.

91
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.790
Now, let's go ahead and just start.

92
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.390
Tomcat.

93
00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:01.840
So let's go back here into the bin directory and let me just click on Startup.

94
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.290
That said, it has started.

95
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.670
Now, let me go here and let me just say.

96
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.880
Local host.

97
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.620
It's already here, let me say.

98
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.130
Nine, nine, nine.

99
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.920
Local host.

100
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.110
Colon, the port number, which is nine.

101
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.680
Nine, nine.

102
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.470
If you see the screen, it means that installation is successful.

103
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.380
If not, maybe there is some issue with the port number.

104
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:35.560
Maybe you also have some other Tomcat instance running on that port, or maybe some minor issue which

105
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.900
you can Google and find out.

106
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.810
So that's the thing.

107
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.140
But if you see this screen, it means that everything is working fine.

108
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.150
And localhost, you would do this when you are testing on your local machine.

109
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.080
And instead of this, you can also say 127.

110
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.010
.0.0.1.

111
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.310
It's an IP address for localhost and that would also be fine.

112
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:04.210
But on a server you would use the IP address of the server or you can also or even here you can use

113
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.390
the IP address of this particular machine and that would also work fine.

114
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.520
But normally when you're developing, you would just say localhost and you would use a port number if

115
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.300
there is any.

116
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.270
And that's it.

117
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.510
So that's how you would install Tomcat.

118
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.980
And thank you.
