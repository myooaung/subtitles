00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,130
Hi there.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,300
This is De La Rue.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,230
And welcome back.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,560
In this lecture, we will discuss the absolute basic concepts of the web, and we will also do a short

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,180
demo at the end of this lecture.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,990
On the worldwide web, we have a client server model where the client can be something like a browser

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:28,220
which is being used by some user, and the server is a computer that serves some content and the user

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,050
needs some information from the server.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:39,050
So the client would request for some resource via URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator,

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,260
which means that it helps in locating the resource.

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,770
So the server finds the resource and sends it back to the client as a response.

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,870
And the resource is typically a web page which is rendered in the browser.

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:03,110
And this entire client server communication on the web takes place via the HTTP protocol where HTTP

14
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,470
stands for hypertext transfer protocol.

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,240
As the name implies, it's a protocol that transfers hypertext.

16
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:20,300
And by hypertext we mean HTML content where HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is the

17
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,910
language that web pages are implemented in.

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,390
Although other content can also be transferred on the web.

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,170
HTML pages are the ones that typically get transferred.

20
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,780
So http protocol transfers.

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,890
HTML pages.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,170
An extra deep protocol runs on top of the TCP IP protocol.

23
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,960
If you do not know what TCP IP is, then you can Google for TCP IP and learn more about it.

24
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:52,010
And finally, let's be thankful to this gentleman, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide

25
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,880
Web, which is one of the greatest discoveries of our times.

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,150
It is one of the reasons why you and I are connected today.

27
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,800
We are this online course.

28
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:08,830
Let's now look at the key elements that make up a hedge tip request which a client sends to the server.

29
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:16,720
First one is the HTTP method, which specifies the type of operation the client is requesting.

30
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:23,680
For instance, a client might request some information from the server or might be submitting some information

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,380
via a form, or might be updating some information, or might be deleting something by clicking on a

32
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,220
delete button.

33
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,540
Such actions are identified by a HTTP method.

34
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,490
Here we have a list of HTTP methods like get post put and so on.

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,240
Get and post are the most commonly used ones.

36
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:51,970
Get, as the name implies, suggests that client wants to get some information from the server that

37
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,400
is he or she wants to retrieve some information.

38
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,280
For instance, in an E commerce website, you might be viewing a list of products, and when you click

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,900
on a particular product, you would see information on that product in a new web page.

40
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:13,240
So as soon as you click on the product, a HTTP request with get as the HTTP method is generated and

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:19,300
some unique information about the product is passed to the server so that the server can respond back

42
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,550
with the entire product information.

43
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:30,650
Similarly, post implies that the client is posting some information to the server which results in

44
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,320
creation of a new resource on the server.

45
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,650
For example, when you sign up on a website, you would fill out a form with your details like name,

46
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,450
date of birth, email and so on.

47
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:48,350
And when you hit the submit button, a HTTP request with post as the history type method would be generated

48
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,830
along with all of the form details which you have entered and on the server, a new user account would

49
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,990
be created for you and the resource would be something like a database row in a table.

50
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:00,680
Right.

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,810
So that's the new user account.

52
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,030
So the resource is the new user account.

53
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,190
Another key element is the URL itself.

54
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:16,209
That is the location from where we want to fetch some information or in case of post, submit some information.

55
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,660
Then we have the form parameters, which is nothing but the data that we submit through a form.

56
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,590
And in case of that, it could be something like a movie title whose details we want to fetch.

57
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:38,310
That is, the user would enter the movie title in a search box and the server would return all the movies

58
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,420
matching the title.

59
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,930
So when the user hits the search button, we say that a get request is generated on the title that the

60
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,790
user entered would be appended to the URL.

61
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:57,820
As we see here over here, title equal to Lincoln would be the form parameter where the movie name is

62
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,450
Lincoln.

63
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:07,650
So in get form parameters are appended to the URL itself with question mark symbol serving as the delimiter

64
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,590
between the URL and the form parameters.

65
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:19,990
And in case of post, such form parameters are not appended to the URL, but they are sent separately

66
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:27,100
as part of the HTTP request, and that separate entity is referred to as a message, body or payload.

67
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,080
It's also called a payload.

68
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,840
And as we can see in this example, form parameters represent some user registration details.

69
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:43,440
Next request will also include something called request headers, which includes some additional information.

70
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:51,010
And one of them is the user agent, which gives information about what browser the client is using along

71
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,470
with information such as the operating system.

72
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,300
And this could be used by the server to give customized response.

73
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,080
For example, if the request comes from a PC, then the server might send back a particular web page.

74
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:12,010
But if the request happens to be coming from a smartphone, then the server would return a lighter version

75
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,450
of the same web page.

76
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,780
That is, some of the information which is not that important would not be included in the web page.

77
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,540
And there's also a header called Accept, which tells what kind of content the browser can accept.

78
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,190
So these are just a few of the headers and there are a few more too.

79
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:37,380
So these are the key elements that form a HTTP request.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,770
On similar to tip request.

81
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,590
Let's also look at the key elements that make up a HTTP response, the response that is coming from

82
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,850
the server to the client.

83
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:55,080
First one is the HTTP status code, which indicates whether the corresponding HTTP request has been

84
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,700
successfully completed or not.

85
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,640
For instance, a status code of 200 indicates that the request has succeeded.

86
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:09,480
Similarly, a status code of 404 implies that the server could not find the requested resource.

87
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,900
And these are just a few important status codes.

88
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,340
And there are also a few more.

89
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,480
Response would also include something called ASC content type, which tells the type of content the

90
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,530
response contains.

91
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:30,750
An example is text slash HTML, which indicates that the response is in HTML format and looking at it,

92
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,180
the browser knows that it needs to process the HTML and render it in the UI.

93
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,940
Similarly application slash PDFs suggest that the response is PDF document.

94
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,830
So looking at it, the browser would launch a PDF viewing software.

95
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,330
Our next, we have the actual response content itself, like the web page content.

96
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,460
And there will also be some headers included in the response, just like in the case of a HTTP request.

97
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,150
And one of them is the information about the server.

98
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,230
In this example, it is Apache Tomcat, which is the server.

99
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,380
Another header is the content type, which we just discussed.

100
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,130
Now finally, let's quickly look at the anatomy of a URL in this example URL.

101
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:31,690
W w w dot IWO is the server name, and this name maps to a unique IP address of the server which looks

102
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,909
similar to the one shown in parentheses.

103
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:41,020
In fact, in the URL you can also replace the server name with the IP address and it will still work.

104
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:49,470
On this part here is called as the part which also assists the server in locating the resource.

105
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,320
And profile HTML would be the actual resource itself.

106
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:02,400
Now this particular website would be running on something called a TCP port, which is a 16 bit number

107
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,560
that identifies a specific program on the server like this particular website.

108
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,370
And you can have different services running on the same server, but on different ports.

109
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:21,120
So here this website is a service and so you can have similar kind of services running on different

110
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,660
ports.

111
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:30,970
And since a TCP port is a 16 bit number, we can have as many as 65,000 536 ports.

112
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,750
That is true to the port of 16 and hence the same number of services running on the server.

113
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:47,260
And out of this 65,005, 36 ports, ports 0 to 1023 are reserved for well-known services.

114
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,410
For instance, 21 is for FTP.

115
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,150
23 is for Telnet, and 80 is for HTTP.

116
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:01,750
And four for three is for HTTPS, which is a secure version of HTTP.

117
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,000
So our website here or most websites run on port 80.

118
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:13,350
Websites can also run on other ports, but 80 is the default one for http.

119
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,510
For instance, a common alternative to a tea is 8080.

120
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:26,510
Since it's not the default port, this port number would have to be explicitly specified in the URL.

121
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:33,410
As we can see here, the server name is followed by a colon, which is in turn followed by 88.

122
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:42,560
Essentially such a port number that is other than 80 should fall outside the range of 0 to 1 023 as

123
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,380
that range is for well-known services.

124
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,150
So that's about it.

125
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,240
Now let me just give a short demo where we can see a real get and post request in a browser.

126
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:01,370
Here we are in the three tier system, Ivo, and we are inside my account.

127
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,270
So I have logged into the system to refresh your memory.

128
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:12,140
So trivial is a bookmarking app is a social bookmarking app which is being developed in my company and

129
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:19,820
it allows us to bookmark articles on the web or books that are within this system, within the three

130
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,840
tier system or the movie titles which, which are in the mobile system.

131
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:30,020
Now I have clicked on the movies link and it is showing all of the movies that I have watched.

132
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,680
So these are all the ones that I bookmark as being watched.

133
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,960
And there are also some to do list here.

134
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:42,740
So the browser that I'm using is Firefox and I'm going to demonstrate both the get requests and also

135
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,240
the post requests.

136
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,130
Every browser also comes with something called as developer tools and for Firefox we have to use the

137
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,740
shortcut key F tool.

138
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,280
So let me hit F.

139
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,290
Well, here it is.

140
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,760
So these are the developer tools and it has different tabs here.

141
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,290
One of them is network.

142
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:10,100
So just make sure that you are under this network tab and it allows us to look at the network traffic

143
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:16,370
that is being generated as we click on different links or when we submit some search forms.

144
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,990
And there are also other things like the debugger, for instance, can be used for debugging.

145
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,790
So it's a very useful tool.

146
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,480
So let's just focus on the network now.

147
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,310
So let me go ahead and click on this link.

148
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:36,940
If we click on this link, it shows all the movies which are in my to do list, so which I want to watch.

149
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:43,240
And if you look at here, here in this area, it shows that show to do is equal to two.

150
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,920
So that's the form parameter.

151
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:51,310
So a form parameter need not be is not constrained to just when we submit the forms, it can also be

152
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,680
in this way it can be hardcoded.

153
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,690
So let me just go ahead and click it.

154
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:03,050
And we can see a bunch of requests being generated because there are a lot of images and each of those

155
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,740
images will also send separate requests to the server.

156
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,570
So this is the main one.

157
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,230
It says the method is get and this is the URL.

158
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,240
So let me just click on this one.

159
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,880
So when I click that.

160
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,990
Here it is.

161
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,630
So here we have both the get the request as well as the response data.

162
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,330
For instance, here, this is the request URL.

163
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,550
So you can see the full URL here.

164
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,590
And as you can see, the HTTP is the protocol that is being used.

165
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,370
So that's what we see here.

166
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:43,300
And this is the server name and this is the the location where we are submitting the request to the

167
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,170
location.

168
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,570
And this is the form parameter here.

169
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,810
We are saying that show to do is equal to true.

170
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,250
So that is what enables the server to send this data.

171
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,470
That is, we want to see only the data that is in the to do list.

172
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:07,420
Now the request method, the HTTP method is get and this server name is mapped to this IP address and

173
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,130
there is also this port number 80, which is the default port number for HTTP.

174
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,510
So that's what it is.

175
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,090
And in the response, we also have the status code and it says that it is 200, which means that the

176
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,380
request has been processed successfully and the version of HTTP is 1.1.

177
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,620
So that's some of the request and response data.

178
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,290
And here there is the.

179
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:30,500
Bottom.

180
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,690
We have the headers also we said that both requests as well as response have some headers.

181
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,700
So these are some headers.

182
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:43,520
For instance, these this are the request headers and one of them is accept, which we discussed.

183
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:50,240
So it says text slash XHTML, application slash XHTML and so on.

184
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,010
We already discussed it.

185
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:59,520
They just suggest what kind of content the browser can accept, the browser can process.

186
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,000
Then we also discussed about the user agent, which is at the very bottom here.

187
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,410
So it gives information about the browser operating system and so on.

188
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:14,810
And there are also a bunch of other headers here like the host cookie and so on.

189
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,760
So that's the request headers.

190
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,040
And we also have some response headers here, content language, content type I mentioned about this.

191
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,750
So it tells about the response that is included in the body of the response.

192
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,180
So it is going to be text slash HTML.

193
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,350
And one other response header I mentioned was server in this.

194
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,450
In this case, it is Apache Coyote.

195
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,910
So those are the HTP request and response parameters.

196
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,420
And if we click here on the response.

197
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,570
So this is the actual response itself.

198
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,740
As you can see, there is some HTML content here, over here.

199
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,630
So that's the request.

200
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,930
Now, let me show you the response for response.

201
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:02,940
Let me click on articles which shows all of the web page links that I have collected.

202
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,290
So here are a bunch of links.

203
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,340
Let me click on edit for this one.

204
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,760
So I'm trying to edit some information.

205
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,820
So this is a link to a very good article on sublets.

206
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,060
And so I have all of this.

207
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:25,320
Now let me go ahead and change this rating to Best.

208
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:35,220
And when I submit this, it will generate a post request and that is included in a called form.

209
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,510
We will look at that later.

210
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,130
But let me go ahead and click click on this thing edit article.

211
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,800
So as you can see, you can see that it generates a post.

212
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,540
So it is submitting all of this information to the server and we get back the response to.

213
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,970
So this is the response and the rating has been updated to the best here.

214
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,280
So that's the post request.

215
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,800
Let me just show it to you once again.

216
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,839
I just wanted to show you the post here.

217
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,230
So if I click on post, here it is.

218
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,210
Now it's right.

219
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,369
So it's just the same thing.

220
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,290
Once again, this is the URL.

221
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,770
This is a new URL and the HTTP method is post.

222
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,390
Once again, it's the same remote address for status code.

223
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,190
It is three or two.

224
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,160
It's not 200, but that is fine.

225
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,490
We can discuss about three or two later if you have time.

226
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,540
And then once again there are some response and request headers.

227
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,140
So that's how it is.

228
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,570
So if I click on this edit, let me click on that.

229
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,580
So I said that this is a form and the post is a post request is being submitted.

230
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,960
So let's look at some of the HTML tags too.

231
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:58,720
So if you right click on this on this page and if you select view page source, it shows us the HTML

232
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,440
content.

233
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,810
So this is what we have here.

234
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,910
So at the top we have the HTML.

235
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,790
So this is a tag, a HTML tag.

236
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,650
And so this is the starting tag and we also have the ending tag for every starting tag.

237
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,920
And then there is the head of some.

238
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,400
It's also a tag and the body starts here.

239
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,610
This is the body which contains the real body of the Web page.

240
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,880
So let me just scroll down here.

241
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,650
So this is the form.

242
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,380
This is a tag called this form.

243
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,690
It has all of these elements.

244
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,380
This is this represents the form and it has all of these elements.

245
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,940
Now, here we are saying that the method is post.

246
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,410
So this is what how you would specify it.

247
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,110
You can also make it as get.

248
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,850
And this is the destination where you want to send all of the all of the data that we are entering in

249
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,420
the form.

250
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,750
And then there are all of these different elements.

251
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:58,840
So these are text boxes to text boxes and for text box, this is the tag that is used.

252
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:05,770
Input type equal to text type suggests that it's a text box and there is also the URL.

253
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,090
This is the name of the text box.

254
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:14,200
Similarly, there is also a text box for title and these are called checkboxes.

255
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:20,290
You may be familiar familiar with all of this, but there may be some students who are absolutely new

256
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,100
to HTML.

257
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,320
So I have to explain it.

258
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:28,600
So these are checkboxes and for checkboxes you have this input type equal to checkbox and once again

259
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:34,300
there is a name here and that name would be used on the server side to get the value that is selected.

260
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,490
And so there are two checkboxes and there were three ratings here.

261
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,200
These are radio buttons and only one of them can be selected here for checkboxes.

262
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,000
You can serve either of both of them.

263
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,980
So for radio buttons, it is input type equal to radio and there is a naming.

264
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,750
There is a name too for that.

265
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,860
And other than that, there is this dropdown here.

266
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,850
And for that we use something called us select.

267
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,740
Let me just show you.

268
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,580
Here it is.

269
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,130
It has the Select.

270
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,340
This is the tag.

271
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:10,880
And all of the different options in the dropdown are here that indicated using the stockholders option.

272
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,830
So those are the the different UI elements and the corresponding tags.

273
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,290
Now, there are also a bunch of tags here.

274
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,140
Some of hyperlinks.

275
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,090
These are the hyperlinks.

276
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,790
These are the links in the navigation and a link to represent a link.

277
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,600
We use the anchor tag here and this is the destination.

278
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,920
It's called as an attribute.

279
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,590
Ref is an attribute.

280
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,460
And if you click on that link, a request would be sent to this particular URL.

281
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:43,880
So articles, books, movies that you see here, you can see them here, articles, books, movies and

282
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,270
all.

283
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,500
And the anchor tag also has an ending tag over here.

284
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,600
Okay.

285
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,500
So that's that.

286
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,480
And Dive is another important tag.

287
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,440
And that's the body.

288
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,130
And there's also some JavaScript code here.

289
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,700
And some CSEs here.

290
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,940
So that's like a high level overview of some HTML content.

291
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:12,600
And then when you the actual submit button is here, it also has to be as part of the form tag.

292
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,080
So the form tag is ending here and this is the submit button.

293
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,410
And when you hit submit, all of the data that you have entered in the form would be sent to the server.

294
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,880
And and it would be sent to this particular destination in the form tag you have this action attribute.

295
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,750
It will be sent to this destination.

296
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,580
And that's it.

297
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,550
Another important tag is the table tags.

298
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,340
So this is another page on top.

299
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,160
It shows all of the programming languages that are popular and Java is the most popular one here.

300
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,820
So once again, you have all of these.

301
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:53,300
So let me click on F12 once again to open the developer tool.

302
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,250
And this is the network.

303
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,660
Let me resubmit this page.

304
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,210
I just want to show you the table tag.

305
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:02,900
Okay.

306
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,610
So this is this is a table.

307
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,340
It has rows and some columns.

308
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,160
So let me hit on this inspector here.

309
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:18,010
And let me hit this button here so you can see here, if I click here, it says Table here.

310
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:24,170
As you can see, table in the in the left corner here in this area, you will see that it says table

311
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,670
and it's has t head, which is for the headers here.

312
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,730
So that's the table tag.

313
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:39,230
Now, if I click here in the first row so you can see that tag over there and the PR corresponds to

314
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,390
this entire row.

315
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,850
And then you can see that TDI, TDI is this particular cell and it has a value one.

316
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,860
Similarly, this is another TDI.

317
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,990
This has the second cell.

318
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:57,710
And if you move to the second row, we it shows a new row and it has one, two, three, four, five,

319
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,890
one, five, five, two, these five cells.

320
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,750
So that's what you can see here.

321
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,790
So that's how it is.

322
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:12,530
You have the rows and rows are represented using PR and the individual cells are a within a row are

323
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,290
represented using TDI tax.

324
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,760
So that's the table tag.

325
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,590
So that's a high level overview of HTML two.

326
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,280
So that's about it.

327
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:27,680
