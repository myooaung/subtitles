00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:02,969
Hi there.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:03,540
This is David.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,090
And welcome back.

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,810
Now, let's go ahead and look at the solution for our exercise.

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,510
So here is the card price estimate or class.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,330
And I hope you were able to complete it.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,880
In case you could not implement it correctly, then this short discussion should be very helpful.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:26,060
But if you are able to complete it successfully, and if your solution has passed the online test,

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,790
then you can still look at this solution so that you can compare it your version with the version that

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,689
we have here.

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,170
So this is the get sale price method, which you are supposed to implement.

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,500
So let's just look at the solution.

13
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,720
So here we the sale price is initialized and here we have the first condition.

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:52,820
So we said that if the age of the car is less than or equal to ten, then the price depreciates by 5%

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,040
of the original sale price.

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,640
So the depreciated value is computed in this way.

17
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,960
It takes the age of the car, which is here.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,269
Age of the car is computed here, which it's already given to you.

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:13,780
And we are multiplying it with the sale price times .05 as the price.

20
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,600
Here we are saying the price depreciates by 5% of the original sale price.

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,660
So this is the original sale price and it is going to be reduced by 5%.

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:33,640
And that is done for this value, the age of the car and that is the price depreciated and we are subtracting

23
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,470
that from the sale price.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,660
So the sale price is being recalculated here and we have the condition.

25
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:48,370
So if the car is over ten years old, then we said that we are going to return this 10% of the sale

26
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:48,970
price.

27
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,860
So that's what we are returning here.

28
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,620
And that's it.

29
00:01:54,070 --> 00:02:00,220
Here we had a small node like use compound arithmetic assignment operators wherever it is possible,

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,740
so it's not required there.

31
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,990
But let's look at the security features here.

32
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,870
So the condition is if Card does not have at least two airbags and ABS and EBD.

33
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,220
In that case, you would have to reduce the sale price by $1,000.

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,110
So that's what we are doing here.

35
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,230
So if the car we have the condition here.

36
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:27,670
So if the car has all of these conditions, if all of these conditions are true, then we we do not

37
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,670
have to reduce the price and we just keep the if.

38
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:38,170
BLOCK But if it does not, how if the at least one of these conditions would fail, then a false would,

39
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:44,350
then this entire expression would return a false and not false would be true and the sale price would

40
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,670
be reduced by $1,000.

41
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,510
So here the requirement is that all of the conditions have to be met, otherwise the sale price would

42
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,290
be reduced.

43
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,480
So we are using the note operation here and the next is comfort features.

44
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,800
This is pretty simple.

45
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:05,920
We are saying if the car has a rear view camera and so because of that, we are using this and symbol

46
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,370
here.

47
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,620
And we are we are saying either sunroof or auto AC has to be there.

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,010
If in that case only then we will increase the price by $500.

49
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:25,690
So if the rear view camera is true, and if one of these is true, then it is sufficient and we can

50
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,800
increase the sale price.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,250
So we have the comfort features that are required by this logic.

52
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,520
And this is straight forward.

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,530
If has accident history is true, then we reduce the price by $400.

54
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,620
Now, next one is based on additional miles driven.

55
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,990
So we have the additional miles completed here.

56
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:50,390
And we are saying if the number of miles over driven, that is the additional miles is greater than

57
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,900
1000.

58
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,550
So that's what we have here.

59
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,790
And if it is less than or equal to 10,000, then reduce the sale price by 500.

60
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,220
Similarly, we have two more conditions here, two more if statements.

61
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:10,130
So the first one is if miles over driven is greater than 10,000, that is represented by this boolean

62
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,140
condition and less than or equal to 30,000, reduce the sale price by 1000.

63
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,510
And if the miles over driven is greater than 30,000, reduce it by 1500.

64
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,670
And we are finally retaining the value here.

65
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,210
So that said, let me we also have the main method here.

66
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,380
Let me just run it once.

67
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,490
With some values.

68
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,600
So here it is.

69
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:39,120
So the age of the car is two because we are passing 2018 and the sale after depreciation is 18,000.

70
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,820
So that's what is being computed.

71
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:48,330
So initial value is 20,000 because we are passing Ford, EcoSport and Ford for Ford EcoSport, the value

72
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,590
returned is 20,000 and the age of the car is two.

73
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,790
And based on that.

74
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,160
Here we are computing this and 2000 is reduced.

75
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:09,680
After applying this logic and we are printing the value which is 18,000 and then after the security

76
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,860
features has been applied because we are passing to here and true and false.

77
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,950
So which means that it did not have this false represents the bead has a bead and because of that the

78
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,550
price was reduced and the car also did not have.

79
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,020
The conditions that we have for comfort features.

80
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:35,140
So it remained at 17,000 and there was a finally we are passing through, which means that there has

81
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,690
been an accident and the price is further reduced.

82
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,660
And finally, here we are passing 60,000.

83
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,850
60,000.

84
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,180
Okay.

85
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,500
So for 60,000, it was overdriven and the overdriven distance is greater than 30,000.

86
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,680
And because of that, we were reducing the price by 1500.

87
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,290
So the final price was 15,000.

88
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,400
And that's it.

89
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,390
And.

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,250
Hope you like this exercise.

91
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,270
And that's it.

92
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,050
And thank you.

93
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,370
And see you in the next lecture.
