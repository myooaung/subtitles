1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.719
You can always go ahead and continue extending our project.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.070
So earlier we made changes in the data store class.

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.620
OK.

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.790
So we changed everything.

5
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.700
Today all sectors from the collections framework chapter.

6
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.630
So now let's go ahead and continue making changes in the other classes.

7
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.450
So lunch not Djala.

8
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.920
Here it is.

9
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.650
So we have loaded that down.

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.870
And the next thing that we are doing here is in the stock method.

11
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.480
Here it is understocked meant there is going to be for each user it's going to similar browsing OK the

12
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.250
bookmarking process.

13
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.510
So that's what it is going to do.

14
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.930
And Peukert response to the browser and we have this method called us but also we are passing a single

15
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.320
user on the set of all bookmarks.

16
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.030
Now here is after loading the dot we are fetching the users and also the bookmarks.

17
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.900
OK but here are the users still using this.

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.260
The idea is so we need to change that.

19
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:07.080
So let's make it less of user and make this

20
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.110
list awfullest off bookmark.

21
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.000
And this data is being fetched using the manager's.

22
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.600
OK.

23
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.280
So we are using the manager's files.

24
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.320
So let's go there.

25
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.030
Here it is on managers is in walking the dog layer.

26
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.330
Here it is andar is actually in the database.

27
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.570
Normally the database calls are made from the Doblin.

28
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:50.010
So let's dig this line in the user dhal and exchange this to this user is being invoked from use on

29
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.470
manager Nerdist simply returning the data that it gets from Dow.

30
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.140
So change that.

31
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.100
And if you're going to launch not Java.

32
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.990
So this has also changed.

33
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.840
So no more compassionate and this line.

34
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.410
Now let's do the same thing.

35
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.680
Heard this and here it as bookmarks manager which is in marking bookmarks dhal which is in Woking to

36
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.300
get bookmarks method here.

37
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.430
So let's just dig this new the same thing again.

38
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.420
We did a story this one in the bookmark manager.

39
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:36.270
Also we do the same thing and and launch Also we do the same thing on the compilation and it has gone

40
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.260
.

41
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.760
Now these are some Brentham that that's it's not really about that for now actually we can change that

42
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.510
also does make it less or more.

43
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:58.000
We are done with that and the browse method in view is expecting this.

44
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:07.590
So we can change this to the launch is clear of all completion errors.

45
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.850
Now here we are in the view and we are getting the bookmarks and we are iterating through each of the

46
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.880
bookmarks here.

47
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.990
So that's the first thing here we are simulating a user who is going to bookmark.

48
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.560
OK.

49
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.240
Bookmarks all of them all of the bookmarks.

50
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.670
He's going to bookmark some of them.

51
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.420
So we are simulating that.

52
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.310
So we just need to change this.

53
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.640
OK.

54
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.410
So in the foster tradition or it's going to be web links in the second movies under the hood you're

55
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.360
just going to be books and he's looking at each of the bookmarks here.

56
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.780
OK.

57
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.820
So the users are directing is looking at each of the bookmarks here.

58
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.520
OK.

59
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.460
So this one would be bookmarklet this for loop and this second for loop as for individual bookmarks

60
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.640
within that particular type of bookmark.

61
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.050
So in the first iteration it would be ramblings.

62
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.340
And the second it would be movies and in the third box.

63
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.900
Now here we are in the in the previous version we are restricting the user to on the bookmark a certain

64
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.870
number of bookmarks.

65
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.490
OK.

66
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.690
Beyond that he cannot bookmark.

67
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.350
So that's some inflexibility I think we can remove got now bookmark bookmark the user can bookmark any

68
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.570
number of bookmarks.

69
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.190
OK Max limit would be bookmarks Dawk.

70
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.490
I mean the maximum number of bookmarks is that the system has.

71
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.260
So that is done.

72
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.840
So seems like this is also done on we know that the bookmarking decision is made we are randomisation

73
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:44.290
But if we are going to implement the iPod later we will get the decision from the user interface itself

74
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.420
.

75
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.150
OK.

76
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.950
And the same thing is also happening after bookmarking if the user happens to be an editor or the chief

77
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.480
editor.

78
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.540
The user can actually set the bookmark as kid friendly.

79
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.880
OK so this is a code for that if in case you have forgotten you can just go back.

80
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.740
You can view that court on Similarly the book here.

81
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.300
This court will well will see if the book if the particular bookmark can be shared or.

82
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.540
The third party site or not.

83
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.440
And all of the decisions here get shared decision and get good the state as a decision.

84
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.750
So all the decisions are done via randomisation.

85
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:31.170
Hopefully we will change that also to take the input from the user from the UI or see what we now hear

86
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.540
.

87
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:41.600
OK so once the user in the view here once the user is bookmarking an item we are invoking the same user

88
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.120
bookmark.

89
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.810
So lets go there.

90
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:52.560
Ancel user bookmark is this method is in the book month manager and a Saudi It is an bookmark controller

91
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.030
on the control tower.

92
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.550
So from the UI from the view part we are invoking the controller.

93
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.750
Thats the normal process.

94
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.340
Any any web application in and which follows and MVC framework model from the controller we are invoking

95
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.580
the same method a set of user book Walk and bookmark manager in the Manager class.

96
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.890
So here we are creating this instance called user bookmark which is passed to user and bookmark.

97
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.710
So you may recall that we are creating this user bookmark instance and we are saying that it is being

98
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.440
bookmarked by this particular user.

99
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.510
OK.

100
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:33.570
Its in the user user is the input on that particular user as bookmarking this particular book back.

101
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:40.650
OK so which user is bookmarking which bookmark as something that is stored in this in this instance

102
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.590
Hanaford is an instance off of eyeblink than we are doing something we are actually downloading the

103
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.660
link and we are writing it here.

104
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:49.560
So.

105
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.430
So thats all information so we have and we have implemented quite a bit so far.

106
00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:02.340
And here we are in walking does save user a bookmark because we want to save this information to the

107
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.710
database so we are working there.

108
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.480
So lets go here on this doll as being past the user bookmark.

109
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:16.770
And it is been walking the odd method in the store so lets more there and here it is on this odd method

110
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:17.150
.

111
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.380
Ideally it would insert the date time to the database.

112
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:26.070
But since we are managing everything in the date just across are distorting the use bookmark information

113
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.570
in this user bookmarks ID.

114
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.190
OK.

115
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.400
So we are going to change that also because we want only data structures from collections frameworks

116
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:45.500
so lets go here use our bookmarks and its changed list of user bookmark

117
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:56.140
.

118
00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:58.620
So that's changed

119
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:06.320
.

120
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.080
And we are starting it with that.

121
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:17.160
And we don't need this also anymore.

122
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.200
It's here you can just remove that.

123
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.150
Keeping track of the index.

124
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.300
So thats about it.

125
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:38.070
So let me just your on this here at On-Star Java keynoting data and user are browsing items

126
00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:45.540
user 3 user 4 and so on and we are done.

127
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.530
So you're done with that.

128
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.410
So we have change the program we have extended it now.

129
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:57.630
All ideas are removed and we have replaced them vet who had done with the collections framework data

130
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.380
structures.

131
00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:58.610
Okay.

132
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:06.160
And we got the benefit off of not having to use fixed size data structures.

133
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.480
Okay.

134
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:11.400
During recreation time we had to set the fixed the size of Doddie that's no longer needed.

135
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.020
And that did us actors are also automatically extendable.

136
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.420
So it's a small change but a nice change.

137
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:17.790
Okay.

138
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:25.670
So we could clearly see the benefit that we how of using data us in the collections framework.

139
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.380
Although our aim is very useful.

140
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.340
But in this case we could see the flexibility that we could get from collection's free market sectors

141
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:32.830
.

142
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:33.500
Okay.

143
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.320
So that's about it.

144
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.520
So please go ahead and make this the changes that we have done in this in the previous Nisson.

145
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.760
I know with that I think we have also given as much of the project and we will see how we can extend

146
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.620
it further later.

147
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.900
So thank you and happy coding
