Hi there.

2
00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:08.820
This is the room.

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.190
And welcome back.

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.490
It's time now to look at how date and time are represented in Java and how they can be manipulated.

5
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.430
We all know that it's a very fundamental topic as we encounter dates and pretty much every application

6
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.180
that we use.

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.150
For instance, collecting our birthday is a pretty common activity, like in the case of Facebook or

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.750
Gmail.

9
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.240
It helps them in keeping track of our age and also to show us some relevant ads.

10
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.050
Similarly, when we post a question or a review on a particular website, then date and time is tracked

11
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.500
so that the end user will know when exactly that particular question or the review has been posted.

12
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.870
So data and time handling is extremely fundamental and that's what we are going to learn in this particular

13
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.470
section.

14
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.520
And here is the agenda.

15
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.850
In Java eight, there is a brand new data time API and we will learn about it in the section.

16
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.030
But before doing that, we will first look at the date and time classes that were there before Java

17
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.170
eight and let's refer to them as legacy data and Time API.

18
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.400
And these legacy classes are considered to be far from ideal, and that's why we have the new Data Time

19
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.160
API.

20
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.090
As this, all classes have several issues as we will soon see.

21
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:32.050
However, the legacy classes are still very widely used and it is important for us to know them really

22
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.410
well.

23
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.820
Some courses seem to be focusing only on the new Java eight data time API, but if we know only the

24
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.480
new classes then it can be painful and confusing if we have to deal with code that is still using the

25
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.440
old classes.

26
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.460
So to avoid such issues, we are going to learn both the APIs.

27
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.730
So let's go ahead now and get started with this topic.
