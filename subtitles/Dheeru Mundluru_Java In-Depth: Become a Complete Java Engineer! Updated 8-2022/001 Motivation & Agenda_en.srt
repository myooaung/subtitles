00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,510
Hi there.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,620
This is the Mandela room.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,670
And welcome back.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,560
So we now have a very solid understanding of the Java Sea platform.

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:18,340
Right.

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,530
And there were two objectives and designing this course and both the objectives have been met.

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:30,910
The first objective is to cover most of the concepts that fall under the Java Sea platform and to also

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,070
cover them at a very in depth level.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,640
That's the reason this course has been named as Java in-depth.

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,670
And we also ensured that we discuss the motivation behind every single concept.

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,260
So it was not just about syntax, but to also understand the why part.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,880
So that's the first objective to discuss the breadth as well as the depth.

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:58,540
And the second objective is to discuss the best practices and the design principles that one needs to

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,900
know in order to write well-designed Java code.

15
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,730
And we discussed a ton of rules, and I hope you have learned it well.

16
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,710
So those were the two objectives.

17
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:15,310
And now let's take it one step ahead and let's make it even more interesting and inspiring.

18
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,250
Let's learn about Java EE platform.

19
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,350
Strictly speaking, this particular section should not be included in this course.

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,040
The reason is this course is all about Java SE.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,700
And to also discuss about the best practices in the Java language.

22
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:41,660
So Java E is about web development and so it doesn't fall under the scope of this course.

23
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,820
And I never had any intention of including the section, but now I'm including it for two reasons.

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:57,270
The first reason is to help you guys understand how Java is used in the real world, and web application

25
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,880
development is ubiquitous and Java is very widely used for web application.

26
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,890
So that's one use case.

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,680
So in order to do that, we are going to extend our project to Web, enable it.

28
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:17,040
You know that our project was missing the front end part as well as it was not hosted on a web server,

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,800
although we said that it is a web application.

30
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,090
So for the front end part, we had a Java file which was mimicking the front end.

31
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,700
So now we are going to Web enable it.

32
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,040
And so you're going to see how Java is actually used in the real world.

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,600
So we are going to do that.

34
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,090
And the second reason is to give you a sense of direction on your next steps.

35
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,540
So in this particular section, you will learn about the core Java EE technologies like Servlet and

36
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,640
JSP, and you will see how it can be used in order to build a web application.

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,900
Now, with that knowledge in place, you can explore more technologies once you are done with this course.

38
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,910
So you can learn about other technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

39
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,790
So those are the clients are technologies, or you can explore other technologies like spraying and

40
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,100
hibernate and so on and so forth.

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:18,540
So without this it can be a bit challenging because you do understand the code java, but you may be

42
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,500
a bit lost and you may not know where to start or what to do.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,130
So this will kind of give you a sense of direction.

44
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,810
It acts as a bridge, so it's really nice that we are covering this.

45
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,940
So that's one thing.

46
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,920
And I also have to say that you need to treat this particular section as a bonus section.

47
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,850
So it needs to be treated as a pure add on section.

48
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,810
What that means is it's not going to be as comprehensive as other sections in this course.

49
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,950
Having said that, it still is pretty in-depth.

50
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,120
It has over 4 hours of really valuable content.

51
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:04,500
Probably we also get into certain details which are not even covered in other dedicated courses, courses

52
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,090
that are dedicated for this topic.

53
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:13,110
So it's going to be pretty in-depth, too, but just not as in-depth as other sections in this course.

54
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,720
And we are also going to practice follow some good conventions in writing our code.

55
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,260
So just because it is a bonus section, it doesn't mean that it's going to be at a very high level or

56
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,570
we are going to follow some naive practices.

57
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,560
That's not the case.

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,710
We are going to follow some good coding conventions.

59
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:37,080
For instance, we do stick to the and we see design pattern which our project was following.

60
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,470
Then we use something called us JST tags which are kind of advanced DSP tags.

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:50,610
And if you recall, we also had users in our project and the user passwords were being stored in clear

62
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:57,060
text, but now we will store it in encrypted format because that's how it is professionally, professionally

63
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,750
done and it's very important from a security standpoint.

64
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,680
So I want you to learn this good practices and take it ahead and use them in your career.

65
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,510
So that's the thing.

66
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:14,670
So it's going to be really interesting and it's going to be very useful for you and the course would

67
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,220
be very complete with this new edition.

68
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,140
So let's go ahead and see what we have on the agenda for this section.

69
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,160
Okay.

70
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,490
Here is the agenda.

71
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,990
We will first learn about the absolute basic concepts of the web.

72
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,550
Next, we will briefly discuss about the Java EE specification and what it includes.

73
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,680
We will also discuss about something called servlet containers and web servers.

74
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,920
Next we will install Tomcat, which is a servlet container and also a web server to.

75
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,540
And next people implement a mini web application called Books Aloha.

76
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,080
And it simply displays a list of books.

77
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,910
And it helps us to learn about sublets, GSP and GST.

78
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:13,390
And we will also implement the application using MVC pattern and the web application will be deployed

79
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,500
on Tomcat.

80
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:21,300
And this is a good book you can buy to get a more deeper understanding on Servlet and JSP.

81
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:27,460
It is an old book but still very much useful as it covers the fundamentals very well.

82
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,860
Finally, we will extend our bookmarking project with the same technologies that we have learned that

83
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,420
is Sublets and GSD.

84
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,530
We will also follow the MVC pattern and we will reuse a lot of the code that we have already written

85
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,700
in our project.

86
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:52,290
However, we will focus only on the books part and we will not worry about movies or the web links.

87
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,440
That's because once you do it with books, it's the same process for movies and web links too.

88
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,690
So we are going to save some time there.

89
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,460
Let's also look at a couple of screenshots of the end product.

90
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,770
This is the login page.

91
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,540
And once the user is logged in, this is one of the pages that the user sees.

92
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:21,770
It's called as the browse page, and it essentially displays a list of books and the user can bookmark

93
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,560
one or more of them by clicking on the save link that you can see besides each book.

94
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:33,020
There is also one other similar page and you will see it when we get to the project.

95
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,540
So it's going to be really interesting.

96
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,430
That's about it for now.

97
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,860
And I will see you in the next lecture and we will get started off.

98
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,570
Thank you.
