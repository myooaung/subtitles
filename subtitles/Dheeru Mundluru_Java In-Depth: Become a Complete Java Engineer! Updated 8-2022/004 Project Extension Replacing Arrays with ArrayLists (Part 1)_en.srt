1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,600
Hi there now it's time to extend our project.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,610
It's been a while since we have extended it.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,840
The last extension was in the I wrote chapter so there we have extended the project to read the data

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,470
from X Files.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,530
Before that we were reading the data from this class called us data store.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:25,140
And then after we have learned some of the concepts in the Iowa chapter we have changed that in order

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,010
to read that it Off-Ramp ex-Vice.

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:27,400
OK.

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,790
The data is still stored in data store but the data is loaded from X Files.

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,620
Since then we have learned about data structures and also genetics.

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,010
So let's go ahead and put that into use.

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:39,780
OK.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,390
So it's going to be a very simple extension.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:50,250
So far the only data that we are using was are using single dimensional iron to be arrays.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,110
So now we're going to change that.

16
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:52,490
OK.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,590
Because our sort of very inflexible.

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,780
We need to know the size of the Army during the creation time.

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,280
So that's very inflexible and our eyes are also not auto extendable.

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,040
We know that.

21
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:04,569
OK.

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,500
So let's go ahead and change that and the conduction frame update us or just give us a lot of flexibility

23
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,910
so we don't have those limitations anymore.

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,150
The limitations that are is do us so we are going to do that.

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,720
We are simply going to use the collection framework data structures.

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,770
Okay so let's go ahead and do that.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,850
But before that let's just do a very quick recap of the project.

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,510
So we know that the project is that application it's a social bookmarking with opposition where users

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:41,100
can bookmark their favorite bookmarks and other features and glore to make certain bookmarks as kid

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,310
friendly but much so that only kids can use them.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,090
OK.

32
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,230
And that can be done by special type of users called editors and editors on into the future was to also

33
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,920
share certain bookmarks with a third party website and that was also another feature.

34
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:05,060
And we implemented certain Jela features when we tried to incorporate that right and center to the application

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,420
.

36
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,449
So we followed the MBC design back then.

37
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:15,810
So the core business logic was we were able to implement it but for the view part we have used a dolphin

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,210
we call it as good or Java and it's similar to the browser.

39
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,950
OK.

40
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,880
And then for the data base but be how you use the data store Barra's so that it is stored in data stored

41
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,770
on for much of the remaining business logic.

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,970
What we hope the business logic.

43
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,100
So that is already quoted in Java and that is fine.

44
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,970
It's just there for the view under the dust or part B how similar occurred using Golan Heights.

45
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:45,660
So later I might add a new chapter at the IGN and then I might cover some of the technologies that we

46
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,670
can use for implementing view.

47
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:54,990
And also for implement indeed Austral like the Maya security and also to color some of the JEDEC concepts

48
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,050
which can be used to do.

49
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,000
He did offer them that he duster from the database.

50
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,300
OK but I'm not sure I'll be able to do it.

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,690
So I would try my best to do that after I'm done with some of the other stuff.

52
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,220
Adding some of the other stuff.

53
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,950
And the last guess if I can on that.

54
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,370
I think you can enroll in other courses that are some other course.

55
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,570
Those are very good courses on Java eat and also on my SU fuel.

56
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,970
So you can just enroll for those courses.

57
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,320
Those are pretty short courses and you can when you are doing those courses you can extend this project

58
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,040
in order to implement a viewport on Also that database back.

59
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,320
So you can always do that.

60
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,400
But I will try my best to provide some kind of a basic introduction to those technologies and probably

61
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,850
cover that in this goes much since this is a it's it's a Java course purely gello course.

62
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,790
So the core part is definitely taken care of and the project options.

63
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,400
It's just the missing pieces.

64
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,070
RW and the database Boch which are simulated here using these dolphins but they we try our best to also

65
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:59,220
those the worst case you can actually enroll in other courses and extend this project while you're learning

66
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,530
those concepts.

67
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,310
So let's go ahead and get started here launched our Djala.

68
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,880
I simply think of it as a web server on Nixon built on just application on good or Java is a viewport

69
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,030
.

70
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,520
It also is that good ideas.

71
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,380
So let's go ahead and look at launch nodular.

72
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,620
Sophie scroll down.

73
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,920
So here is the main method and it isn't working load data on no database to the data.

74
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,520
OK.

75
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,770
And for that it is using DUDAS store and it isn't working this static function and it is loading users

76
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,490
ramblings more recent books.

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,140
OK.

78
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,270
And each of them loads read off from their text file.

79
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,970
Ok so this is node users.

80
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,540
So let's go ahead and change this.

81
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,180
OK.

82
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,830
So let's go ahead and make it.

83
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,580
Here is a string array.

84
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,720
So let's make it so the data is going to be stored in the string array.

85
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,380
So let's simply make it a list of strings

86
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,360
choose Obama notation on control Chiv.

87
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,730
Oh.

88
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,540
So it is a list of strings.

89
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,110
So this is the parameterised type.

90
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,290
We know that now that's going to I want to read.

91
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,250
And it's also changed this

92
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,550
day.

93
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,140
And here we don't need this column anymore because we are not going to use an ID.

94
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:32,210
So does keeping track of the index so let's ecstasy.

95
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,600
That's it.

96
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:45,030
And let's go back and the same thing happens here.

97
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,950
Oh score no users so users.

98
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,510
It's also an ID so we can also change that.

99
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,850
So click on doc.

100
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,560
So here is users.

101
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:03,780
So that just go ahead and make good on this user.

102
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,190
In fact you can make a collection of rules and also because one option is even more generic.

103
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,340
But Critchley read like Doc no.

104
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,990
Now we don't need any of this so it can be a fixed size.

105
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,270
It is also Ahto extendable.

106
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,060
So let's go back here we are.

107
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:36,180
So we are watching the data read will read the rest of the file and we need to store the data here.

108
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,860
Here we are adding it.

109
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,290
OK we are we are getting the data that we are parsing the data and then we are creating an instance

110
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,700
of user and we are storing it in this user's ID.

111
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,270
OK.

112
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,270
Now it's going to be our users and users list.

113
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:51,820
OK.

114
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,020
And this is on them but it is just it's keeping track of the index.

115
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,620
So let's just go ahead and remove that game because you're not using it.

116
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:06,780
So let's also remove this and let's just call that user user

117
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,590
users not add up.

118
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,640
So you're done with this matter.

119
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,550
So it's harder to users.

120
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,820
And we also have these other methods like web links or Lord rubbings Lord movies I'm dumb as a listen

121
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,620
just go out and mix similar kind of changes.

122
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:35,370
So let's just take the seam in here and Oppy it here no longer.

123
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,410
We have the string arm and that's it.

124
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,130
And the same thing goes here.

125
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:41,870
OK.

126
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,950
Here we are using mops which is a cootie mention NRD a daisy right highlight the.

127
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,810
We are going to restore the gambling's.

128
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,480
OK ramblings and this is column number is.

129
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,470
He is of keeping track of the column numbers.

130
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,650
So it's a truly array.

131
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,870
And in the zero Truglio sauteing doublings and in the first row I think we are storing movies on in

132
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,750
the second we are storing books.

133
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,300
OK.

134
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:10,310
So instead of a 2D area that's used and list off lest we get a list offer list.

135
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,130
So let me go back here to bookmarks.

136
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:25,380
So let's change this to the list and this is how another list so that this Nestor's this girl store

137
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,800
individually book.

138
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,820
So does you do it you be able to store a list which will how only rumblings had the fust position be

139
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:39,460
able to store a list which really how on the movies on a second the list will start on the books.

140
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,640
So it just resembles a goody and deore.

141
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:53,560
So let's change this also to our list and we don't need to specify dentata things there.

142
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,240
I'm a tradition we'll take get off Goc.

143
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,620
Now let's go back and sorry.

144
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,900
This needs to be a bookmark or a string.

145
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,860
Right.

146
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:13,950
This needs to be a bookmark and this internal list can store iterable or any of the bookmarks.

147
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,570
OK.

148
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,170
OK.

149
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,370
So the so the zero at that moment is a list of bookmark trusted images a list of bookmark on second

150
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,740
is also on this stuff bookmark.

151
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,110
OK.

152
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:28,490
And each of those of us can store a weblink or they can store a movie or a book.

153
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,040
OK so let's go back.

154
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,770
Here are the blanks.

155
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,410
And

156
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,980
so we need to remove this

157
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:54,160
.

158
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,230
See this bookmark reduced.

159
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,670
OK so that's this little part of the book.

160
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,200
Mark resistible how all of the blanks.

161
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:19,560
Now we need to add it to the bookmarks data structure on the grill get hired here.

162
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,920
OK.

163
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,150
So that's the zero at that moment.

164
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,090
Next year you need to do the same here for movies.

165
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:35,650
When it's go down you have to replace once again the ceiling step and actually extremal this

166
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,860
Scobie.

167
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,310
This

168
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,920
needs to be assigned here and this needs to go outside of the front low

169
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,520
scoring here

170
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:14,350
.

171
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,860
So that's the movies on the same thing for the books also.

172
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,280
So here we are remote this

173
00:11:29,280 --> 00:12:04,560
.

174
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,700
So those are the road methods and we are also returning.

175
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,300
There are some guitars for that.

176
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,630
So let's also do that change here.

177
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,390
So this is going to return this you get bookmarks.

178
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:32,430
So certainly the data structures and this one is going to get users here should get it done this way

179
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,850
.

180
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,630
So that said and we don't need any of these any more.

181
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,950
So that may also remove that game.

182
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,490
So this this find this can be taken care of later.

183
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,010
So that's the thing.

184
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,530
So let me just stop it here.

185
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,310
Will this change with the changes that be made in the store.

186
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,180
So in the next lesson we will come back and maybe make some changes in the viewed or Djala and probably

187
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,060
in launch not July and few other files.

188
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:03,620
OK.

189
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,230
Because of the changes that we made we will get some competition out of there.

190
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,650
So we are going to fix that.

191
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,790
And the next lesson.

192
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,150
Okay okay then see you in the next Hessen
