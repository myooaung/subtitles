00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,070
Hello there.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,140
This is the model room and we'll come back.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,590
So we have learned about how to create Java classes within Eclipse, and we have also learned about

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,540
the Eclipse build process.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:20,110
Now let's learn about how to efficiently navigate through the source code with an eclipse.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,060
So if you're going to look at some shortcuts for doing that and it's very important, so you need to

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,530
memorize the shortcuts.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:32,830
So the first thing that we are going to look at is something called as type exploration, which as the

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:40,000
name suggests, is about exploring types, and the type is nothing but either a class or an interface.

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,320
So let's say we want to search for our basics class.

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:51,070
So for that, the shortcut is control shift to where T stands for type.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,010
So you can start typing in the name of the file, which is basic demo.

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,520
And as we are typing, there is a real time search that is happening.

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,300
So Eclipse is searching the workspace as well as the Java library too.

15
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,900
So these are all the classes from the Java Library, and this is the basic demo class that we are looking

16
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,060
for, which is in our workspace Demo Z.

17
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,420
So just click on that.

18
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,810
So that's how you would search for a type.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:27,490
Next, we would want to see something called as an outline of a class, and an outline is nothing but

20
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,060
the members of a class, what members the class has.

21
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,350
So there are different ways to do it.

22
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,710
So one is through the package Explorer.

23
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:42,880
So you would just click on this demo source and then we have our package within which we have the basics

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,320
demo class and we can see all of the methods that this class has.

25
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,950
So the class does not have any fields right now.

26
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:57,040
So let's go ahead and just add a field here and you will see that it gets added here in the list.

27
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,780
Here it is.

28
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,410
So we can see the field as well as all of the members.

29
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,940
So let me just remove it now.

30
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,800
So that's one way.

31
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:14,170
Now, the second way is through a shortcut and you will just say control or where all stands for outline.

32
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,740
So once again, you can see all of the methods here.

33
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,330
So you can just click on them here and you will be at the method.

34
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,130
We can do the same over here.

35
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,400
Also, if you click on that, if you double click, you will be there.

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,350
So that's how you will.

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,930
You can see an outline of the class.

38
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,260
So it is control o.

39
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,870
And you can also search here.

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,040
Let's say if you say array, you can search for it and just.

41
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,710
Click on it and you'll be there.

42
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,570
So that's the second way.

43
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,800
And the third way is through something called us breadcrumb.

44
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:56,350
So all you will do is just right click and say Show and breadcrumb.

45
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,850
So it shows the breadcrumb.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,920
And the breadcrumb is nothing but the path to the class here and here.

47
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,480
If you click on this arrow once again, you will see all of the methods.

48
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,390
And typically I do this, this is what I prefer.

49
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,310
And if you click on ideas here, we will get to the race method.

50
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:24,180
And if you want to hide it, you can also right click on say Hide Breadcrumb and it will go away.

51
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,420
But I generally prefer to have the breadcrumb here.

52
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,090
So that's the type exploration.

53
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,370
Now let's look at method exploration.

54
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,720
Now for this, let me open our student test class.

55
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,910
So, control chef P.

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,450
Student test.

57
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,560
And here it is.

58
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,320
Now let me scroll down here.

59
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,380
We have the update profile method invocation.

60
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:54,350
So if we want to look at the update profile, the method definition.

61
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,510
So if we want to navigate to that method, all you need to do is just click here on the name of the

62
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,080
method and hit F three and there you go.

63
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,920
So you are at the method definition of update profile.

64
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,710
To go back, just hit this button here.

65
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,230
So that's the method navigation.

66
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,329
But here we have the constructor.

67
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:22,390
So just click here and once again do an F three and you are at that particular constructor.

68
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,260
So this is in the student class, so you can go back once again.

69
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,690
So it's just f three here.

70
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,340
Now let's put a statement.

71
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,360
Print statement controlled space.

72
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,730
Let's print name.

73
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
Doesn't matter.

74
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,620
Now let's say we want to navigate this.

75
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,780
Pentland method is part of the Java API.

76
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,310
Right.

77
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,960
So if we want to look at that definition once again, the same shortcut f three.

78
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,610
And here we are.

79
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,460
And it is the definition of the print method, which is in this class called S print stream.

80
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:06,760
Now, if we want to know what all other methods are in working this particular method, then what you

81
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,770
would do is you would just click on this and you would say Control Shift.

82
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,950
G So that's the Shortcut Control Shift.

83
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:22,300
G And there are 2057 references that are invoking this particular method.

84
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,730
So from 2057 places, we are invoking this particular method.

85
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,650
So here majority of them, almost all of them are from the Java API.

86
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,830
For instance, here, the from the Java Lang package, we have this class called Abstract Stack Worker.

87
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,520
Here this method is invoking the println method.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,410
So similarly.

89
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,590
If they scroll down, we will see the source directory here at the very end.

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,430
Here it is.

91
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,960
This is the source directory in our JID workspace and this is the package and all of these classes are

92
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,300
accessing are invoking the print method.

93
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:09,480
For instance, if you go into the basics demo class, so we have the type casting method and here we

94
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,320
can see that we are invoking the print statement here and here.

95
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,850
So this is how you would see all the methods that are that are invoking a particular method.

96
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,620
So you would just click on the method and you will say control shift.

97
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:31,530
G So similarly in our student class, if you click here and if you say Control Chef G, it has only

98
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,020
one other class, which is the student test class.

99
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,830
And from the main method we are invoking the update profile method.

100
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,080
So that's control chef G Now let's go back into the print stream class.

101
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,270
Now, this is a print method now if you want to look at the call hierarchy.

102
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,990
So this particular method is being invoked from many different methods and those methods are again invoked

103
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,610
from some other methods.

104
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:04,170
And if you want to look at the call hierarchy itself, then you would say control alt edge.

105
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,350
And it would open this view caller's call hierarchy.

106
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,390
So once again, we will see all of those methods that are accessing this particular print method.

107
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,950
But let me scroll down to update.

108
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,510
Here we have the update profile method from the student class.

109
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,140
So update profile method is invoking println.

110
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,230
Now if I click here, it shows the main method from the student test class.

111
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:39,640
So the main method here is invoking in the student test class is invoking the update profile method

112
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,970
in the student class, which in turn is invoking the print ln method in the print stream class.

113
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,000
All right, so that's the call hierarchy.

114
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,380
And this is a view that's that method exploration.

115
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,020
Next, let's look at search function.

116
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,870
Say, if we want to search for some text within the files, all you will do is control edge.

117
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,840
And here you have many taps.

118
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,070
It's the search window.

119
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:13,000
So let's say in the file search, if you want to search for the text, add in any of your files, then

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,860
you can have this pattern star, which means any file and just hit search.

121
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,890
So it is showing this particular location.

122
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:28,180
So this is a basics demo class and within this line 154 there is this comment where there is the text

123
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,060
added, so it has the text add.

124
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,770
So if you click that you can see it.

125
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:38,980
So that's how you would search for a text, some text now let's say Control Edge once again.

126
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,960
So this is a file search.

127
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,340
We did a file search earlier for searching for this text add.

128
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:51,610
Let's say you want to search for some Java construct like a method or some field.

129
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,820
Then you would click on this tab Java search.

130
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:01,510
So let's say we want to search for our update file method in the student class.

131
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,730
And if you want to look at this, the declaration, the definition, then you would just say search

132
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:12,250
and it will show the student class similarly control edge.

133
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:21,550
Let's say there is a method called ADD and if you want to look at its declaration and add, method is

134
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,440
also there in the Java API.

135
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,960
So let's hit search here.

136
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,750
So there are so many declarations.

137
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,590
So in Java.

138
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,590
Let me just scroll here.

139
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,290
Scroll down.

140
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,690
There is the idealist class which has all of these different methods.

141
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,780
So if I click on AD, you can see the ad method.

142
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,650
So control edge it is.

143
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,060
And you can search for other things also like the fields also.

144
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,400
Or you can look at the references also.

145
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,420
Let me just look at show you the references update file.

146
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,240
So this will show the invocation statement.

147
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:06,410
Here it is in the student test class and the main method we are in working update profile.

148
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,840
So that's control edge.

149
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,200
Now if you want to search with ten this class, you will do it.

150
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,990
As in any text editor, you will just say control f and you can find and you can replace.

151
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,800
Now if you want to go to a particular line, you will say control.

152
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,610
L So that's the shortcut and you will enter the line number.

153
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,950
So most of these can also be done from here, from the menu.

154
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:36,190
For instance, let's click here, update, profile, and here, navigate, navigate and here it says

155
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,180
F three, F three is for getting to that particular definition.

156
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,690
So just click on that and you read the methods definition.

157
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:52,030
And similarly, let's say we want to get the outline quick outline so we set control or we can see the

158
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,400
shortcut here, but quick outline.

159
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,320
SS And to search you can just say you can go from here, search.

160
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,570
You can see that the command is control edge.

161
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,460
So that's that.

162
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,460
So let's just go ahead and do a quick summary of the shortcuts.

163
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,030
Here they are.

164
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:17,980
So Control Shift DX is for the type search to search for a type control or is to get an outline of the

165
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,420
class or an interface.

166
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,390
