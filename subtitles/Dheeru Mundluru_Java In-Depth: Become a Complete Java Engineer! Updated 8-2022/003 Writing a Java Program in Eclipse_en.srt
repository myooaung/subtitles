1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,020
Hello there.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,200
This is the Ramona La Rue.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,070
And welcome back.

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,600
Let's now go ahead and create our first Java class in Eclipse.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,480
So here I am in the Eclipse installation directory and we have seen this particular application in the

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,250
last lecture.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,160
So let's go ahead and double click on this in order to launch Eclipse.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,790
So the first thing that Eclipse asks us is to select something called as a workspace.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,470
And a workspace is simply a directory where our programs are stored.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,840
So as the name workspace suggests, it is simply a space where our work is stored.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:43,380
And our work being the programs that we write and the class files that get generated and any resources

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,940
that we might be using.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,930
So since we are starting off, we need to create a workspace.

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,990
So once we create it in future, we can use the workspace.

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:58,890
So just click on Browse here and I'm in the C drive, click on new folder and let's create this folder

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,680
called JID which stands for Java in Depth.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,660
Just select folder, select folder and just say hit launch here.

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:09,370
Okay.

19
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,580
So what we see here is the welcome screen.

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,650
So you can just close this one.

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,530
Now here what we are seeing is.

22
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,480
So this is called as.

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,890
This is called as a perspective, which is just a feature of eclipse.

24
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:34,640
So this is one perspective and a perspective lets you do something and we can also have other perspectives.

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,190
So that's a perspective is simply a collection of predefined windows.

26
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,730
So this is one window here and they refer to it as a view.

27
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,380
And here we will have another view, which is where we will write our code.

28
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,440
And so we have different views here.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,680
And when we run our program, the output can be seen here.

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,970
So that's another view.

31
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:05,240
So a perspective is a bunch of views and this is the Java E perspective and using it we can create Java

32
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,470
E Web applications.

33
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,210
We simply have to click on this link.

34
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:13,550
But then there are also other perspectives like the Java perspective and also the debug perspective.

35
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:20,120
So here if you click on this particular one open perspective, it shows you all the perspectives that

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,160
come with this particular eclipse.

37
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,500
So this is the default one.

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,320
So if we click on Java here, it is a more simplified version of Java E perspective.

39
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,490
So as you will see, you will have only fewer features here.

40
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,510
So you can create a Java Basic Java project here, Java application.

41
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,820
Similarly, there is another one called Debug.

42
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,930
Let's also click that.

43
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,680
So debug perspective has different views and you would use this particular perspective when you are

44
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,540
debugging your application.

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,590
So if your application, a main application compiles fine, but if you see some errors in your application,

46
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:03,830
then you would want to debug and see where the issue is and for that you would use the debugger.

47
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,670
And later we will look at how we can debug Java programs.

48
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,620
So all of those perspectives will be laid out here and you can switch between them.

49
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,430
So this is the Java perspective and this is the Java E perspective.

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:22,520
So for now, let's just use the Java perspective here, now here, let's go ahead and create a simple

51
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,060
project.

52
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,820
We can either click here or we can go here and certain eclipses, you might not see this.

53
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:34,880
So you can also go here and to file click on New here and you have many options.

54
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,670
So we need to create a project and the project will be created within our workspace.

55
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,220
So that's the first thing that we need to do.

56
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,350
So within our workspace we can have one or more projects and those projects can be entirely interrelated

57
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:48,830
to.

58
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,750
So here is where we will create the project.

59
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,270
So the project name, let's name it as eclipse test.

60
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,850
And here we are saying use default location, which means that eclipse test will be created within our

61
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,020
guide workspace.

62
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,060
And here the execution environment degree will be Java 14.

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,500
And if you recall in the previous lecture I showed my path and I was using Java 14 and that was being

64
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,649
used to launch Eclipse and the same Java is being used here also in order to run the program.

65
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:26,560
So in your case it might be something else or we can also select any other ones that we might be having.

66
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,240
So let's just use this one, which I have it on the on the path.

67
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,210
And here this option says create separate folders for sources and class files.

68
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,380
Let's leave it as this.

69
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:44,350
It just means that the source code and the compiled class files will be located in different folders

70
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,910
and I will show you that.

71
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,680
So go ahead and just click next.

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,570
So everything is default.

73
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,010
Now here in this page, there is this option called create module hyphen in for Java.

74
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:04,130
So you can deselect this and this particular option, you will see it only if you are using Java nine

75
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,060
or later.

76
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,160
If you're using Java eight, then you will not see it Java eight or any of the prior versions of Java

77
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,460
eight.

78
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,600
Then you will not see it.

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,560
So from Java nine only you will be able to see this option.

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,290
And this is related to a concept called US modules which we have not discussed, but maybe in future

81
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,350
we might discuss it, but for now just deselect it.

82
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:31,010
If you see this, it just means that you are using either Java nine or a more recent version.

83
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,440
So just select it and hit finish and it will create the project here.

84
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,320
And if we drill down we can see source also.

85
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,920
Let me also open the folder on the file system.

86
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,850
So let me go into C drive and JID.

87
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,720
So within the JID it created this thing called us eclipse test.

88
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:58,760
So this is the project and within this we have source here within source we will have the source code

89
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,770
and within bin we will have the generated class files, the compiled files.

90
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,150
Right now it is empty.

91
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:15,020
So let us go and create our first class so you can right click here or you can right click on source

92
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,610
also and just say new and we need to create a class.

93
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,830
So since this is our first class, let's go ahead and create the Hello World class.

94
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,370
Because the package name you can leave it as eclipse test.

95
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,060
So it is picking the same name as the project.

96
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:38,250
Or you can also create another package name like the column dot semantics, dot semantics, square dot

97
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,750
test or something like that.

98
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,250
So let's leave it like that.

99
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:47,310
And the modifier is public and let's not worry about the superclass since we haven't discussed it yet.

100
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,150
And here, which method steps would you like to create?

101
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,390
So let's just say we want to create the main method automatically.

102
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,850
So that's the stub of the main method.

103
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,200
So that's it.

104
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,470
Let's just hit finish and.

105
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:09,430
And this is another view where it is creating this hello world class and it is within the package eclipse

106
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,910
test.

107
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,390
So you can also see that main method got automatically generated.

108
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:14,700
Okay.

109
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,100
So that's the benefit of using an eclipse ID and ID.

110
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,400
Now, since a font is small, let's go ahead and increase it.

111
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,590
Let's also close these views here.

112
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,490
We don't need them.

113
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:32,300
So we just have this this this is called S package exploder because you can explore the packages and

114
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,080
here we will.

115
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,160
When we run it, we will see that there is a new view that gets created.

116
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,250
But before doing that, let's increase the font size.

117
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,370
Go here and to window preferences.

118
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:44,770
Here.

119
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,070
The first option is general.

120
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,140
Let's drill down.

121
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,170
Appearance.

122
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,060
Let's drill down.

123
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,740
Click on colors and fonts.

124
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,850
And here, once again, let's select Java here.

125
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,600
And within Java, there is this option called Java editor, text, font.

126
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,740
Just double click.

127
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,320
So this is what we have right now.

128
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,300
So let's increase the font size to 16.

129
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,010
Okay, apply and close.

130
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,870
So the font has increased and that's good.

131
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,660
Now let's go ahead and put a print statement.

132
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:19,450
So let's just say six out and hit control space and the statement is automatically created.

133
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,790
That's the beauty of it.

134
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:30,280
So let's print this and let me just save it controls and let me just show something on the desk right

135
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,610
now.

136
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,630
So here we are in the bin and the RC folder.

137
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:39,309
We have the eclipse test package within which we have Java Java.

138
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,480
So that is okay.

139
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:46,000
Now if you go into Ben, you will see that the package eclipse test is there because that's the package

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,610
and within that the class file is there.

141
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,190
So we did not compile it separately.

142
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:58,930
So it means that eclipse is automatically compiling our our source code so you can see how productive

143
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,910
it is when we are using Eclipse so we don't have to execute the Java command.

144
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,680
It is being done internally.

145
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,690
So that's the beauty of using an editor like Eclipse.

146
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:16,900
Now to run it, all we need to do is just click on this button run hello or Java and you will notice

147
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,970
that a new view gets opened here.

148
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,020
It's called console.

149
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,360
It's just like the command prompt console.

150
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,270
You see it got created and it is printing.

151
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,140
Hello here.

152
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,750
So that's the thing.

153
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:35,110
And you can another way to run it is you can just right click on the class here and say run as and you

154
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,740
can run it here.

155
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,740
Also run as Java application and there you go.

156
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,700
It has run again.

157
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:47,680
And you can also click here also right click run as an Java application, run as an Java application.

158
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,480
So it will run it once again.

159
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,890
So that's how it is the compilation and execution.

160
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,100
And let's also put a couple of more statements.

161
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,930
Let's say Long L.

162
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,970
Let's assign it to an end.

163
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,960
And what would happen?

164
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,320
We should get a compilation error.

165
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,680
That's what we are getting here.

166
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:13,640
So this underline here, when I hover over it, it says type mismatch cannot convert from long to int.

167
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,540
Right.

168
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,690
And similarly, we can also see this red icon here.

169
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,110
And hovering over it will give will show this tip here.

170
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,280
It says type mismatch.

171
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,520
Just the same message.

172
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,720
And over here also if you click on problems.

173
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,330
Here it is.

174
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,490
So it is it is showing this error.

175
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,600
So if we drill down, it shows the same message here.

176
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,470
So that's the compilation error.

177
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,870
And to fix it, we just do this, put it cast and the error is gone.

178
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,920
So it disappeared.

179
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,710
But it is giving this yellow icon and it is called as a warning.

180
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,090
So it just says the value of the local variable.

181
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,840
I is not used because we are not using it anywhere.

182
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,540
So it's like a dummy statement.

183
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,790
So the same thing here also I is underlined.

184
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,890
So when I hover over it, it shows this message and even in the problems instead of errors.

185
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,530
Now it just says that it is warning.

186
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,530
So the value of the local variable I is not used.

187
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,450
So this is given by the compiler.

188
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:21,080
So it's not an error, but it is a compiler warning and it is warning us that there could be a potential

189
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,470
issue.

190
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,670
So look into that.

191
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,110
So in this case for this, it is saying that the local variable is not used anymore.

192
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,570
So that's the warning that it is giving us because it is pretty much a dummy statement.

193
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,370
So maybe we wanted to use this particular variable, but we are not using it.

194
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,860
So it is telling us to look into that.

195
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,700
But it will run fine, so there won't be any issues in running the file.

196
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,830
Now, another thing is cool.

197
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:54,810
Thing is, if we hover over here on the print, it gives a little summary of what the print does along

198
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,310
with the declaration itself.

199
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,880
This is called as a Java documentation.

200
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:05,400
So the owner of this method, whoever has written this method, has also taken time to write a simple

201
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,620
summary of this particular method in the source code itself.

202
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,000
So that's because of that.

203
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,660
And another type of comment called Java Dog and we will look at it later.

204
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:23,880
Similarly, even for if our here so system is a class and this is the summary of that summary of the

205
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,770
system class.

206
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:30,210
So the owner, whoever has written this class has written this documentation.

207
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,960
So it gives a clear summary of what the system class does.

208
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,160
So now that doesn't happen for Main here because we did not write it.

209
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:45,180
So if we write Java comments, then we can see that and that is something that we will look at it later.

210
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,880
So that's another benefit of eclipse.

211
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:55,880
Now, if by any chance you, let's say, accidentally close this console, then you don't have to panic.

212
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,030
Just go here into window.

213
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,900
And here we have something called Show View, which shows all of the views.

214
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:08,800
Just click on console and the console will be back again with the same text that it had earlier.

215
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,180
Same goes with problems.

216
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,510
Also, if you close it, just go into window and show view and you can click on problems here and you

217
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,200
will see that that particular tab will be back again.

218
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:21,320
Okay.

219
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,460
So that's what it is.

220
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:29,390
And one other thing I wanted to show is if you go into a window and if you want to, let's say, remove

221
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,690
all of these line numbers, for instance, just go here.

222
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,700
Window preferences.

223
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,800
Earlier we looked at this one appearance, so we don't need that go into editors.

224
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:47,410
Click on text editors, and it shows many of the things that can be seen here in the editor view.

225
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,720
So if you select this one and apply enclose so the line numbers will go away.

226
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,870
So there are a bunch of other options also, but I think we need to.

227
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,730
It's better to have blind numbers.

228
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,960
It'll be very useful.

229
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,010
So it's back again.

230
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,260
So that's that.

231
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,030
So here, the package name.

232
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,050
It just picked this particular one.

233
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,430
But we can also create more packages.

234
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:20,060
Just right click say new package and you can create a package like Comcast, Symantec Square, dot util

235
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,310
or whatever and it will create a package.

236
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,120
And within that package you can once again create classes within that package.

237
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,650
So that's about it.

238
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:34,040
So we have created our first Java class in Eclipse and that's about it.

239
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:34,940
Thank you.

240
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,830
And I will see you in the next lecture where we will look at something called Bell Process.
