00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.990
Hello there.

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.090
This is Lulu.

3
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.150
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.220
In this lecture, I'm going to provide some guidance on how you can do this course.

5
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.220
It is a master course and hence is pretty long and can be overwhelming for some of you.

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.970
So I want to provide some guidance so that it can be approached in a more effective and systematic way.

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.360
Guidance will also be provided for new college students who are just getting started with Java.

8
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:36.130
So you can view the course as consisting of two parts, and the first part would be core Java and it's

9
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.630
also very in-depth.

10
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:46.630
So this would be around 50 to 60% of the course, and that would amount to around 40 to 45 hours of

11
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.890
the course, and that would be roughly around 17 to 18 sections.

12
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.050
And shortly we will look at that.

13
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.630
So this would cover most of these topics.

14
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.600
It would be the language basics, which is like the syntax, the for loops and so on.

15
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.870
And we will also look at the inheritance and polymorphism concepts, and we will also learn how to use

16
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.490
Eclipse in a professional way.

17
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.480
We will study about the Java virtual machine, then the exceptions input output, which is about how

18
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.490
to read data from files and how you can write data to files.

19
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.350
Then we will look at the Java's powerful inbuilt data structures.

20
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.500
So these come with the Java library itself.

21
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.300
Then we will also explore this concept called us generics and we will look at the basics.

22
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.590
And in the second part of the course we will do the remaining part of the generics.

23
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.270
Once you have mastered this, only then move on to the second part.

24
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.540
Now, after finishing all of this, if you are not feeling confident, then I would suggest take some

25
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.470
time off and review the sections once again, whichever you are feeling uncomfortable with and once

26
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.230
you feel confident and comfortable, then move on to the second part, which is the advanced Java.

27
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.510
And that would include some of these concepts like advanced generics.

28
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.580
So we will continue learning about generics.

29
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.540
We will look at Multithreading, which is very important then databases.

30
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.100
And specifically we will cover SQL and also the MySQL database and we will see how we can interact with

31
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.770
databases from our Java programs.

32
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.260
We also look at the functional style programming, which is about concepts like lambdas and streams.

33
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.610
And finally, the interesting part we will look at an introduction to Java E, which helps in developing

34
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.940
the Web applications using Java stack.

35
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.730
So we're not going to get into the in-depth of Java EE because this course is not about Java EE.

36
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.040
So we will explore some core web technologies like Sublets and JSP, and we will also look at few other

37
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.760
topics.

38
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.720
And both these parts have these things in common, which is about best practices and professional design

39
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.720
rules that you need to use when writing your programs.

40
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.650
And these are very important for writing well-designed code.

41
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.870
And we also have the project which will be in both the parts.

42
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.140
So we will start off in the first part and we will extend it into the second part.

43
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.950
And finally it will the project will end at the end of the course.

44
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.040
So if you are a Java aspirant, if you want to become a Java professional, you have to do this entire

45
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.670
course.

46
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.470
If you are a college student, then I think this will suffice.

47
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.830
You can just stick with Core Java, which is the first part.

48
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.020
And within Core Java, I think JVM internals and the project can be optional.

49
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.180
So it is up to you, but you also have to learn a little bit about Multithreading.

50
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.510
So the Multithreading basics have to be covered and I will show you that even between JVM, I will show

51
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.280
you the part that you can learn.

52
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.570
There is one or two lectures and you can learn about those concepts.

53
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:03.370
Now this is for only first or second year undergrad students, and you can do it according to your curriculum.

54
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.990
But at some point before you graduate, like third or final year, I would strongly suggest to complete

55
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.730
the rest of the course too.

56
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.500
That is the advanced part, including the project which you should implement.

57
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.970
That way you would have an end to end experience in building a Java based web application, and that

58
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.610
can be helpful with your campus interviews.

59
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.580
And you would also do well once you are hired, especially having learned the best practices.

60
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.990
So if you want to apply for Java jobs, you should complete the course.

61
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:46.460
Also, if you're currently a Java professional and not comfortable with any of the topics like say functional

62
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.450
style programming or multithreading, then you can just do the specific sections as they are very in-depth.

63
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.770
Now let's head over to the course website and look at the course structure.

64
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.620
So let's just go ahead and look at the first and the second part, the code and the Advanced Java.

65
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.060
So this is the course content and the course is divided into sections.

66
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.870
A section is like a chapter and it has some lectures and most of them are video lectures.

67
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:23.430
So like I said, the first 17 or 18 sections would comprise the core Java part.

68
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.680
So let me just scroll down here.

69
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.750
So these are all the different sections.

70
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.310
You know the project GBM internals exceptions, input output collections.

71
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.620
And I said that the first part would end here in generics.

72
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:44.500
And within generics you can do the first five lectures up until this point, project extension and replacing

73
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.540
RS with less.

74
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.360
And the second part of generics would be the remaining lectures, and the remaining part of the course

75
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.340
will be part of the advanced Java.

76
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.210
Now, if you are a college students, you have to do till here.

77
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:05.260
And like I said earlier, you would also do multi threading a little bit of multi threading because

78
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.980
it might be important for you to study this.

79
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.620
So within Multi-threading it is this chapter called concurrency.

80
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.000
Do the first six lectures.

81
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.260
The last lecture would be synchronization and demo.

82
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:24.730
So I want you also to do this so you can take a look at your curriculum and learn whatever concepts

83
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.920
you can learn from this particular course.

84
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.500
Now, I said you can also, if you're a college student, you can skip the project.

85
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.810
So the project is here now.

86
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.330
This is a dedicated Chapter four project and it starts off here, but the project is extended as we

87
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:46.000
progress through the course and as we learn new concepts, we do extend this project in the different

88
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.530
sections of this course.

89
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.680
So if you wish to, you can skip, or you can also do this course or do this particular project.

90
00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:00.750
I also said that you might want to skip maintenance, but I would recommend doing that also.

91
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.100
But if you wish to skip.

92
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.380
So this is for the college students at least do this particular course called stuck.

93
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.420
This particular lecture called a stack.

94
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.300
So that's what it is for college students.

95
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.540
I hope it has given you more clarity.

96
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:22.840
So it would be roughly around 40 hours of the course for you, which might take a couple of months to

97
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.440
finish.

98
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.780
Now let's explore section.

99
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.640
So each section here.

100
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.410
So before exploring the section, let me just let's look at these different sections.

101
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.150
Here's an introduction.

102
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:40.010
And here we have a high level overview of what is in the Section two.

103
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.840
In this particular section, we will write our first Java program and we will compile and execute it

104
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.930
and we will also install Java within this particular section.

105
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.470
And then after that, all of these chapters like the Section three, is about classes, objects and

106
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.280
their members.

107
00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:01.520
So all of these chapters can be considered the initial chapters three, four, five can be considered

108
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.100
as five and also seven as the language basic series.

109
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.710
So those are really, really fundamental about the Java language syntax and all.

110
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:19.130
Then here we will learn about using Eclipse and we will learn how to use it in a professional way.

111
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:27.170
So before the section we will use a normal text editor like Notepad Plus Plus in case of Windows and

112
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.690
we will run our commands from the command line.

113
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:35.210
But after that we will switch over to Eclipse and this is the right time to switch to Eclipse because

114
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.240
Eclipse hides a lot of details.

115
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.850
For instance, the compilation process is done automatically, but as a beginner you need to know how

116
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:49.160
to compile from the how to compile your programs and run your programs from the command line.

117
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:55.040
And for that reason, we, you know, we use a normal editor and we use a command prompt in order to

118
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.930
compile and run our programs.

119
00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.660
So later, I will also talk about what compilation is in one of the subsequent sections.

120
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.180
So here we will learn about Eclipse.

121
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.320
And even if you are a college student, I would like you to do this particular section.

122
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.120
It's just one hour and learn how to use Eclipse in an effective way.

123
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:19.850
Then after that, here we deal with inheritance and polymorphism.

124
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.360
So these are the object oriented programming concepts.

125
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.630
And before doing that, we will do a case study of a real world social bookmarking application that

126
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.950
my company is developing.

127
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:37.520
And we will look at the different requirements and the different features that are part of those requirements.

128
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.620
And in order to implement those features, we need to learn all of these concepts.

129
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.440
So that's how we are going to learn these concepts.

130
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:52.700
So instead of using some pie examples, we are going to use a real world case study and here we will

131
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.080
learn how to debug our programs and also unit test the program.

132
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.270
And the project starts here and the project is actually an implementation of this case study itself,

133
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.840
typically in many courses if there is a project.

134
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.580
So they will have some project, but that's completely independent of what you are learning.

135
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.030
But in this case we implement what we are learning here.

136
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.420
The learning is based on this case study, as I just mentioned.

137
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.400
So we implement that case study.

138
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.680
So there is no context switch in that sense.

139
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:27.890
Then these are all the rest of the chapters and here is the input output chapter where we read from

140
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:28.550
files.

141
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.800
So here also the project is extended.

142
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.010
You know, we have this thing called as project extension.

143
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.800
So the project is gradually extended.

144
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:44.550
And here when we learn about databases, we further extend the project to use a database.

145
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.650
And finally we also web enable it when we learn about the Java technology.

146
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.740
So that's right at the very end.

147
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.330
So if you are a Java aspirant, you have to learn everything.

148
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.500
Now let's explore one of these.

149
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.950
So every chapter starts with most of the chapters.

150
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:07.240
Start with an introduction where we talk about the agenda for the chapter.

151
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.010
Most of them also end with a conclusion.

152
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:18.330
And in the conclusion we summarize the entire of what we have learned and every section here.

153
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.240
There are also quizzes.

154
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.700
Here is one quiz in this section.

155
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:29.790
Mostly you will see them at the end of the chapter, but sometimes they are also there in the middle

156
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.720
of the chapter.

157
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:36.760
If the chapter is really huge and there are also coding exercises and we will also look at that.

158
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:43.050
Now some of the lectures have resources, so if there are any demos in that lecture.

159
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.480
So most of the lectures have demos.

160
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:52.050
So if there is a demo, then the program that we have implemented will be available.

161
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.780
So if you see this resources, it means that there is a demo.

162
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.190
So.

163
00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.430
For instance, this one.

164
00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:04.490
So it has this file, Java file, so you can download it, but I would recommend actually implementing

165
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.770
the demo when it is being demonstrated.

166
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.250
And this particular lecture also has the speed of documents.

167
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:15.890
Sometimes we also have some supplementary notes, some additional notes which you can download and read.

168
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.350
So that's that the resource says.

169
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.830
Few sections have assignments, but most sections have.

170
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.100
Our chapters have coding exercises.

171
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:35.240
And here in this particular section, we start learning about the design rules.

172
00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.770
Design principles.

173
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:43.050
And in this particular Section seven, we also learn about some coding conventions.

174
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.330
So that is something that you need to learn.

175
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.770
Even if you are a college student, you need to use good coding conventions.

176
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.400
Now here in exceptions, let me show you something.

177
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:59.340
So I said that there are some design principles also that we are learning from the effective Java book,

178
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.080
but we will learn it.

179
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.280
We're using our own examples and we implement them using our own programs.

180
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.660
So for some of them we have these things called as best practices.

181
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.050
Those are some best practices that you need to follow.

182
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:20.890
Now let me head over to this particular section and let me click on one of the lectures here.

183
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.890
This one.

184
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.940
It's right here.

185
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.040
So let me just play it.

186
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.950
Hi there.

187
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.860
This is Lou and welcome back.

188
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.650
Now, here there is this thing called a playback rate.

189
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:41.020
So here you can adjust the speed of my talk for by default it is one X, so that's the default speed.

190
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:48.340
If you find my talking speed to be slow, then you can click on this 11. 25x, so it will be slightly

191
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.120
faster.

192
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.750
So how does this collect the collection?

193
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.540
Within the stream operations class.

194
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.510
And there is also 0.75.

195
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:03.230
In case if you are finding one X to be to be fast, then you can try 0.75.

196
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.720
But I think it is too slow.

197
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.360
So these are the three options that you can use.

198
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.450
And here.

199
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:10.350
There.

200
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.250
There's this thing called us notes.

201
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:20.270
So if you want to take any notes while viewing the lecture, you can click on this one and you can take

202
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.290
notes here.

203
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:28.180
In case if you have any questions, go into this Q&A tab here.

204
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:35.170
And you can you know, you can check if there are any questions, similar questions that have been asked.

205
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.200
So click on these are all the questions.

206
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:44.920
Just click on Current Lecture and it shows you the questions that that have been asked in this particular

207
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.520
lecture.

208
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.430
So see if those questions help you.

209
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:54.370
If not, then you can click on a question and you can ask a new question, and I will respond back within

210
00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:54.790
a day.

211
00:14:55.060 --> 00:15:00.640
Now here, when we click on all lectures, it's going to show us a question from all of the lectures.

212
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.430
And the most recent ones will be at the top.

213
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.200
If you want to answer some of the questions, feel free to answer those questions because you might

214
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.080
have learned and you might be familiar with that question.

215
00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:16.510
So do that and that will really help you to learn also, because in order to answer that question,

216
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.780
you might actually refer to your notes and you might answer it.

217
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.550
So that can be very helpful.

218
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:26.080
So that's about the questions and there are also coding exercises.

219
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.810
Now, let me just show you one coding exercise.

220
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.870
So here there is one coding exercise.

221
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.190
It has a short description here.

222
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.090
What the coding exercise is about.

223
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.300
And you also have a place for you to submit your solution.

224
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:46.400
In this case, you need to provide two programs and once you hit check solution, there are scripts

225
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.320
that have been installed here.

226
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.290
So they will test your solution for correctness.

227
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:57.140
And if they are correct, it will say that it is a success and if it is not correct, then it says that

228
00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.480
your solution has not passed the test.

229
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:04.510
And in that scenario, you can it might also give you some hint where it went wrong.

230
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.550
Then you can try to fix it and then resubmit it.

231
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:13.250
Now, if you have tried hard enough, long enough, and if you are unable to get it through, then you

232
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.960
can send me your solution.

233
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:19.640
Do not post in the Q&A section because Q&A section is for everyone.

234
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:25.430
So other students are also trying to solve the problem and hence it's not a good idea to post it here.

235
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:30.260
So if you want to share your solution, you can private message me and the way you can do it is click

236
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.620
on this overview tab and just go down here.

237
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:38.210
Click on See More and you will find.

238
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.410
My profile here.

239
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:47.490
Here, just click on this and it will open a page such as this one, and you can click on Send Message

240
00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.330
and you can send me a private message.

241
00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:56.260
And once I respond back, you also get an email and you can click on that or you can click on.

242
00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.810
If you click on that link.

243
00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:03.200
You can go into messages and view my private messages that I have sent.

244
00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.640
So that's further sharing your solution.

245
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.579
It has to be only via the private message.

246
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.640
Now let's just head over to the slides.

247
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.079
I just want to give some tips.

248
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.390
Okay.

249
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.460
Let's look at some very important general suggestions.

250
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.369
The first one is the most important one.

251
00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:27.690
So make sure that you are concentrating really hard because lot of details are packed into every single

252
00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:28.380
lecture.

253
00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.190
So if you miss your concentration, then you're going to miss something.

254
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.290
That is for sure.

255
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.590
There is no fluff at all in any of the lectures, so please concentrate.

256
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.350
Well, do not rush through any of the lectures.

257
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.740
Do them systematically and if needed, take notes.

258
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:49.590
And if you're not clear about something, then just review the lecture one or more times and that should

259
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.310
be helpful.

260
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:56.790
And if you still have any questions, then do post your questions, make sure to implement the demos.

261
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.850
So this is a programming course, so you need to program, so implement everything that is being demonstrated.

262
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:09.570
Similarly, do all of the exercises put in the effort to solve those exercises, and that will give

263
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:13.080
you a lot of confidence because they validate what you have learned.

264
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.430
So that's very important.

265
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.330
And this is one book, this is Effective Java by Joshua Bloch.

266
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.290
So this is an intermediate level ebook or advanced level ebook.

267
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.150
So it doesn't teach any core concepts.

268
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:30.360
But we do cover some of these best practices that are discussed in this book, and we do it in our own

269
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:30.740
way.

270
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.220
You don't have to buy this book.

271
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.260
Everything is explained clearly.

272
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:39.570
Maybe later on in the second half of the course or once you are through the course, this is something

273
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.950
that you would want to buy.

274
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.370
And these are two other books for your reference head.

275
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.180
First, Java is a very good book, but it's only an introductory book.

276
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:53.850
It teaches you the basics using nice graphics, so that is something that you can purchase, but it

277
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.050
is not required at all.

278
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.640
Harnessing Java by Kishori Sharan is also an introductory book.

279
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.020
It covers all of the details.

280
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.090
It's not just the introduction.

281
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.160
Again, it is only a reference.

282
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.370
We don't need these books just in case.

283
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:13.290
If something is not clear and if you want something handy, then you can perhaps refer to this books.

284
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.450
And that's the reason I have included them here.

285
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:21.180
Other than that, everything is covered in this course from the basics to the very advanced.

286
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:27.720
And you know, at some point, please do consider leaving a rating or review and that will help me and

287
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.590
also other students and feel free to provide any feedback for me.

288
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.310
That's it.

289
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.760
Thank you.

290
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.200
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
