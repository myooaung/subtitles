00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:02,930
Hi there.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,060
This is Uluru and welcome back.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:13,910
There is this pretty popular code which says Write your code as of the next guy to maintain is a homicidal

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,280
maniac who knows where you live.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:24,230
So this code suggests that we need to use proper coding conventions so that the next person to maintain

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,730
it has a pleasant experience and would be happy to maintain your code.

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:35,600
But if you do not write your code using proper coding conventions, then the person who is going to

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,450
maintain your code might not have a pleasant experience and he might be unhappy.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,360
And if it turns out to be a homicidal maniac, then he may find you and might cause trouble to you.

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:56,640
So in the last lecture we looked at the JSP file and we used some legacy tax, which we were not supposed

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,210
to use.

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,930
So the legacy tax made us use some Java code within the GSP file.

13
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:13,830
So we made one enhancement in the last lecture where we removed the Java code and the servlet and we

14
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,730
made it better.

15
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:22,620
But we still can improve it further because we have some Java code within the JSP page itself and that's

16
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,450
where we are going to use a GST.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,120
Now GST stands for JSP Standard Tag Library.

18
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:39,540
So it's a library of GSP tax too, and we need to use those tags and it extends the JSP specification.

19
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:48,810
And as of today, the latest version is GST L 1.2, and it essentially helps replace embedded Java code

20
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,540
with some other GSP tags and we will see how that can be done.

21
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,590
So we are going to modify the GSP file, which we have written in the last lecture.

22
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,190
Here is the My Bookstore JSP file, which we have written in the last lecture.

23
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,580
So now we are going to use some GST tags.

24
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:16,650
So they are also JSP tags, but come with the GST library and we will use them to replace the the legacy

25
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,750
tags that we see here so that they look very similar to HTML tags.

26
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,840
So that would be much more convenient for frontend developers, it would be much more easier to read.

27
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,580
So we are going to do that.

28
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,140
So we are going to replace these triplets that we see here, this and this.

29
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:40,920
We are going to use some tags which would do the same thing, which will have this, which will have

30
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,860
the same logic of iterating through the books.

31
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:49,620
So we are going to use some tags for that, a tag for that, and we are just going to look at one or

32
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,310
two tags.

33
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,360
And for the rest of them you can take a look at the GST.

34
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,370
So you can look at some tutorials for GST and you can learn more about them.

35
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,960
Okay, so but to use those tags, we need to import a jar file.

36
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,780
So let's go into the box project here.

37
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,940
Right click going to properties.

38
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,390
Okay.

39
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,670
Let's click on Java Build Path so that we can add the jar.

40
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,720
So let's say add external jars.

41
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,880
So here I have this jar.

42
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,370
It's called steal hyphen 1.2.

43
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,910
1.2 is the latest version in the resources section.

44
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,470
I will provide you a link to this jar file or I might provide this jar file itself.

45
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,950
So do look out in the resources section.

46
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,730
To say open and apply.

47
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,770
So it is added.

48
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:47,410
Now that jar file is good for this eclipse, but it also has to go into our var file, the var file

49
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,990
that we are going to create so that the web application can also use it.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,710
So let's go ahead and click on this thing called deployment assembly and then click on ADD.

51
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,440
Click on Java Build Path entries.

52
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,110
Click that and click next.

53
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:12,290
So it shows this ticket and let's say finish.

54
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,430
So it added that and I have already added servlet api jar two.

55
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,510
So we are good with that.

56
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,460
I have added it offline.

57
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,720
So a servlet API is already there and tomcat also.

58
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,960
And it was there inside the lib folder.

59
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,880
But I have added it just for this specific web application to the books.

60
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,540
Aloha.

61
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:41,660
So that it will be within the lib folder that is also present within the books aloha web project.

62
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,750
I'll show it to you.

63
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,880
So let me head.

64
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,670
Okay, so we are done with that now.

65
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:54,260
JSP Deal is essentially a JSP tag library, so it's a bunch of tag libraries and we are going to use

66
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,120
one of the library called Core.

67
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,730
It's just like using the Java library.

68
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:05,510
In order to use that, we need to use we need to say we need to tell that we want to use that particular

69
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,470
tag library.

70
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,210
So I'm going to replace this.

71
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,800
We don't need this anymore with this particular tag.

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,930
It's called as a tag lib directive.

73
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,290
It's a JSP tag too.

74
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,860
And here it is.

75
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,230
We are here we are specifying that we want to use the core tag library.

76
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:31,040
So some of the tags are defined there and we are using this prefix called C and that will be used in

77
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,060
the JSP tag.

78
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,840
So that is that and we need to replace this.

79
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:43,010
So what I'm going to do is so I'm going to first add that tag, it's called for each.

80
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,910
OC, which is used for iteration.

81
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,170
So this is the ending tag.

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,300
Let me take this and replace this here.

83
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,480
Let me put it here and then we can remove it.

84
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,980
So this has a bunch of attributes.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,790
One of them is called Var and let me call it as book.

86
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,810
So for each is just identical to the for each statement in Java.

87
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,110
So here let me call it as book.

88
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,110
And there is another attribute called items.

89
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,200
Okay.

90
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,090
So now we need the array.

91
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,680
So in my bookstore, Java, we are setting this attribute called my books.

92
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,970
So we need this.

93
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,580
We need to iterate through this.

94
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,620
Particular ArrayList, which is what we were doing here.

95
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,560
So we will just say my box.

96
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,070
However, in order to access it, we use something called an expression language.

97
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,440
L Which starts with.

98
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,830
Which stands for expression, language, and this is how you would do it.

99
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,130
So you'd have the dollar symbol and the braces and within the brace, you have my books.

100
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,220
So this way we get access to.

101
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,560
And this particular object reference.

102
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,390
So that's what we are doing here.

103
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:09,340
And my books that we see here is the is attribute name and that's what we are using here to.

104
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,560
It is not my box, it's not the variable name itself, but it is the attribute name.

105
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,090
This is the attribute name.

106
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,130
And that's it.

107
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,210
That's the thing.

108
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,460
And we don't need this anymore.

109
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,550
But before that, let me replace this also.

110
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,860
So here we have the book variable.

111
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,840
So what we will do, as that said dollar, we use the expression language once again.

112
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:40,780
So once you are done with this course, do read on the GSP tags as well as the GST tags as well as the

113
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,010
expression language.

114
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,630
So let me put here use but here to use it.

115
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,910
We don't need this.

116
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,030
We just need the filename rather than the method name.

117
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,630
So that is what we need.

118
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,990
And let me copy this for otter to so it's Facebook don't get author.

119
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,080
We just need to say book author.

120
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,590
So let me copy and replace that with this.

121
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:08,810
Okay.

122
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,650
Remember that the field names were image URL, author and rating.

123
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,920
And let's do the same for the last one.

124
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,190
And this would be rating.

125
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,690
That's all there is.

126
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,970
So we can remove all of this.

127
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,250
We don't need this.

128
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,510
And let's also remove we don't need this comment to this was just for demonstration.

129
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,840
So we have the footage here and this footage is creating two new records.

130
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,850
So we need to remove this triplet to.

131
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,330
Okay.

132
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,860
So this is all we have.

133
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,470
So as you can see, it is much more cleaner.

134
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,500
The entire script has been replaced with this tag.

135
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,650
And that's the beauty of G Steel.

136
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,760
So now it is much more convenient for a frontend developer to use this.

137
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,910
So let's go ahead and export.

138
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,780
The file.

139
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,110
Keep my books on it would be books.

140
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,820
Aloha.

141
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,310
And it's going to override the old one.

142
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,470
Finish.

143
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,480
Here it is.

144
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,610
And let me go into the Web Apps Directory.

145
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,320
I'm inside Tomcat Web apps.

146
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,850
So let me copy it.

147
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,540
My Tomcat is on, so it's going to automatically unpack this.

148
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:33,940
Okay.

149
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,570
There you go.

150
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,620
Now let me go here and hit the control f five.

151
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:39,820
There you go.

152
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,840
So that's it.

153
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,640
So we have used this.

154
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,450
And let me also show one more tag.

155
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,430
We can also add the tag.

156
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,510
Either we can make the change here or we can also change directly.

157
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,570
Over here also if we want to.

158
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:05,100
Normally you wouldn't do that, but if you want to, you can also change here and in web apps, books.

159
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,800
Aloha.

160
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,630
We have this file.

161
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,160
So let me just change.

162
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,450
Add a new tag.

163
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,080
Okay.

164
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:21,070
So here we have let's say we want to display only the book, which has a rating of at least five four.

165
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,220
So we can say there is a new tag called C.

166
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,800
Remember that the C here is the prefix.

167
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,720
We are defining the prefix here.

168
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,170
Yes.

169
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,390
And the library we are using is called a score.

170
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,020
So that's why we are we are using this specific library, JSP library.

171
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,540
There are also a few other JSP library libraries, but this is the most common one that we use.

172
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:47,560
It has all these tags representing such if if statements are or iteration.

173
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,540
So it's called F.

174
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,070
Best.

175
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,390
So we want.

176
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:01,780
To create a euro only if the rating is greater than four.

177
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,720
So we can use this greater than symbol and let's say for.

178
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,710
And this has to come right before the for the ending statement.

179
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,910
That's it.

180
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,530
Let me go back here and refresh and see if it's going to work.

181
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,280
Something is wrong here.

182
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,220
Well, this has to be here.

183
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,800
Not here, but it should be here.

184
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,440
So instead of just having it like this, we have this whole thing.

185
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,650
So greater than 4.0 has to be here.

186
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,610
That's it.

187
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,030
So the other book had a rating less than four.

188
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,440
So this one had five.

189
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,030
So that's the thing.

190
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,290
So we looked at JSTOR and you can see that it's much more cleaner code.

191
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:56,790
But I also have to say that even GSP is kind of considered as an obsolete technology.

192
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,580
And these days face less is used.

193
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,930
Face less is another view.

194
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:08,310
Technology, just like GSP and Facelifts, is used in conjunction with something called JSF Java Server

195
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,520
faces, and it's a framework that also offers.

196
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,620
This is a framework and within that you can use face.

197
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,640
So that's a newer technology which you can explore later.

198
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,580
But at least I just wanted to specify that.

199
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:28,740
So you don't see many projects using JSP anymore, but at least this gives you a good foundation about

200
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,610
MVC and how JSP can be used.

201
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:39,840
And we are also we have also seen how not to use legacy code, legacy JSP tags and instead use expression

202
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,800
language as well as gesture tags so that it is much more convenient for frontend developers to work

203
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,750
on the front end code.

204
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,270
Before signing off.

205
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,710
Let me also just show you.

206
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,370
The lit folder, which I was talking about.

207
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:01,020
So we are inside web apps, books, aloha, web inf.

208
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:08,190
So within web enough we have the lip and here is where we have the GST l 1.2 and the servlet API two.

209
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,880
And this is what I was demonstrating earlier.

210
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,830
In the eclipse in order to have this still within the VAR file.

211
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:25,930
Now, within web apps in Tomcat, also there is the lib folder which has some some jar files and servlet

212
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,340
API is also here.

213
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,150
So that would be applicable for the entire Tomcat itself.

214
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:37,360
But it is it has also been added into the Web Apps Directory and I have done that offline.

215
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,140
So just wanted to show you the lib folder too.

216
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,220
So that's about it.

217
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,570
Thank you and happy coding.
