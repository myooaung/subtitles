00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:02.990
Hi there.

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.150
This is the Ramona La Rue.

3
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.050
And welcome back.

4
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:12.130
So, so far, we have seen how we can programmatically read data from the database and also how we can

5
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.810
programmatically insert data into the database.

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.210
Right.

7
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.050
That's what we have seen in the previous lecture.

8
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.690
Now, let's see how we can programmatically update existing data in the database.

9
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.570
So we have data in the tables.

10
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.420
We need to see how we can update them.

11
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.780
And for that, we have update queries so which we are going to look at in this particular lecture.

12
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:38.520
So you may recall that there is this feature in our project called Marking as Kid Friendly.

13
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.020
So a particular bookmark can be marked as kit friendly or it is not kid friendly.

14
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.320
It can be marked as either as kid friendly or not kid friendly.

15
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.470
If it is marked as kid friendly, it means that it can be viewed by kids.

16
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.950
Right?

17
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.040
And so a particular bookmark can be marked as kid friendly or not, and it can be done by only certain

18
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.510
types of users, like the certain types of staff members like Ed or chief Ed.

19
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.510
So when a particular ed or Chief Ed marks a certain bookmark as kid friendly or not, then that information

20
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.690
about that particular user should also be captured.

21
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.400
So that is mainly for bookkeeping purposes because if some inappropriate bookmark is marked as kid friendly,

22
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.000
then we know who that user is and we can question that user why he or she has done that right and maybe

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.620
remove some of their privileges if they are not doing their job in a proper way.

24
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.620
So we need to capture that kind of information.

25
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.260
So that's one thing.

26
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.220
So what we need to do is we need to update our update our table for that.

27
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.640
We need to modify that table for that table structure for that.

28
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.340
Now, apart from the kid friendly, there was also another feature that was added called Sharing of

29
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.110
Bookmarks.

30
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.350
You might remember that.

31
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.590
You might recall that bookmarks, certain bookmarks like books and web links can be shared with can

32
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.180
be shared with partner websites.

33
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.860
So and that is also done by staff members like editors or editors.

34
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.700
And when one of those does that for a certain bookmark, then we need to once again capture who that

35
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.450
user is.

36
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.150
So we need to make certain changes in the database in order to capture that information.

37
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.970
And for that, we have these tables here, we have these SQL statements here.

38
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.100
It's called as Ed Table.

39
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.990
So we need to do that.

40
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.120
We need to add certain columns and book web link and also movie, right?

41
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.310
These are the three types of bookmarks and they can be marked as kid friendly.

42
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.690
So there is already a column which we have added called Kid Friendly Status.

43
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:52.210
Now we need to also add columns to capture the information about the user who is setting it as kid friendly

44
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.480
or who is sharing the bookmark now.

45
00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.460
And so for that reason, we are adding going to add two columns in the book table.

46
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.140
So the commander's editor followed by this keyword table.

47
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.880
So those are reserved keywords followed by the table name, which is book.

48
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.290
And we are saying add column.

49
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.480
This is also keywords, reserved keywords and we are saying the name of the column, new column would

50
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.880
be kid friendly marked by.

51
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.750
So it tells who that user was who has moved.

52
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.360
And it is a big end and.

53
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.090
We don't need this country.

54
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:36.010
And we are saying that this kid friendly marked by is a foreign key and it is referencing the ID and

55
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.930
the user field.

56
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.070
It's essentially a user ID.

57
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.110
And similarly we are also adding another column called Shared by.

58
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.810
So this is for capturing the information about a bookmark that is shared with the partner site.

59
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.560
And once again, it would be a big end.

60
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.440
Unshared shared by is also a foreign key and it also references the ID in the user ID.

61
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.430
So we are essentially adding these two columns, kid friendly mark by and shared by.

62
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.200
And we are also saying that kid friendly magpie should be added after this particular column called

63
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.430
Kid Friendly Status.

64
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.350
So that's how you would say that.

65
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.339
And for shared by we are saying that it needs to be added after this newly added column kid friendly

66
00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:22.019
magpie.

67
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.360
So those are the two columns we are adding and then go after the kid friendly status shared.

68
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.700
I would go after this new, new column and both of them are foreign keys and we are doing the same thing

69
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.330
for web link.

70
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.370
Also we are adding kid friendly magpie and we are adding the shared by columns.

71
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:47.050
And once again, they are they are foreign keys and in the movie column we are only adding kid friendly

72
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.720
marked by, but we are not adding a shared by column.

73
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.000
That's because movies cannot be shared with that third party site, with the partner site.

74
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.080
So that was the rule.

75
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.870
If you recall, only books and web links can be shared.

76
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.620
So that's what it is.

77
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.500
So let's go ahead and execute these queries.

78
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.170
Now this is the data from the previous.

79
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.370
From the previous lecture.

80
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.400
Let's also delete this data.

81
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.230
Especially for the use of for the bookmarking data because we are going to run this program once again

82
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:34.790
and this particular table would be would be populated with more, more and more data than bookmarking

83
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.930
the bookmarking tables which we have created in the previous lecture.

84
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.880
So let me just say from.

85
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.970
So this we are doing just because when we run the program once again, it's going to add more.

86
00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.610
It's going to add more and more information into these tables.

87
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.710
So we are just cleaning up these tables.

88
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.270
So we just copy these three queries.

89
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.070
We are done.

90
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.030
So we have these tables.

91
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.810
So let me just say in the C book.

92
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.560
So it could show all the, the schema of the table so that you would use this kind of a query.

93
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.920
DSC It means to describe a book.

94
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.860
So as you can see shared by and kid friendly marked by have been added.

95
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.500
And we also said that kid friendly marked by has to be added after kid friendly status so we can see

96
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.630
that it got added here and shared by we said it needs to be added after kid friendly.

97
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.760
So it got added here and the similar changes would have been made in other tables too.

98
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.540
So this is how you would change the schema.

99
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:53.160
You would add new columns into into the existing tables, which can have some data.

100
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.540
Also, in our case, they already have some data, but we can still change the schema in this way.

101
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.690
Now let's get back to the code.

102
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.180
And this is the view class.

103
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.350
So earlier we have seen how we could this is a code for bookmarking.

104
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.200
Now this is the code for setting.

105
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.400
Good friendly status.

106
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.450
So let's just briefly look at it.

107
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.320
So we are saying that f so this is a frontal lobe here we have our lobe.

108
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:30.590
So here we are inside a particular we are looking at a particular bookmark and this is being invoked

109
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.280
on a particular user from the launch class.

110
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:41.780
And here we are saying f the user is of this type editor or chief editor.

111
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.910
Then we need to see if we can set the get friendly status.

112
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.620
And we know that there is this method called E kid friendly eligible which tells whether the bookmark

113
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:57.110
is in the first place, whether it is kid friendly, eligible or not, and if it is eligible and if

114
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:04.130
it is if the kid friendly status if you see kid friendly status is an enum, it can be in a in one of

115
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.320
these states approved, rejected or unknown.

116
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.080
So initially it would be an unknown state.

117
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.400
So we are saying if it is an unknown state, then get the decision here.

118
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.340
So this is the class for getting the decision.

119
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:22.040
And so earlier we had this code which is slightly wrong.

120
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.920
So the randomized function should be like this.

121
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:31.910
We get the math random decision and if the decision is less than 0.4, it means that it is approved.

122
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.630
But if it is between 0.4 and 0.8, then it is rejected.

123
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.210
So once again, we are using randomized function.

124
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.420
I'm just this is I'm highlighting because earlier we were using this random function many several times,

125
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.760
but then this within this statement.

126
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.930
But now I realized that that was wrong.

127
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.000
One of the students has pointed that out.

128
00:08:54.270 --> 00:09:02.100
So it's going to be random or we only compute it once and we are checking it here using the ternary

129
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.880
operator.

130
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.410
So if you go back.

131
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.970
So here it is.

132
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.940
So if it is equals unknown, we have got the effect.

133
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.410
So we are getting the decision.

134
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:16.170
And if it is, if it is not equal to unknown, then we are going to set the status set to friendly status.

135
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.270
So it's in the bookmark controller.

136
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.680
So you may recall that the view class is like the user interface.

137
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.670
So we can go here into the controller.

138
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.020
So this is the back end.

139
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.460
So this is a web server.

140
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:35.340
So this is the first point where a request is received on the web server side.

141
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:41.730
And then we are invoking the manager and then the manager we had the we were having these steps.

142
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.730
So the bookmark status is being set.

143
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.720
Right here.

144
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:55.550
This method is invoked with user friendly status and also the bookmark for which we are setting the

145
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.150
status.

146
00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.590
So we are just forwarding that information to this method.

147
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:06.950
And within the method for that bookmark, we are setting the status, what our status has been selected,

148
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.600
approved or rejected.

149
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:15.680
And we are also marking the user information here and we are passing all of this information to this

150
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:22.070
new method which I have written called update kid friendly status within the bookmark class.

151
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.360
So this is what here this is some new method that I have written.

152
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.400
So all we are going to do is here we are checking.

153
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.990
So this is a bookmark.

154
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.430
We are fact checking.

155
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:42.240
If this bookmark here, whether it is by default, we are saying it's movie book.

156
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.280
But if it is an instance of movie, then we are updating this variable.

157
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.500
So we have this variable called table to update, which will be used in our SQL query here.

158
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.980
So first, let's look at the SQL query here.

159
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.150
So this is the query.

160
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:03.060
So the query and here is the try with resources syntax, just like in the previous lectures.

161
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.760
So we get a connection, we get a statement and here is our query and the query is update query because

162
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.700
we are going to update update the table.

163
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.930
The table can be book, movie or web link.

164
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.420
So that is decided by this.

165
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.820
So we are using an instance of operator here.

166
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.440
So by default it would be movie.

167
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:28.290
But if the bookmark is an instance of movie, then we are updating this particular variable to movie.

168
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:36.400
But if it is an instance of weblink, we are setting it to web link so that table to update variable

169
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.740
is used here here.

170
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:45.400
So the command would be update followed by the table name and the table name is captured would be one

171
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.450
of these three depending on what the bookmark is.

172
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.790
So I hope that is clear.

173
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:58.600
And we are saying it is followed by set keyword and we are saying get friendly status equal to.

174
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.040
Here.

175
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.840
There is the kid friendly status.

176
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.900
So we are appending a kid friendly status.

177
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.450
And kid friendly status was.

178
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:15.360
You know, within the bookmark, we were setting the get kid friendly status here in the previous method

179
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.350
here we were setting it as get free kid friendly status.

180
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.120
So we are just using the getter method.

181
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.170
Oh, sorry.

182
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:29.680
So we are using the getter method and getting the get get friendly status, which is an enum constant.

183
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:30.670
Right.

184
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.680
And we are invoking the ordinal method which is from the enum class.

185
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.000
So kid friendly status is an enum.

186
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.770
It can be one of these three.

187
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:46.600
So if it is approved or rejected, if it is approved, it would have an original value of zero.

188
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.660
If it is rejected, it would have an ordinal value of one.

189
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.750
So I hope you remember the enum lectures.

190
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.490
So that's all we are doing here in bookmark dao.

191
00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:04.420
So we are getting the status and in the bookmark manager we are also setting who the user is who has

192
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.590
marked that particular bookmark.

193
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.730
As with a certain kid friendly status.

194
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.290
So that is the user.

195
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:18.160
So in the bookmark dao, we are once again just getting the who that user is by invoking this getter

196
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:24.820
method called get it friendly, marked by and we are getting the user ID of that particular user.

197
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:32.770
So now we have the kid friendly status and we also know the user ID and we are just saying set get kid

198
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.560
friendly status is equal to this one.

199
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.840
So we are building our query in this way by concatenating.

200
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:43.250
And we are also saying get friendly, marked by you.

201
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.370
So we have a comma.

202
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.590
And this is the second next field.

203
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:55.200
And we are saying equal to user ID and we are also saying where ID equal to bookmark.

204
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.890
Dot get ID right.

205
00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.420
Because we are doing all of this for a particular bookmark.

206
00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.680
So this statement has update table name.

207
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:10.190
Let's assume it is book set it friendly status equal to let's say it is approved.

208
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:18.090
So it would be the value for that, the corresponding ordinal value and we are saying marked by it,

209
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:25.290
friendly marked by user ID where ID is equal to that particular ID of the book.

210
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.070
And that can be a book, a movie or web link.

211
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.660
And we are saying statement, dot, execute, update, and we are passing this query.

212
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.940
Just recall that if it is an insert update or a delete, we will use execute update.

213
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.860
If it is an if it is if it is a select query, we would use execute query.

214
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.600
Just recall that.

215
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.640
So that's it.

216
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.420
Update kit friendly status.

217
00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:55.870
Now if we go back to view class, so that's the kid friendly, but then we also have this sharing thing.

218
00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.380
So once again it is inside the same F condition.

219
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.650
So if it is an editor or a chief editor.

220
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:11.420
So once the market is kid friendly, then they also have the option to share that particular bookmark.

221
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:18.380
But that particular bookmark has to be either a movie or either a book or a web link.

222
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.760
Only then it is shareable.

223
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.670
So there is this interface called Shareable.

224
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:29.300
You may recall that only book and web link would implement that movie will not implement.

225
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.650
So if the bookmark is a movie, then this this particular condition would fail.

226
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:41.180
But if it is a book or a web link, it would it would pass because those are two types actually implement

227
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.130
this shareable, shareable interface.

228
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.980
That's for instance, we are seeing instance of shareable.

229
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.000
Theaters interface shareable.

230
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:57.860
And if and then we are once again getting the shared decision whether it can be shared or not.

231
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:03.290
And if 1/2 it's a randomized function, if it truly is retained, then we are.

232
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.950
So this since this is the UI, then we are passing the request to the back end to the server and we

233
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:15.200
are passing user information as well as the book bookmark information to this method called share,

234
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.270
which is in the bookmark controller.

235
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:24.110
So if you click that, so here is the bookmark controller and it is invoking a similarly named method

236
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.070
called share.

237
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:31.910
And this is what we have and we are here in this bookmark, we are setting this, we are invoking this

238
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.480
method called set shared by and we are setting the user.

239
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.410
It means that this bookmark is being shared by this particular user.

240
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:39.820
Right.

241
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.950
And we are once again, this is some information, some example.

242
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.200
This is just from the old code.

243
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.760
Just ignore it for now.

244
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.440
Now we are invoking shared by info method.

245
00:16:54.440 --> 00:17:01.310
So once again we need to update the tables about who who is going to share that information.

246
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.730
Right.

247
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.500
So for instance, so this is the new method that has been added in the bookmark.

248
00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:13.430
So once again, we have the update query, but this time we are updating the shared by column, which

249
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.560
we have added earlier.

250
00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.420
And we are saying who that user is.

251
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.970
And once again, we are saying ID is equal to the idea of the bookmark.

252
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.480
And once again, it's just the same update query.

253
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:32.400
So the table to update could be either a book or a web link.

254
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.730
It cannot be a movie because movies cannot be shared.

255
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.350
And the user ID is we are fetching the user ID in this way.

256
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.390
Bookmark not get it friendly marked by.

257
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.020
Which was set earlier here in the previous method.

258
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.030
Sorry.

259
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.300
This should be shared by.

260
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.460
Not that.

261
00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.020
Yeah.

262
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.060
I should be like that.

263
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:07.870
So we are getting the user who is sharing it and we are building our query, update, query here and

264
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:08.530
that's it.

265
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.130
Okay.

266
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.910
So let's go back to lunch.

267
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.720
So we are done with that.

268
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.180
So now let's go ahead and run it.

269
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.080
Said so.

270
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.590
It's not easy to read.

271
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.510
So I'm just going to add this.

272
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.980
So if I put a slash G, so it will be printed in this way.

273
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:48.680
So here we can see that for this particular row, the kid friendly status is zero, which means that

274
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:55.130
it is approved and it was set by this user with the ID three and it was shared by this user with the

275
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.270
user ID file.

276
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.010
So that's what it is.

277
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.410
So I think it is clear now.

278
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.830
So we have seen how we can update data.

279
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.480
So that's about it.

280
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.300
And if you have any questions, please let me know.

281
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.820
But I hope it is clear enough.

282
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.930
Thank you.

283
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.070
And that's it.

284
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.970
And happy coding.
