00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello there.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.950
This is the Rue.

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.890
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.030
So let's now go ahead and look at the different Java SE releases.

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.430
So in the last lecture we got a good understanding of the Java Sea.

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.260
Like an overview of Java Sea.

7
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.410
And it has many releases over the years.

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.190
In this lecture, we will look at the different releases and the release cycle, like how often a release

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.040
is being made and generally what comes out in the release.

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.210
And also a little bit about the history of the releases.

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.830
So here we are.

12
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.760
In a given year.

13
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.050
Currently they are doing two releases, one in March and one in September, for instance, in 2019.

14
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.190
In March, they released Java as a tool.

15
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.490
So along with that, all of the providers will also try to write to try to come up with a JDK implementation.

16
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.930
Like the Oracle, Amazon, the Open JDK, Oracle and so on.

17
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.710
So here this was released in March 2019, which is the specifications, and the JDC would come separately

18
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.400
and Java 13 was released in September.

19
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.390
So every year they are doing one release in March and one in September.

20
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.760
So that's a six month release cycle.

21
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.890
And this six month release cycle started from Java ten onwards, and before that the releases were much

22
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.910
less frequent.

23
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.980
So they used to release anywhere from once every 2 to 5 years.

24
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.960
For instance, Java six came out in 2006, seven came out in 2011.

25
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.900
So there is a gap of five years and eight in 14 and nine and 17.

26
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.990
So the problem with this is Java was evolving very slowly, right?

27
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.370
While other platforms and other programming languages were evolving very quickly.

28
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.710
So they were doing releases very quickly.

29
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.980
So Java is not like was not like that.

30
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.830
It was very slow and was not as agile as other platforms or programming languages.

31
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.440
Because of that, the, the innovation was kind of slow, so they wanted to make it faster.

32
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:16.660
So the reason why it used to happen is because the designers were always trying to bring out large,

33
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.850
big features in every release.

34
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.610
For instance, in eight there were Lambda Lambda expressions and eight was a very huge release.

35
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.070
Similarly, in nine, they had something called as modules of the Java platform module system, which

36
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.200
was also a very huge change.

37
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.620
So they have certain deadlines to meet, but because those features are so complex, the deadlines were

38
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.070
constantly getting extended and the release was not happening.

39
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.380
But the problem with that is in a release, apart from this big features, there would also be some

40
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.830
smaller features and which are completed, but we are unable to use it because the release itself is

41
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.710
not happening.

42
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.800
So the release was stopping those small features to see the light.

43
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.130
So we are unable to use those small features.

44
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.480
So the Java designers wanted to change that and so they decided to do frequent releases from Java ten

45
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.200
onwards.

46
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.100
But the thing the difference is that in each release they will only have fewer features coming out.

47
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.800
Like if there are any smaller features, they would come out.

48
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.550
But the larger features will also come out in one of the releases.

49
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.970
But in each release you will see you will see only few changes being made.

50
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.360
So that's the thing.

51
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.040
So they wanted to be agile like all other platforms to.

52
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.220
So here this particular document shows only till Java six, but before Java six, there were also five

53
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:51.120
other releases, five or six releases and dating back to 96 when Java came into existence.

54
00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:00.260
So in the first versions like the Java one, Java two and so on, so the Java one was initially called

55
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.620
as was called as JDK one, and then there was JDK 1.1 which came out in 97, and the next version was

56
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.510
J to as I recall, the Java Sea was earlier called J2 SC.

57
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.200
So they had some inconsistent version numbers like J.

58
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.260
SC 1.2, 1.3 and so on.

59
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:26.220
So the naming was very inconsistent, but in this course, let's call them as Java one, Java 1.1,

60
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.120
Java two, Java three, Java six, Java seven, and so on.

61
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.280
And I think everybody can understand that.

62
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.400
So in the initial versions, let me just give you an idea about what came out in those initial versions.

63
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:47.940
So before Java six, like in Java one and Java 1.1, they had only a few hundred classes.

64
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.500
Recall that each release comes with the Java Library, and the Java Library had only a few hundred classes,

65
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.940
and the platform itself in Java one on 1.1 was pretty slow.

66
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:08.190
Then Java two came out and it was a major release with addition of a significant number of new classes.

67
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.460
So there were a large number of classes that got added and more importantly, it was faster to, as

68
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.440
it included the compiler.

69
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:24.330
Then after that, Java five came out in around 2004, it was also a pretty huge release.

70
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.460
In between there were Java three and Java four, but probably they are not that significant.

71
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:37.080
Java five was really huge with new additions like generics and some new multithreading features, and

72
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.510
it had close to 2500 classes.

73
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.080
Then later, Java six, which we can see here, has come out.

74
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:49.020
It did not add much to the language itself, but had some important changes in the Java.

75
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:56.490
So sometimes in certain releases you will have you will see more changes in Java and fewer language

76
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.210
changes.

77
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.300
But now in the recent releases, you know, it's mostly smaller features that are coming out.

78
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.470
For instance, here.

79
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.260
And some of them are preview features.

80
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.420
For example, switch expressions was added as a preview feature, but later.

81
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.530
So it was a preview feature in Java 13 also.

82
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.380
But in Java 14 it became a permanent feature of the language.

83
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.390
There is something called switch expressions, so some of them are released as preview features.

84
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.020
They are not standard and they may be removed in the next release too.

85
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:34.140
If the if developers do not like them and they get the feedback that it's not good, so they might they

86
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.190
might remove the feature.

87
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.090
So that's about it.

88
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.640
And next we will install one of the latest versions of Java SE implementation.

89
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.700
So we'll install a JDK and we will get started.

90
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.560
Thank you and see you in the next lecture.
