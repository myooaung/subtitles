00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.100
Hi there.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:03.670
This is Dave.

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.320
And welcome back.

4
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:12.250
Let's now look at how to install the latest version of Java on a 64 bit Linux operating system.

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.800
If you're using a different operating system like Mac or Windows, please refer to the lecture specific

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.910
to that operating system.

7
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.720
And in this demo, we will look at how to install Java on a 64 bit open to operating system.

8
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.980
Now if you're using a 32 bit Linux or any other distribution other than Ubuntu, then I will provide

9
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.930
you with some instructions at the end of the lecture along with the rest of the instructions in the

10
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.010
resources section.

11
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.140
For now, let's go ahead and install Java on a 64 bit open to operating system and it is going to be

12
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.660
a very easy task.

13
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.330
So we will look at the easiest way to do it, just three commands.

14
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.680
First thing is, let's go ahead and open the terminal and the shortcut is control alt dt for terminal

15
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.240
and here are the instructions.

16
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.650
So I'm just going to copy them.

17
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.310
And all we need is the first three instructions to install Java.

18
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.890
So let's look at this.

19
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:17.800
So it's sudo add apt repository space PPA Colon Linux uprising slash java.

20
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.360
So let's just copy this.

21
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.110
In case if you are prompted to enter a password, then just enter your system.

22
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.830
Password.

23
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.640
The center.

24
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.350
Now.

25
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.730
Let's copy the second one.

26
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.280
It's sudo space apt hyphen get space update and all these instructions will be available in the resources

27
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.060
section.

28
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.590
And the third one is to install Java.

29
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:59.050
So as of now, the latest version is Java ten, in case you'll see some other later version, then you

30
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.710
can just install that particular Java version.

31
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.190
So as of now, it's Java ten.

32
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.330
It may be something else and you would have to use the correct version here.

33
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.380
It says Java ten.

34
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.790
So you can Google for Linux uprising and you can easily find out what the exact name his name is for

35
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.270
this.

36
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.180
So for Java eight, it used to be Java eight here.

37
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.660
Yes.

38
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.670
You need to accept the licence agreement.

39
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.030
Say och, then left select.

40
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.690
Yes.

41
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.470
It may take slightly longer for you because I'm going to edit out some of the some of the installation

42
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.540
process here in the interest of time.

43
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.900
So it's installed.

44
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.070
Java has been installed.

45
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.170
So to look at the latest, what version of Java has been installed and to confirm whether Java has been

46
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.600
installed, we just need to execute this command.

47
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.650
It's Java C, which is for the Java compiler space hyphen version.

48
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.860
So here it is.

49
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:16.310
It says Java ten has been installed and it will be installed in slash user slash lib slash JVM folder.

50
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.620
That's just for your information.

51
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.920
Now, if you happen to see some other version, then you can execute this command in order to set Java

52
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.240
ten as the default.

53
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.320
It's a pseudo space apt space install space oracle hyphen java ten, hyphen set hyphen default.

54
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.040
Now, if at all, you want to uninstall that and install the installed version, then you need to execute

55
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.970
these two commands.

56
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.680
So we're not going to do it now, but I will include these instructions in the resources section.

57
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.510
So that's it.

58
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.020
That's how we would install Java, as simple as that.

59
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.520
Now, if you are using a 32 bit version of Linux, then I'll show you how to install that.

60
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.050
Instructions will be in the resources section, but I'll show you what files you need to download.

61
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.510
So for that you can just execute this command.

62
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.200
You name space hyphen A.

63
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.580
Let me execute this and it will tell you whether yours is a 32 bit or a 64 bit.

64
00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:20.779
There you go.

65
00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.550
I think here there was an extra hyphen.

66
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.120
So here it is.

67
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.800
It says X 86, underscore 64.

68
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.910
And if yours is a 32 bit, it would say something like 83, 86.

69
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.990
So that's all there is to determine whether yours is a 32 bit or 64 bit operating system.

70
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:48.020
Now, what you can do is just go to Google and search for JDK download and you will see results like

71
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.600
this.

72
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.780
So all of these are Oracle lengths.

73
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.100
Just click on this one.

74
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.690
So this is for Java SE eight and this is for Java C ten.

75
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.010
But let's click this.

76
00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.660
So here it is.

77
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.710
The latest version as of now is JDK and you can click on this one.

78
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.580
So it has JDK and two versions of Java, but JDK is what we need to download because we are going to

79
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.050
develop Java programs.

80
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.780
Git is for executing Java programs.

81
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.610
You cannot develop Java programs with that.

82
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.230
So you would have to download this.

83
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.680
So if you are installing a different version of Linux other than Ubuntu, then you will click this.

84
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:31.580
But for 32 bit, the latest version that we can use is a Java eight.

85
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.810
So Java eight is here when you scroll down because the later versions of Java like Java ten do not support

86
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.680
32 bit OS.

87
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.940
So this is the only option that you have and once again you have the same format.

88
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.210
Jade can to is just click on JDK here.

89
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.710
Now here you need to just accept the license agreement.

90
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.140
And for 32 bit we have x86 here.

91
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:05.000
So you would download one of these to our RPM or to and instructions will be given in the resources

92
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.720
section.

93
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.690
So so you just need to accept the license agreement here.

94
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.210
Now if it is 64 bit, you can actually download one of these too.

95
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:21.290
For 64 bit it's 64 and 432 bit it's x 86 for about 464.

96
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.950
You can download the latest version instead of Java eight.

97
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.530
So once again, just click on JDC.

98
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.340
So here you have the two versions for Linux.

99
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.810
So there is no 32 bit here.

100
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.940
So just accept the license agreement and you can download one of these and the instructions will be

101
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.620
provided in the resources section.

102
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:49.850
So but what we have seen is the easiest way to install Java on Ubuntu and that's about it.

103
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.510
Thank you.

104
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.710
And see you in the next lecture.
