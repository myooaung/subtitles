1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:07,260
What and let's go ahead and continue extending our project I know we are going to implement something

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,980
more fancy and interesting.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,620
We're going to download web pages and write them to the desk.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,360
So in our system we have different kinds of bookmarks.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,610
A bookmark can be a weblink.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,100
It can be a movie or it can be a book.

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,850
Now when it comes to babblings when a user bookmarks a web link we were saving the title of the eyeblink

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,170
along with your old information.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,560
But now we want to extend the project to also download the corresponding web page content.

10
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,400
Now that would give us a couple of benefits.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,070
One of them is we can maintain a local cache of the web page.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,920
So if tomorrow the post is not available if it is taken on our of the web page is not available then

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,260
we still have the local cache of the web page and the user can still browse the [REMOVED].

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,640
But the more important benefit is that they can index all those web pages.

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,810
Now if we index those web pages it means that the user can actually search this business.

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:18,390
So indexing basically allows us to provide search capability an index is basically a data structure

17
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,500
which allows us to search text in a very efficient way.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,800
And there are third party libraries like so lock on Lucine which can help us in indexing their documents

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,600
.

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,210
So we're not going to index the web pages but we're going to just download the web page and we're going

21
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,680
to write it to their desk.

22
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:38,840
OK.

23
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,170
And so there are a couple of pasts involved here.

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,790
So when we say we are going to download a web page what we are doing is we are actually doing it normally

25
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,880
read operation.

26
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,180
But in this case the source is in a remote host earlier in the last lesson.

27
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,110
We saw that when we read we actually read from a file.

28
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,470
So do they are the source of just fine.

29
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,110
But now with this extension the source is basically remote host.

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,720
So it's the network.

31
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:12,720
So once we read the document from the remote host then we need to write it with a disk on product we

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,160
use the our writer causus.

33
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,630
OK so we are going to do that.

34
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,540
So let's just go ahead and make these extensions.

35
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,330
So I have created this new class called hysterically picnic and it has been added to the Udal package

36
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,730
which was created in the last class on the history class.

37
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,590
Has this method us don't work and all it is going to do as as the name suggests it's going to download

38
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,440
a webpage.

39
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,140
So the input to this method is a you are off of a page.

40
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:47,100
You are a lawful eyeblink which is a bookmark and it's going to honor the page and written the contents

41
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,460
of the web page as a string.

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,350
And here we are using some classes from the Jawa dot net package.

43
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,310
Since we did not discuss it you don't have to worry about it and it's not even production quality code

44
00:02:59,310 --> 00:02:59,920
.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,410
So basically here there is this class called hitcher to be your own connection and it represents a connection

46
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,240
to the remote host.

47
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,380
And then we are invoking this method called Let's get response called on this variable.

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:21,690
Can and when we do that if the response code is in between to those 200 and 300 It means that we are

49
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,740
able to connect with that.

50
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,820
So we're successfully on so we can read the contents of that particular page.

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,200
OK.

52
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,950
And that's what we're going to do here.

53
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:39,510
And so we are in working this matter called Get input stream on the connection object and get input

54
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,920
stream simply returns a regular input stream.

55
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,010
Ok so now we're going to just read from here.

56
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,220
And we know that input stream is the base abstract class for all byte oriented and streams.

57
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,030
So let's go ahead and fill this method and it could be part of the I or you do.

58
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:04,270
So let's just say create method and let's just go ahead and fill this matter.

59
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,090
So the previous method was reading from a file.

60
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:15,110
And instead of building a string it was writing it into the string every night.

61
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,950
So that was the last lesson.

62
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:25,350
So let's just go ahead and copy this because the code is pretty much identical.

63
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:39,000
So the one difference is let's make this as in to keep it simple and file in good stream object is replaced

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,150
with this input stream.

65
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,220
So it's more generic now.

66
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:50,610
And since we want to accumulate the content of the page we want to build a web page content that uses

67
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,800
string builder.

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,300
So we should always use a string builder.

69
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:07,560
I have seen code where people who are concatenating using the plus operation for such an important operation

70
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,270
and that's very bad.

71
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:17,020
Now string line is fine let's remove this.

72
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,330
To append

73
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:32,530
and we're writing a new line that's because real method is strips new lines lets add some catch glossier

74
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,670
to catch clause

75
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,930
.

76
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,600
So we are dimming that string method we are invoking the true string.

77
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:55,190
It's going to read on the web page content which has been accumulated and this string builder object

78
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,110
.

79
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,440
So that's about it.

80
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,920
And then coding is still UTF 8 and we will be using only you be of 8 in our system because that's like

81
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,640
a universal kind of cursor.

82
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,570
Now let's go back into history to be correct.

83
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,300
And this is fine.

84
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,790
Now let's look at the code which is going to invoke this method.

85
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,250
So if you're going to view our Java.

86
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,550
So we have this browse here and we are

87
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,420
basically for a given user we are going to we are doing the bookmarking here and we are going we are

88
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,670
invoking the same user bookmark.

89
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,130
So that's just going here.

90
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,110
It's into the going into book my controller.

91
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,760
From here we are going to bookmark manager and have already written some code here.

92
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:51,910
Now we want to download the web page only if the bookmark is an instance of eyeblink.

93
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:58,360
So here we are passing a bookmark which can be a weblink which can be a book or a movie but we want

94
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,760
to do this only if it is a weblink.

95
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,710
So here we are.

96
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,340
Downcasting it took a blink.

97
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,520
If it an instance off of a blink and we are working to get you out of the matter because wabbling has

98
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,920
a get your delimiter and then we are assigning it to this variable you are in.

99
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,440
So it basically has that you are a lot of eyeblink.

100
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:25,030
And we want to download only effect for now if it doesn't end with Dot B-B of which means that if it

101
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,700
ends with dockage DML or something like that then we want to download.

102
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,830
So then we are connecting in working this download method here.

103
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:33,860
OK.

104
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,250
Which is what we haven't seen.

105
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,080
And we are passing the Yoran of the page.

106
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,520
OK so once we get back the response.

107
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,040
So it's assigned to this wearable web page.

108
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,780
And if the web page is not equal to none only then we are going to write it to their desk.

109
00:07:52,780 --> 00:08:01,720
Sometimes it can be not also for instance if the response code is not within this limit then it means

110
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,180
that something is wrong in which case we are going to read on another.

111
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,840
OK so let's go back and let's also for the right matter now.

112
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,440
OK.

113
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:20,270
So that's also going to get created within the higher your class.

114
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:29,690
So let's go ahead and the input barometer here is the ID because the when we write to the desk we have

115
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,400
to create a file and the filename will be the name of the idea.

116
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,409
So because the idea is unique to the bookmark we go we can just use that ID.

117
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,950
And we are passing the web page content also because that needs to be written to the file.

118
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,360
So here it is.

119
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:57,290
So let's just pick this chord here and our are.

120
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,960
Now it's very simple.

121
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,700
Just keep making it right.

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,550
So on it as a writer a little bit more explicit.

123
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,200
So it's just the exact opposite stuff

124
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:30,330
.

125
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:41,990
OK now let's leave this as UTF 8 and yes we need to give a final name so I'd say Dot hedge DML

126
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,220
and so we are again creating a string here from the ID.

127
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,930
So we are invoking the value of.

128
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,130
And

129
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,190
we need to specify the location.

130
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:10,140
So here JRD is my workspace eclipse workspace and truly is our project.

131
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,560
And let's create this page a directory called pages and it's right here.

132
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,160
So I have already created this directory called pages.

133
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,490
So you should also create this page just a directory within that trivial project and all the pages that

134
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,120
get downloaded will be read on into that directory.

135
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,560
So that's also put the finals last year.

136
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,690
So that's what we have here.

137
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:43,420
And we can read more all of this make a writer dark ride and we just

138
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,080
do this

139
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:59,530
like Eclipse cleared all the exceptions for us exception catch blocks for us and upset.

140
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,300
So

141
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,090
OK that's about it.

142
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,870
So let's just go ahead and run our application now

143
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,450
running something else.

144
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:26,030
And one other small change I'm mean is that in the weblink there was a different you are here for the

145
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,470
first two eyeblink but that was taking a lot of time to download.

146
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:37,000
So I just replaced it with something else but later we will change it back but or later when we are

147
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,110
dealing with multithreading we will actually see how we can abandon a request if it is taking too long

148
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,330
.

149
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:44,890
OK.

150
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,810
So right now it's taking like 10 or 15 seconds you don't know that page.

151
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,970
So if it is it shouldn't be taking so long.

152
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,220
So if something like that happens we should abandon downloading that Biche because that's just not good

153
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,640
to download such kind of Lapidus so that we will see later.

154
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,950
But this start to just let you know.

155
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:12,800
So I just replace that with this non-IT me quickly launch.

156
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,120
So it is downloading downloading what it is downloading it means it's not loading some link.

157
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,280
It's done.

158
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,080
So let me

159
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,340
refresh this on so there are three pages that God created.

160
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,580
OK.

161
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,450
So you are there are there are three hits the whole pages that go down in order.

162
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,250
So that's it.

163
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,540
So you just go ahead and I'm going to upload some code into the resources section.

164
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:44,410
So what we have done is I think it's more interesting that we have actually downloaded web pages and

165
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,680
we have written them to their desk.

166
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:53,360
