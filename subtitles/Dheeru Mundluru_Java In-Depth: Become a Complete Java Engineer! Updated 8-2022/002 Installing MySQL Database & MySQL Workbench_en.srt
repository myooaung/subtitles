1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:02,830
Hi there.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,300
This is the.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,770
And now let's go ahead and install my SQL database.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,630
Now, my SQL is an open source relational database management system, and it comes in different flavors.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,730
One of them is the community server edition, which is a free edition, and that's what we are going

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,540
to install.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,040
And there is also the enterprise edition for which we need to pay.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,270
So it comes with some additional features and also support.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,480
So my SQL is owned by Oracle and previously it was owned by Sun Microsystems.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,800
And we know that Sun Microsystems has been acquired by Oracle in 2010.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,670
So we will be installing my SQL Community Server edition, and it can also be used in production systems

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,910
too.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,500
So it's really powerful and very good and it is one of the best databases that we have, IBM's.

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,920
So let's just search for my community server download.

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,330
This is what we have.

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,150
So this is the link on my ask.com slash downloads, slash my SQL.

17
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,830
So you can click on that.

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,950
So over here you can download you can select your operating system on.

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,320
Since mine is Windows, I'm going to do that.

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,120
In fact, I have already done that.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:29,730
So here you have 5.7 edition and we will click on this Microsoft MySQL installer and you can also select

22
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,710
one of these options in case you are using a 32 bit machine, you can do that, otherwise you can select

23
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,180
the 64 bit version.

24
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,640
But this is what we are going to select.

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,250
My SQL installer, you're going to download that and you would install my SQL using that.

26
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,140
And there are also other ways to install it here, but we will use this.

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,110
And there are also older versions like 5.6 and 5.5 -5.5.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,490
So the latest version is 5.7.

29
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,870
So you can also install the older versions if you want.

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,300
You can search in the archives and you can do that.

31
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,890
So let me just click this.

32
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:15,160
So if you when you install the minus scale, you also can install all of these different products.

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,420
And my SQL Server is what you will be installing.

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,850
And the server it comes with, it's my SQL Server instance, but it will also come with a client utility

35
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,230
which you can use to connect to the server and the server.

36
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:38,710
You can have it started as a service, which means that when the system starts up, it will the server

37
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:44,770
will also start and you can click on the and you can use the client utility in order to connect to the

38
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,280
server.

39
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,840
So apart from the server, you would also install my SQL workbench.

40
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,750
This is not super important, but in one of the lectures I'm going to show how we can create relational

41
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,380
data models.

42
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,970
That is the database design.

43
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,620
So I'm going to use that.

44
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,270
So you can also install that.

45
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:07,780
You can install it separately too, by clicking here or within this installation itself, there is an

46
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,270
option where you can install that.

47
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:10,810
Okay.

48
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,630
Now let me I'll just explain that in a bit.

49
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,870
So you have these two installers that you can install.

50
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,150
One is the light version.

51
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,370
So for the light version, you would need Internet connection because it's going to download products

52
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:30,050
all the other things that it needs to install by connecting through Internet.

53
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:35,390
I think this one actually you would download the entire package and you can install it so you wouldn't

54
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,830
need internet connection.

55
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:44,240
And in case if you run into any issues, just Google four with the issue and you should be able to figure

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,700
it out.

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,820
So let's just click this one here.

58
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,360
And it is asking for you to log in or sign up.

59
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,970
So for those options, you need an account with Oracle, but you can just click on this.

60
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,480
No, thanks.

61
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,040
Just just start the download.

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,040
So once your download, just double click on it.

63
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:07,340
And once you double click on that, it will ask you to agree there would be a license agreement page.

64
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,970
So you can agree that for that and after that it will show you a bunch of options asking you which products

65
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,220
you want to you want to install.

66
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,829
So just choose a server only option.

67
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:25,310
That way you would be installing only the server, which also comes with the command line client utility

68
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,530
or there is an option called custom.

69
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,230
Now if you select that, it will give you the option of selecting more than one one product so you can

70
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,560
select server and also my SQL workbench right there.

71
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,820
Or you can just select the server only option and then come back and download the workbench later.

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,850
So on my machine I have already installed, so I'm not going to show that to you, but it's pretty straightforward

73
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:56,480
process and mine is an older version and my, my SQL workbench, I installed it recently and it's the

74
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,410
latest version.

75
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,970
So the latest version of Workbench is working with an older version on my machine.

76
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,210
Now, the entire installation process is very straightforward.

77
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,310
Just keep accepting all the defaults.

78
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,500
One of them is it will ask for the port number and there is some default port number that it assigns

79
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,540
for the My SQL Server instance.

80
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,630
It will be running on that port and you would.

81
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:24,530
There will also be a page where it will ask you to choose a service name as the Windows Service name

82
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,480
in this case, since it's a Windows machine.

83
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,150
So that server instance would run as a service and the server service name is also there is some default

84
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,890
name, so you don't have to change that.

85
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:41,180
An only thing that you will change as and one of the pages it will ask for a root password for the root

86
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,720
user.

87
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,580
So root user, it comes from the Unix world and it essentially means that the user has full admin privileges.

88
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:56,570
So there you can enter a password and you have to remember that password so that we can use it in the

89
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,210
future.

90
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,500
But I would suggest just keep it something simple because this is a development environment.

91
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,410
I would suggest just keep it as route.

92
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,210
So just do that.

93
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:11,000
And if you run into any issues, just go for it and you should be good to fix it.

94
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:18,140
In case you are using a very old operating system and if you're running into any issues, then you can

95
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,480
install probably an earlier version of my SQL.

96
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,810
So there is the archive and you can go ahead and use that.

97
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,350
Now let's just click on the workbench here.

98
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:43,820
Now with the workbench, the workbench would need two other software here because the workbench is the

99
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:51,470
graphical user interface for using my SQL instead of the minus client utility, you would use that.

100
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,920
I have not used it in my professional life.

101
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,410
Only recently I have used it.

102
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:04,000
Client utility is also very good, but within the using the Microsoft workbench it is you have the GWI

103
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:11,270
so you can create your databases and view and the entire database using a graphical user interface.

104
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,120
And you can also do that database design as we will see later.

105
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,870
But since it's a guy you would need these two software here, two pieces of software now here you can

106
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,460
go ahead and install it.

107
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:29,390
So far, the MySQL database, it was 5.7, but this has a different versioning.

108
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,340
But don't click here.

109
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:37,150
I would say you have to actually click here, but if you click here, it will take you to that old to

110
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,630
the other page that we have seen earlier where we have the MySQL installer.

111
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:45,820
So click here download and in this case it will not even ask for any root password or anything like

112
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:45,970
that.

113
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,660
Everything is pretty straightforward, so that's what it is.

114
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:57,490
And once you download it and install, so if you click on going to start and click on all programs.

115
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,230
So here you will see my SQL and if you click on my SQL here.

116
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,480
So this would be the workbench.

117
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,210
We can click on that later.

118
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,880
And this is the my SQL 5.5 -5.5.

119
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,460
So you must be seeing something like 5.7.

120
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,850
And this is the command line utility.

121
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,750
And as I said earlier, you need a root password.

122
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,400
So you would just say root.

123
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,020
And that said.

124
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,730
So it would install that.

125
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,870
Now, another way of installing it is from the command prompt itself.

126
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,500
So let's search for C and D.

127
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,710
Okay.

128
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:43,140
Now here you can say my SQL hyphen, you root.

129
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,780
It is for the root user, it's root itself and P is root.

130
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,810
So just do that and that's how you would connect.

131
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:58,670
So this executable is in the path now when you install it, it should also insert the path to this executable

132
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,510
directly.

133
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,570
If not, you can add it manually.

134
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,840
So let me open my explorer.

135
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,170
So click on See Drive.

136
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,160
Program files.

137
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,960
My school.

138
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,750
Here it is.

139
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,200
You have 5.5 the server instance on the workbench.

140
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,760
So you would do this bin and here is my skill.

141
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,250
So let me just exit here.

142
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's see if we can find it here.

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,780
But it will be here.

144
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,630
The path to the bin folder will be here.

145
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,290
Here it is.

146
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,720
My SQL Server point five slash bin.

147
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,490
So it should get automatically added.

148
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,110
If not, you can do that.

149
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,540
You can add it manually and that's about it.

150
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,950
So if you run into any issues, just Google for it and it should help you out.

151
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:05,570
So when you are trying to install the workbench, it might you might have to install the other two software

152
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,880
also or they may have already been installed.

153
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,770
So just try to install it and run it.

154
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:16,280
And if on while you are installing Workbench, if it asks you for those other software dot net framework

155
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,790
and another Visual Studio software, then you can go ahead and download them.

156
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,350
Also, it should be straightforward.

157
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,150
So that's about it.

158
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,300
And next, we'll get started with the database design.

159
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,810
Thank you and see you in the next lecture.
