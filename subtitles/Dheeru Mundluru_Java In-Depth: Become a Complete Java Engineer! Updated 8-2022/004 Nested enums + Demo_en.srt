Hi there.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:11,630
This is the to the book genre we saw was the top level, but it can also be nested within a class or

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,590
an interface.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,880
If an enum is generally useful, you can make it a top level one.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,670
But if you think it has some context, that is, if you think it makes sense to make it part of some

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,310
class or interface, then it can be nested.

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,810
Here is our book Genre Enum, which is now nested within a class called Book.

8
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:39,340
Now we know that Enum is basically a class, and since here it is nested within another class, it would

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,870
be a nested class.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,400
In fact, it would be a static asset class.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:51,510
It cannot be an inner class as inner classes cannot have static members while an enum can have static

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,160
members.

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:52,680
Right.

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,010
Recall that an inner class includes the three nested classes other than static member class.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,519
Remember that there would be an anonymous class or local class or non static member class.

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,120
So a nested enum is implicitly static.

17
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:17,710
So it cannot also access instance members from the enclosing class, just like a static method or a

18
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,000
static member class.

19
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:27,170
Now, since book genre is a nested static class on compiling Java, it will produce two classes, books,

20
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,000
class and book dollar book genre class.

21
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,760
Recall that this is what happened with nested classes in bytecode.

22
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,420
There were no nested classes.

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,690
They simply get translated into top level classes.

24
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,020
Not to access an item constant like horror.

25
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,320
We would do book dot book genre dot horror.

26
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,330
Since Mr. Denham is implicitly static.

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,630
The next question could be Is there any difference between a static member class and a nested enum?

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:08,840
The difference is that a static member class is intangible, while a nested enum is not intangible.

29
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:17,240
Finally, note that an enum can be nested within another enum and that another enum can be a nested

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,930
enum too.

31
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,870
Or it can be a top level enum too.

32
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,110
I believe such nested ness would be really rare.

33
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,480
Similarly, a static member class can also have a nested enum.

34
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,920
However, an inert class cannot have a nested enum, as nested enemies are implicitly static, while

35
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,070
inner class cannot include any static stuff.

36
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:49,620
Now let's head over to our editor and convert our ebook genre enum into your nested enum should be a

37
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,610
very short demo.

38
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:59,470
Look, here is a book genre enum from the previous demo and let me show you the My Explorer.

39
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,930
So on the hard disk we just have book genre dot class.

40
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,830
So this is the only class file we have which corresponds to book genre.

41
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,620
Now let's go ahead and let's make it nested within the book class.

42
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,490
Now it gives a compilation error because the file is named as book genre, so we need to rename it.

43
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,340
So let's just say rename compilation unit to book Java.

44
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,580
So insert and let's also insert this main method.

45
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,380
Let's take it out from the enum.

46
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,270
And let's insert it here inside the book class so that we can run it.

47
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,660
Now, let's also look at the file system.

48
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,000
And as you can see, it has created class and book dollar.

49
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,750
Book genre.

50
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,340
Class for the enum.

51
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,430
Now it is a static nested class.

52
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,280
Let's go ahead and run this and it will be the same output as in the previous demo.

53
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,850
So that's about it.

54
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,380
Thank you.

55
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,990
And this code will be available in the resources section.
