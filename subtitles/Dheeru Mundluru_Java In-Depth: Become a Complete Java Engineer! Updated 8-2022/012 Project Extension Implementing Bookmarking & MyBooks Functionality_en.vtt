00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:02.990
Hi there.

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.080
This is De La Rue.

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.020
And welcome back.

4
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.900
Let's now go ahead and extend our project and let's implement the next feature, which is the bookmarking

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.140
part as well as implementing a page which displays all the books that are bookmarked by the user.

6
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.590
So first thing is we are here in the browser JSP, which we created earlier in the last lecture.

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.810
So we had this anchor tag.

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.680
OC which was displaying save.

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.080
So all we need to do is this was empty.

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.820
Let me copy a piece of code here.

11
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.830
This is the code.

12
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.530
Now here we have this GSP expression tag.

13
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.280
It's fine.

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.700
We can have it here and we are saying request dot get context part.

15
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.240
So this request object.

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.860
So we are in the GSP file.

17
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.950
It is similar to the request object that we see here in the controller in controllers.

18
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.990
We have for the do get method.

19
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.940
For instance, we have request and response.

20
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.480
So it is similar to the request that we see here.

21
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:14.330
So the GSP files also have access to that request object and we are invoking a method called get context.

22
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.250
But context is nothing but the web application that we have developed.

23
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.770
In our case it is 3D or web.

24
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.750
So it will add this piece here to your web, to the URL and this will be automatically added.

25
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.230
The domain name will be automatically added by the container.

26
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:41.510
So by invoking get context part, we are adding this piece and we are saying slash bookmark bookmark

27
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.210
is the URL pattern, which is.

28
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.060
Which is for the servlet that we created the bookmark controller and we are also saying slash sale.

29
00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.280
So what it means is the same controller, bookmark controller can be accessed using different URL patterns.

30
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.770
So earlier we had slash bookmark.

31
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.530
So now we are also introducing another URL pattern slash, slash, bookmark, slash, save.

32
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.840
And next, I'll show you how we can add this the second path into the controller.

33
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.730
I'll show that.

34
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:23.620
And we are saying here we are adding this parameter called bid because each of this is a book and this

35
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.610
has a book ID, this has a separate book ID, so we need to pass when the user clicks on save here,

36
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.970
we need to pass the book ID corresponding to this book and then we need to pass the book ID corresponding

37
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.070
to this book when the user clicks on this book.

38
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.070
So that's the thing.

39
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.190
So here we have this parameter, it's called as a parameter and we are calling it as B ID equal to we

40
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.570
need to copy the actual ID of this book.

41
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.550
So we are using an l expression here.

42
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.840
So we are saying book ID since we are iterating through all of the books.

43
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.090
The book in the current iteration has the ID field and we are just getting that ID.

44
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.590
That's it.

45
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.180
So this is the URL or whatever you are seeing in the double codes and this will generate a get request

46
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.890
to the server to the container and there is no change here.

47
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.610
Now the second thing is, so this will take the control to the bookmark controller and the user.

48
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.780
This particular book will be saved for the user and after that the request will be forwarded to a new

49
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.920
page that we are going to create, which displays all the books that the user has saved.

50
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.220
Now we also want to add a link in this page in browser.

51
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.940
JSP And we want to add a link, a new menu item.

52
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.280
So let's go here, let's put a new navigation bar.

53
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.730
So we are going to add a navigation bar at the top and we want to add a new link called My Box.

54
00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:03.010
So we are in the my we are in the browse page and in the browse page we are going to right here in body

55
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.160
after this anchor here we have at the top anchor.

56
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.320
So this file will also be provided.

57
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.060
We are going to copy this.

58
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.260
A new.

59
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.610
So we are going to add a menu and navigation bar here and this page browse JSP will have that link called

60
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:26.090
My Box and clicking on my box will also show you that same page which displays all the books that the

61
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.130
user has saved by clicking on here.

62
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.810
We'll also take you to the same page.

63
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.910
But here this would also additionally involve saving the book for that user.

64
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.270
So this includes a bookmarking functionality, but this one just simply the my books that comes up here

65
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.320
will simply display all the books that the user has already saved.

66
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.260
And it is very identical to this page, except that we will not have this these links in that page.

67
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.740
So that is what is being added here.

68
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.900
So that is the navigation bar.

69
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.580
And later when we implement login functionality we will add another menu item.

70
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.450
So even here we are saying request get context part.

71
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:12.420
So that is all always needed and we are saying slash bookmark and we are saying slash my books.

72
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.580
So this is a third URL pattern.

73
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.690
So one was slash bookmark, the other was slash bookmark, slash save.

74
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.570
And this one is slash bookmark, slash my books.

75
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.870
So let's go ahead and make our changes in the bookmark controller.

76
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.840
So this is what we have.

77
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.720
This is what we have.

78
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.450
If there is a single if there is a single URL, but now we have three different URLs.

79
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.970
So it's called a URL patterns and it's like an array.

80
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.750
So one of them is bookmark.

81
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.430
The second one is.

82
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.020
And the third one is.

83
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.700
All of them.

84
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.070
Here, start with a bookmark.

85
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.740
My books.

86
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.210
So these are the three URLs here.

87
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.420
And we need to put a closing brace.

88
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.110
That's it.

89
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.280
So now we need to update our do get method.

90
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.620
So this is the logic.

91
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.620
If we are just accessing slash bookmark.

92
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.170
So this is the logic that gets executed.

93
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.130
So we need three.

94
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.720
We need an f slope here.

95
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.680
Let me show you.

96
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.220
So first thing is, when somebody clicks on the save, we need to do something here.

97
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.720
Then we need a.

98
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.420
Someone clicks on my books just on the my books.

99
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.630
My books link.

100
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.140
Then we need some certain functionality here.

101
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.860
And finally, if somebody clicks on Browse, we need this, which we have already written.

102
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.270
Right.

103
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.710
So let's just.

104
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.930
Copy these two lines.

105
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.530
Here.

106
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.160
First.

107
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.690
Copy it here.

108
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.080
Now, how do we know if the control is coming from one of these?

109
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.000
So for that.

110
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:09.460
What we will do is there is a method called get servlet path request.

111
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:17.740
Once again, we are making use of the request object and we will say get servlet path right here and

112
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:23.550
that would return the actual servlet path of the current request.

113
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:30.010
So if the request is coming from here for this, if this was the URL pattern, it would return this

114
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.660
one, it would return this.

115
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.260
And if the request is for my box, it would return this thing.

116
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.530
So first, let's write it for save.

117
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.280
Contains save.

118
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.760
Then do whatever you have to do here.

119
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.690
Save that.

120
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.300
And there should be a request.

121
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.760
DISPATCHER for this because.

122
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.810
DISPATCHER For this and request dispatcher for that.

123
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.210
So let's do something here.

124
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.110
It's called a dispatcher.

125
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.130
Let's initialize it to NULL.

126
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.180
Let's also print this one just to show you.

127
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.830
So this will show up in the console of the Tomcat container.

128
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.090
Let's call it.

129
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.160
Sublet part.

130
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.470
That's for that.

131
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:24.970
And.

132
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:29.630
Take this.

133
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.970
We need to protect this.

134
00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.909
So this should take us to my.

135
00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:40.940
Bookstore, JSP.

136
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.580
And this is the dispatcher.

137
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.360
And same thing we are going to use for my books.

138
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.160
Also, this is for my books.

139
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.300
Same destination for both of these.

140
00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.380
And.

141
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:11.660
But in this case, it will be slash because this is the third one which we have already implemented.

142
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.560
Notice that for all the gasps, it starts with a slash.

143
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.750
So just keep that in mind.

144
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.660
An animal duck.

145
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.140
Finally, we will forward it here.

146
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.240
So a dispatcher will be initialized with one of the destinations based on the request.

147
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.580
And that's it.

148
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.580
And here, request dot get sublet part.

149
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.720
In the second case, it will be my box.

150
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:45.940
If it contains save, save the bookmark, if it contains my box, just followed it here.

151
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.810
However, in my books, we need this.

152
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.640
Let me copy that.

153
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.900
It's the same code.

154
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.830
But in this case, we will pass it to.

155
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.220
Earlier we passed false.

156
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.680
But here we pass through.

157
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.310
Which means that we want to.

158
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.740
Get only those books that are saved by the user.

159
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.160
And for that, let me.

160
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.560
Now, if you recall, I had this.

161
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:18.680
Else block your.

162
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.310
I commented it out, so let me uncomment it.

163
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.360
So this is the query.

164
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:31.590
So this is an bookmarks to get books is bookmarked is now true.

165
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:39.130
So if it is true here it goes into this else block is bookmarked is true and it goes into this else.

166
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.320
BLOCK It's exactly identical.

167
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.360
QUERY It's just that this not in here is replaced with N.

168
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.740
So we want to get all the books that are bookmarked by the user.

169
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:57.100
So this query here, nested query, is going to give us all the bookmarks that are bookmarked by this

170
00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.020
particular user with the ID file.

171
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.510
That's the same case here too.

172
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.750
But in this case we are saying the query will only look for those bookmarks.

173
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:14.200
So whatever bookmarks that you get here, we are trying to get the details of those books using the

174
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:20.140
outer query over here, the outer query, you know, it has certain IDs books.

175
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.350
And from that, we need to remove all of the books that are saved.

176
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.510
It's just the opposite.

177
00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.970
So I think you got that.

178
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:35.590
So we uncomment that and rest of the code is just the same and we don't need parentheses here.

179
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.310
So that's it.

180
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.620
So this and this are done.

181
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.410
We just need to fill up this part here.

182
00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:51.550
Now, if we look at bookmark manager, so we have this save here and we have the parameter bid which

183
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.790
is being passed from the JSP.

184
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.000
So we need to get the value of the bid of the book ID.

185
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.910
So book ID if you go back into browser.

186
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:05.020
JSP So if you scroll down here we are passing this value.

187
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.500
The user clicks on a particular save link and this value will be passed.

188
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.150
So we need to get this.

189
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:15.850
For that we use another method in request object called get parameter.

190
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:24.670
And we need to pass the name of the parameter and the name of the parameter is B ID, right?

191
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.610
If you go back here it is B ID.

192
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:33.000
So this is the name and this is the value on the other side of the assignment.

193
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.390
So if you do that, if you say get parameter of that, it will return the value.

194
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.330
And we can assign it to.

195
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.350
A string here.

196
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.950
It returns a string.

197
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.900
And so that's the thing.

198
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:54.170
Next thing is we need to save this bookmark, and the bookmark should be associated with a user.

199
00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:01.400
Now, if you recall, we have implemented that method already in an earlier version.

200
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:10.310
So this is the book here we are saving the user bookmark, the input is user and bookmark so that here

201
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:16.580
we are creating a new instance called user bookmark and it has this association, it associates the

202
00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:23.030
you, it has both user as well as bookmark and it is forwarding this new instance called user bookmark.

203
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.530
So it maintains the relationship between user and bookmark.

204
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.440
That's what this particular class does and we have already implemented that.

205
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:37.850
And we were invoking this method called save user bookmark, which is part of the bookmark right from

206
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:38.780
the bookmark manager.

207
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:44.990
We are invoking the bookmark and this method, this is the method and all of this has been done in the

208
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:52.130
previous version itself and we are invoking the get bookmark on the user bookmark.

209
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:57.860
So we have the user bookmark here, get bookmark would return an instance of some bookmark and if it

210
00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:04.370
is an instance of book in the earlier versions, we were also having movie and web link, but right

211
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.270
now we are just focusing on book, so we will be passing an instance of book.

212
00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:15.410
So in that case we are invoking this method called Save User Book, and in Save User book we are inserting

213
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:21.350
into this table called User Underscore Book, which has these two fields, the user ID, book ID, and

214
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:27.140
we are inserting the corresponding values user, bookmark, dot, get user.

215
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:33.110
It will get us the get the user object and we are invoking the get ID and we are doing the same thing

216
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.430
for get bookmark too.

217
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:39.410
We are saying user bookmark, get bookmark and get ID and that will give the idea of the book.

218
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.100
That functionality is there and we need to send it.

219
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.950
But that method bookmark manager is accepting a user object and bookmark object.

220
00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.260
Now user object is the ID.

221
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:56.390
We have the ID and we can create a user object and just pass that ID to that.

222
00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:02.210
Similarly for book also we can create a book object and an empty book object and pass that ID, but

223
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:06.170
instead of doing that, let's actually get the data from the database itself.

224
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:12.680
So let's create a method called get user and get book and get those values from the database because

225
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.810
that's how you should do it professionally.

226
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:15.740
That's how you should do it.

227
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:22.670
Instead of creating two new objects, user and book, and just inserting and just populating them with

228
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.690
the IDs, it's better to get all of the data from the database.

229
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.370
So that's the right proper way to do it, and let's do it in the proper way.

230
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:39.140
So let's say user manager this time, let's use in order to get the user information, let's use the

231
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:44.390
user manager because user manager corresponds to just user related methods.

232
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:52.220
So get the instance, get instance would give us the single time and let's write a new method called

233
00:15:52.220 --> 00:16:02.900
get user and pass five so your hard coding the value and let me just create this method and user manager

234
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.960
there you go and let's make it long.

235
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.890
Let's call it user ID.

236
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.660
And this should return.

237
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.900
Instance user is an entity, right?

238
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.360
If you recall, here it is under entities.

239
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.970
You have all these entities and user is one of them.

240
00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.850
Say a written doll.

241
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.640
In this case, doll would be user.

242
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.900
Here, if you go here, user, user manager uses user dog bookmark.

243
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.130
Manager uses bookmark.

244
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.050
So that's the architecture.

245
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.060
And.

246
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.730
Get user off.

247
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:42.570
User I.D..

248
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.260
Or to create this method.

249
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:48.770
That's it.

250
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:56.150
And this code is there and majority of this code is already there here in datastore.

251
00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.620
So there is this book method called load users.

252
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.160
OC.

253
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.300
Here at the top.

254
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:10.900
All we need to do is just put where ID is equal to the ID and.

255
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:16.079
Here, Lord, as we are loading all of the users.

256
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:19.050
So we are adding it into a list here.

257
00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.130
But we don't need that.

258
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.630
We just need a single user.

259
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.329
So this is the code that needs to be copied there.

260
00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:25.680
So I have it here.

261
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.810
I copied it into a separate.

262
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:31.180
Fine.

263
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.360
Let me just copy it.

264
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.990
And I will also make this quote available in the resources section.

265
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.820
Let's go back into user manager.

266
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.210
Let's just replace this whole thing with what I have.

267
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:44.700
So let's.

268
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.440
And this is the one that we need to use this connection.

269
00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:53.630
So.

270
00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.810
So we imported some of the school related stuff.

271
00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:02.390
So that said, once again, we are initializing the driver here, loading the driver, and we have the

272
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.170
private resources syntax which has the connection and the statement.

273
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.120
So that will automatically close them.

274
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.130
And the query, as I mentioned earlier, select start from user where ID is equal to user ID, which

275
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.300
is being passed here.

276
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.770
And then we are simply getting the details of that particular user.

277
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.240
Only one user will be retrieved and we are calling the create user method.

278
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.010
So this is all all code.

279
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.860
Nothing new.

280
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.040
Only difference was in data store.

281
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.760
We were fetching multiple rows, but in this case we are fetching only a single row.

282
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.630
And we are returning that.

283
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.080
And here, let's assign it.

284
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:41.050
That's it.

285
00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.740
And now one thing I want to mention here in user as.

286
00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.450
Oh, this has to go into.

287
00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.770
Sorry, this has to go into Dow.

288
00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.260
I made a mistake.

289
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.720
This has to go here.

290
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.490
I.

291
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.940
It was a wrong overwriting.

292
00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.310
So this goes back into user manager.

293
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:11.880
Sorry.

294
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.080
Written.

295
00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.060
So user.

296
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.020
So that's it.

297
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:26.800
And this code you see, every time we are invoking a method, we are loading this and we have all also

298
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:35.680
these statements so all of we can optimize it furthermore and we can abstract out all of this and all

299
00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:42.790
of this code can go into either some super type or it can go into a separate servlet.

300
00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:47.470
So this has to be invoked only once, for once we start the Tomcat server.

301
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.710
Once we do that, we don't need this statement anymore.

302
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.920
So we can do further optimizations can be done.

303
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.560
But this is since we are implementing it for the very first time, a basic functionality, it is fine

304
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.050
to have it here in every method.

305
00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:09.010
So just want to tell you that there can be more optimizations that can be performed on this code.

306
00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.210
That's it.

307
00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.320
Next, let's get the bookmark manager the book.

308
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.980
So let's invoke bookmark manager.

309
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.050
Get instance.

310
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.670
Get book now.

311
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:23.480
Get book.

312
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.490
We will pass the bid here.

313
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:28.400
Okay.

314
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.630
Let's create this method.

315
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.250
And.

316
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.650
We say.

317
00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.810
It's just almost the same name.

318
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:39.610
Get book.

319
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:53.010
The ID now create this method and bookmark dol and I already have the code get book.

320
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.420
Replace this with this.

321
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.150
This needs to be a book written type.

322
00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:12.740
And in bookmark also it has to written a book, a bookmark.

323
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.330
It's returning a bookmark.

324
00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.130
Let's use the super type instead of book.

325
00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:21.300
We can use super type.

326
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.000
This used to be long.

327
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:26.390
That's it.

328
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.880
And bookmark now once again, the same methods we have.

329
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:37.660
Only difference between datastore and here is we were loading books, loading users, multiple users

330
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.500
and loading multiple books, loading multiple web links.

331
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.600
But over there, we just need in the new code, we just need a single book and a single user.

332
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.500
So have used the same code instead of storing it in a list.

333
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:57.280
I was just returning the only book that is being constructed, so that was the only change.

334
00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.100
So it was a very simple extension OC.

335
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.970
And this needs to be changed to long.

336
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.280
Don't pass along.

337
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.210
Because bid is in the form of string here.

338
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.830
We need to convert it into long.

339
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:18.430
Okay.

340
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:18.960
That's it.

341
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.770
So that's it.

342
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.120
We are just getting a book.

343
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:29.700
We are using the same query as in the DataStore class, but instead of storing it in ArrayList we are

344
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.990
creating a single book and we are just returning that book very similar.

345
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.460
Instead of multiple books, a single book is being returned and it's called Get Book.

346
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.320
And let me assign it to.

347
00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:42.390
Yes.

348
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.640
Actually, I guess I'd bookmark inserting a bookmark.

349
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.720
And finally we need to invoke.

350
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:53.620
We need this.

351
00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.500
Save user bookmark as the method that we have here.

352
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:03.710
Here it is.

353
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.960
Just pass user and bookmark.

354
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.090
Okay.

355
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:11.740
That's it.

356
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.750
Okay, so the bookmark, the item is bookmarked and we need to.

357
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:19.800
Copy this code.

358
00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.440
So we need to get all the.

359
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.500
Bookmarks that the user has bookmarked.

360
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:31.590
And since we are going to forward it, forward the control to my books, right to my bookstore, JSP,

361
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.660
which is here, we define it here.

362
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.980
So in my bookstore.

363
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.790
JSP we are going to display all of the books that the user has bookmarked.

364
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:44.190
So we are first saving the bookmark and then we need to get all the books from.

365
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:51.360
The database and we need to get all the books that are saved by this user and we are passing it through

366
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:57.300
here that will fetch us all the books saved by the user and we are storing it and the books attribute

367
00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:57.630
here.

368
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.430
So we are invoking set attribute.

369
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.980
So as you can see, we are accessing different methods of request like the request get request, dispatcher,

370
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:11.520
request dot get parameter to get the values that are passed from the browser and request dot get servlet

371
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.800
path request, set attribute.

372
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.370
And even in the JSP we had the get context.

373
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.460
Something called get context.

374
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:21.950
Here it is.

375
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:22.940
Get context part.

376
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.410
So we are using different methods from the request object here.

377
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:32.630
So that's the HTTP servlet request and that's it.

378
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.540
And only thing that we need is the GSP file.

379
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.040
It's already pre created.

380
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.980
But here we need to just say.

381
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.100
And you.

382
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.920
Just be fine.

383
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.510
Call my books.

384
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:54.240
And the default template is good.

385
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.660
And I have the code here, my books.

386
00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.830
Here it is.

387
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.880
It's exactly identical to the Browse.

388
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.830
Only thing is we are not having the save link anymore.

389
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.880
So we are.

390
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:20.180
Once again, here is the fur loop iterating through the box and displaying the information about the

391
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:20.810
box.

392
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:25.400
And one thing is in this particular page we are in my box.

393
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:32.030
So we also have the navigation bar and over here we are displaying browse here.

394
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.300
The link that is displayed is browse and browse dot JSP.

395
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:40.790
We have my box as the link, so it's just each of them pointing to each other.

396
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:49.250
And here I added this particular text called Saved Items, Saved Items because we are showing all the

397
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.600
items saved by this user.

398
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.860
So I added some text for that and then to break tags.

399
00:25:55.010 --> 00:26:04.700
And here I have a new GST tag called Choose and it is similar to the switch statement or if elseif you

400
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:09.230
also have the if elseif blocks in Java, it's very identical to that or the switch statement.

401
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:14.450
So all we are saying is we are saying choose and this choose ends here.

402
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:24.080
It's a GST tag and we are having this thing called Venn C one and it is like an F condition like or

403
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.190
like a case block.

404
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:31.700
Think of it as a case block and we are saying test equal to so box is what is being passed and we are

405
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:37.850
using this l expression, expression, language and we are using this inbuilt function called empty.

406
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:44.300
And we are saying if it is not empty, then go ahead and execute this code which displays the box.

407
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:52.160
But if it is empty, then see when will be closed here after the table and we'll have this otherwise.

408
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:59.480
So this is like the default block and switch statement or in case of if else statement it would be the

409
00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:06.140
else block and we are displaying this text here or you haven't saved any items yet because there are

410
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.140
no items, so that's it.

411
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:15.410
And you can have multiple one tags also because even in switch statements, you can have multiple case

412
00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:16.070
labels.

413
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:21.590
So you can also have multiple one blocks and only one of them will get executed or the default one.

414
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.340
So that's how that is.

415
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.970
So let's time to create our VAR file.

416
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:38.290
Right click on your web say export var file destination is web apps inside web apps in Tomcat three

417
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.060
little web.

418
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.490
So I'm just saying save.

419
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.610
I deleted the earlier ones versions.

420
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:51.090
So click finish my tomcat is already running so let me see here.

421
00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:52.080
So.

422
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.630
It created the application.

423
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:59.410
Let's go ahead and click on this one more time.

424
00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:02.370
Okay.

425
00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.860
So this is the new UI and you can see the my box link here.

426
00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.040
So and we have five books here.

427
00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.700
Let's go ahead and save the Java box.

428
00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.260
It got saved.

429
00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.600
And in the my box, here it is.

430
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.490
We are showing the saved items.

431
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:27.490
And if you click on Browse here, we go back to this page and let's say one more item and we will go

432
00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:27.820
back.

433
00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:33.460
It will take us to the browser, to the My Box page, and the new item is already saved.

434
00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.010
So what is it?

435
00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.220
Let me just show you the.

436
00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:56.750
Okay.

437
00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:02.310
So let me go into browse here and just want to show you that message that we are displaying when there

438
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:03.270
are no items.

439
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:08.430
So if you go back and if you add, then it will not show that message anymore.

440
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:09.830
So that's it.

441
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.980
I hope you like the new extension.

442
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.930
And next, we will go ahead and add the login functionality.

443
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.160
Thank you.

444
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:19.170
Happy coding and see you in the next lecture.
