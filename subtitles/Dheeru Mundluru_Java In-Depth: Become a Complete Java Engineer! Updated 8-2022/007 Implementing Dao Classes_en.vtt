00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.990
We know how code for loading data needed for our application and this day US during the day after class

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.660
basically in real world this would mean that we have a database with some data.

3
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.190
Now the next step would be to write some code to fetch this data.

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.770
For that we need that dollar.

5
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.300
So it's the there that communicates with database and so it includes some obscure queries.

6
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.280
But since we're not dealing with D-W at this point we cannot how obscure queries but our dog classes

7
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.930
will instead use that get Admetus in their data store class.

8
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.970
So let's go ahead and write two simple doffs user doubt and bookmark.

9
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.390
And these dolls will in good methods get users and get bookmarks which will in will get users and get

10
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.850
bookmarks methods and the data stored us so let's create a package what our doffs

11
00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:07.620
.

12
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.970
So that's the new package for dot com dot semantics they are truly are.

13
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.200
And first let's create user Dao

14
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.900
so let's add the get user methods get users matter within this dog

15
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.650
.

16
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.310
So typically this would include since it's a door it would include that as well cories.

17
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:49.500
But since we don't have a screen at this point so we will just invoke we'll just invoke the get users

18
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.180
method and the data store store

19
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.280
import user.

20
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.940
Now let's create a bookmark doe with get bookmarks mattered

21
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.620
and it would in invoke

22
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.380
similar method within the get in it in the store.

23
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.810
So it's got bookmarks and ingredients

24
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.840
needs to be two dimensional.

25
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:49.500
So that's the bookmarks dot next let's right get users and get bookmarks in our manager process and

26
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.440
they will in intern in the dormitory that we just wrote the methods that we are going to write in the

27
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.180
Manager class can be invoked from the controller.

28
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.270
So we just go there.

29
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.330
This is how MVC works where controllers really work.

30
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.500
Managers and managers in Dunwell in work doffs.

31
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:16.280
So let's go ahead and simply add these methods get users and get good marks in our manager process.

32
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.500
So first let's open the User Manager class.

33
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.440
From here we are going to work the door there that is their door class.

34
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:33.020
So let's just say I read static dolls since this is user management.

35
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.450
We need to invoke the user now.

36
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.320
So let's create an instance of this here

37
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.230
or

38
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.800
so this would simply invoke

39
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.850
got users.

40
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.270
So all it is doing is just relaying the call.

41
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:22.290
So that's it really does work and it's going to book manager.

42
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.620
And similarly let's instantiate a bookmark down here

43
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.340
so

44
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.550
you can go the bookmark down

45
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:48.150
.

46
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.670
So add credence

47
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.760
bookmark two dimensional array or this

48
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.800
and that's it.

49
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.520
So we created the Darlie are the user now under bookmark.

50
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.600
And these are the classes with which the data from our data are stored on there and done in work from

51
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.870
User Manager and bookmark manager.

52
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.900
So all on these two classes are doing is they're simply relaying the calls and they will be invoked

53
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.500
from other leaders like the controller layer.

54
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.410
And that's about it.
