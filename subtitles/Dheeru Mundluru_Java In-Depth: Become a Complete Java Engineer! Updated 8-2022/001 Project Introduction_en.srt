00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,570
Hi there.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,190
This is day two.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,900
And welcome back.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,520
It's not time to implement our project and have some fun.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,910
We've been promoting our Casterley that will implement a basic version of the.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,210
The project will evolve as a course progresses but the framework and all the core features will be implemented

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,590
in this version.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,040
So we would have been promoting a major part of the project and this version specifically here is what

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,880
we will do.

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,890
Vivek implement most of the features we have learned so far.

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,450
We will use proper object oriented design and coding conventions will implement the project using Eclipse

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,110
and will make use of all the commonly used features including the old ones like automatic source code

13
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,310
generation automatic refactoring and so on.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,190
We will also use a popular and B.C.E. design pattern which we will discuss next and we will also use

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,910
another design pattern called Single and pattern.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,670
Finally for some parts of the implementation we will use a popular software development process.

17
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,140
It and double up ment which is referred to as BTD in shock.

18
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:29,760
DDT is very widely used Technik desk is written before we start writing that legal logic.

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,810
So that would be interesting and we will discuss it and its benefits.

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,100
When we are implementing it so its going to be some real good stuff that we are going to implement.

21
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,390
And here is a project specification.

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,040
The system will involve five users and 15 bookmarks the 15 bookmarks would include five doublings five

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,260
books and five movies.

24
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,970
We would just build the necessary framework to load this data.

25
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,250
Next we will implement the real features.

26
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,100
I'm already familiar with all of them.

27
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,970
The first one would be the bookmarking process itself.

28
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,380
Each user can bookmark at most five items which can be any of the bookmark types.

29
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,360
So 5 is a max limit.

30
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,550
The marking decision itself will be done randomly.

31
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,420
So we'll be using randomisation function from the math class and for this version duplicate book Mazzariello

32
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,160
we will have to duplicate later.

33
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:36,930
Next week it is marking bookmarks as kid friendly with this feature an editor or chief editor can approve

34
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,990
or reject a bookmark as kid friendly or they may not even take any action to.

35
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:48,840
There is a bookmark will be left in an unknown state so only an editor or chief editor is authorized

36
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,030
to make approval or rejection decisions on it cannot be done by regular users.

37
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,300
We already know that.

38
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,760
Again for this first version this is done by a randomisation.

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,940
Later we can prompt the user to give his or her decision.

40
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,300
The final feature is sharing of good friendly bookmarks with partner websites.

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,320
So it's going to be only kid friendly bookmarks that you can share other regular bookmarks with partnership's

42
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,630
sites.

43
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,830
Again this can be done only by staff members such as editors and chief editors.

44
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:29,380
Moreover the constraint is that only books and ramblings can be shared so movies cannot be shared.

45
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:36,270
Also like other features for another shared decision is done by randomisation.

46
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:42,720
So basically for all three features that are shown here in green boxes a user decision is based on randomization

47
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,710
.

48
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,290
So that's the specification in the next lesson.

49
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,520
Let's look at the architecture that we are going to follow.

50
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,890
They'll be using the popular and Visio design pattern and so we will briefly discuss it and after that

51
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,280
we'll start our implementation
