00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.410
Let's review what we implemented so far through this and this illustration that things that have been

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.340
implemented are emphasized in green and the ones that are yet to be implemented are shown in blue.

3
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.560
So we implemented model undelete store and we need to implement the view of the controller.

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.190
But the last is application that we are building we need to write a separate program that program would

5
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.240
just load the data that is it will go to all the entities like the users and the bookmarks and then

6
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.720
we'll invoke the different steps that we are yet to implement.

7
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.680
Like the bookmarking process marking book MOTSS kid friendly and so on.

8
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.780
So now let's write this launcher program and to begin with we will use it to load the data and we would

9
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.740
also see if everything we do so far is working correctly or not.

10
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.980
Let's call this program as we launch let's clear to launch and com got semantics Square.

11
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.590
Trivial

12
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.960
And since it's a launcher program let's have a main method here

13
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.180
.

14
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.980
I had a method called load data.

15
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.720
So this would be responsible for loading that it up.

16
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.390
So let's just click this and it's actually capitis the top.

17
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.690
It's always the main method at the bottom.

18
00:01:44.130 --> 00:02:01.550
Now from here let's in work gun store dog load data so we know that it loads the data.

19
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.660
So this is the dust or glass that Spartacists our segment here

20
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.980
.

21
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.590
OK.

22
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.160
So this what we loaded it down.

23
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.570
Next let's fetch the radio from the store and for that we can use the getter method.

24
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:37.050
And it's also introduced the corresponding data structures in this class that is the users under bookmarks

25
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.740
.

26
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.180
So let's just write them

27
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.260
.

28
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.250
So that would hold the users.

29
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.240
And for bookmark we know it's a two dimensional array.

30
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.140
It's just in both user and bookmarks bookmark and to D2.

31
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.500
OK.

32
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.550
Now let's initialize them here

33
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.410
.

34
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.040
Get users and do the same for bookmarks

35
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.200
same book and control space.

36
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:45.610
So bookmark manager non-geek instance dot get bookmarks.

37
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.860
So we have the required data here.

38
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.510
Let's actually bring this data out

39
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.680
so we will see if it if everything is working fine or not

40
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.910
so hostile print only user data and let's do it in a subject matter.

41
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.730
So let's just write a new method for that.

42
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.660
It's called It does print user data.

43
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.380
It's highlighted here and sick create Brende user data and it would create a private method here.

44
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:37.040
So since users is a global variable here we can directly access it from here.

45
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.130
Our user user

46
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.620
users

47
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.510
on greenspace simply print user.

48
00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.420
Now let's also how bringed bookmark data

49
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.000
it's hard to generate the matter

50
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.720
here since bookmarks is a good dimensionality.

51
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.010
We would need to foreclose an asteroid.

52
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.850
It's called a bookmark list

53
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.210
for each control space.

54
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.550
Nice.

55
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.720
And let's just say space

56
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.480
and space bookmark.

57
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:08.070
So let's just go ahead and run this program and see if what we call it is correct a.

58
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:15.650
Right quick run nice job application.

59
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.190
Now it brings something.

60
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.170
So let's just go ahead and look at that.

61
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.370
OK.

62
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.600
Now so what what are we supposed to do it's printing something it's calling the string method in the

63
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.750
object class.

64
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.370
So we need to all right Doc..

65
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:39.870
So that let's go into each of our users or judge each of our entities and override the boosting method

66
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.220
in the object class and for that it's very simple let's just do it automatically.

67
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:53.450
That's going to source said generate do string and by default to set up in all the fields.

68
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.240
Now let's just keep it like that and that's it.

69
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260
Where is what's the insertion point.

70
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:07.880
And let's say last member so that it will be created as the last member of the class and say OK now

71
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.080
you go here.

72
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:16.250
So it's has created this dusting method automatically and it is overwriting this.

73
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.200
In addition it means that this method is overwriting a method in the superclass.

74
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.210
So it's as simple as that.

75
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.290
Let's just do that for the rest of the.

76
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:35.620
And it is too generic to string class member.

77
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.790
That's the advantage of using an ID

78
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:52.040
.

79
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.030
How cool is that.

80
00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:01.560
So let's just go ahead run this launch program one more time and there you go you can see the output

81
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:01.840
.

82
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:08.030
So here are you all the users thousand Tozan and Rantel going on to and so on.

83
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.550
Here are the emails the passwords.

84
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.640
The first name last name gender user type.

85
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:23.620
Similarly prints for the book also here sorry the weblink.

86
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:30.690
It's printing ramblings here spreading that you are in and the host for the movie.

87
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:39.740
It's using the release ear and cast and directors here and the same for the book also.

88
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:44.159
OK so everything we have written is working correctly.

89
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:52.390
It just doesn't burn ID and the title and those fees because those fields are inside the bookmark.

90
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.710
So under tousling mother is not here but we can have a posting here also and we can invoke it from the

91
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.330
from the subclauses.

92
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.030
But I don't think that's necessary because we know that it's working fine.

93
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.780
So that's good enough for now.

94
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:14.180
So just go ahead and implement the launch program and we will continue building the project.
