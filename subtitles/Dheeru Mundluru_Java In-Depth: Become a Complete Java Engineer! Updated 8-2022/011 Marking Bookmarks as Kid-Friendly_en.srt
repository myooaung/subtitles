00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,980
Hi there.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,420
Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,230
In the last lesson re-implemented east kid friendly eligible method.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,820
And with that we completed part of the functionality for monitoring bookmarks as kid friendly.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:21,390
Now let's write code that will actually allow editors and chief editors to my bookmarks as kid friendly

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,560
.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,120
The new code will make use of easy kid friendly eligible method.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,750
That is if the method returns true for a bookmark only then an editor can approve or reject the bookmark

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,360
as kid friendly like in the case of bookmarking process a proof or rejection will be done by a randomisation

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,270
Lidderdale will enhance the functionality to make real input from the user from the console.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,050
So let's get started.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,050
Let's begin with the bookmark class and let's introduce a new for you.

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,150
Callers get friendly status.

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,110
So this field basically tells whether a bookmark is good for me or not.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,070
OK so let's introduce that field.

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,400
It would be a string.

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:14,850
So initially it can be initialized with a value called as a known and later when an editor or the chief

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,420
editor marks a particular bookmark as either a prude or rejected then the value of this field will be

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,140
updated.

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,630
OK so basically this field can have three values.

21
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,440
It can be unknown or it can be approved or rejected.

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,770
So the right thing to do would be to have a constant exporting class and how all these values within

23
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,230
that class and then reference that.

24
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,940
So one other benefit.

25
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,610
The main benefit of a constant exporting class which I did not explain earlier is that you have a single

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,880
place where you have all these constants and you can reference them from anywhere within your code.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,220
So that one day it is if you need to make any change in the value you just updated in only one location

28
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,880
.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,650
Otherwise you would have all these values spread across all your core and if you need to update any

30
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:08,490
value then you have to change it in one place and also you have to up hand-on every other place where

31
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,230
that value is used and you have to ablated there.

32
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:17,880
OK so it is very tedious and you may not be able to update in all the locations in some in some cases

33
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,120
.

34
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,300
OK so that's not a good way to do it.

35
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,550
So the right way would be to have such a class and to export all the constants from one place so that

36
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,640
if there is a need to make any change we just make it in only one place.

37
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,290
OK.

38
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,280
So let's just introduce a new class.

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,640
In fact I already added this class called it friendly status within the constants which is where we

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,180
have all the constant exporting classes.

41
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,460
And since it need not be instantiated it has a pirate constructor.

42
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,380
And here are the three constants.

43
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,770
Which means that they have static and finalizer modifiers.

44
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,710
So one is a brute.

45
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,460
One is rejected and the other one is unknown.

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,410
OK so let's just go here and initialiser to unknown

47
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,790
.

48
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:14,580
Next let's go into the View class view class we know corresponds to the user interface and we have one

49
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,190
method called bookmark which we wrote earlier.

50
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,140
So which corresponds to the bookmarking process.

51
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,050
Now before we get started let's do some refactoring here.

52
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:31,800
Let's actually create a pneumatic color brawls and let's maybe we will comment on this whole method

53
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,790
book Mont..

54
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,510
And the reason I want to have this new method called browsers because let's try to keep our implementation

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,800
as close to reality as possible.

56
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,840
So the browse method will take just the same parameters user and bookmarks and it is kind of like the

57
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,220
user has long been honest browsing all the bookmarks.

58
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,430
So he's presented with all the bookmarks on the user's browsing and his looking at each bookmark and

59
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,430
when he's looking at the bookmark he may perform three actions he may either bookmark a particular item

60
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:13,470
that he looking at or he in guess if it is an editor or a chief editor then the user can either mark

61
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,600
the bookmark as kid friendly or share the bookmark with a particular with the partner site which is

62
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,750
a feature that we that we are going to add later.

63
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,280
So those are the three actions that a user might take one or more of those actions or the user might

64
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,300
not even do anything with that particular item he may just give the item.

65
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,750
So it is much more realistic that way.

66
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,560
So let's just go ahead and introduce a new matter blows and we will comment this out.

67
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,470
OK.

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,680
So let's actually common this OUTFRONT

69
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,400
it's just copy and just simply modify this method.

70
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,910
It's just called it does browse.

71
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
OK.

72
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,830
Now a user not get e-mail.

73
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,500
Let's just say he's browsing items

74
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,590
now we will still have the same restriction.

75
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,740
That is a user cannot bookmark more than the user bookmark Lamech.

76
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,780
So it was a file and we still have the same.

77
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,610
So you can think of it as like you're not that there the whole application itself it has a trial version

78
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,950
on within the trial version when the user is using the trial version.

79
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:31,010
He's not allowed to bookmark more than the bookmark limit number of items.

80
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,980
So you can think of it that way.

81
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,350
So basically what will go the way it's going to be different from the previous version of bookmark is

82
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:49,210
that this time the user will browse through all the bookmarks and for each bookmark we will use a randomized

83
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,720
randomization to decide whether the user is going to book a bookmark that particular item or not.

84
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:03,940
So over here the user is actually dating only five times and each time he's just randomly picking a

85
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,120
particular bookmark.

86
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:11,710
But in the new version the user iterate through all the bookmarks but whether or not to bookmark a particular

87
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,700
item is dependent on the randomization feature.

88
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,310
OK so let's just go ahead and do it.

89
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,280
And I think it should be clear.

90
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,570
So first let's introduce a local variable here.

91
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,880
It's called Does bookmark.

92
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,640
That's how a for loop to iterate.

93
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,060
And let's would be have nested for loop because it's a two dimensional array that we have

94
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,790
now of this bookmark count

95
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,760
is less than it's used.

96
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,000
This

97
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,410
only then the user can bookmark.

98
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,060
Now let's introduce a new method called Get bookmarks decision.

99
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,670
And let's pass this bookmark the current bookmark to this method.

100
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,530
It's a pneumatic.

101
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:34,090
So we'll just create 3.

102
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:41,200
Now we need to use a randomization function here let's use it to an earlier operator here.

103
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,760
There's a mad dog around them.

104
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:55,070
Now of let's say if this value is less than Boinne fine then we will return true which means that user

105
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,490
wants to bookmark that particular item.

106
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,370
Otherwise the user is not interested in it.

107
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,250
OK so let's just say as

108
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,930
how available called Eastbrook Mont.

109
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:17,860
.

110
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,500
Now it means that the user wants to bookmark.

111
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,730
OK so let's increment this which means that the user is bookmarking a new item

112
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:42,230
and we can just reuse the scene statement that we can copy both of them here.

113
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:54,120
Now let's just put the message here because we want to introduce new code later.

114
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,150
So that's it I think there is nothing more here.

115
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,690
So we can just remove all of this

116
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,980
launch.

117
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:25,270
It's called This as browse and it's since it's not bookmarking alone anymore let's just call it a start

118
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,450
here.

119
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,810
Do the same here.

120
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,610
We can also common this.

121
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,900
I don't think we have to print all of those.

122
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,260
It was just to test whether we were loading the data properly.

123
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,820
So that was during the initial part of writing the code.

124
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:52,790
Yeah it's Liebert like that it's also common this hard because we have this particular statement which

125
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,430
is saying which user is browsing Diadems.

126
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,920
So we are good with that.

127
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:05,530
So next let's go ahead and create the new logic for marking as kid friendly

128
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:15,520
so fasting is it can be done a bookmark can be marked as kid friendly only by either editor or chief

129
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,320
editor.

130
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,400
So let's have that permission first.

131
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,120
We get type.

132
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,510
So if you recall we have this constant exporting class called user type.

133
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,110
OK.

134
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,660
So this is for our editor.

135
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,910
Let's do the same thing our chief editor

136
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,820
is this good user type

137
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:56,760
.

138
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:02,330
Next thing is the bookmark itself should be click friendly eligible.

139
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,110
So we have already written them at their ease get friendly eligible.

140
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,390
So let's put another condition here.

141
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,760
Just at the bookmark level.

142
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:19,160
Literally all of this court I'm sorry it has to be inside the for loop so because we are doing it at

143
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,640
an item level at each item level.

144
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,580
So this is where it has to go.

145
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:31,400
So as the user is making a decision on whether to bookmark or not then if the user is an editor or chief

146
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,420
editor then makes the next decision here.

147
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,950
OK so he's good friendly energy bill.

148
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,900
OK.

149
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,400
That's one thing.

150
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,450
And

151
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,390
let's go back here and look here and let's put together for this create Gager and center

152
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,380
.

153
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,640
So that's good.

154
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,490
So we want to do this.

155
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,380
Only if the current status is unknown.

156
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,820
OK if it has already been approved or rejected we don't have to do this.

157
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,500
So a user will said the paternally status only if the existing status is unknown.

158
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,430
OK.

159
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,790
So let's not use the kid friendly status constant exporting glass

160
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,120
.

161
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,650
UNKNOWN

162
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:48,590
OK now let's create a new method called Get geek friendly state as decision just like the baby had this

163
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,200
method get bookmarked position.

164
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,560
Similarly let's also get a map.

165
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,510
Let's also write a method called Get kid friendly state decision

166
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,240
and that's just by our boss.

167
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,870
Bookmark

168
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,720
this one also written Boullion and we would once again use randomisation here.

169
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:19,880
Actually here it reads a string not boolean.

170
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,520
Now we have three decisions.

171
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:30,350
One is either a prude and other one is rejected or the third one as user may not want to approve or

172
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:36,710
reject so uder might still decide to just skip that particular item or not market ask it friendly maybe

173
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:43,360
he wants to leave it to some other editor or he might want he or she might want to get a decision sometime

174
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:43,980
later.

175
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,220
So let's have three decisions here.

176
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:52,730
So first let's say it proved so once again that user Donati operator wine for food is less than wine

177
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,200
for let's recopy this year.

178
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,980
Then the user wants to prove it.

179
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:09,240
So if that if it is false if it is above point for here better than or equal 2.4 then let's have the

180
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,370
statement.

181
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,870
So the point of this logic is if it is less than one for then use it means that user wants to prove

182
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,360
it.

183
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:36,340
If it is greater than or equal to less and this has to be 0.4 and if it is less than point eight then

184
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,770
let's say that the user let's say user wants to either reject it.

185
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,950
So we just say you're currently

186
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,330
not rejected.

187
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,980
And if the value is about point eight greater than or equal 2.8 in which case we really would as unknown

188
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,670
.

189
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,060
So we have Nestor Donati operations here

190
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,310
and that's Control shift.

191
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,660
And so that's good.

192
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,910
Let's go back Unidas is a string

193
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:31,010
.

194
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:38,840
Now if the status is something other than unknown only then we want to set the status we want to update

195
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,480
the status in the bookmark.

196
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,080
So let's have this condition here

197
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:49,850
.

198
00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:00,380
So only if it is not equal to unknown then we want to update the status.

199
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,420
So in this case it is a bookmark

200
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,370
that said between the students and let's have a six out statement here

201
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:17,450
.

202
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,710
So if it is if it is not equal to or known only then we are operating the paternally status and we are

203
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,870
printing the value here of the status value and also the bookmark and just to be clear.

204
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,160
So that's about it.

205
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:41,430
So let's just go ahead and run this class on launch.

206
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,590
There you go.

207
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,200
So let's just review the output here.

208
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,180
So loading data and then user is browsing items.

209
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:58,360
So users looking at the first item and he wants to book market which is of eyeblink.

210
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:04,990
So we are printing only those items which the user wants to bookmark so user is actually browsing all

211
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,020
15 items all 15 bookmarks that we how.

212
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:15,770
But these are the ones which the user is actually bookmarking So the randomization is telling us that

213
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,300
the user wants to bookmark it.

214
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:26,880
The randomization process I and I and the user can bookmark at most at most five bookmarks.

215
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,240
So that's the condition we have.

216
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,960
So this is the second user.

217
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,380
And for the third user we have a different output.

218
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:39,620
That's because this third user is actually an editor of one of the staff members so the user is bookmarking

219
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:39,670
.

220
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:46,220
And once this item is bookmarked then the user is also marking the bookmark as kid friendly in this

221
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,460
case it is approved.

222
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,470
And this is the actual bookmark.

223
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,750
The same bookmark has been the same item has been bookmarked also.

224
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:01,780
So they use it as both bookmarking and is also and is also marking the bookmark as kid friendly.

225
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,570
OK.

226
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,490
Now this is a second one.

227
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:10,100
And over here the user is doing the same thing and he also does approve.

228
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,110
In this case it is rejected.

229
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,220
The Big Mac has been rejected.

230
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,440
And here is a movie and in this case a movie has been bookmarked.

231
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:23,910
But they use it as not marking it as kid friendly or anything like that.

232
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,750
And here are some more items which are rejected and which are approved.

233
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:36,590
So we see this because there is no limit on the items that can be rejected are approved on the items

234
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,570
where the kid friendly status can be marked.

235
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:46,750
So there is no limit on that like the limit that we how far good for setting up for bookmarking an item

236
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,340
.

237
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,100
So that's it.

238
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,990
So those are the four users performing different actions.

239
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,740
Next we will look at the functionality for sharing of get friendly bookmarks with partner websites
