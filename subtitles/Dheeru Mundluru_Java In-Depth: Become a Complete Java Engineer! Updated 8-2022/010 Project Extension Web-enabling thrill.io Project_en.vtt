00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.040
Hi there.

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.630
This is to.

3
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.170
And welcome back.

4
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.920
It's not time to get back to our project.

5
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.300
The bookmarking application Trello.

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.239
Since we have learned about JSP and sublets, it's not time to web enable our project.

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.560
We know that for our project we have used the MVC pattern, the model view and controller, and the

8
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.080
only missing piece was the view part.

9
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.040
So for the model, we have the managers, the double layer, and also the database which we have implemented

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.410
for controller.

11
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.530
We had used some Java files and all we need to do is convert those Java files into servers.

12
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.350
And for the viewport we have used a Java file.

13
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.240
The Java file called View Java was mimicking the front end.

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.240
Now, since we have learned about JSP and Servlet, we are going to replace the Java file using JSP

15
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.990
and Servlet.

16
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.160
Now for this extension, we are going to focus only on books.

17
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.920
So let's not worry about movies and web links and let's focus only on books.

18
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.550
So earlier we have implemented the books of our project.

19
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.970
So it's nice that we are going to focus on only books so that we can use some of the code from the books.

20
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.930
Aloha Project.

21
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.710
Let me show you a demo of how the end product would look like.

22
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.500
So this is how the screen would look like, the login screen would look like.

23
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.890
So we are going to have the login functionality and once the user logs in the user can view all the

24
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:46.080
books that he or she has bookmarked and the user can also view the books that he or she has not bookmarked

25
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.390
yet and can bookmark them.

26
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.930
So this is what we are going to see.

27
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.710
So this is a test application that I have implemented, and the final product that we are going to implement,

28
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.430
the final product will also be exactly identical to this.

29
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.410
So let's go ahead and let me enter a user name.

30
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.280
One of the users was user four at Semantic Square dot com and the password was test.

31
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.710
This login screen is the last one that we are going to implement.

32
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.230
So for this extension, we will have around three lectures to implement this basic functionality of

33
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.480
bookmarking the books.

34
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.760
After three lectures, this would be the last lecture.

35
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.330
So login functionality will be implemented at the very end.

36
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.700
So once the user locks in.

37
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.060
We show the screen.

38
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.520
So this screen will show all the items that the user has bookmarked.

39
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.730
Now, as of now, there are no books that the user has bookmarked.

40
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.710
So we display this message called As You Haven't Saved Any Items.

41
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.310
So let me go into this browse.

42
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.350
There is this link called Browse.

43
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.040
If you click that, it will show all the bookmarks that are not yet bookmarked by the user.

44
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.940
So there are around five books here and these are not yet bookmarked.

45
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.440
So this is the first screen that we are going to implement.

46
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.050
So this would be the next lecture.

47
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.220
Now here there is a link called Save, and if you click on Save, this particular item will be bookmarked

48
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.090
and the user will be taken to the other page, which we have just seen.

49
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.460
And that book will be displayed there.

50
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.360
And a link to that page is also provided here called My Books.

51
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.440
And as the name implies, it will show only books that the user has bookmarked.

52
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.630
So let me go ahead and click on the save button Save Link.

53
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.090
There you go.

54
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.870
So we are taken to the My Books page now.

55
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.960
And in the my books page we once again have this browse link which will take us to the previous page.

56
00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.950
So the Browse link will be the first one that we are going to implement and the second lecture will

57
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.200
be focused on saving the bookmark when the user clicks on the save button.

58
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.170
So that would be the bookmarking functionality itself along with this page that we are seeing here,

59
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.850
which is the My Books page.

60
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.079
So that's the second one.

61
00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.180
And the last one is the login functionality.

62
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.170
So basically three features.

63
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.610
One page to show all the bookmarks that are not yet bookmarked, which is this page.

64
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.950
And the second one is the bookmarking functionality, which is the save link here.

65
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.680
When you click on that, we are going to save the bookmark for that particular user and along with the

66
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.460
My Books page and they will actually take us to the same page as my books.

67
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.390
So once again, let me click on this one.

68
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.600
So now the user has saved two items.

69
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.440
So this is the second one and the last feature is the login functionality itself.

70
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.430
So that is coming at the very end.

71
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.800
And we also have the logout here.

72
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.780
So if you click on that, we will be taken back to the login page.

73
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.260
So this is a simple application that we are going to implement.

74
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.330
But the nice thing is we have learned everything about it when interacting with the database.

75
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.760
We have learned about the database technology, the MySQL and how to interact with it.

76
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.510
And for the view part, we have already learned about JSP and Servlet and the project.

77
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:33.890
Also, we have implemented it in an incremental way and as we were learning new features, we were building

78
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.610
the project.

79
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.790
As soon as we have learned the oops concept, we implemented our first version and we gradually improved

80
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:41.150
it.

81
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.270
And so this is a simple application and we can make it as complicated as as we want to.

82
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.100
And later on you can also implement movies and web links and so on.

83
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.190
So that's about it.

84
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.060
I think you must have like what you have seen right now.

85
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.580
And let's go ahead and implement this project.

86
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.040
Thank you and see you in the next lecture.
