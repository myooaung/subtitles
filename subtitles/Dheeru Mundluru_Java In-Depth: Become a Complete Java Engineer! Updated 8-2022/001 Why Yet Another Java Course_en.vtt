00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:04.680
Hi there.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.330
Welcome to this master course Java In-Depth.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.510
Become a complete Java engineer.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.290
This is the demo, and I'm going to be your instructor for this course.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.870
I'm a passionate software engineer and an educator with a PhD in computer science, and I have several

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:25.050
years of experience working as a principal software engineer in and around Silicon Valley, developing

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.549
complex algorithms in areas such as search, data mining and data integration, where we deal with tons

8
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.630
and tons of data.

9
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.000
And I have used Java for this and I've been using it for well over a decade now.

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.480
So I have brought all of this Java experience into this Java Master course, and one of the core missions

11
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.410
of this course is to address certain limitations that I observed in many senior to lead software engineers.

12
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.750
And shortly I'm going to talk about that.

13
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.710
Now, as the course title suggests, the goal of this course is to help you become a complete Java engineer

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.450
right by the end of this course.

15
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.540
It's not just about teaching you the Java fundamentals, like the Java syntax or the oops concepts,

16
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.490
which is what most Java courses do.

17
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.030
But to take it a step ahead and help you become a complete Java engineer and a complete Java engineer

18
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.310
is someone who has a comprehensive understanding of the Java programming language, which is one of

19
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.040
the most important goals of this course, along with the many design principles, best practices, and

20
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.330
professional coding conventions for building well-designed software.

21
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.690
And by the end of this course, you will also have the practical experience in building a good Java

22
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.890
based Web application following professional coding principles.

23
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.000
This course has also been rated as one of the top three Java courses on Udemy dot com, and many actually

24
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.610
regarded as the best Java course out there.

25
00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.510
This course has already taught tens of thousands of students across over 150 countries, ranging from

26
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.470
absolute beginners to even experienced Java professionals.

27
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.030
Many top companies are also very actively using this course as part of their official training programs.

28
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.420
Now, in this short video, I'm going to talk about why this course was created and what it offers to

29
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.330
differentiate itself from other Java courses.

30
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.970
It is indeed a very unique course.

31
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.420
Now the million dollar question why do we need yet another Java course?

32
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.880
One thing I observed in my career was that sometimes even good engineers who graduated from top schools

33
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.850
and who worked at top companies are failing to write good, clean and well designed code.

34
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.900
Their code works correctly and efficiently, but due to poor design, the code is not maintainable.

35
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.030
That is, it is not easy to understand and hence not easily extendable.

36
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.450
By poor design I mean not following proper design principles and best practices.

37
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.340
And this often leads to several rounds of code refactoring and hence loss of valuable time for the company.

38
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.380
To a large extent, I feel this has to do with the way we are taught programming.

39
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.390
Most courses are good at covering the language fundamentals, but they are still not comprehensive enough.

40
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.770
And many times the focus is on the syntax.

41
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.980
But why a particular feature is used is not clearly explained.

42
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.840
And they almost always never teach.

43
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.010
Best practices and design principles which are critical for writing high quality code.

44
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:47.120
And most do not include a good project that follows professional coding conventions, although concepts

45
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.350
are demonstrated via small programs, and this comprehensive master course aims to address these shortcomings

46
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.700
in the current courses.

47
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.310
And it takes a holistic approach to teach Java programming.

48
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.900
It covers most of the language features in a very in-depth way.

49
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.890
Everything from language basics to object oriented design to advanced topics like Multithreading database

50
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.350
programming and functional style programming.

51
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.310
Features like lambdas and streams are discussed in great detail.

52
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.190
It's not just syntax, but motivation.

53
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.220
Behind introducing these features is also discussed.

54
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.420
And the highlight of this course is we discuss several best practices and design principles that a good

55
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.520
software engineer is ought to know.

56
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.150
Many design principles outlined in the popular effective Java book are also discussed, and many of

57
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.620
them are actually demonstrated in code.

58
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.220
Using our own custom examples.

59
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.240
Another highlight is that it includes an instructor led project where we develop a full blown bookmarking

60
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.170
web application using technologies like Servlet and JSP.

61
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:05.660
With my SQL as the database project also follows standards like MVC and TDD, where TDD stands for test

62
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.830
driven development.

63
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.460
So you're going to gain some good real world experience, right, from the comfort of your home or the

64
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.300
workplace.

65
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.720
So these three are the core objectives of this course.

66
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.320
Next, we use Eclipse for writing our programs and a comprehensive Eclipse tutorial is also included

67
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.170
and it teaches you all the things that you need to know as a professional developer, including debugging,

68
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.480
Java programs and unit testing.

69
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.340
Finally, we have a special chapter giving a solid introduction to JVM, which stands for Java Virtual

70
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.750
Machine, and it is an incredible platform on which Java programs run.

71
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.930
Most courses never discussed this topic, or even if they do, they barely scratch the surface.

72
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.510
Several challenging quizzes and coding exercises are included to validate what you have learned.

73
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.800
So together, all of these will help you in becoming a complete Java engineer.

74
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.950
And if you're complete, it means you're confident and a happy engineer.

75
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:16.130
Only requirement is to concentrate really well as over half to one year of your self-study effort is

76
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.020
packed into this master course.

77
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.350
It is a sort of mini degree in itself.

78
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.540
You can reach out to me if you have any questions and I will respond within a day or so.

79
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.900
And my answers are very detailed and personalised to, if you like what you have heard from me, then

80
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.240
please go ahead and sign up for this course and thank you for your time and have fun.
