1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:08,750
Let's not create constant exporting classes the classes that exist only for defining constants.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:16,170
For example we have Jondrette fill in book and movie classes and it has a range of values in each of

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,880
those domains.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,760
So instead of defining these values in databases we can also define them in a constant exploding class

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,870
.

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:31,810
Similarly range of values for gender field in use class cannot be defined using constant exporting class

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
and we can do the same for user type feel within the user class.

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,130
These classes will be useful when we have to check if the field has a particular value.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,400
For example if we want to check if a particular book belongs to a certain genre then the constant exporting

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,120
class corresponding to this feature will be useful.

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,700
We will see this when we later implement east kid friendly eligible method.

12
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,600
So these classes are useful.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,640
And let's go ahead and create them.

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,280
Let's first create a new package for constants

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,360
.

16
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,010
So it's semantics were really are constants.

17
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,490
Let's create a constant exporting class called user type

18
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,570
since it's going to expose only the constants.

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,450
So there are no instance variables are there are no methods in this class.

20
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,880
So it's just going to be static final peak of Feels so that it's compile time constants so we don't

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,990
need to create an instance of this class so we can define a private constructor.

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,380
Now let's define the constants

23
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,380
since it's a compile time constant we need to use all caps.

24
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,250
That's the convention we know that it's got it as user.

25
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,320
Now let's simply copy this.

26
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,380
So let's call the second one as student editor

27
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,450
and Thirty-One chief editor.

28
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,700
Okay so that's a user type class.

29
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,970
Let's create one for gender

30
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,630
in the private constructor

31
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,990
and the gender field is here.

32
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,320
So let's go ahead and create three constants

33
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:31,270
.

34
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,610
Initialize it with zero

35
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,920
to two on

36
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,390
transgender.

37
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,880
Make it two.

38
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,420
So that's the gender class.

39
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,960
And we also need to do more for the genre for book genre and movie joinery and I'm just going to create

40
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,890
them off line as darling dear and that's much better.

41
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,610
It will say for some time.

42
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,700
So let me just create it off line and I'll come back and show it to you.

43
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:14,990
OK.

44
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,709
Here's a book John reckless and these are all the constants that it has.

45
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,019
And it's in the Constans package.

46
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:30,270
And here is a movie class and it has a lot of constants as you can see here the different genres classics

47
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,350
drama comedy and so on.

48
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,540
I'm going to upload the book movie genre and book Journey to the resources section so you can just download

49
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,080
them and that's it.

50
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,880
So those are the four constant exporting classes that we have created.

51
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,020
And that's a
