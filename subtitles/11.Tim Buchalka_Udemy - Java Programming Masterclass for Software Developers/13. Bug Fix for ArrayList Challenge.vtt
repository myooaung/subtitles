00:00:04.759  -->  00:00:06.859
In this video, we're going to fix a small
2

2

00:00:06.859  -->  00:00:08.930
bug that occurred in the challenge
3

3

00:00:08.930  -->  00:00:11.510
solution. So after testing the code
4

4

00:00:11.510  -->  00:00:13.759
perhaps you've noticed that we can
5

5

00:00:13.759  -->  00:00:15.500
update the contact with a name that
6

6

00:00:15.500  -->  00:00:18.500
already exists in the list, so what I'm
7

7

00:00:18.500  -->  00:00:20.000
going to do is first demonstrate this
8

8

00:00:20.000  -->  00:00:22.309
bug and after demonstrating it we're
9

9

00:00:22.309  -->  00:00:23.960
going to continue on and fix the issue.
10

10

00:00:23.960  -->  00:00:26.390
so let's run the application, I'm going
11

11

00:00:26.390  -->  00:00:32.930
to run our main method. Alright, so what
12

12

00:00:32.930  -->  00:00:35.059
we want to do is we want to have at
13

13

00:00:35.059  -->  00:00:37.190
least two contacts, so I'm going to start
14

14

00:00:37.190  -->  00:00:38.870
by entering your contact so we can add a
15

15

00:00:38.870  -->  00:00:42.680
new contact rather John telephone number
16

16

00:00:42.680  -->  00:00:44.930
one two three four five six seven eight
17

17

00:00:44.930  -->  00:00:50.210
nine and we'll add another one, Jim this
18

18

00:00:50.210  -->  00:00:54.020
time contact number nine eight seven six
19

19

00:00:54.020  -->  00:00:58.250
five four three two one enter and we'll
20

20

00:00:58.250  -->  00:01:00.230
one to print out the contacts to confirm
21

21

00:01:00.230  -->  00:01:02.390
we've got two there. So you can see at
22

22

00:01:02.390  -->  00:01:03.890
the moment we've got John and Jim both
23

23

00:01:03.890  -->  00:01:06.710
listed. Now the main idea is to update
24

24

00:01:06.710  -->  00:01:09.109
one of the contacts with the same name
25

25

00:01:09.109  -->  00:01:10.969
that already exists to demonstrate that
26

26

00:01:10.969  -->  00:01:12.859
bug, so what I'm going to do is choose
27

27

00:01:12.859  -->  00:01:15.740
Jim for this, so we need to select
28

28

00:01:15.740  -->  00:01:19.959
three to update an existing contact,
29

29

00:01:19.959  -->  00:01:22.850
contact name, this is the existing
30

30

00:01:22.850  -->  00:01:26.539
contact name, so we're gonna enter Jim into the
31

31

00:01:26.539  -->  00:01:28.429
new contact name, we're going to enter
32

32

00:01:28.429  -->  00:01:33.529
John and the new contact phone number
33

33

00:01:33.529  -->  00:01:36.499
one two three four five six seven eight
34

34

00:01:36.499  -->  00:01:40.279
nine and press Enter successfully
35

35

00:01:40.279  -->  00:01:41.719
updated the record as you can see there
36

36

00:01:41.719  -->  00:01:44.569
and now if we list the contents we'll
37

37

00:01:44.569  -->  00:01:48.409
print them out. You can see now we've got
38

38

00:01:48.409  -->  00:01:50.810
two John entries they're basically two
39

39

00:01:50.810  -->  00:01:53.450
contacts with the same name and phone
40

40

00:01:53.450  -->  00:01:55.310
number. Now we don't want to allow
41

41

00:01:55.310  -->  00:01:57.529
contacts with the same name but do keep
42

42

00:01:57.529  -->  00:01:59.090
in mind that real phone numbers do allow
43

43

00:01:59.090  -->  00:02:01.669
our two placated contacts. Now the
44

44

00:02:01.669  -->  00:02:04.549
problem is obviously in the update
45

45

00:02:04.549  -->  00:02:06.200
contact method because of course that's
46

46

00:02:06.200  -->  00:02:08.599
what we're calling to update, so that's
47

47

00:02:08.599  -->  00:02:12.319
open the mobile phone class, they come
48

48

00:02:12.319  -->  00:02:14.989
down to update content contact rather or
49

49

00:02:14.989  -->  00:02:16.040
just close down the run window, so you
50

50

00:02:16.040  -->  00:02:18.019
can see it a bit better, this is the code
51

51

00:02:18.019  -->  00:02:18.830
here you can see on
52

52

00:02:18.830  -->  00:02:21.320
screen, they're starting on line 29
53

53

00:02:21.320  -->  00:02:24.230
this method firsts finds the position of
54

54

00:02:24.230  -->  00:02:26.780
the existing contact in case it exists
55

55

00:02:26.780  -->  00:02:29.240
and in the case where it does exist,
56

56

00:02:29.240  -->  00:02:32.060
the contact is updated but before the
57

57

00:02:32.060  -->  00:02:34.370
contact what we want to do is before
58

58

00:02:34.370  -->  00:02:36.950
updating the contact, we want to check if
59

59

00:02:36.950  -->  00:02:39.530
the contact or a contact with the same
60

60

00:02:39.530  -->  00:02:41.750
name already exists. So all we really
61

61

00:02:41.750  -->  00:02:44.390
have to do was add an else statement to
62

62

00:02:44.390  -->  00:02:46.520
the if to check if the contact with that
63

63

00:02:46.520  -->  00:02:48.520
particular name is already in existence.
64

64

00:02:48.520  -->  00:02:51.920
so we come down here, if found
65

65

00:02:51.920  -->  00:02:54.260
positions less than zero then we need to
66

66

00:02:54.260  -->  00:02:57.620
add it else if parentheses
67

67

00:02:57.620  -->  00:03:00.770
find contact parentheses again and it's
68

68

00:03:00.770  -->  00:03:06.380
going to be new contact dot get name,
69

69

00:03:06.380  -->  00:03:07.820
you can see opening and closing parentheses
70

70

00:03:07.820  -->  00:03:12.520
there that's not equal to minus one,
71

71

00:03:12.520  -->  00:03:15.920
closing parenthesis and the should have
72

72

00:03:15.920  -->  00:03:18.230
been to another parenthesis there after
73

73

00:03:18.230  -->  00:03:21.260
the dot get name function call, so that
74

74

00:03:21.260  -->  00:03:23.390
closes that off, so if the phone contact
75

75

00:03:23.390  -->  00:03:25.220
or we're passing a new contact name
76

76

00:03:25.220  -->  00:03:27.739
returns always not equal to negative one
77

77

00:03:27.739  -->  00:03:29.420
so it's a number other than negative one
78

78

00:03:29.420  -->  00:03:31.519
that means we've already got a contact
79

79

00:03:31.519  -->  00:03:33.590
with that name, so what we're going to do
80

80

00:03:33.590  -->  00:03:43.430
is print out contact with name plus new
81

81

00:03:43.430  -->  00:03:49.880
contact dot get name let's spend this on
82

82

00:03:49.880  -->  00:03:54.560
to the next line plus double quotes
83

83

00:03:54.560  -->  00:04:02.220
already exists update it's not successful
84

84

00:04:02.220  -->  00:04:05.070
stop, then we'll close that line off.
85

85

00:04:05.070  -->  00:04:06.880
Other thing we want to do at that point
86

86

00:04:06.880  -->  00:04:09.160
is return false because of course the
87

87

00:04:09.160  -->  00:04:11.410
update wasn't successful, then we don't
88

88

00:04:11.410  -->  00:04:13.870
need to change any other code because of
89

89

00:04:13.870  -->  00:04:15.640
course if the code falls through down to
90

90

00:04:15.640  -->  00:04:17.920
here, it means the name wasn't found and
91

91

00:04:17.920  -->  00:04:19.930
were able to go through and actually do
92

92

00:04:19.930  -->  00:04:21.880
the update. Well, so let's go back now to
93

93

00:04:21.880  -->  00:04:24.520
our main dot Java and what we might do
94

94

00:04:24.520  -->  00:04:28.270
is also while I'm here, I'll look at the
95

95

00:04:28.270  -->  00:04:31.090
menu they had a typo there in the menu,
96

96

00:04:31.090  -->  00:04:33.790
so we come down here to the menu to
97

97

00:04:33.790  -->  00:04:36.040
update existing an existing contact,
98

98

00:04:36.040  -->  00:04:38.830
let's just fix that to update an
99

99

00:04:38.830  -->  00:04:40.960
existing contact. Alright, so now that
100

100

00:04:40.960  -->  00:04:42.310
we've put that change in let's test this
101

101

00:04:42.310  -->  00:04:47.170
out, so let's run up ok so we're going to
102

102

00:04:47.170  -->  00:04:48.190
start again we're going to do exactly
103

103

00:04:48.190  -->  00:04:50.140
the same as we did last time, we do a
104

104

00:04:50.140  -->  00:04:55.240
number two first add John telephone
105

105

00:04:55.240  -->  00:04:57.250
number one two three four five six seven
106

106

00:04:57.250  -->  00:05:03.910
eight nine and two again Jim nine eight
107

107

00:05:03.910  -->  00:05:07.900
seven six five four three two one one
108

108

00:05:07.900  -->  00:05:10.060
two print out our contacts and so you've
109

109

00:05:10.060  -->  00:05:11.560
got two there to contact showing there
110

110

00:05:11.560  -->  00:05:14.110
now. So we now need to perform an update
111

111

00:05:14.110  -->  00:05:15.640
and of course that's number three in the
112

112

00:05:15.640  -->  00:05:18.550
menu, we're going to update Jim so we
113

113

00:05:18.550  -->  00:05:22.450
type in Jim enter your contact name,
114

114

00:05:22.450  -->  00:05:27.880
try typing John and went to the contact
115

115

00:05:27.880  -->  00:05:29.860
number one two three four five six seven
116

116

00:05:29.860  -->  00:05:32.860
eight nine and you can see now we've got
117

117

00:05:32.860  -->  00:05:33.880
some different output.
118

118

00:05:33.880  -->  00:05:36.520
Contact with name John already exists
119

119

00:05:36.520  -->  00:05:39.100
update was not successful error updating
120

120

00:05:39.100  -->  00:05:41.590
record. So basically the console is
121

121

00:05:41.590  -->  00:05:43.630
displaying a message that there was an
122

122

00:05:43.630  -->  00:05:46.000
error updating the contact because John
123

123

00:05:46.000  -->  00:05:48.310
already exists which is what we want,
124

124

00:05:48.310  -->  00:05:49.600
so that's good but let's just do one other
125

125

00:05:49.600  -->  00:05:51.340
thing, just to make sure that it is
126

126

00:05:51.340  -->  00:05:52.960
working where we're choosing a different
127

127

00:05:52.960  -->  00:05:54.520
name, so go through and do the update
128

128

00:05:54.520  -->  00:05:58.080
again, you just in contact name is Jim
129

129

00:05:58.080  -->  00:06:01.240
then we want a change Jim to another man
130

130

00:06:01.240  -->  00:06:02.440
this time we'll go for the new contact
131

131

00:06:02.440  -->  00:06:05.990
name Percy
132

132

00:06:05.990  -->  00:06:10.130
one three five seven nine one two three
133

133

00:06:10.130  -->  00:06:13.370
four. This time Jim was replaced with
134

134

00:06:13.370  -->  00:06:14.599
Percy which is what we would expect
135

135

00:06:14.599  -->  00:06:16.699
because the names are different, we can
136

136

00:06:16.699  -->  00:06:19.099
do option one to print out a list and
137

137

00:06:19.099  -->  00:06:21.410
we've now got John and Percy because of
138

138

00:06:21.410  -->  00:06:24.110
course we've changed or updated Jim to
139

139

00:06:24.110  -->  00:06:26.509
have a new name of a new phone number of
140

140

00:06:26.509  -->  00:06:28.880
Percy and one three five seven nine one
141

141

00:06:28.880  -->  00:06:31.130
two three four, so if you fix that bug
142

142

00:06:31.130  -->  00:06:34.819
that allowed a duplicate to entry to be
143

143

00:06:34.819  -->  00:06:37.210
basically updated to the same name and
144

144

00:06:37.210  -->  00:06:42.130
we're done. So I'll see you in the next video.
