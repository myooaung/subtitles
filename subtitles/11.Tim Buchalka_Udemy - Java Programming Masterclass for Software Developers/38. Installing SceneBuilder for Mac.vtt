alright so in this video we're going to
2

2

00:00:06.350  -->  00:00:08.660
go ahead and download and setup scene
alright so in this video we're going to
3

3

00:00:08.660  -->  00:00:11.330
builder for a mac computer it's part of
go ahead and download and setup scene
4

4

00:00:11.330  -->  00:00:12.680
this process we are actually also going to
builder for a mac computer it's part of
5

5

00:00:12.680  -->  00:00:14.780
configure it so that it actually works
this process we are actually also going to
6

6

00:00:14.780  -->  00:00:16.940
in intelliJ as well let's make a start
configure it so that it actually works
7

7

00:00:16.940  -->  00:00:19.910
on that now firstly as i mentioned in
in intelliJ as well let's make a start
8

8

00:00:19.910  -->  00:00:22.720
the previous video we talked about scene
on that now firstly as i mentioned in
9

9

00:00:22.720  -->  00:00:24.920
builder for the first time you might
the previous video we talked about scene
10

10

00:00:24.920  -->  00:00:27.130
find some old binaries if you search for scene
builder for the first time you might
11

11

00:00:27.130  -->  00:00:29.470
builder online from oracle but don't actually
find some old binaries if you search for scene
12

12

00:00:29.470  -->  00:00:31.390
use those because they don't include the
builder online from oracle but don't actually
13

13

00:00:31.390  -->  00:00:34.420
latest updates to java fx now
use those because they don't include the
14

14

00:00:34.420  -->  00:00:36.410
there's a company called glue on and
latest updates to java fx now
15

15

00:00:36.410  -->  00:00:38.240
have taken the lead in keeping scene
there's a company called glue on and
16

16

00:00:38.240  -->  00:00:40.190
builder up-to-date and actually provide

39

39

00:01:35.390  -->  00:01:37.210
just dragging it over the scene builder
we're going to do the installation by
40

40

00:01:37.210  -->  00:01:40.460
into our applications you can see that
just dragging it over the scene builder
41

41

00:01:40.460  -->  00:01:42.100
we've now got scene builder in there
into our applications you can see that
42

42

00:01:42.100  -->  00:01:43.900
alright so that's what we need to do to
we've now got scene builder in there
43

43

00:01:43.900  -->  00:01:45.890
install it pretty straightforward and
alright so that's what we need to do to
44

44

00:01:45.890  -->  00:01:47.350
i'm just going to eject that now that
install it pretty straightforward and
45

45

00:01:47.350  -->  00:01:49.990
we are finish with the installer and
i'm just going to eject that now that
46

46

00:01:49.990  -->  00:01:53.920
will close down the finder and actually
we are finish with the installer and
47

47

00:01:53.920  -->  00:01:55.280
what we can do before I go into the
will close down the finder and actually
48

48

00:01:55.280  -->  00:01:57.710
installation on intelliJ
what we can do before I go into the
49

49

00:01:57.710  -->  00:01:59.830
just run this and just to
installation on intelliJ
50

50

00:01:59.830  -->  00:02:04.630
have a look at it will open up scene builder
just run this and just to
51

51

00:02:04.630  -->  00:02:07.990
that we've just installed and this is
have a look at it will open up scene builder
52

52

00:02:07.990  -->  00:02:09.740
actually the tool that's installed will
that we've just installed and this is
53

53

00:02:09.740  -->  00:02:11.690
cancel that for now and you can see that
actually the tool that's installed will
54

54

00:02:11.690  -->  00:02:14.810
we've got a basic scene builder and i'm
cancel that for now and you can see that
55

55

00:02:14.810  -->  00:02:16.370
not going to go into this in detail here
we've got a basic scene builder and i'm
56

56

00:02:16.370  -->  00:02:17.570
because we're going to do that in the
not going to go into this in detail here
57

57

00:02:17.570  -->  00:02:18.090
future
because we're going to do that in the
58

58

00:02:18.090  -->  00:02:21.030
view within IntelliJ point is it's a
future
59

59

00:02:21.030  -->  00:02:23.370
standalone program that we can use but
view within IntelliJ point is it's a
60

60

00:02:23.370  -->  00:02:25.980
theirs also a mechanism that we can actually
standalone program that we can use but
61

61

00:02:25.980  -->  00:02:28.140
use to incorporate this into intelliJ
theirs also a mechanism that we can actually
62

62

00:02:28.140  -->  00:02:29.190
and that's obviously what we want to do
use to incorporate this into intelliJ
63

63

00:02:29.190  -->  00:02:31.620
so it's more convenient for convenient
and that's obviously what we want to do
64

64

00:02:31.620  -->  00:02:33.060
for us when we're developing programs
so it's more convenient for convenient
65

65

00:02:33.060  -->  00:02:34.980
i'm going to close scene builder here
for us when we're developing programs
66

66

00:02:34.980  -->  00:02:39.390
and quit out of it and swing over
i'm going to close scene builder here
67

67

00:02:39.390  -->  00:02:44.120
to IntelliJ and within IntelliJ open
and quit out of it and swing over
68

68

00:02:44.120  -->  00:02:45.650
i'm going to come up here and click on
