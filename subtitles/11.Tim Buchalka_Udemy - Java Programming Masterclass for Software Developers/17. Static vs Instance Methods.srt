00:00:04,560  -->  00:00:06,630
Let's discuss the differences between
2

2

00:00:06,630  -->  00:00:11,190
static methods and instance methods so
3

3

00:00:11,190  -->  00:00:13,650
firstly static methods systemic methods
4

4

00:00:13,650  -->  00:00:17,070
are declared using a static modifier now
5

5

00:00:17,070  -->  00:00:18,720
static methods can access instant
6

6

00:00:18,720  -->  00:00:21,360
methods and instant variables directly
7

7

00:00:21,360  -->  00:00:23,850
they're usually used for operations that
8

8

00:00:23,850  -->  00:00:27,000
don't require any data from an instance
9

9

00:00:27,000  -->  00:00:28,830
of the class from this in other words
10

10

00:00:28,830  -->  00:00:31,380
and if you remember that this keyword is
11

11

00:00:31,380  -->  00:00:35,190
the current instance of a class so
12

12

00:00:35,190  -->  00:00:37,679
inside a static method we can't don't
13

13

00:00:37,679  -->  00:00:40,530
have access to this keyword we can't use
14

14

00:00:40,530  -->  00:00:42,480
that whenever you see a method that
15

15

00:00:42,480  -->  00:00:44,429
doesn't use instant variables that
16

16

00:00:44,429  -->  00:00:46,710
method should probably be declared as a
17

17

00:00:46,710  -->  00:00:49,769
static method for example main is a
18

18

00:00:49,769  -->  00:00:51,839
static method and it's called by the
19

19

00:00:51,839  -->  00:00:54,210
java virtual machine when it starts the
20

20

00:00:54,210  -->  00:00:57,629
java application in this example on
21

21

00:00:57,629  -->  00:00:59,370
screen we've got a class called
22

22

00:00:59,370  -->  00:01:02,069
calculator with a static method called
23

23

00:01:02,069  -->  00:01:04,589
print sum and it just prints the sum of
24

24

00:01:04,589  -->  00:01:07,260
two integer numbers then we've got the
25

25

00:01:07,260  -->  00:01:10,560
main class with two static methods main
26

26

00:01:10,560  -->  00:01:13,979
and print hello now inside main we're
27

27

00:01:13,979  -->  00:01:16,020
calling the method print sum from the
28

28

00:01:16,020  -->  00:01:18,659
calculator class so as you can see to
29

29

00:01:18,659  -->  00:01:20,670
call the print sum method we just need
30

30

00:01:20,670  -->  00:01:22,079
to type the class name in this case
31

31

00:01:22,079  -->  00:01:24,780
calculator and in the method name in
32

32

00:01:24,780  -->  00:01:27,539
this case print sum or in the second
33

33

00:01:27,539  -->  00:01:29,729
example in the case of print hello we
34

34

00:01:29,729  -->  00:01:31,049
can just type the method name with
35

35

00:01:31,049  -->  00:01:33,359
parentheses which will automatically
36

36

00:01:33,359  -->  00:01:35,640
call the print hello static method
37

37

00:01:35,640  -->  00:01:37,950
because it's being invoked from a static
38

38

00:01:37,950  -->  00:01:40,590
method itself so static methods don't
39

39

00:01:40,590  -->  00:01:43,049
require an instance to be created we
40

40

00:01:43,049  -->  00:01:45,840
just typed a class name dot method name
41

41

00:01:45,840  -->  00:01:47,880
to access them let's move on now to
42

42

00:01:47,880  -->  00:01:51,899
instance methods instance methods belong
43

43

00:01:51,899  -->  00:01:54,329
to an instance a specific instance of a
44

44

00:01:54,329  -->  00:01:56,460
class you know to use an instance method
45

45

00:01:56,460  -->  00:01:59,070
we have to instantiate the class first
46

46

00:01:59,070  -->  00:02:03,450
usually by using the new keyword is that
47

47

00:02:03,450  -->  00:02:05,460
methods can access instance methods and
48

48

00:02:05,460  -->  00:02:08,550
instance variables directly instance
49

49

00:02:08,550  -->  00:02:10,590
methods can also access static methods
50

50

00:02:10,590  -->  00:02:14,220
and static variables directly so in this
51

51

00:02:14,220  -->  00:02:16,140
example we've got a class called dog
52

52

00:02:16,140  -->  00:02:18,150
with a method bar
53

53

00:02:18,150  -->  00:02:21,180
so notice here how the method bark is
54

54

00:02:21,180  -->  00:02:22,860
not using the static camera at this time
55

55

00:02:22,860  -->  00:02:24,900
so in other words that method is to
56

56

00:02:24,900  -->  00:02:27,480
sustained an instance method then we've
57

57

00:02:27,480  -->  00:02:29,700
got our main class with a method main
58

58

00:02:29,700  -->  00:02:32,580
now inside main then main method we
59

59

00:02:32,580  -->  00:02:35,069
first need to create an instance of dog
60

60

00:02:35,069  -->  00:02:37,560
class and that's done with the line dog
61

61

00:02:37,560  -->  00:02:40,890
Rex equals new dog as you can see we're
62

62

00:02:40,890  -->  00:02:43,140
using the new keyword to create an
63

63

00:02:43,140  -->  00:02:45,959
instance of that class and after we've
64

64

00:02:45,959  -->  00:02:47,250
got the instance we can call the
65

65

00:02:47,250  -->  00:02:49,620
instance method bark in this case by
66

66

00:02:49,620  -->  00:02:52,769
typing Rex bark so the hard part here
67

67

00:02:52,769  -->  00:02:54,420
could be deciding when to create an
68

68

00:02:54,420  -->  00:02:56,340
instance I want to create a static
69

69

00:02:56,340  -->  00:02:58,980
method so let's say some basic rules
70

70

00:02:58,980  -->  00:03:01,739
that should help you decide so here
71

71

00:03:01,739  -->  00:03:02,970
we've got a small diagram that should
72

72

00:03:02,970  -->  00:03:04,859
help you with deciding whether you need
73

73

00:03:04,859  -->  00:03:07,079
an instance or a static method no
74

74

00:03:07,079  -->  00:03:09,420
instance methods are created more often
75

75

00:03:09,420  -->  00:03:11,579
than static methods but let's see how
76

76

00:03:11,579  -->  00:03:13,440
you'll follow this diagram so the
77

77

00:03:13,440  -->  00:03:14,909
question that you would ask yourself
78

78

00:03:14,909  -->  00:03:17,760
would be should have method be static so
79

79

00:03:17,760  -->  00:03:19,319
for that question the next question
80

80

00:03:19,319  -->  00:03:21,060
would be doesn't use any fields
81

81

00:03:21,060  -->  00:03:22,980
instance variables in other words or
82

82

00:03:22,980  -->  00:03:26,190
instance methods of this object this is
83

83

00:03:26,190  -->  00:03:27,419
the proposed method you're looking to
84

84

00:03:27,419  -->  00:03:30,060
write so if that's true in other words
85

85

00:03:30,060  -->  00:03:32,700
it does use some fields and/or instance
86

86

00:03:32,700  -->  00:03:34,859
methods then you'd make it an instance
87

87

00:03:34,859  -->  00:03:36,989
method in the other scenario if the
88

88

00:03:36,989  -->  00:03:39,750
method doesn't use or is not proposed to
89

89

00:03:39,750  -->  00:03:41,459
use any instance variables or instance
90

90

00:03:41,459  -->  00:03:44,579
methods in that case then you should
91

91

00:03:44,579  -->  00:03:47,639
probably consider writing in as a static
92

92

00:03:47,639  -->  00:03:50,099
method so generally speaking if you're
93

93

00:03:50,099  -->  00:03:52,349
not using any fields or instance methods
94

94

00:03:52,349  -->  00:03:55,019
with the new proposed method instead of
95

95

00:03:55,019  -->  00:03:56,699
making that method static instead of a
96

96

00:03:56,699  -->  00:03:58,799
regular instance method so that's the
97

97

00:03:58,799  -->  00:04:00,870
main differences between static instance
98

98

00:04:00,870  -->  00:04:02,879
methods let's now move on to the next
99

99

00:04:02,879  -->  00:04:04,769
video we're going to talk a bit more
100

100

00:04:04,769  -->  00:04:06,959
about static is tomm static and instance
101

101

00:04:06,959  -->  00:04:11,180
variables see you in the next video.
