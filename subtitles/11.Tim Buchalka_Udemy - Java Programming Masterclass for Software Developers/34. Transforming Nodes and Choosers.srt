1

00:00:05,310  -->  00:00:07,000
alright so let's now start taking a look
2

2

00:00:07,060  -->  00:00:10,480
at transforming nodes now javafx allows
alright so let's now start taking a look
3

3

00:00:10,480  -->  00:00:12,700
us to transform nodes in the scene graph
at transforming nodes now javafx allows
4

4

00:00:12,700  -->  00:00:14,470
which means we can do things like we're
us to transform nodes in the scene graph
5

5

00:00:14,470  -->  00:00:15,310
take them
which means we can do things like we're
6

6

00:00:15,310  -->  00:00:17,470
zoom in on them animate them and also
take them
7

7

00:00:17,470  -->  00:00:19,330
apply other effects
zoom in on them animate them and also
8

8

00:00:19,330  -->  00:00:21,970
let's start by adding a label to our ui so
apply other effects
9

9

00:00:21,970  -->  00:00:25,120
go back to a sample . fXML file so gonna
let's start by adding a label to our ui so
10

10

00:00:25,120  -->  00:00:26,650
add that below the radio button we
go back to a sample . fXML file so gonna
11

11

00:00:26,650  -->  00:00:32,290
added so its going to label....
add that below the radio button we
12

12

00:00:32,290  -->  00:00:38,760
...
added so its going to label....
13

13

00:00:38,760  -->  00:00:47,190
...
...
14

14

00:00:47,190  -->  00:00:51,330
...just to confirm
...
15

15

00:00:51,330  -->  00:00:52,650
will run it to make sure the label
...just to confirm
16

16

00:00:52,650  -->  00:00:57,450
showing alright there's our label showing java
will run it to make sure the label
17

17

00:00:57,450  -->  00:01:00,850
fx effects bit of a mouthful so close
showing alright there's our label showing java
18

18

00:01:00,850  -->  00:01:03,870
it down and let's now zoom in on that
fx effects bit of a mouthful so close
19

19

00:01:03,870  -->  00:01:06,420
label by calling the labels set scale X
it down and let's now zoom in on that
20

20

00:01:06,420  -->  00:01:09,820
and set scale y methods we're going to
label by calling the labels set scale X
21

21

00:01:09,820  -->  00:01:12,880
add an ID to the labels so we can do
and set scale y methods we're going to
22

22

00:01:12,880  -->  00:01:14,920
that so label text equals javafx
add an ID to the labels so we can do
23

23

00:01:14,920  -->  00:01:18,310
elements and it's going to be...
that so label text equals javafx
24

24

00:01:18,310  -->  00:01:24,430
....go to our
elements and it's going to be...
25

25

00:01:24,430  -->  00:01:26,800
controller dot java file and we need to
....go to our
26

26

00:01:26,800  -->  00:01:28,870
first create an instance or add an instance
controller dot java file and we need to
27

27

00:01:28,870  -->  00:01:31,540
variable for the label so...
first create an instance or add an instance
28

28

00:01:31,540  -->  00:01:35,620
....
variable for the label so...
29

29

00:01:35,620  -->  00:01:41,260
...
....
30

30

00:01:41,260  -->  00:01:50,740
...
...
31

31

00:01:50,740  -->  00:01:57,130
....
...
32

32

00:01:57,130  -->  00:02:02,500
...
....
33

33

00:02:02,500  -->  00:02:07,300
...
...
34

34

00:02:07,300  -->  00:02:08,950
let's just run this to confirm this work
...
35

35

00:02:08,950  -->  00:02:13,860
that it does work there it is all
let's just run this to confirm this work
36

36

00:02:13,860  -->  00:02:16,510
be it not fitting where it was before
that it does work there it is all
37

37

00:02:16,510  -->  00:02:18,930
but it's definitely zoomed-in now so
be it not fitting where it was before
38

38

00:02:18,930  -->  00:02:20,320
typically wouldn't do that when the
but it's definitely zoomed-in now so
39

39

00:02:20,320  -->  00:02:22,350
application first runs well actually
typically wouldn't do that when the
40

40

00:02:22,350  -->  00:02:24,540
zoom in and out in response to some user
application first runs well actually
41

41

00:02:24,540  -->  00:02:26,740
interaction for example we might want to
zoom in and out in response to some user
42

42

00:02:26,740  -->  00:02:28,540
zoom in when the user roles their mouse
interaction for example we might want to
43

43

00:02:28,540  -->  00:02:30,660
button while the cursor is over the
zoom in when the user roles their mouse
44

44

00:02:30,660  -->  00:02:32,350
label or perhaps when the user hovers
button while the cursor is over the
45

45

00:02:32,350  -->  00:02:34,410
over the label let's actually do the
label or perhaps when the user hovers
46

46

00:02:34,410  -->  00:02:36,990
later so when the user hovers over the
over the label let's actually do the
47

47

00:02:36,990  -->  00:02:39,490
label we scale it up so that do that we
later so when the user hovers over the
48

48

00:02:39,490  -->  00:02:41,740
need to add an event listener that
label we scale it up so that do that we
49

49

00:02:41,740  -->  00:02:43,860
listens form mouse enter and
need to add an event listener that
50

50

00:02:43,860  -->  00:02:46,410
mouse exit events when the cursor enters
listens form mouse enter and
51

51

00:02:46,410  -->  00:02:47,940
the label we're going to zoom in
mouse exit events when the cursor enters
52

52

00:02:47,940  -->  00:02:50,130
on it and when the cursor exits the
the label we're going to zoom in
53

53

00:02:50,130  -->  00:02:52,540
label zoom out so let's go and have a
on it and when the cursor exits the
54

54

00:02:52,540  -->  00:02:56,160
look at doing that so close down back to
label zoom out so let's go and have a
55

55

00:02:56,160  -->  00:02:58,630
the controller so will delete the
look at doing that so close down back to
56

56

00:02:58,630  -->  00:03:02,350
code of the initialize method and
the controller so will delete the
57

57

00:03:02,350  -->  00:03:05,190
instead we're going to do is create
code of the initialize method and
58

58

00:03:05,190  -->  00:03:08,770
these two events or event
instead we're going to do is create
59

59

00:03:08,770  -->  00:03:10,210
handlers to be more precise
these two events or event
60

60

00:03:10,210  -->  00:03:17,490
...
handlers to be more precise
61

61

00:03:17,490  -->  00:03:32,520
...
...
62

62

00:03:32,520  -->  00:03:35,940
..
...
63

63

00:03:35,940  -->  00:03:37,500
...
..
64

64

00:03:37,500  -->  00:03:51,270
...
...
65

65

00:03:51,270  -->  00:03:54,270
....so we've
...
66

66

00:03:54,270  -->  00:03:55,930
created event handlers we need to
....so we've
67

67

00:03:55,930  -->  00:03:58,110
associate those event handlers with the
created event handlers we need to
68

68

00:03:58,110  -->  00:04:00,360
label in our fxml file so let's go ahead
associate those event handlers with the
69

69

00:04:00,360  -->  00:04:03,520
and do that and with the way we can do
label in our fxml file so let's go ahead
70

70

00:04:03,520  -->  00:04:07,170
that is just to come down here and
and do that and with the way we can do
71

71

00:04:07,170  -->  00:04:12,030
put....
that is just to come down here and
72

72

00:04:12,030  -->  00:04:15,850
....
put....
73

73

00:04:15,850  -->  00:04:18,790
...
....
74

74

00:04:18,790  -->  00:04:24,670
...
...
75

75

00:04:24,670  -->  00:04:28,730
ok alright let's try this and see now
...
76

76

00:04:28,730  -->  00:04:33,530
if it's going to work so we got our default
ok alright let's try this and see now
77

77

00:04:33,530  -->  00:04:37,040
interface and if I hover over going
if it's going to work so we got our default
78

78

00:04:37,040  -->  00:04:39,610
into it zooms to double the
interface and if I hover over going
79

79

00:04:39,610  -->  00:04:42,050
size as soon as I leave and move outside
into it zooms to double the
80

80

00:04:42,050  -->  00:04:43,280
the area it actually goes back to the
size as soon as I leave and move outside
81

81

00:04:43,280  -->  00:04:44,950
regular size again pretty cool
the area it actually goes back to the
82

82

00:04:44,950  -->  00:04:48,200
now you might imagine doing this when
regular size again pretty cool
83

83

00:04:48,200  -->  00:04:50,390
the user can't see details when the UI is
now you might imagine doing this when
84

84

00:04:50,390  -->  00:04:52,550
in its default size and we want them to
the user can't see details when the UI is
85

85

00:04:52,550  -->  00:04:54,440
have to zoom into other areas of the UI
in its default size and we want them to
86

86

00:04:54,440  -->  00:04:57,530
that is of interest to them so apart of
have to zoom into other areas of the UI
87

87

00:04:57,530  -->  00:04:59,810
zooming like this javafx also allows us
that is of interest to them so apart of
88

88

00:04:59,810  -->  00:05:02,360
to rotate controls so lets actually try
zooming like this javafx also allows us
89

89

00:05:02,360  -->  00:05:05,780
rotating the label 90 degrees and one
to rotate controls so lets actually try
90

90

00:05:05,780  -->  00:05:10,940
way of doing that is back in the sample
rotating the label 90 degrees and one
91

91

00:05:10,940  -->  00:05:13,310
. fXML and we can come down here
way of doing that is back in the sample
92

92

00:05:13,310  -->  00:05:15,010
just start of the line and put rotate
. fXML and we can come down here
93

93

00:05:15,010  -->  00:05:19,160
equals...
just start of the line and put rotate
94

94

00:05:19,160  -->  00:05:22,850
...if you run that run
equals...
95

95

00:05:22,850  -->  00:05:26,890
it you can see where labels looking now
...if you run that run
96

96

00:05:26,890  -->  00:05:28,850
and this still works because the zoom
it you can see where labels looking now
97

97

00:05:28,850  -->  00:05:30,380
in and zoom obviously is smart enough to
and this still works because the zoom
98

98

00:05:30,380  -->  00:05:33,010
figure out that the text was rotated 90
in and zoom obviously is smart enough to
99

99

00:05:33,010  -->  00:05:34,760
degrees and rotate it in place
figure out that the text was rotated 90
100

100

00:05:34,760  -->  00:05:37,190
alright so moving on let's try adding a
degrees and rotate it in place
101

101

00:05:37,190  -->  00:05:40,100
drop shadow to one of our buttons now
alright so moving on let's try adding a
102

102

00:05:40,100  -->  00:05:41,360
we're going to do this using code
drop shadow to one of our buttons now
103

103

00:05:41,360  -->  00:05:44,000
because fxml support for effects is
we're going to do this using code
104

104

00:05:44,000  -->  00:05:45,700
sketchy as at the time that i'm
because fxml support for effects is
105

105

00:05:45,700  -->  00:05:48,290
recording these videos now we can define
sketchy as at the time that i'm
106

106

00:05:48,290  -->  00:05:49,910
a couple of the available effects in the
recording these videos now we can define
107

107

00:05:49,910  -->  00:05:53,380
FXML using CSS but unfortunately not all
a couple of the available effects in the
108

108

00:05:53,380  -->  00:05:55,630
of them so going to use the set effect
FXML using CSS but unfortunately not all
109

109

00:05:55,630  -->  00:05:57,730
method here to set a drop shadow on the
of them so going to use the set effect
110

110

00:05:57,730  -->  00:05:59,510
button and we're going to do that in the
method here to set a drop shadow on the
111

111

00:05:59,510  -->  00:06:02,030
controller's initialized method we have
button and we're going to do that in the
112

112

00:06:02,030  -->  00:06:04,450
to declare an instance variable for the
controller's initialized method we have
113

113

00:06:04,450  -->  00:06:06,070
button in the controller first let's go
to declare an instance variable for the
114

114

00:06:06,070  -->  00:06:12,030
back and do that
button in the controller first let's go
115

115

00:06:12,030  -->  00:06:14,450
so we need a button it's going to be...
back and do that
116

116

00:06:14,450  -->  00:06:17,040
...
so we need a button it's going to be...
117

117

00:06:17,040  -->  00:06:22,260
...
...
118

118

00:06:22,260  -->  00:06:24,810
....
...
119

119

00:06:24,810  -->  00:06:26,630
...
....
120

120

00:06:26,630  -->  00:06:55,010
...
...
121

121

00:06:55,010  -->  00:06:57,260
alright so now when we run this we
...
122

122

00:06:57,260  -->  00:06:59,040
should see our button 4 has got a
alright so now when we run this we
123

123

00:06:59,040  -->  00:07:04,470
drop shadow you can see the drop shadow
should see our button 4 has got a
124

124

00:07:04,470  -->  00:07:07,470
around button 4 now if you want to
drop shadow you can see the drop shadow
125

125

00:07:07,470  -->  00:07:09,630
you can change the radius color and
around button 4 now if you want to
126

126

00:07:09,630  -->  00:07:11,570
other properties of the drop shadow by
you can change the radius color and
127

127

00:07:11,570  -->  00:07:13,380
setting its properties so quite a
other properties of the drop shadow by
128

128

00:07:13,380  -->  00:07:15,290
a deal of
setting its properties so quite a
129

129

00:07:15,290  -->  00:07:16,730
flexibility there doing things a
a deal of
130

130

00:07:16,730  -->  00:07:18,810
along those lines alright so that's
flexibility there doing things a
131

131

00:07:18,810  -->  00:07:20,940
obviously only a very quick introduction
along those lines alright so that's
132

132

00:07:20,940  -->  00:07:22,860
to transforming nodes to see all the
obviously only a very quick introduction
133

133

00:07:22,860  -->  00:07:25,230
effects you can go to this link that i'm
to transforming nodes to see all the
134

134

00:07:25,230  -->  00:07:28,500
going to take you to the browser now we
effects you can go to this link that i'm
135

135

00:07:28,500  -->  00:07:33,090
have it their it's got lots more details
going to take you to the browser now we
136

136

00:07:33,090  -->  00:07:35,160
about the various effects that you
have it their it's got lots more details
137

137

00:07:35,160  -->  00:07:39,360
can actually implement in your apps for
about the various effects that you
138

138

00:07:39,360  -->  00:07:40,640
example i'm going to select one and have
can actually implement in your apps for
139

139

00:07:40,640  -->  00:07:42,950
a look it gives you an example code as
example i'm going to select one and have
140

140

00:07:42,950  -->  00:07:44,630
well to we'll see how to do things this
a look it gives you an example code as
141

141

00:07:44,630  -->  00:07:46,470
case a high-level effect that makes
well to we'll see how to do things this
142

142

00:07:46,470  -->  00:07:47,880
broader portions of the input image
case a high-level effect that makes
143

143

00:07:47,880  -->  00:07:49,790
appear to glow based on a configurable
broader portions of the input image
144

144

00:07:49,790  -->  00:07:50,910
threshold
appear to glow based on a configurable
145

145

00:07:50,910  -->  00:07:53,310
alright let's get back to IntelliJ
threshold
146

146

00:07:53,310  -->  00:07:56,130
continue our look at some other features
alright let's get back to IntelliJ
147

147

00:07:56,130  -->  00:07:59,390
of the javafx we're going to start
continue our look at some other features
148

148

00:07:59,390  -->  00:08:02,130
looking at the file chooser class now
of the javafx we're going to start
149

149

00:08:02,130  -->  00:08:04,530
it's a very rare client application that
looking at the file chooser class now
150

150

00:08:04,530  -->  00:08:06,780
doesn't offer some type of open and save
it's a very rare client application that
151

151

00:08:06,780  -->  00:08:07,820
functionality
doesn't offer some type of open and save
152

152

00:08:07,820  -->  00:08:09,890
now fortunately the file chooser class
functionality
153

153

00:08:09,890  -->  00:08:11,820
means we don't have to reinvent the
now fortunately the file chooser class
154

154

00:08:11,820  -->  00:08:13,530
wheel and write these open and save
means we don't have to reinvent the
155

155

00:08:13,530  -->  00:08:15,780
dialogues that's because the file
wheel and write these open and save
156

156

00:08:15,780  -->  00:08:17,190
chooser class does everything we'll
dialogues that's because the file
157

157

00:08:17,190  -->  00:08:19,410
need and in addition it can be
chooser class does everything we'll
158

158

00:08:19,410  -->  00:08:21,950
customized it doesn't descend from the
need and in addition it can be
159

159

00:08:21,950  -->  00:08:23,420
node class
customized it doesn't descend from the
160

160

00:08:23,420  -->  00:08:26,390
so can't be added to the scene graph in
node class
161

161

00:08:26,390  -->  00:08:28,910
other words we can add it to layout but
so can't be added to the scene graph in
162

162

00:08:28,910  -->  00:08:30,890
that's okay because the file chooser ui
other words we can add it to layout but
163

163

00:08:30,890  -->  00:08:32,810
does everything we want hopefully
that's okay because the file chooser ui
164

164

00:08:32,810  -->  00:08:35,000
does everything that we want
does everything we want hopefully
165

165

00:08:35,000  -->  00:08:36,880
there's no need to embed it in a window
does everything that we want
166

166

00:08:36,880  -->  00:08:38,450
with other UI elements is the point I'm
there's no need to embed it in a window
167

167

00:08:38,450  -->  00:08:40,390
getting here getting at here
with other UI elements is the point I'm
168

168

00:08:40,390  -->  00:08:42,010
alright so let's actually try changing
getting here getting at here
169

169

00:08:42,010  -->  00:08:44,840
buttons 1 text first go back to the sample
alright so let's actually try changing
170

170

00:08:44,840  -->  00:08:47,750
. fXML button1 going to change the text
buttons 1 text first go back to the sample
171

171

00:08:47,750  -->  00:08:50,060
there instead of saying button...
. fXML button1 going to change the text
172

172

00:08:50,060  -->  00:08:52,520
...
there instead of saying button...
173

173

00:08:52,520  -->  00:09:14,480
...
...
174

174

00:09:14,480  -->  00:09:21,110
....
...
175

175

00:09:21,110  -->  00:09:27,860
...
....
176

176

00:09:27,860  -->  00:09:29,000
what we're going to do is we're going to call
...
177

177

00:09:29,000  -->  00:09:31,130
this show open dialogue method which
what we're going to do is we're going to call
178

178

00:09:31,130  -->  00:09:34,070
opens the show shows or shows the file chooser in open
this show open dialogue method which
179

179

00:09:34,070  -->  00:09:36,350
mode but to do that we have to pass in a
opens the show shows or shows the file chooser in open
180

180

00:09:36,350  -->  00:09:39,620
parent window for the file chooser so
mode but to do that we have to pass in a
181

181

00:09:39,620  -->  00:09:41,060
what we have to do is go back to our
parent window for the file chooser so
182

182

00:09:41,060  -->  00:09:44,030
simple . fXML we need to assign a
what we have to do is go back to our
183

183

00:09:44,030  -->  00:09:46,460
fx ID to our grid pane so that
simple . fXML we need to assign a
184

184

00:09:46,460  -->  00:09:47,990
we can achieve so coming back
fx ID to our grid pane so that
185

185

00:09:47,990  -->  00:09:50,960
up here to our grid pane...
we can achieve so coming back
186

186

00:09:50,960  -->  00:09:54,170
....
up here to our grid pane...
187

187

00:09:54,170  -->  00:09:57,020
...go back to our
....
188

188

00:09:57,020  -->  00:10:00,230
controller what we need to do add a
...go back to our
189

189

00:10:00,230  -->  00:10:02,540
listener to the grid pane so...
controller what we need to do add a
190

190

00:10:02,540  -->  00:10:04,610
...
listener to the grid pane so...
191

191

00:10:04,610  -->  00:10:28,490
...
...
192

192

00:10:28,490  -->  00:10:30,080
..
...
193

193

00:10:30,080  -->  00:10:33,860
so let's actually do that and we run
..
194

194

00:10:33,860  -->  00:10:35,150
it will just show you what this null
so let's actually do that and we run
195

195

00:10:35,150  -->  00:10:36,160
does
it will just show you what this null
196

196

00:10:36,160  -->  00:10:39,730
so firstly if we click on the Open
does
197

197

00:10:39,730  -->  00:10:43,620
button here our file chooser does open
so firstly if we click on the Open
198

198

00:10:43,620  -->  00:10:50,140
but if we click on the main window we
button here our file chooser does open
199

199

00:10:50,140  -->  00:10:51,730
can still interact with it
but if we click on the main window we
200

200

00:10:51,730  -->  00:10:55,030
in fact we can click on again and open a
can still interact with it
201

201

00:10:55,030  -->  00:10:57,580
second dialog boxes as you can see here and
in fact we can click on again and open a
202

202

00:10:57,580  -->  00:11:02,920
you can even close the main window and
second dialog boxes as you can see here and
203

203

00:11:02,920  -->  00:11:04,960
the file chooser remains up an overall
you can even close the main window and
204

204

00:11:04,960  -->  00:11:06,460
or both of them in this case which I'll just
the file chooser remains up an overall
205

205

00:11:06,460  -->  00:11:08,830
cancel out there and clearly that's not
or both of them in this case which I'll just
206

206

00:11:08,830  -->  00:11:10,330
something that we want its not a
cancel out there and clearly that's not
207

207

00:11:10,330  -->  00:11:12,310
good way to create an application that
something that we want its not a
208

208

00:11:12,310  -->  00:11:15,040
does that what we want the file chooser
good way to create an application that
209

209

00:11:15,040  -->  00:11:18,040
to do or to be modal so that the user has
does that what we want the file chooser
210

210

00:11:18,040  -->  00:11:20,500
to navigate to a file or cancel the
to do or to be modal so that the user has
211

211

00:11:20,500  -->  00:11:22,390
dialogue before they can interact with
to navigate to a file or cancel the
212

212

00:11:22,390  -->  00:11:24,340
the main window again so that's the
dialogue before they can interact with
213

213

00:11:24,340  -->  00:11:26,430
reason that we're passing the main
the main window again so that's the
214

214

00:11:26,430  -->  00:11:29,080
window as the parent and by doing that
reason that we're passing the main
215

215

00:11:29,080  -->  00:11:30,280
we should actually get the behavior we
window as the parent and by doing that
216

216

00:11:30,280  -->  00:11:31,500
want here so if we go back to the
we should actually get the behavior we
217

217

00:11:31,500  -->  00:11:34,500
controller we changed null now we
want here so if we go back to the
218

218

00:11:34,500  -->  00:11:37,810
change that...
controller we changed null now we
219

219

00:11:37,810  -->  00:11:43,660
...so run this app
change that...
220

220

00:11:43,660  -->  00:11:54,580
again click open theirs our dialog box and notice
...so run this app
221

221

00:11:54,580  -->  00:11:56,530
when I'm clicking on that i'm clicking but I
again click open theirs our dialog box and notice
222

222

00:11:56,530  -->  00:11:59,380
can't get access to it I can't move this at all
when I'm clicking on that i'm clicking but I
223

223

00:11:59,380  -->  00:12:00,880
it's actually completely modal so we
can't get access to it I can't move this at all
224

224

00:12:00,880  -->  00:12:02,170
have to actually make an operation
it's actually completely modal so we
225

225

00:12:02,170  -->  00:12:04,420
select a file or alternatively click on
have to actually make an operation
226

226

00:12:04,420  -->  00:12:06,790
cancel to go back to the window again so
select a file or alternatively click on
227

227

00:12:06,790  -->  00:12:08,310
we can only open one file chooser as
cancel to go back to the window again so
228

228

00:12:08,310  -->  00:12:12,880
well and noticing also that the close
we can only open one file chooser as
229

229

00:12:12,880  -->  00:12:16,540
button was deactivated on the main hello
well and noticing also that the close
230

230

00:12:16,540  -->  00:12:18,490
world window we can't literally do
button was deactivated on the main hello
231

231

00:12:18,490  -->  00:12:19,630
anything there until we've actually
world window we can't literally do
232

232

00:12:19,630  -->  00:12:21,280
made a decision or done something with
anything there until we've actually
233

233

00:12:21,280  -->  00:12:26,310
the file chooser alright so by default
made a decision or done something with
234

234

00:12:26,310  -->  00:12:28,630
the file chooser initially choose shows
the file chooser alright so by default
235

235

00:12:28,630  -->  00:12:30,180
the default file system view of the
the file chooser initially choose shows
236

236

00:12:30,180  -->  00:12:31,480
operating system that's running on
the default file system view of the
237

237

00:12:31,480  -->  00:12:33,790
instead we want to show the last
operating system that's running on
238

238

00:12:33,790  -->  00:12:35,650
directory the user save to or a directory
instead we want to show the last
239

239

00:12:35,650  -->  00:12:37,680
that they specified perhaps in the
directory the user save to or a directory
240

240

00:12:37,680  -->  00:12:40,300
application settings so to have the file
that they specified perhaps in the
241

241

00:12:40,300  -->  00:12:41,740
chooser initially open to a specific
application settings so to have the file
242

242

00:12:41,740  -->  00:12:44,250
directory we can use the set initial
chooser initially open to a specific
243

243

00:12:44,250  -->  00:12:45,850
directory method
directory we can use the set initial
244

244

00:12:45,850  -->  00:12:48,100
alright so let's run again and open the
directory method
245

245

00:12:48,100  -->  00:12:50,020
file chooser but this time lets select a
alright so let's run again and open the
246

246

00:12:50,020  -->  00:12:52,180
directory instead of a file so i'm going
file chooser but this time lets select a
247

247

00:12:52,180  -->  00:12:58,430
to run it again
directory instead of a file so i'm going
248

248

00:12:58,430  -->  00:13:01,940
open
to run it again
249

249

00:13:01,940  -->  00:13:03,560
we're gonna go to folder where I stored
open
250

250

00:13:03,560  -->  00:13:06,320
some of the projects for this course
we're gonna go to folder where I stored
251

251

00:13:06,320  -->  00:13:08,540
let's have selected this source code
some of the projects for this course
252

252

00:13:08,540  -->  00:13:12,860
folder click on open notice I couldn't
let's have selected this source code
253

253

00:13:12,860  -->  00:13:13,550
do that
folder click on open notice I couldn't
254

254

00:13:13,550  -->  00:13:15,050
so when I did that when I selected the
do that
255

255

00:13:15,050  -->  00:13:17,480
directory and actually and click on open
so when I did that when I selected the
256

256

00:13:17,480  -->  00:13:19,520
it actually open the folder rather than
directory and actually and click on open
257

257

00:13:19,520  -->  00:13:20,960
allowing is to actually select the
it actually open the folder rather than
258

258

00:13:20,960  -->  00:13:22,460
directory of that we actually or
allowing is to actually select the
259

259

00:13:22,460  -->  00:13:24,170
folder that we wanted to in this
directory of that we actually or
260

260

00:13:24,170  -->  00:13:26,630
scenario so in other words sometimes we
folder that we wanted to in this
261

261

00:13:26,630  -->  00:13:28,670
want the user to be able to choose a
scenario so in other words sometimes we
262

262

00:13:28,670  -->  00:13:31,010
directory and not file so if we do want to
want the user to be able to choose a
263

263

00:13:31,010  -->  00:13:32,930
choose a directory we need to use the
directory and not file so if we do want to
264

264

00:13:32,930  -->  00:13:34,580
directory chooser instead because we're
choose a directory we need to use the
265

265

00:13:34,580  -->  00:13:36,440
using the file chooser at the moment again
directory chooser instead because we're
266

266

00:13:36,440  -->  00:13:37,790
just to confirm that file chooser is
using the file chooser at the moment again
267

267

00:13:37,790  -->  00:13:39,950
working i can select a file their
just to confirm that file chooser is
268

268

00:13:39,950  -->  00:13:42,830
click on open it does return back to the
working i can select a file their
269

269

00:13:42,830  -->  00:13:46,070
main dialogue so if we want to do a
click on open it does return back to the
270

270

00:13:46,070  -->  00:13:48,650
directory there instead of a file and
main dialogue so if we want to do a
271

271

00:13:48,650  -->  00:13:49,970
what we need to do is use directory
directory there instead of a file and
272

272

00:13:49,970  -->  00:13:52,190
chooser as i mentioned and just to see
what we need to do is use directory
273

273

00:13:52,190  -->  00:13:53,780
how it works lets actually try adding
chooser as i mentioned and just to see
274

274

00:13:53,780  -->  00:13:57,590
that....
how it works lets actually try adding
275

275

00:13:57,590  -->  00:14:00,860
....
that....
276

276

00:14:00,860  -->  00:14:04,640
alright so this ones a bit different we
....
277

277

00:14:04,640  -->  00:14:06,740
need to actually use a....
alright so this ones a bit different we
278

278

00:14:06,740  -->  00:14:11,000
we run that again we should find there
need to actually use a....
279

279

00:14:11,000  -->  00:14:18,020
we can choose a directory so open go
we run that again we should find there
280

280

00:14:18,020  -->  00:14:19,610
back up one level to my source code
we can choose a directory so open go
281

281

00:14:19,610  -->  00:14:21,140
folder now I can click on source
back up one level to my source code
282

282

00:14:21,140  -->  00:14:23,480
code click on open and notice this time
folder now I can click on source
283

283

00:14:23,480  -->  00:14:26,420
it's now chosen the actual directory
code click on open and notice this time
284

284

00:14:26,420  -->  00:14:28,310
instead of opening like it did last time
it's now chosen the actual directory
285

285

00:14:28,310  -->  00:14:33,020
that's directory chooser and
instead of opening like it did last time
286

286

00:14:33,020  -->  00:14:35,690
incidentally same deal there it expects
that's directory chooser and
287

287

00:14:35,690  -->  00:14:37,400
the only window to be passed to it and
incidentally same deal there it expects
288

288

00:14:37,400  -->  00:14:38,600
that's why we were able to use the
the only window to be passed to it and
289

289

00:14:38,600  -->  00:14:41,120
exact same command the same parameter
that's why we were able to use the
290

290

00:14:41,120  -->  00:14:44,540
...and just
exact same command the same parameter
291

291

00:14:44,540  -->  00:14:45,950
to confirm that's working lets actually
...and just
292

292

00:14:45,950  -->  00:14:47,540
add a bit more code here....
to confirm that's working lets actually
293

293

00:14:47,540  -->  00:14:53,150
...
add a bit more code here....
294

294

00:14:53,150  -->  00:15:09,210
...
...
295

295

00:15:09,210  -->  00:15:11,430
..
...
296

296

00:15:11,430  -->  00:15:17,130
...
..
297

297

00:15:17,130  -->  00:15:21,870
...
...
298

298

00:15:21,870  -->  00:15:25,200
let's try running that to see whether we
...
299

299

00:15:25,200  -->  00:15:32,550
do get a response so we run open firstly if I
let's try running that to see whether we
300

300

00:15:32,550  -->  00:15:36,600
cancel chooser was cancelled open
do get a response so we run open firstly if I
301

301

00:15:36,600  -->  00:15:37,590
again this time we're going to select
cancel chooser was cancelled open
302

302

00:15:37,590  -->  00:15:41,430
a folder the source code open you can see
again this time we're going to select
303

303

00:15:41,430  -->  00:15:43,860
we get the folder name here I get the
a folder the source code open you can see
304

304

00:15:43,860  -->  00:15:45,570
full path back from the directory that
we get the folder name here I get the
305

305

00:15:45,570  -->  00:15:49,290
was chosen pretty cool so
full path back from the directory that
306

306

00:15:49,290  -->  00:15:51,660
open it again though you may have
was chosen pretty cool so
307

307

00:15:51,660  -->  00:15:54,690
noticed if we open the folder we seeing
open it again though you may have
308

308

00:15:54,690  -->  00:15:57,060
that only thing we can actually select
noticed if we open the folder we seeing
309

309

00:15:57,060  -->  00:15:59,160
here are folders you can see these other
that only thing we can actually select
310

310

00:15:59,160  -->  00:16:01,290
files but they aren't selectable and
here are folders you can see these other
311

311

00:16:01,290  -->  00:16:02,760
depending on your operating system you
files but they aren't selectable and
312

312

00:16:02,760  -->  00:16:05,220
may not even see the files at all but on
depending on your operating system you
313

313

00:16:05,220  -->  00:16:06,720
a Mac we can still see the files but
may not even see the files at all but on
314

314

00:16:06,720  -->  00:16:08,910
with only got the ability to select
a Mac we can still see the files but
315

315

00:16:08,910  -->  00:16:12,930
folders and depending on your
with only got the ability to select
316

316

00:16:12,930  -->  00:16:15,000
operating system as well you might find
folders and depending on your
317

317

00:16:15,000  -->  00:16:17,340
it down here where it's got open it
operating system as well you might find
318

318

00:16:17,340  -->  00:16:19,290
might have the text select folder in the
it down here where it's got open it
319

319

00:16:19,290  -->  00:16:21,480
case of a mac though it still shows as
might have the text select folder in the
320

320

00:16:21,480  -->  00:16:24,360
open I'm gonna finish the video
case of a mac though it still shows as
321

321

00:16:24,360  -->  00:16:26,820
here now when we get back here to this
open I'm gonna finish the video
322

322

00:16:26,820  -->  00:16:28,650
in the next video we're going to start
here now when we get back here to this
323

323

00:16:28,650  -->  00:16:31,740
looking at at the file chooser again and
in the next video we're going to start
324

324

00:16:31,740  -->  00:16:32,730
would talk about something called
looking at at the file chooser again and
325

325

00:16:32,730  -->  00:16:35,070
extension filters so see you in the next
would talk about something called
326

326

00:16:35,070  -->  00:16:40,460
video
extension filters so see you in the next
