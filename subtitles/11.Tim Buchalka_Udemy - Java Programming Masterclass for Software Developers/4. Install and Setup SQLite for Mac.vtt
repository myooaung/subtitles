00:00:04.980  -->  00:00:07.050
so in this video we're going to see how to
2

2

00:00:07.050  -->  00:00:09.500
run the sqlite command line shell on
3

3

00:00:09.500  -->  00:00:12.210
a mac if you're using Windows refer to
4

4

00:00:12.210  -->  00:00:14.630
the previous video if you're using linux
5

5

00:00:14.630  -->  00:00:16.610
then actually refer to the video after
6

6

00:00:16.610  -->  00:00:18.510
this one where we actually set up for
7

7

00:00:18.510  -->  00:00:20.430
those relevant operating systems but if
8

8

00:00:20.430  -->  00:00:21.420
you're on a Mac you're in the right
9

9

00:00:21.420  -->  00:00:23.780
place so writing database code
10

10

00:00:23.780  -->  00:00:25.910
straightaway isn't the easiest way to
11

11

00:00:25.910  -->  00:00:27.530
learn about sqlite and the sql
12

12

00:00:27.530  -->  00:00:29.510
language if you get errors you have to
13

13

00:00:29.510  -->  00:00:30.770
work out then if the errors in your code
14

14

00:00:30.770  -->  00:00:32.930
or the sql statements that you've
15

15

00:00:32.930  -->  00:00:35.180
used so what we're going to do is we're
16

16

00:00:35.180  -->  00:00:36.570
going to start out by using the sqlite
17

17

00:00:36.570  -->  00:00:38.910
command line shell so that we can create
18

18

00:00:38.910  -->  00:00:40.640
databases and use sql commands
19

19

00:00:40.640  -->  00:00:43.440
directly now on a Mac turns out this is
20

20

00:00:43.440  -->  00:00:45.350
really really easy and that's because
21

21

00:00:45.350  -->  00:00:47.760
the sqlite command line shell is already
22

22

00:00:47.760  -->  00:00:49.550
installed on a mac so there's really
23

23

00:00:49.550  -->  00:00:51.120
nothing else we need to do to be able to
24

24

00:00:51.120  -->  00:00:52.980
get to be able to get that up
25

25

00:00:52.980  -->  00:00:54.840
and running so just to confirm that it
26

26

00:00:54.840  -->  00:00:55.760
is working
27

27

00:00:55.760  -->  00:00:57.840
open a terminal session and you can do
28

28

00:00:57.840  -->  00:00:59.690
that by holding a command pressing space
29

29

00:00:59.690  -->  00:01:03.260
that will open that screen up there and we
30

30

00:01:03.260  -->  00:01:07.230
type terminal press enter that
31

31

00:01:07.230  -->  00:01:09.240
loads the terminal screen and to test
32

32

00:01:09.240  -->  00:01:11.310
that we've got a sql lite that's
33

33

00:01:11.310  -->  00:01:13.260
sqlite is installed....
34

34

00:01:13.260  -->  00:01:17.130
...press ENTER and you
35

35

00:01:17.130  -->  00:01:18.270
can see that we've got some
36

36

00:01:18.270  -->  00:01:20.070
text showing on the screen there you can
37

37

00:01:20.070  -->  00:01:21.660
see that sqlite three is actually
38

38

00:01:21.660  -->  00:01:24.090
successfully installed now don't worry
39

39

00:01:24.090  -->  00:01:25.680
if you see slightly different version
40

40

00:01:25.680  -->  00:01:27.930
numbers there this program is updated
41

41

00:01:27.930  -->  00:01:30.150
from time to time but to so long as
42

42

00:01:30.150  -->  00:01:32.010
you actually can see that it has started
43

43

00:01:32.010  -->  00:01:33.660
a program and it looks like it's working
44

44

00:01:33.660  -->  00:01:35.310
then we're good to go
45

45

00:01:35.310  -->  00:01:36.900
so at this point we can quit out of this
46

46

00:01:36.900  -->  00:01:40.380
by typing . quite going to type
47

47

00:01:40.380  -->  00:01:42.120
exit to close down the command shell and
48

48

00:01:42.120  -->  00:01:43.320
that's going to close down the terminal
49

49

00:01:43.320  -->  00:01:46.920
window and at this point we're good to go
50

50

00:01:46.920  -->  00:01:49.260
so skip the next video unless for some
51

51

00:01:49.260  -->  00:01:51.240
reason you also want to install sqlite
52

52

00:01:51.240  -->  00:01:53.520
three on a linux machine and the
53

53

00:01:53.520  -->  00:01:55.320
video after that we then actually go ahead
54

54

00:01:55.320  -->  00:01:58.020
and start using sqlite so i'll see
55

55

00:01:58.020  -->  00:02:04.070
you in the next video
