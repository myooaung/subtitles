00:00:05,040  -->  00:00:06,710
<v Instructor>In this video we're going to download</v>
2

2

00:00:06,710  -->  00:00:09,030
and instal Amazon Corretto,
3

3

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:12,140
which is the Java Development Kit for the Windows platform.
4

4

00:00:12,140  -->  00:00:13,460
So first things first,
5

5

00:00:13,460  -->  00:00:16,653
we're gonna do a little search for Amazon Corretto.
6

6

00:00:17,590  -->  00:00:20,903
C-O-R-R-E-T-T-O.
7

7

00:00:22,010  -->  00:00:25,273
And click on the http://www.Amazon.com/Corretto link.
8

8

00:00:28,130  -->  00:00:29,100
And we're gonna come over here
9

9

00:00:29,100  -->  00:00:31,910
and click on Download Amazon Corretto 11,
10

10

00:00:31,910  -->  00:00:34,503
which is the JDK version 11.
11

11

00:00:36,150  -->  00:00:38,520
And once we get to here, we'll choose our platform.
12

12

00:00:38,520  -->  00:00:40,040
We're on Windows, so I'm gonna come over here
13

13

00:00:40,040  -->  00:00:42,120
and click on the MSI file,
14

14

00:00:42,120  -->  00:00:45,010
which is the executable installer file.
15

15

00:00:45,010  -->  00:00:47,970
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file if you want.
16

16

00:00:47,970  -->  00:00:49,860
There's probably no reason to do that.
17

17

00:00:49,860  -->  00:00:51,410
We're going to run the instal.
18

18

00:00:52,510  -->  00:00:54,900
And that'll finish off in this case downloading first,
19

19

00:00:54,900  -->  00:00:57,353
and then it's going to start with the installation.
20

20

00:00:59,200  -->  00:01:01,810
You can see that Windows is doing a security scan,
21

21

00:01:01,810  -->  00:01:02,910
we'll let that finish.
22

22

00:01:04,220  -->  00:01:06,530
All right, so it's starting the Setup Wizard now.
23

23

00:01:06,530  -->  00:01:08,300
We're gonna click on Next.
24

24

00:01:08,300  -->  00:01:09,680
Now noting that the folder that
25

25

00:01:09,680  -->  00:01:11,417
it's going to be installed in here,
26

26

00:01:11,417  -->  00:01:15,400
C:\Program Files\Amazon Corretto\
27

27

00:01:15,400  -->  00:01:17,250
That may be important in a future video,
28

28

00:01:17,250  -->  00:01:19,930
so you might want to keep a note of that folder.
29

29

00:01:19,930  -->  00:01:20,920
Also note that here,
30

30

00:01:20,920  -->  00:01:23,380
that it's going to set up our environment variables
31

31

00:01:23,380  -->  00:01:25,790
and registry keys for us which is nice.
32

32

00:01:25,790  -->  00:01:27,720
So that means that it's just something else
33

33

00:01:27,720  -->  00:01:29,870
we don't need to set up, which is good.
34

34

00:01:29,870  -->  00:01:32,290
Click on Next and click on Instal.
35

35

00:01:32,290  -->  00:01:35,200
And once this finishes, I'm just going to the command line.
36

36

00:01:35,200  -->  00:01:37,170
We'll just click on Yes to the little prompt
37

37

00:01:37,170  -->  00:01:39,590
that pops up about whether you want to allow this app
38

38

00:01:39,590  -->  00:01:41,390
to make changes to your device.
39

39

00:01:41,390  -->  00:01:42,820
So I click on Yes.
40

40

00:01:42,820  -->  00:01:44,620
And I let the installation complete.
41

41

00:01:46,990  -->  00:01:49,820
Click on Finish and the installation is now completed.
42

42

00:01:49,820  -->  00:01:51,980
And one final step is just to come down
43

43

00:01:51,980  -->  00:01:54,870
to the Start window for Windows here,
44

44

00:01:54,870  -->  00:01:57,283
click on Command, C-M-D, or type in Command,
45

45

00:01:58,470  -->  00:02:01,290
and we're gonna type in: java -version
46

46

00:02:03,330  -->  00:02:04,810
And noting that we've now got some output,
47

47

00:02:04,810  -->  00:02:08,880
it says: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto.
48

48

00:02:08,880  -->  00:02:11,030
So that confirms that the installation
49

49

00:02:11,030  -->  00:02:12,330
has been successfully installed,
50

50

00:02:12,330  -->  00:02:14,080
and then the Java Development Kit
51

51

00:02:14,080  -->  00:02:16,550
is now installed on the computer.
52

52

00:02:16,550  -->  00:02:18,660
All right, so now that's the installation
53

53

00:02:18,660  -->  00:02:23,003
of Amazon Corretto JDK for Windows version 11 completed.
