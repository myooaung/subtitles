00:00:05.500  -->  00:00:10.500
at the end of the last video we actually had some problems with our code we had the
2

2

00:00:10.500  -->  00:00:15.260
application crashing when we Press New
so to confirm we will just run this click on file
3

3

00:00:15.260  -->  00:00:20.670
new and we actually got an error before the dialog box came up so
4

4

00:00:20.670  -->  00:00:25.350
that we need to fix but also I just want
to take the time to fix this up notice
5

5

00:00:25.350  -->  00:00:30.260
this unused imports if you are in this situation where
you want those clean-up for you automatically
6

6

00:00:30.260  -->  00:00:37.950
going to preferences or settings and search for import and auto import is the one we
7

7

00:00:37.950  -->  00:00:42.090
want and you can click on optimizing
imports on the fly and add an ambiguous
8

8

00:00:42.090  -->  00:00:45.770
imports on the fly and that will
clean up some of these things for us
9

9

00:00:45.770  -->  00:00:49.660
automatically click on OK now anytime we do an import you should find that
10

10

00:00:49.660  -->  00:00:55.900
this are cleaned up so if we go back and delete something notice how that is clean
11

11

00:00:55.900  -->  00:00:59.660
up automatically so the next time it
looked at the code it's cleaned up so
12

12

00:00:59.660  -->  00:01:04.010
just can be a good way to add imports for
you automatically and the other thing
13

13

00:01:04.010  -->  00:01:09.830
was the an unambiguous imports is only one
import that matches that criteria its
14

14

00:01:09.830  -->  00:01:13.790
going to automatically add it without asking and that saves you a bit of time when your typing but if
15

15

00:01:13.790  -->  00:01:16.900
there's more than one it will still
ask you to choose which import
16

16

00:01:16.900  -->  00:01:21.330
you want so that's number one but number two is
that error we are getting will the error
17

17

00:01:21.330  -->  00:01:25.830
we are getting is because i wasn't really paying attention 2 things firstly before I come back here and talk about the dialogue
18

18

00:01:25.830  -->  00:01:31.500
controller if you look at the to do item
dialogue this is really a red flag here the
19

19

00:01:31.500  -->  00:01:36.790
fact and its actually saying cannot set
JavaFX scene control.txt field from field
20

20

00:01:36.790  -->  00:01:41.820
short description field and if you look in our dialogue controller we can see we got this import
21

21

00:01:41.820  -->  00:01:47.250
java.awt.* which is
everything in that package and that's a
22

22

00:01:47.250  -->  00:01:52.710
completely different GUI we shouldn't be having that
23

23

00:01:52.710  -->  00:01:58.500
import their at all so I wasn't paying attention
when I added it so delete that and
24

24

00:01:58.500  -->  00:02:02.350
notice now its gonna come up and ask the
imports again just delete that line and
25

25

00:02:06.590  -->  00:02:16.230
import so you can see two text field theirs text fields java.awt and text field.javafx so I wasn't paying attention and I selected the wrong one so choose the
26

26

00:02:16.230  -->  00:02:21.950
JavaFX one and likewise for the text
area do the same thing once we do that
27

27

00:02:22.920  -->  00:02:27.960
we got now the right fields and if we go back to our
to do item dialogue those errors
28

28

00:02:27.960  -->  00:02:33.670
then disappear as well so just something there if
you are getting a similar problem and you can't get it to work
29

29

00:02:33.670  -->  00:02:40.790
that's most likely what it is so now if we try and run it click on file new we
30

30

00:02:40.790  -->  00:02:45.440
get our dialogue box coming up again and let's try
typing something in so I'm gonna do something
31

31

00:02:45.440  -->  00:02:54.660
as a short description....
32

32

00:02:54.660  -->  00:03:01.490
....and the deadline lets select a date two days into the future
33

33

00:03:01.490  -->  00:03:05.570
so I'm recording this on may 9 so set it to may 11
34

34

00:03:06.590  -->  00:03:14.550
click on ok you can see ok was pressed down the left-hand
corner in the console output and our application hasn't
35

35

00:03:14.550  -->  00:03:18.580
crash which is a good thing what hasn't happen here in the left hand side
36

36

00:03:18.580  -->  00:03:25.340
the toolbar item doesn't appear in the list
view but if you close the application down and run it
37

37

00:03:25.340  -->  00:03:31.090
again we notice that the item does
appear so click on my new to do item
38

38

00:03:31.090  -->  00:03:36.060
may 11 which is correct and this is
a new to do item so it was saved but the
39

39

00:03:36.060  -->  00:03:41.310
item wasn't updated and shown in the list
view so in other words our list view doesn't
40

40

00:03:41.310  -->  00:03:45.330
automatically update at least not yet
now there is a way to have the list
41

41

00:03:45.330  -->  00:03:49.050
automatically update which will cover
later but for now what we gonna do is
42

42

00:03:49.050  -->  00:03:53.720
we need to explicitly add the item to the list
view and we have to do this in our main
43

43

00:03:53.720  -->  00:03:58.870
window controller so going to do it after
calling the process results method so lets
44

44

00:03:58.870  -->  00:04:04.260
go and do that we close down the program and
back to controller and close the run window
45

45

00:04:04.260  -->  00:04:12.220
after the controller.process results
what we want to do is we do it their so
46

46

00:04:12.220  -->  00:04:16.090
reset the list view data by setting this data to the updated list and that is going to
47

47

00:04:16.090  -->  00:04:17.700
be the quickest way to get this to work for now
48

48

00:04:17.700  -->  00:04:29.920
so we type in...
49

49

00:04:29.920  -->  00:04:38.350
...so its basically replace the contents with
50

50

00:04:38.350  -->  00:04:42.930
whatever is coming back from our data the singleton the list of all our to do
51

51

00:04:42.930  -->  00:04:49.930
items so now if we run it we should find that
it will actually work so we got our items
52

52

00:04:49.930  -->  00:04:58.940
in their but if we click and add a new on....
53

53

00:04:58.940  -->  00:05:02.430
likewise for the date it doesn't matter I'll
just make it friday the 13th click on ok
54

54

00:05:05.670  -->  00:05:10.210
now notice it was updated you can see tim's item did appear in the
left hand side of
55

55

00:05:10.210  -->  00:05:15.610
the interface and that's a good thing so
that's been updated but notice how it wasn't
56

56

00:05:15.610  -->  00:05:19.110
selected and we really should select the new item and probably what the
57

57

00:05:19.110  -->  00:05:22.460
user would expect to happen after you
save an item
58

58

00:05:22.460  -->  00:05:26.780
that item should be appearing on the screen and it
should be selected so in order for us to
59

59

00:05:26.780  -->  00:05:30.660
select a new item in the list view we need to
know about it in the main window's
60

60

00:05:30.660  -->  00:05:35.690
controller now we could get the items from the
to do data class and select the last one
61

61

00:05:35.690  -->  00:05:39.860
on the list but it's really safer to
have the process data method return
62

62

00:05:39.860  -->  00:05:43.850
the item that it created then we'll know
for sure that we are selecting the new item
63

63

00:05:43.850  -->  00:05:50.190
so lets update the process data method so it does what we want close this down
64

64

00:05:50.190  -->  00:05:55.450
go to our dialogue controller process
result you can see its currently a void
65

65

00:05:55.450  -->  00:06:03.360
so its not returning anything let's change that and change it to return a to do item....
66

66

00:06:03.360  -->  00:06:18.520
....
67

67

00:06:19.520  -->  00:06:33.210
...so we got our item in a separate line now on the next line to
68

68

00:06:33.210  -->  00:06:44.740
do...
69

69

00:06:44.740  -->  00:06:51.630
..ok so that's now returning the item
that was created and added to our
70

70

00:06:51.630  -->  00:06:54.630
singleton instance you can see they're
on line 32
71

71

00:06:55.650  -->  00:07:01.000
go back to our controller so we got the code in here that is doing a set all for
72

72

00:07:01.000  -->  00:07:06.020
the items we can use the get selection
model.select to select the new items
73

73

00:07:06.020  -->  00:07:11.490
so....
74

74

00:07:11.490  -->  00:07:19.250
....
75

75

00:07:19.250  -->  00:07:25.230
...
76

76

00:07:25.230  -->  00:07:30.830
....so we are updating the value
77

77

00:07:30.830  -->  00:07:35.770
that's or storing the values that is returned from the
process results method and ultimately we
78

78

00:07:35.770  -->  00:07:39.820
were using the Get selection model.select for that particular item that was
79

79

00:07:39.820  -->  00:07:44.200
added to our list view so now we are goinig to run it and try and add another item
80

80

00:07:44.200  -->  00:07:52.370
noting that our new items is also there so let's
add another one new.....
81

81

00:07:56.140  -->  00:08:07.670
...and you can see what happened their it was added an
82

82

00:08:07.670  -->  00:08:12.360
instantly selected on the screen so that is great so its now working so we are making
83

83

00:08:12.360  -->  00:08:19.240
progress but one thing if you click on new again we notice that the dialogue hasn't got a title
84

84

00:08:19.240  -->  00:08:22.990
the title bar itself is empty so let's add a title for it as well
85

85

00:08:24.490  -->  00:08:29.790
cancel out of that and close it down we can actually add title right at the top where
86

86

00:08:29.790  -->  00:08:36.590
we are initializing up here on
line 55 below that we can type...
87

87

00:08:36.590  -->  00:08:41.660
....
88

88

00:08:43.320  -->  00:08:55.550
...and run that to make sure that it works we've now got add new todo item as our title so
89

89

00:08:55.550  -->  00:09:01.330
we set the dialogue panes header text and just canceling out of that closing this down
90

90

00:09:01.330  -->  00:09:11.780
and looking at our to do the header text
here in the FXML so that is the dialogue pane
91

91

00:09:11.780  -->  00:09:15.400
header text but we can also set the dialogues header text so what's the difference
92

92

00:09:15.400  -->  00:09:20.230
between the two well let's set the
dialogues header text in addition to see
93

93

00:09:20.230  -->  00:09:23.480
what this looks like so we need to do
that in code as oppose to putting that
94

94

00:09:23.480  -->  00:09:30.410
in the XML so come back to controller and
just below the set title lets put....
95

95

00:09:30.410  -->  00:09:33.550
....
96

96

00:09:33.550  -->  00:09:46.330
...so now lets run that to see the difference
97

97

00:09:48.700  -->  00:09:56.320
....and notice where that descriptions or
that text appeared so the dialogues header text is
98

98

00:09:56.320  -->  00:09:59.320
separated from the dialogue content and is in a larger font
99

99

00:09:59.950  -->  00:10:04.590
and our dialogue header text is a much smaller fonts so we got two
options here and when we want to present
100

100

00:10:04.590  -->  00:10:08.870
information or instructions or other
information to the user so
101

101

00:10:08.870  -->  00:10:13.360
I'm going to finish the video here now in the next
video what we are gonna do is go ahead and start
102

102

00:10:13.360  -->  00:10:17.370
looking at changing the way we populate
the list view because the way that would
103

103

00:10:17.370  -->  00:10:21.090
be doing it so far isn't really
recommended but you know it does work
104

104

00:10:21.090  -->  00:10:25.480
but it's not the way we want to do it in a real world application so lets look at doing that in the next
105

105

00:10:25.480  -->  00:10:25.680
video
