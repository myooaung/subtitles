00:00:05.430  -->  00:00:07.160
<v Tim>So armed with the knowledge</v>
2

2

00:00:07.160  -->  00:00:08.710
that you've learned in the last video
3

3

00:00:08.710  -->  00:00:10.090
about naming conventions,
4

4

00:00:10.090  -->  00:00:11.883
your challenge here is as follows.
5

5

00:00:13.690  -->  00:00:15.130
Wanna do three things.
6

6

00:00:15.130  -->  00:00:18.010
Firstly, create a variable of type double
7

7

00:00:18.010  -->  00:00:20.110
to track the number of miles driven in a month
8

8

00:00:20.110  -->  00:00:22.480
by a company's sales representative.
9

9

00:00:22.480  -->  00:00:24.940
Number two, create a variable of type int
10

10

00:00:24.940  -->  00:00:26.280
to track the number of customers
11

11

00:00:26.280  -->  00:00:28.690
who visited a store in a day,
12

12

00:00:28.690  -->  00:00:31.130
and thirdly, create a variable to record
13

13

00:00:31.130  -->  00:00:33.660
the last key pressed in a game.
14

14

00:00:33.660  -->  00:00:35.250
So use the proper naming conventions
15

15

00:00:35.250  -->  00:00:38.710
discussed in the previous video for your variable names.
16

16

00:00:38.710  -->  00:00:40.370
Pause now and do that and come back
17

17

00:00:40.370  -->  00:00:42.220
when you're ready to see my solution.
18

18

00:00:44.330  -->  00:00:45.220
All right, so welcome back.
19

19

00:00:45.220  -->  00:00:46.720
So hopefully, you managed to do that.
20

20

00:00:46.720  -->  00:00:48.560
So let's go through my solution.
21

21

00:00:48.560  -->  00:00:49.890
So what I'm going to do is delete
22

22

00:00:49.890  -->  00:00:51.490
the existing example we had there.
23

23

00:00:51.490  -->  00:00:53.040
We no longer need that,
24

24

00:00:53.040  -->  00:00:57.080
and I'm gonna start by typing the answer to the first one,
25

25

00:00:57.080  -->  00:00:59.880 line:15% 
which was to track the number of miles driven in a month
26

26

00:00:59.880  -->  00:01:01.750 line:15% 
by a company's sales rep.
27

27

00:01:01.750  -->  00:01:03.820 line:15% 
Now there's a few options, obviously, with this.
28

28

00:01:03.820  -->  00:01:06.933
We could type double milesDriven if we want.
29

29

00:01:08.137  -->  00:01:10.290
Our milesDriven equals 1000d,
30

30

00:01:10.290  -->  00:01:12.850
and obviously, the value is irrelevant.
31

31

00:01:12.850  -->  00:01:14.480
Now you might've done something like instead
32

32

00:01:14.480  -->  00:01:15.430
salesRepMilesDriven
33

33

00:01:19.330  -->  00:01:23.493
or alternatively, you might've done repMilesDriven,
34

34

00:01:25.740  -->  00:01:26.990
and obviously there's a number of other ways
35

35

00:01:26.990  -->  00:01:28.630
you could've done it as well.
36

36

00:01:28.630  -->  00:01:29.500
All right, so that's the first one.
37

37

00:01:29.500  -->  00:01:30.780 line:15% 
The second one,
38

38

00:01:30.780  -->  00:01:33.280 line:15% 
we're needed to create a variable of type int
39

39

00:01:33.280  -->  00:01:34.630 line:15% 
to track the number of customers
40

40

00:01:34.630  -->  00:01:37.670 line:15% 
who visit a store in a particular day,
41

41

00:01:37.670  -->  00:01:38.670 line:15% 
so we could keep it simple
42

42

00:01:38.670  -->  00:01:42.750 line:15% 
and just do int customers equals 50,
43

43

00:01:42.750  -->  00:01:44.640
and again, the value's irrelevant,
44

44

00:01:44.640  -->  00:01:46.500
or you might've done something like
45

45

00:01:46.500  -->  00:01:49.520
calling dailyCustomers perhaps
46

46

00:01:49.520  -->  00:01:52.230
or even maybe storeDailyCustomers.
47

47

00:01:54.470  -->  00:01:57.420
All of those would be okay or something similar to that,
48

48

00:01:57.420  -->  00:01:59.040 line:15% 
and third one, if you recall,
49

49

00:01:59.040  -->  00:02:00.870 line:15% 
we needed to create a variable,
50

50

00:02:00.870  -->  00:02:02.320 line:15% 
which I didn't mention the type,
51

51

00:02:02.320  -->  00:02:05.630 line:15% 
and that was to record the last key pressed in a game.
52

52

00:02:05.630  -->  00:02:07.020 line:15% 
So you might do something like,
53

53

00:02:07.020  -->  00:02:08.880
if it's a key press, it's a single digit,
54

54

00:02:08.880  -->  00:02:10.690
maybe you've defined a char,
55

55

00:02:10.690  -->  00:02:12.830
but a String would've been acceptable as well.
56

56

00:02:12.830  -->  00:02:15.840
So lastKey might be one equals,
57

57

00:02:15.840  -->  00:02:18.410
and we'll just put an arbitrary value there d,
58

58

00:02:18.410  -->  00:02:21.310
or maybe you did something, instead of lastKey,
59

59

00:02:21.310  -->  00:02:22.840
maybe lastKeyPressed
60

60

00:02:25.480  -->  00:02:27.293
or maybe playerLastKeyPressed,
61

61

00:02:31.690  -->  00:02:32.730
and again, if you used a String
62

62

00:02:32.730  -->  00:02:34.300
instead of a char that I've used,
63

63

00:02:34.300  -->  00:02:37.230
that would've been perfectly acceptable as well.
64

64

00:02:37.230  -->  00:02:39.370
So in general, try and be a little bit concise
65

65

00:02:39.370  -->  00:02:40.410
with your variable names,
66

66

00:02:40.410  -->  00:02:42.200
but don't focus only on that.
67

67

00:02:42.200  -->  00:02:44.070
So if you need to use a few extra letters
68

68

00:02:44.070  -->  00:02:46.970
to name something to be clearer, then do it.
69

69

00:02:46.970  -->  00:02:48.430
So there is obviously a limit
70

70

00:02:48.430  -->  00:02:49.960
where it becomes impractical
71

71

00:02:49.960  -->  00:02:52.890
when you're defeating the purpose of making it easy to read.
72

72

00:02:52.890  -->  00:02:54.112
So if I said something like
73

73

00:02:54.112  -->  00:02:57.029
thePlayersLastKeyPressedInThisGame,
74

74

00:03:01.500  -->  00:03:03.080
I think you'd probably agree that's starting to get
75

75

00:03:03.080  -->  00:03:04.000
a little bit too long,
76

76

00:03:04.000  -->  00:03:05.800
and it's defeating the purpose
77

77

00:03:05.800  -->  00:03:08.210
of being able to sort of see a variable at a glance
78

78

00:03:08.210  -->  00:03:09.820
and know what it's for.
79

79

00:03:09.820  -->  00:03:11.230
The point I'm making here is unlikely
80

80

00:03:11.230  -->  00:03:14.170
that the extra words I've added in this particular example
81

81

00:03:14.170  -->  00:03:15.950
don't really make it any clearer
82

82

00:03:15.950  -->  00:03:18.425
as to the purpose of the variable.
83

83

00:03:18.425  -->  00:03:22.100
lastKeyPressed or lastKey or playerLastKeyPressed
84

84

00:03:22.100  -->  00:03:24.010
are probably sufficient.
85

85

00:03:24.010  -->  00:03:27.570
All right, I'll just delete this last bit of code there.
86

86

00:03:27.570  -->  00:03:29.230
Okay, so I'm gonna end the video here,
87

87

00:03:29.230  -->  00:03:31.510
and in the next one, we're going to do a quick recap
88

88

00:03:31.510  -->  00:03:32.940
of operator precedence
89

89

00:03:32.940  -->  00:03:34.690
but then get into another topic
90

90

00:03:34.690  -->  00:03:37.190
called operator associativity,
91

91

00:03:37.190  -->  00:03:38.890
so I'll see you in the next video.
