00:00:05.632  -->  00:00:06.520
<v Tim Buchalka>All right, so in this video</v>
2

2

00:00:06.520  -->  00:00:08.770
now that we've created our solution,
3

3

00:00:08.770  -->  00:00:10.790
we wanna actually start testing it
4

4

00:00:10.790  -->  00:00:14.690
in the coding exercises part of the Udemy interface.
5

5

00:00:14.690  -->  00:00:17.000
Now what I did at the end of the last video,
6

6

00:00:17.000  -->  00:00:18.700
and you recall that when we ran this,
7

7

00:00:18.700  -->  00:00:20.680
this was originally of type double,
8

8

00:00:20.680  -->  00:00:22.210
and I changed it to type long.
9

9

00:00:22.210  -->  00:00:25.420
So we run the output, we got the results.
10

10

00:00:25.420  -->  00:00:26.940
Now that was actually correct.
11

11

00:00:26.940  -->  00:00:29.050
It should be type long, but what I wanna do
12

12

00:00:29.050  -->  00:00:31.700
is change that back to double, because I wanna show you
13

13

00:00:31.700  -->  00:00:33.170
what happens when you do make a mistake
14

14

00:00:33.170  -->  00:00:36.130
and you don't follow the setup and the configuration
15

15

00:00:36.130  -->  00:00:37.823
of what the coding exercise is asking you.
16

16

00:00:37.823  -->  00:00:39.810
I wanna show you what happens, so we'll change that back
17

17

00:00:39.810  -->  00:00:41.790
to a double, which will still work.
18

18

00:00:41.790  -->  00:00:43.640
The code will still work with IntelliJ.
19

19

00:00:43.640  -->  00:00:46.100
And you can see we got the same result
20

20

00:00:46.100  -->  00:00:48.130
other than the fact we've got a period and a zero
21

21

00:00:48.130  -->  00:00:49.640
after the seven, and that's because
22

22

00:00:49.640  -->  00:00:53.620
it's now a floating point number instead of a whole number.
23

23

00:00:53.620  -->  00:00:55.820
We'll see what I mean by that as we go through.
24

24

00:00:55.820  -->  00:00:58.570
So what we wanna do now is go into our speed converter.
25

25

00:00:59.450  -->  00:01:00.610
And we're gonna close down the run window
26

26

00:01:00.610  -->  00:01:01.950
so we can see what we're doing here.
27

27

00:01:01.950  -->  00:01:04.940
Now you can convert, you can just copy the entire thing,
28

28

00:01:04.940  -->  00:01:09.410
like I'm just doing a control + A on Windows machine copy,
29

29

00:01:09.410  -->  00:01:13.010
control + C, or command + A, command + C on Mac.
30

30

00:01:13.010  -->  00:01:14.530
Now be careful if you're using packages.
31

31

00:01:14.530  -->  00:01:17.360
So if you've got something on line one that says package,
32

32

00:01:17.360  -->  00:01:18.650
you'd wanna miss that bit of code,
33

33

00:01:18.650  -->  00:01:20.020
but then make sure you're not using that,
34

34

00:01:20.020  -->  00:01:22.620
but if you've just got the code from public class
35

35

00:01:22.620  -->  00:01:25.640
right down to and including the last right curly brace,
36

36

00:01:25.640  -->  00:01:27.030
that should work fine.
37

37

00:01:27.030  -->  00:01:28.047
So I've taken a copy of that.
38

38

00:01:28.047  -->  00:01:29.890
I'm gonna swing back to Udemy.
39

39

00:01:29.890  -->  00:01:33.120
I'm gonna go back to the coding exercise that we looked at,
40

40

00:01:33.120  -->  00:01:36.410
and I asked you two videos ago to have open.
41

41

00:01:36.410  -->  00:01:38.750
So if not, make sure you open the speed converter
42

42

00:01:38.750  -->  00:01:39.650
coding exercise on Udemy.
43

43

00:01:39.650  -->  00:01:41.760
And you can see the example with that here
44

44

00:01:41.760  -->  00:01:44.440
that it starts with public class as well.
45

45

00:01:44.440  -->  00:01:47.670
So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna paste that code.
46

46

00:01:47.670  -->  00:01:49.830
So I'm just gonna select the entire code.
47

47

00:01:49.830  -->  00:01:52.260
Gonna delete it and paste the code.
48

48

00:01:52.260  -->  00:01:53.400
So basically you wanna just make sure
49

49

00:01:53.400  -->  00:01:56.740
the code that you've typed in is actually correct,
50

50

00:01:56.740  -->  00:02:00.280
and correctly paste in, I should say, and ready to go.
51

51

00:02:00.280  -->  00:02:03.530
So now we wanna click on the check solution boxes.
52

52

00:02:03.530  -->  00:02:05.920
I wanna click on that, and we're now testing to see,
53

53

00:02:05.920  -->  00:02:07.810
or Udemy's code is testing to see
54

54

00:02:07.810  -->  00:02:10.340
whether the solution is correct
55

55

00:02:10.340  -->  00:02:12.730
against the solution we asked you to come up with.
56

56

00:02:12.730  -->  00:02:14.530
And notice here that we've got this error.
57

57

00:02:14.530  -->  00:02:16.490
Oops, your solution is incorrect.
58

58

00:02:16.490  -->  00:02:18.300
So what I'm going to do is just drag this over a little bit
59

59

00:02:18.300  -->  00:02:20.400
so we can read it a bit more a bit easier.
60

60

00:02:21.700  -->  00:02:22.710
And we can see what's happening here,
61

61

00:02:22.710  -->  00:02:25.110
the error there was with spacing.
62

62

00:02:25.110  -->  00:02:28.810
So that part's okay, and if you look very carefully there,
63

63

00:02:28.810  -->  00:02:30.870
you can see we haven't really got exactly
64

64

00:02:30.870  -->  00:02:33.610
what was asked of us, and that's the output
65

65

00:02:33.610  -->  00:02:35.430
from our method, down here down the bottom.
66

66

00:02:35.430  -->  00:02:38.680
Zero point zero space, km slash h,
67

67

00:02:38.680  -->  00:02:43.010
no space there, equals space zero space mi slash h.
68

68

00:02:43.010  -->  00:02:45.100
And it's repeated up here, and it's basically saying
69

69

00:02:45.100  -->  00:02:47.620
that's your output there, but this is what was expected
70

70

00:02:47.620  -->  00:02:50.020
in double quotes, and if you look really carefully,
71

71

00:02:50.020  -->  00:02:53.150
you can see that there's a space before the equals sign.
72

72

00:02:53.150  -->  00:02:56.560
So it's being a bit pedantic, but this is a way
73

73

00:02:56.560  -->  00:02:58.750
to find these coding exercises, and you really have to
74

74

00:02:58.750  -->  00:03:01.960
check the screen carefully to make sure
75

75

00:03:01.960  -->  00:03:05.550
you are giving the results exactly as it's asking for.
76

76

00:03:05.550  -->  00:03:08.270
So what we need to do is go back and put a space there
77

77

00:03:08.270  -->  00:03:12.640
before the equals sign after the km slash h
78

78

00:03:12.640  -->  00:03:13.740
to make sure that it's working.
79

79

00:03:13.740  -->  00:03:15.240
So let's actually fix that, and what we'll do is
80

80

00:03:15.240  -->  00:03:17.040
because we're now checking this
81

81

00:03:17.040  -->  00:03:19.290
within the code exercise's solution,
82

82

00:03:19.290  -->  00:03:21.380
we don't really need to go back to IntelliJ.
83

83

00:03:21.380  -->  00:03:24.040
We can just come down to our print conversion,
84

84

00:03:24.040  -->  00:03:25.820
and there, as you can see, there's the equals sign there.
85

85

00:03:25.820  -->  00:03:29.320
We've got km slash h, we haven't got a space there.
86

86

00:03:29.320  -->  00:03:31.260
I'm gonna add a space there, and now
87

87

00:03:31.260  -->  00:03:33.260
I'm gonna click on check solution again.
88

88

00:03:35.890  -->  00:03:38.970
So you can see now that our solution is actually correct.
89

89

00:03:38.970  -->  00:03:40.940
What I wanna do now, and to finish off this video,
90

90

00:03:40.940  -->  00:03:42.830
is just show you some common errors
91

91

00:03:42.830  -->  00:03:43.820
that may actually pop up.
92

92

00:03:43.820  -->  00:03:45.480
And we already showed you one there
93

93

00:03:45.480  -->  00:03:48.030
where if you didn't type in the output exactly
94

94

00:03:48.030  -->  00:03:50.310
as it was asking for on the screen we got an error,
95

95

00:03:50.310  -->  00:03:52.470
and if you read that code carefully,
96

96

00:03:52.470  -->  00:03:54.380
the error message, rather, carefully,
97

97

00:03:54.380  -->  00:03:56.130
you could see that I was missing a space there,
98

98

00:03:56.130  -->  00:03:58.040
and that actually fixed the problem.
99

99

00:03:58.040  -->  00:04:00.360
But we'll look at some other common errors.
100

100

00:04:00.360  -->  00:04:02.900
Now one of them is if we don't name the method
101

101

00:04:02.900  -->  00:04:05.237
as described in the text you'll get an error.
102

102

00:04:05.237  -->  00:04:07.100
Now at the moment we've got one here
103

103

00:04:07.100  -->  00:04:09.990
called printConversion, and that's actually what was asked.
104

104

00:04:09.990  -->  00:04:11.240
You can see up here, write another method
105

105

00:04:11.240  -->  00:04:12.420
called printConversion.
106

106

00:04:12.420  -->  00:04:15.155
If we called ours printConversion,
107

107

00:04:15.155  -->  00:04:16.917
let's say abc or something like that,
108

108

00:04:16.917  -->  00:04:20.320
and we check our solution, we'll actually get an error.
109

109

00:04:20.320  -->  00:04:23.270
And that's because we're not following what's been asked.
110

110

00:04:23.270  -->  00:04:24.810
The method with the name printConversion
111

111

00:04:24.810  -->  00:04:27.000
and parameters of type double was not found.
112

112

00:04:27.000  -->  00:04:29.440
And it's telling us it's found these other methods,
113

113

00:04:29.440  -->  00:04:32.440
but the name doesn't match, so we have to be specific
114

114

00:04:32.440  -->  00:04:35.460
and put exactly what is being asked for us.
115

115

00:04:35.460  -->  00:04:37.530
So make sure you do check your solutions carefully there.
116

116

00:04:37.530  -->  00:04:39.963
We'll check it again, we should find the error disappears.
117

117

00:04:41.180  -->  00:04:43.170
Now another common error you'll get
118

118

00:04:43.170  -->  00:04:46.150
is if you accidentally you say, for example,
119

119

00:04:46.150  -->  00:04:47.550
instead of double here on line 12,
120

120

00:04:47.550  -->  00:04:51.500
if we use a capital D to use a double class,
121

121

00:04:51.500  -->  00:04:53.900
and we'll talk more about those in a future video,
122

122

00:04:53.900  -->  00:04:55.050
but it's not exactly the same.
123

123

00:04:55.050  -->  00:04:57.833
Check the solution again, you find you'll get an error.
124

124

00:04:59.100  -->  00:05:00.260
And you can see again that's telling us
125

125

00:05:00.260  -->  00:05:01.510
method with name printConversion
126

126

00:05:01.510  -->  00:05:04.110
and parameters in lower case double there not found.
127

127

00:05:04.110  -->  00:05:06.830
Methods found, and you can see there's printConversion,
128

128

00:05:06.830  -->  00:05:08.040
and you can see there that straight away
129

129

00:05:08.040  -->  00:05:09.480
it's telling you that there's a difference there.
130

130

00:05:09.480  -->  00:05:12.270
Capital D for double, lower case one there.
131

131

00:05:12.270  -->  00:05:14.570
So I'll put that back to a lower case D again.
132

132

00:05:15.870  -->  00:05:17.639
Check the solution.
133

133

00:05:17.639  -->  00:05:18.932
All right, so that's two sample errors,
134

134

00:05:18.932  -->  00:05:20.027
and we've got the solution there,
135

135

00:05:20.027  -->  00:05:21.883
back to me being correct again.
136

136

00:05:22.800  -->  00:05:26.140
Next if we remove the public keyword
137

137

00:05:26.140  -->  00:05:28.230
from the start of the method, whoops,
138

138

00:05:28.230  -->  00:05:29.723
and then I'll leave everything else as it was before.
139

139

00:05:29.723  -->  00:05:32.220
And you check the solution, well, again,
140

140

00:05:32.220  -->  00:05:33.870
you get an error because of that.
141

141

00:05:34.857  -->  00:05:35.690
And you can see it's telling us
142

142

00:05:35.690  -->  00:05:38.760
it should be declared as public static but found static.
143

143

00:05:38.760  -->  00:05:41.970
So you have to be again really checking the text carefully
144

144

00:05:41.970  -->  00:05:46.200
to make sure you're typing exactly what's been asked of you.
145

145

00:05:46.200  -->  00:05:48.410
Check the solution and that should fix that problem.
146

146

00:05:48.410  -->  00:05:51.630
All right, so you can see now the solution is correct again.
147

147

00:05:51.630  -->  00:05:54.380
And that's just some examples of errors that might pop up
148

148

00:05:54.380  -->  00:05:56.940
as you're going through your solution,
149

149

00:05:56.940  -->  00:05:59.250
or with coding exercises in general.
150

150

00:05:59.250  -->  00:06:01.940
The bottom line is make sure you read this carefully,
151

151

00:06:01.940  -->  00:06:05.180
and you are outputting exactly what's being asked of you
152

152

00:06:05.180  -->  00:06:08.220
from the coding exercise, and using the exact data types,
153

153

00:06:08.220  -->  00:06:11.030
and really just take your time to analyse.
154

154

00:06:11.030  -->  00:06:13.570
And keep in mind that computers are pedantic,
155

155

00:06:13.570  -->  00:06:16.440
so you'll need to type your solution in exactly
156

156

00:06:16.440  -->  00:06:20.260
in terms of the output and also the data types, et cetera,
157

157

00:06:20.260  -->  00:06:22.610
as it's being asked for in the coding exercise.
158

158

00:06:23.850  -->  00:06:25.287
All right, so the solution is correct again,
159

159

00:06:25.287  -->  00:06:28.350
and you should, if you're going through this yourself,
160

160

00:06:28.350  -->  00:06:31.120
have gone back to IntelliJ and fixed errors as well,
161

161

00:06:31.120  -->  00:06:32.740
but I won't do that now.
162

162

00:06:32.740  -->  00:06:34.720
Keep in mind also that there's many different ways
163

163

00:06:34.720  -->  00:06:36.190
to solve an exercise.
164

164

00:06:36.190  -->  00:06:38.390
You'll find many solutions shared by other students
165

165

00:06:38.390  -->  00:06:40.120
in the QA section of the course.
166

166

00:06:40.120  -->  00:06:41.540
So you will see many different solutions
167

167

00:06:41.540  -->  00:06:42.970
to the same problem.
168

168

00:06:42.970  -->  00:06:45.060
Now as you've seen, everything needs to be
169

169

00:06:45.060  -->  00:06:47.340
exactly as it's been asked, so make sure
170

170

00:06:47.340  -->  00:06:49.350
you follow the text carefully again,
171

171

00:06:49.350  -->  00:06:51.050
otherwise your solution won't be accepted.
172

172

00:06:51.050  -->  00:06:53.070
You have a warning that has come up on the screen
173

173

00:06:53.070  -->  00:06:54.520
as I've been showing you.
174

174

00:06:54.520  -->  00:06:55.840
Another important thing is don't rush
175

175

00:06:55.840  -->  00:06:58.220
to solve the exercise as soon as possible.
176

176

00:06:58.220  -->  00:07:01.190
It's much better to take some time and solve it properly.
177

177

00:07:01.190  -->  00:07:02.460
That way the knowledge will sink in.
178

178

00:07:02.460  -->  00:07:05.350
The process of actually figuring out how to solve it
179

179

00:07:05.350  -->  00:07:08.670
and going through those steps to fix any errors,
180

180

00:07:08.670  -->  00:07:11.350
reading the coding exercise text again,
181

181

00:07:11.350  -->  00:07:14.170
and fixing it and reading the warnings, et cetera,
182

182

00:07:14.170  -->  00:07:15.460
that's how you become a programmer,
183

183

00:07:15.460  -->  00:07:18.030
immersing yourself in code and taking the time
184

184

00:07:18.030  -->  00:07:19.750
to really understand it and to fix it.
185

185

00:07:19.750  -->  00:07:22.850
So it's not a race, it's a matter of actually
186

186

00:07:22.850  -->  00:07:25.150
enjoying the journey, going through
187

187

00:07:25.150  -->  00:07:28.490
the process of learning is a journey.
188

188

00:07:28.490  -->  00:07:29.880
It's not the end result we're looking for.
189

189

00:07:29.880  -->  00:07:31.510
It's learning and really immersing yourself
190

190

00:07:31.510  -->  00:07:34.440
with this code, and letting this knowledge sink in.
191

191

00:07:34.440  -->  00:07:37.640
All right, so what I'm gonna do is show you now also
192

192

00:07:37.640  -->  00:07:41.580
how to share your solution with myself
193

193

00:07:41.580  -->  00:07:43.030
and Goran and other students.
194

194

00:07:43.030  -->  00:07:45.260
What you can do is copy the solution.
195

195

00:07:45.260  -->  00:07:47.800
I'm gonna click on and select that,
196

196

00:07:47.800  -->  00:07:49.954
copy that, copy that code now.
197

197

00:07:49.954  -->  00:07:54.510
Gonna browse the Q&amp;A, and you can see on the right hand side
198

198

00:07:54.510  -->  00:07:57.900
we've got some other options showing up on the screen here.
199

199

00:07:57.900  -->  00:07:58.850
Now if you wanted to do that,
200

200

00:07:58.850  -->  00:08:00.450
you click on ask a new question,
201

201

00:08:02.070  -->  00:08:03.287
so I suggest you type something useful here,
202

202

00:08:03.287  -->  00:08:07.823
and we'll put My Shared Solution, for example.
203

203

00:08:09.840  -->  00:08:12.210
I'm gonna paste the error, the code, rather,
204

204

00:08:12.210  -->  00:08:13.373
into the box down here.
205

205

00:08:15.110  -->  00:08:16.450
Now before posting a question,
206

206

00:08:16.450  -->  00:08:19.040
I wanna show you a useful feature in the QA
207

207

00:08:19.040  -->  00:08:21.220
that allows you to format your code nicely
208

208

00:08:21.220  -->  00:08:23.820
so that it's easy for others to read and to help you.
209

209

00:08:23.820  -->  00:08:26.160
So basically you should select or highlight
210

210

00:08:26.160  -->  00:08:28.114
all the code that you just pasted,
211

211

00:08:28.114  -->  00:08:31.960
and I'm gonna select that now just to show you what I mean.
212

212

00:08:31.960  -->  00:08:33.840
I'm gonna select all the code,
213

213

00:08:33.840  -->  00:08:36.290
right up to including the lines right at the top,
214

214

00:08:37.160  -->  00:08:38.950
and I'm gonna come down here and click on
215

215

00:08:38.950  -->  00:08:40.830
this little left and right curly braces
216

216

00:08:40.830  -->  00:08:43.460
with the three dots or periods in the middle.
217

217

00:08:43.460  -->  00:08:46.280
Click on that, and notice how by doing that
218

218

00:08:46.280  -->  00:08:48.710
the code is now in a little rectangle.
219

219

00:08:48.710  -->  00:08:51.030
So what that means is now that we've done that,
220

220

00:08:51.030  -->  00:08:52.773
we can scroll down to the bottom.
221

221

00:08:55.150  -->  00:08:59.890
Scroll down to the bottom, and put this is Tim's
222

222

00:08:59.890  -->  00:09:03.000
test solution for the video.
223

223

00:09:03.000  -->  00:09:04.270
Now obviously you put in something
224

224

00:09:04.270  -->  00:09:05.730
that you wanted to address.
225

225

00:09:05.730  -->  00:09:08.540
If you had a question that wasn't working,
226

226

00:09:08.540  -->  00:09:09.660
that's where you'd put it.
227

227

00:09:09.660  -->  00:09:12.150
Then you click on post question,
228

228

00:09:12.150  -->  00:09:14.630
and that question will go into the Q&amp;A section.
229

229

00:09:14.630  -->  00:09:15.990
I'm not gonna post this question now,
230

230

00:09:15.990  -->  00:09:17.890
but you can share your solutions any time you can,
231

231

00:09:17.890  -->  00:09:19.880
whether you got it working, you might wanna show us
232

232

00:09:19.880  -->  00:09:21.680
that you got it working, or if you haven't got it working
233

233

00:09:21.680  -->  00:09:24.390
and you've got a question, you can do that also.
234

234

00:09:24.390  -->  00:09:27.050
Now remember if the code runs in IntelliJ,
235

235

00:09:27.050  -->  00:09:28.740
it still doesn't mean that it's correct
236

236

00:09:28.740  -->  00:09:30.600
per the exercise text.
237

237

00:09:30.600  -->  00:09:32.810
You have to be careful about logical errors,
238

238

00:09:32.810  -->  00:09:35.860
the naming, the spaces, and so on, that we've talked about.
239

239

00:09:35.860  -->  00:09:39.290
The coding exercises are very strict and designed to be,
240

240

00:09:39.290  -->  00:09:41.960
and if one of the requirements from the text is not met,
241

241

00:09:41.960  -->  00:09:44.200
the solution, although it works in IntelliJ,
242

242

00:09:44.200  -->  00:09:46.320
won't work in the coding exercise.
243

243

00:09:46.320  -->  00:09:48.300
All right, so that's that, we'll end the video here.
244

244

00:09:48.300  -->  00:09:49.993
I'll see you in the next video.
