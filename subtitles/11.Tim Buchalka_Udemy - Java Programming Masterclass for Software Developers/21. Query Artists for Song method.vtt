00:00:05.010  -->  00:00:07.560
alright so as I mentioned at the end of
2

2

00:00:07.560  -->  00:00:10.100
the last video we're going to redefine
3

3

00:00:10.100  -->  00:00:12.300
the query albums for artists method
4

4

00:00:12.300  -->  00:00:14.700
even further will do that a little bit
5

5

00:00:14.700  -->  00:00:15.690
later on
6

6

00:00:15.690  -->  00:00:17.550
now it would be nice though if we could
7

7

00:00:17.550  -->  00:00:20.130
somehow have a placeholder in the sql
8

8

00:00:20.130  -->  00:00:22.650
statement for the artist's name so that
9

9

00:00:22.650  -->  00:00:25.380
we could dynamically replace it every
10

10

00:00:25.380  -->  00:00:27.530
time we performed a query rather than
11

11

00:00:27.530  -->  00:00:29.220
having to append the artist name to the
12

12

00:00:29.220  -->  00:00:31.560
statement but hold that thought for
13

13

00:00:31.560  -->  00:00:32.850
future video in this section of the
14

14

00:00:32.850  -->  00:00:34.470
course
15

15

00:00:34.470  -->  00:00:36.710
alright so in the main method we're
16

16

00:00:36.710  -->  00:00:38.870
going to check the other queries
17

17

00:00:38.870  -->  00:00:40.100
we came up with
18

18

00:00:40.100  -->  00:00:42.050
we're obviously tested iron maiden in the
19

19

00:00:42.050  -->  00:00:44.780
last video that worked okay let's so try
20

20

00:00:44.780  -->  00:00:47.570
pink floyd we should be getting back if
21

21

00:00:47.570  -->  00:00:54.620
you recall 12 albums will run this and
22

22

00:00:54.620  -->  00:00:56.010
you can see we've got the 12 albums a
23

23

00:00:56.010  -->  00:01:00.560
that's good that was working as well and
24

24

00:01:00.560  -->  00:01:04.220
just to confirm lets changes this to....
25

25

00:01:04.220  -->  00:01:05.210
...
26

26

00:01:05.210  -->  00:01:07.650
obviously we had ascending order so
27

27

00:01:07.650  -->  00:01:12.810
we'll try that and the sorting is
28

28

00:01:12.810  -->  00:01:14.070
working as you can see there now so
29

29

00:01:14.070  -->  00:01:14.880
that's good
30

30

00:01:14.880  -->  00:01:17.010
and finally let's just try the carole
31

31

00:01:17.010  -->  00:01:19.680
king song the carole king artist I should say
32

32

00:01:19.680  -->  00:01:23.730
and then we'll make this one order by
33

33

00:01:23.730  -->  00:01:26.340
ascending not that it really matters because i
34

34

00:01:26.340  -->  00:01:27.600
think from memory there was only the one
35

35

00:01:27.600  -->  00:01:28.560
album anyway
36

36

00:01:28.560  -->  00:01:32.970
alright so we'll run that we've got just
37

37

00:01:32.970  -->  00:01:34.560
one album tapestry so you can see
38

38

00:01:34.560  -->  00:01:37.140
they're so let's now do one
39

39

00:01:37.140  -->  00:01:39.270
more of the queries that we expect
40

40

00:01:39.270  -->  00:01:42.600
our application will want to perform so lets add
41

41

00:01:42.600  -->  00:01:45.030
a method that returns which artist
42

42

00:01:45.030  -->  00:01:48.570
recorded a particular song now one
43

43

00:01:48.570  -->  00:01:50.580
wrinkle here is that we want to return
44

44

00:01:50.580  -->  00:01:53.580
the artist name the album name and the
45

45

00:01:53.580  -->  00:01:55.590
track number for the song of the album
46

46

00:01:55.590  -->  00:01:59.280
so to do that we need to create a class
47

47

00:01:59.280  -->  00:02:01.220
in our model that contains these three
48

48

00:02:01.220  -->  00:02:02.150
values
49

49

00:02:02.150  -->  00:02:04.440
let's go ahead and do that first we're
50

50

00:02:04.440  -->  00:02:06.120
going to call the class song artist
51

51

00:02:06.120  -->  00:02:11.040
so we're going to create a new model new
52

52

00:02:11.040  -->  00:02:14.710
java class song artist
53

53

00:02:14.710  -->  00:02:20.020
alright so we need those three fields as
54

54

00:02:20.020  -->  00:02:24.160
i mentioned we've got...
55

55

00:02:24.160  -->  00:02:41.350
...
56

56

00:02:41.350  -->  00:02:46.060
alright so let's go ahead and test
57

57

00:02:46.060  -->  00:02:48.310
our query using db browser again I'm just
58

58

00:02:48.310  -->  00:02:52.900
going to start up my instance alright
59

59

00:02:52.900  -->  00:02:54.520
we need to open the database so
60

60

00:02:54.520  -->  00:02:56.590
come up here to file and select the most
61

61

00:02:56.590  -->  00:03:00.400
recent one we use just music DB and
62

62

00:03:00.400  -->  00:03:04.660
going to go into the execute sql so
63

63

00:03:04.660  -->  00:03:06.520
we want to query the artists for three
64

64

00:03:06.520  -->  00:03:09.970
songs heartless she's on fire and go
65

65

00:03:09.970  -->  00:03:12.130
your own way we're going to start by
66

66

00:03:12.130  -->  00:03:13.690
retrieving the record for the song from
67

67

00:03:13.690  -->  00:03:15.850
the songs table so let's try that out so
68

68

00:03:15.850  -->  00:03:19.600
in the sql code select....
69

69

00:03:19.600  -->  00:03:26.290
...
70

70

00:03:26.290  -->  00:03:33.250
...alright
71

71

00:03:33.250  -->  00:03:36.160
we can see there that we get the track 9
72

72

00:03:36.160  -->  00:03:39.040
and the album ID is 308
73

73

00:03:39.040  -->  00:03:41.710
so now that we've got that we can do a
74

74

00:03:41.710  -->  00:03:48.220
select...
75

75

00:03:48.220  -->  00:03:59.110
...
76

76

00:03:59.110  -->  00:04:03.070
...and execute that and you can see ID
77

77

00:04:03.070  -->  00:04:04.960
308 weight matches artist number
78

78

00:04:04.960  -->  00:04:08.470
39 the name dog and butterfly being the
79

79

00:04:08.470  -->  00:04:10.780
album and let's go do the third step
80

80

00:04:10.780  -->  00:04:13.690
which is to query the artists table we now
81

81

00:04:13.690  -->  00:04:16.840
know we need to query it for ID 39
82

82

00:04:16.840  -->  00:04:21.650
so the create new tab select...
83

83

00:04:21.650  -->  00:04:26.270
....
84

84

00:04:26.270  -->  00:04:30.160
...let's execute that and you
85

85

00:04:30.160  -->  00:04:32.500
see we finally got now down to the name
86

86

00:04:32.500  -->  00:04:34.280
of the artist which is heart in this
87

87

00:04:34.280  -->  00:04:34.970
case
88

88

00:04:34.970  -->  00:04:37.030
alright so let's just repeat these steps
89

89

00:04:37.030  -->  00:04:40.430
for the other two songs so we go back
90

90

00:04:40.430  -->  00:04:43.070
here to this first tab this time I'm
91

91

00:04:43.070  -->  00:04:44.180
going to change the name of the song
92

92

00:04:44.180  -->  00:04:47.990
which was heartless will change that
93

93

00:04:47.990  -->  00:04:50.210
id this time this song rather to she's
94

94

00:04:50.210  -->  00:05:00.650
on fire if i run that let's just check
95

95

00:05:00.650  -->  00:05:04.010
that I got my typing wrong their just do a she
96

96

00:05:04.010  -->  00:05:14.510
....
97

97

00:05:14.510  -->  00:05:16.220
....but we'll just try this
98

98

00:05:16.220  -->  00:05:18.970
just do a search for any song that's got
99

99

00:05:18.970  -->  00:05:29.570
the word she in it She so fine
100

100

00:05:29.570  -->  00:05:31.280
that was the one I was looking for she's on
101

101

00:05:31.280  -->  00:05:34.010
fire so i'm not too sure why that didn't
102

102

00:05:34.010  -->  00:05:36.170
come up and try again we'll go back to
103

103

00:05:36.170  -->  00:05:39.050
....
104

104

00:05:39.050  -->  00:05:44.570
...
105

105

00:05:44.570  -->  00:05:46.910
....so let's just try that this time
106

106

00:05:46.910  -->  00:05:49.940
alright that's better obviously the
107

107

00:05:49.940  -->  00:05:51.440
capital made all the difference
108

108

00:05:51.440  -->  00:05:53.600
alright so you can see that's now album
109

109

00:05:53.600  -->  00:05:56.210
248 track number seven
110

110

00:05:56.210  -->  00:05:58.070
so look at second part of the query now
111

111

00:05:58.070  -->  00:06:03.680
change the album to 248 this time
112

112

00:06:03.680  -->  00:06:08.930
....
113

113

00:06:08.930  -->  00:06:14.180
....ok let's
114

114

00:06:14.180  -->  00:06:15.470
just do the final one now which is
115

115

00:06:15.470  -->  00:06:19.190
go your own way.....
116

116

00:06:19.190  -->  00:06:26.960
...
117

117

00:06:26.960  -->  00:06:28.610
the reasons its coming up 4 place is this
118

118

00:06:28.610  -->  00:06:31.280
is actually on four albums so we're just
119

119

00:06:31.280  -->  00:06:32.600
going to look at the first album to do
120

120

00:06:32.600  -->  00:06:40.250
a test here which is album 416
121

121

00:06:40.250  -->  00:06:44.150
and we know the artist now is 92 we
122

122

00:06:44.150  -->  00:06:46.490
should get Fleetwood Mac coming back up
123

123

00:06:46.490  -->  00:06:48.260
the name of the artist Fleetwood mac
124

124

00:06:48.260  -->  00:06:51.350
alright so we know that sql
125

125

00:06:51.350  -->  00:06:52.400
right and we're able to get the
126

126

00:06:52.400  -->  00:06:54.860
information we need to achieve what we
127

127

00:06:54.860  -->  00:06:56.600
want to do though we need to create an inner
128

128

00:06:56.600  -->  00:06:58.970
join on those various tables to
129

129

00:06:58.970  -->  00:07:00.980
get the information so lets actually
130

130

00:07:00.980  -->  00:07:04.190
create another tab and type top in the sql
131

131

00:07:04.190  -->  00:07:06.260
code that we want....
132

132

00:07:06.260  -->  00:07:11.150
....
133

133

00:07:11.150  -->  00:08:31.060
...
134

134

00:08:31.060  -->  00:08:33.730
alright so let's actually just try
135

135

00:08:33.730  -->  00:08:35.110
running that now and see if it works
136

136

00:08:35.110  -->  00:08:39.280
and I got a typo here so....
137

137

00:08:39.280  -->  00:08:47.410
...
138

138

00:08:47.410  -->  00:08:53.650
....
139

139

00:08:53.650  -->  00:09:27.490
...
140

140

00:09:27.490  -->  00:09:32.890
....let's run that alright so
141

141

00:09:32.890  -->  00:09:34.630
just have a look at that again so we
142

142

00:09:34.630  -->  00:09:38.530
got artist.name...
143

143

00:09:38.530  -->  00:09:42.440
....
144

144

00:09:42.440  -->  00:09:53.600
...
145

145

00:09:53.600  -->  00:09:56.150
....
146

146

00:09:56.150  -->  00:09:59.060
...
147

147

00:09:59.060  -->  00:10:02.600
let's try that artists name that should
148

148

00:10:02.600  -->  00:10:07.400
be artists . name...
149

149

00:10:07.400  -->  00:10:08.930
...
150

150

00:10:08.930  -->  00:10:12.140
yeah we got there in the end
151

151

00:10:12.140  -->  00:10:14.990
ok so our inner join is now
152

152

00:10:14.990  -->  00:10:17.060
finally working and we tested that were
153

153

00:10:17.060  -->  00:10:20.000
able to type in particular song and get
154

154

00:10:20.000  -->  00:10:22.760
all the get the name name of the
155

155

00:10:22.760  -->  00:10:25.760
artist name of the album and also the
156

156

00:10:25.760  -->  00:10:27.350
track number that given song
157

157

00:10:27.350  -->  00:10:30.050
appears on alright finally that works
158

158

00:10:30.050  -->  00:10:33.080
what I want to do now is start by
159

159

00:10:33.080  -->  00:10:35.930
swinging back over to the code to our data
160

160

00:10:35.930  -->  00:10:38.960
source class and we want to add the
161

161

00:10:38.960  -->  00:10:40.910
constants for the static parts of the
162

162

00:10:40.910  -->  00:10:43.700
sql statement now the only
163

163

00:10:43.700  -->  00:10:45.620
varying parts of the song title and sort
164

164

00:10:45.620  -->  00:10:47.570
order i'm going to do the same as we did
165

165

00:10:47.570  -->  00:10:49.130
when finding the albums for an artist
166

166

00:10:49.130  -->  00:10:51.260
will have a constant for the part of the
167

167

00:10:51.260  -->  00:10:53.390
statement that occurs before the song
168

168

00:10:53.390  -->  00:10:55.520
title and a constant for the sort
169

169

00:10:55.520  -->  00:10:59.930
section let's go back to do that go up
170

170

00:10:59.930  -->  00:11:02.480
to the top here and we'll add it down
171

171

00:11:02.480  -->  00:11:05.450
here i'm going to start by...
172

172

00:11:05.450  -->  00:11:16.160
....
173

173

00:11:16.160  -->  00:11:25.940
...
174

174

00:11:25.940  -->  00:11:32.690
....
175

175

00:11:32.690  -->  00:13:54.160
...
176

176

00:13:54.160  -->  00:13:58.450
anything left to do now is to do the
177

177

00:13:58.450  -->  00:14:03.280
sort component so....
178

178

00:14:03.280  -->  00:14:18.640
...
179

179

00:14:18.640  -->  00:14:24.670
....
180

180

00:14:24.670  -->  00:14:45.850
...
181

181

00:14:45.850  -->  00:14:50.800
alright let's finish the video here
182

182

00:14:50.800  -->  00:14:52.510
because it's getting quite long in the
183

183

00:14:52.510  -->  00:14:54.310
next one will start writing our query
184

184

00:14:54.310  -->  00:14:56.590
artists for song method and obviously
185

185

00:14:56.590  -->  00:14:58.030
we'll be using the constants that we've
186

186

00:14:58.030  -->  00:15:00.400
defined in this video we test it all and
187

187

00:15:00.400  -->  00:15:01.630
make sure it's working
188

188

00:15:01.630  -->  00:15:07.950
I'll see you in the next video
