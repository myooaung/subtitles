00:00:05.050  -->  00:00:07.030
<v ->Alrighty, so you've reached the end</v>
2

2

00:00:07.030  -->  00:00:11.420
of the newly-created, remastered content for this course.
3

3

00:00:11.420  -->  00:00:13.120
Now if you're not sure what I'm talking about,
4

4

00:00:13.120  -->  00:00:15.690
refer to our video in section one of this course,
5

5

00:00:15.690  -->  00:00:18.760
course remaster in progress, where I give you the details
6

6

00:00:18.760  -->  00:00:20.330
of what's actually happening.
7

7

00:00:20.330  -->  00:00:23.750
Long story short is that I'm remastering the entire course,
8

8

00:00:23.750  -->  00:00:25.330
each and every video.
9

9

00:00:25.330  -->  00:00:27.680
I'm going through and looking at the content,
10

10

00:00:27.680  -->  00:00:30.480
and looking at any questions and answers, any confusion,
11

11

00:00:32.049  -->  00:00:34.160
that came up as a result of that video from students,
12

12

00:00:34.160  -->  00:00:36.340
incorporating the answers to those questions,
13

13

00:00:36.340  -->  00:00:39.520
and basically improving the course, adding more slides,
14

14

00:00:39.520  -->  00:00:41.770
and making this a better experience.
15

15

00:00:41.770  -->  00:00:43.890
Now obviously, with a 77 hour course,
16

16

00:00:43.890  -->  00:00:46.080
it's going to take me some time to complete it all,
17

17

00:00:46.080  -->  00:00:48.250
so what I'm doing is completing a section
18

18

00:00:48.250  -->  00:00:49.900
of the course at a time.
19

19

00:00:49.900  -->  00:00:51.270
And that's why you've actually now
20

20

00:00:51.270  -->  00:00:54.250
just finished the last section, this was the last section,
21

21

00:00:54.250  -->  00:00:55.740
I completely remastered that section.
22

22

00:00:55.740  -->  00:00:57.760
So I'm doing that one section at a time,
23

23

00:00:57.760  -->  00:01:00.270
so I'm now working on the next section of the course,
24

24

00:01:00.270  -->  00:01:02.700
the one immediately after the one you've just finished.
25

25

00:01:02.700  -->  00:01:05.040
Now if you wanna see a work in progress,
26

26

00:01:05.040  -->  00:01:06.680
check out the end of this course,
27

27

00:01:06.680  -->  00:01:09.150
there's a section there on the work in progress.
28

28

00:01:09.150  -->  00:01:10.720
Once I've finished that section,
29

29

00:01:10.720  -->  00:01:12.530
I'll then slide it into place,
30

30

00:01:12.530  -->  00:01:15.070
and you're able then to use that new content.
31

31

00:01:15.070  -->  00:01:18.310
But look, the old style content is still 100% relevant.
32

32

00:01:18.310  -->  00:01:21.190
So don't think you need to wait for this new content.
33

33

00:01:21.190  -->  00:01:23.870
The old style content is completely relevant.
34

34

00:01:23.870  -->  00:01:26.350
It's there for you, and you'll be able to use it,
35

35

00:01:26.350  -->  00:01:28.273
it'll just look a little bit different.
36

36

00:01:29.529  -->  00:01:32.800
It's just that I'm making the new style content better,
37

37

00:01:32.800  -->  00:01:34.390
based on the feedback I've got over the years.
38

38

00:01:34.390  -->  00:01:36.330
But, look, tens of thousands of people have been
39

39

00:01:36.330  -->  00:01:38.350
through this content and absolutely loved it.
40

40

00:01:38.350  -->  00:01:40.260
So whatever you do, don't stop
41

41

00:01:40.260  -->  00:01:43.240
your Java progress journey now, don't wait for new content,
42

42

00:01:43.240  -->  00:01:44.640
keep going through the course,
43

43

00:01:44.640  -->  00:01:46.890
and watch the announcements because on a regular basis,
44

44

00:01:46.890  -->  00:01:49.750
I'll post an announcement to let you know the progress,
45

45

00:01:49.750  -->  00:01:50.830
and when a new section's done.
46

46

00:01:50.830  -->  00:01:52.300
And then, if you want to, you can then go back
47

47

00:01:52.300  -->  00:01:55.040
at that point in time and check that section if you want,
48

48

00:01:55.040  -->  00:01:57.380
or you can just continue to move on.
49

49

00:01:57.380  -->  00:01:58.610
All right, so for now though,
50

50

00:01:58.610  -->  00:02:00.020
you can move on to the next section.
51

51

00:02:00.020  -->  00:02:01.553
I'll see you in that section.
