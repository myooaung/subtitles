00:00:05.130  -->  00:00:06.950
<v Instructor>In this video, we're going to instal</v>
2

2

00:00:06.950  -->  00:00:11.830
Amazon Corretto JDK version 11 for the Linux platform
3

3

00:00:11.830  -->  00:00:13.434
and specifically we're going to installing it
4

4

00:00:13.434  -->  00:00:16.920
on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
5

5

00:00:16.920  -->  00:00:19.390
Now the reason that I was selecting Amazon Corretto,
6

6

00:00:19.390  -->  00:00:21.490
I have discussed that in another video
7

7

00:00:21.490  -->  00:00:22.920
in this section of the course
8

8

00:00:22.920  -->  00:00:24.677
so check on that if you need to.
9

9

00:00:24.677  -->  00:00:27.670
But for now we're gonna start by going to a browser
10

10

00:00:27.670  -->  00:00:31.363
and we're gonna do a search in Google for Amazon Corretto.
11

11

00:00:36.300  -->  00:00:38.230
C-O-R-R-E-T-T-O
12

12

00:00:39.170  -->  00:00:40.003
and
13

13

00:00:42.370  -->  00:00:44.263
we'll click on to go to that page,
14

14

00:00:45.330  -->  00:00:48.343
come over here and select Download Amazon Corretto 11.
15

15

00:00:49.840  -->  00:00:51.640
Now, there are installation instructions.
16

16

00:00:51.640  -->  00:00:53.900
I'm gonna open those in a new tab
17

17

00:00:53.900  -->  00:00:56.210
but the version I'm going to be selecting here
18

18

00:00:56.210  -->  00:01:00.170
is the Debian version, .deb file, for my installation.
19

19

00:01:00.170  -->  00:01:01.420
So I'm going to save that
20

20

00:01:03.900  -->  00:01:06.130
and I'm just going to save that to the downloads folder.
21

21

00:01:06.130  -->  00:01:08.340
It doesn't really matter where we save it.
22

22

00:01:08.340  -->  00:01:09.793
Give that a moment to finish.
23

23

00:01:12.080  -->  00:01:14.600
Now, obviously there's also an RPM version
24

24

00:01:14.600  -->  00:01:17.510
if you're running RedHat, or some other distro,
25

25

00:01:17.510  -->  00:01:20.410
and there's also a .tar.gz version there as well,
26

26

00:01:20.410  -->  00:01:21.520
if you need that.
27

27

00:01:21.520  -->  00:01:22.850
Right, the installation's finished
28

28

00:01:22.850  -->  00:01:24.900
and the installation instructions are pretty basic
29

29

00:01:24.900  -->  00:01:26.050
as you can see there,
30

30

00:01:26.050  -->  00:01:28.490
but you can refer to those if you need to.
31

31

00:01:28.490  -->  00:01:30.580
For now, what I'm going to do is go to the terminal
32

32

00:01:30.580  -->  00:01:32.330
to do the rest of the installation.
33

33

00:01:36.110  -->  00:01:37.610
All right, so I'm just going to, I should put the
34

34

00:01:37.610  -->  00:01:39.410
instructions over to the left there.
35

35

00:01:41.750  -->  00:01:43.920
So I'm gonna start by going into the downloads folder
36

36

00:01:43.920  -->  00:01:47.260
cd, space, then a tilda, forward slash Downloads
37

37

00:01:47.260  -->  00:01:50.260
with a capital D because that happens to be the folder on
38

38

00:01:50.260  -->  00:01:53.520
this version of Ubuntu that that file's been downloaded to.
39

39

00:01:53.520  -->  00:01:55.680
The next thing I'm going to do is follow those instructions
40

40

00:01:55.680  -->  00:02:00.650
in the browser, I'm gonna type in sudo apt get apt dash get
41

41

00:02:00.650  -->  00:02:05.650
space update space two ampersands sudo apt dash get
42

42

00:02:07.090  -->  00:02:12.090
there's a space obviously space instal space java common
43

43

00:02:13.990  -->  00:02:15.103
type in my password,
44

44

00:02:17.960  -->  00:02:20.130
give that a moment to complete
45

45

00:02:20.130  -->  00:02:21.310
and next thing we're going to do is
46

46

00:02:21.310  -->  00:02:22.840
instal the installation folder
47

47

00:02:22.840  -->  00:02:24.732
in this case the dot deb file.
48

48

00:02:24.732  -->  00:02:29.659
So I'm going to type sudo space dpkg space dash dash instal
49

49

00:02:29.659  -->  00:02:32.410
space and the name of the file there I'm just going to type
50

50

00:02:32.410  -->  00:02:34.070
the first two letters and press tab
51

51

00:02:34.070  -->  00:02:36.363
And that's our java 11 db file.
52

52

00:02:37.810  -->  00:02:40.140
All right so, that's it, it's a pretty simple installation
53

53

00:02:40.140  -->  00:02:41.100
as you can see there.
54

54

00:02:41.100  -->  00:02:43.270
And what we are going to do is just check the version number
55

55

00:02:43.270  -->  00:02:45.290
So java space dash version
56

56

00:02:46.850  -->  00:02:48.940
Now note that the output that I've got there
57

57

00:02:48.940  -->  00:02:50.290
is a different version.
58

58

00:02:50.290  -->  00:02:53.470
It says java hotspot, it doesn't say anything about Amazon
59

59

00:02:53.470  -->  00:02:55.870
and that's because I've already had an installation
60

60

00:02:55.870  -->  00:02:57.590
of java on this computer.
61

61

00:02:57.590  -->  00:02:59.550
And what I'm going to do is show you how to change that
62

62

00:02:59.550  -->  00:03:02.370
so if you don't see Amazon in the output down the bottom
63

63

00:03:02.370  -->  00:03:04.640
Amazon Corretto this is how to change it.
64

64

00:03:04.640  -->  00:03:06.350
So again, the instructions are here.
65

65

00:03:06.350  -->  00:03:07.720
So it's pretty straightforward.
66

66

00:03:07.720  -->  00:03:12.720
Firstly we need to type sudo space update alternatives
67

67

00:03:13.090  -->  00:03:14.720
update dash alternatives
68

68

00:03:16.000  -->  00:03:19.290
space dash dash config space java
69

69

00:03:20.490  -->  00:03:21.930
You get presented with this option.
70

70

00:03:21.930  -->  00:03:24.950
The option we want to select here is option one for java
71

71

00:03:24.950  -->  00:03:28.529
So you can see that instead of using the oracle version
72

72

00:03:28.529  -->  00:03:31.160
I've got configured as option two there selection two
73

73

00:03:31.160  -->  00:03:32.423
I'm gonna use option one.
74

74

00:03:33.420  -->  00:03:34.750
And I'm also gonna do exactly the same,
75

75

00:03:34.750  -->  00:03:37.174
I'm just gonna press the up arrow and change java to java c
76

76

00:03:37.174  -->  00:03:41.700
And I'm also gonna select option one as well .
77

77

00:03:41.700  -->  00:03:45.110
And this is obviously for the java executable but also
78

78

00:03:45.110  -->  00:03:47.980
the java compola java c executable from command line
79

79

00:03:47.980  -->  00:03:49.073
We're setting that up in case you wanna use it
80

80

00:03:49.073  -->  00:03:50.200
from the command line.
81

81

00:03:50.200  -->  00:03:53.620
And now if we type jave space dash version
82

82

00:03:54.820  -->  00:03:56.240
this time now we can see that it says
83

83

00:03:56.240  -->  00:03:58.670
open jdk server vm Corretto
84

84

00:03:58.670  -->  00:04:00.770
I think I mentioned in earlier in the video that would show
85

85

00:04:00.770  -->  00:04:02.260
Amazon but of course it's not showing that
86

86

00:04:02.260  -->  00:04:03.520
it just shows Corretto.
87

87

00:04:03.520  -->  00:04:06.740
In any event you can see clearly now by using the open jdk
88

88

00:04:06.740  -->  00:04:08.800
which is exactly what we need here.
89

89

00:04:08.800  -->  00:04:10.870
Now the other thing that you should take note of
90

90

00:04:10.870  -->  00:04:13.520
is the folder that it is actually installed in.
91

91

00:04:13.520  -->  00:04:15.240
We can see that on the screen there in the terminal window
92

92

00:04:15.240  -->  00:04:19.210
in this case usr lib jbm and then java dash eleven
93

93

00:04:19.210  -->  00:04:21.370
dash amazon dash Corretto .
94

94

00:04:21.370  -->  00:04:24.910
So just keep a note of that folder you may need that later
95

95

00:04:24.910  -->  00:04:26.650
but for now though that's the installation of
96

96

00:04:26.650  -->  00:04:29.877
Amazon Corretto in jdk version 11 the open jdk
97

97

00:04:29.877  -->  00:04:32.433
installed successfully on Linux.
