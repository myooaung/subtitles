00:00:04.730  -->  00:00:06.560
now that we're seeing what the hellow
2

2

00:00:06.560  -->  00:00:08.029
world application looks like out of the
3

3

00:00:08.029  -->  00:00:10.160
box let's start changing a few things
4

4

00:00:10.160  -->  00:00:11.990
we'll start with changing the title of
5

5

00:00:11.990  -->  00:00:14.120
the window to Hello JavaFX
6

6

00:00:14.120  -->  00:00:16.070
we can do that simply by changing line
7

7

00:00:16.070  -->  00:00:19.520
14 instead of hello world we put Hello Java
8

8

00:00:19.520  -->  00:00:22.970
FX exclamation basically passing
9

9

00:00:22.970  -->  00:00:24.920
the string to the set title method to
10

10

00:00:24.920  -->  00:00:27.140
invoke that change and moving up with
11

11

00:00:27.140  -->  00:00:28.820
that now let's say welcome to Java FX
12

12

00:00:28.820  -->  00:00:31.430
within the window itself we can do that
13

13

00:00:31.430  -->  00:00:34.129
using code or by changing the FXML file
14

14

00:00:34.129  -->  00:00:36.320
so let's change the application at the
15

15

00:00:36.320  -->  00:00:38.269
moment so that it doesn't use the FXML
16

16

00:00:38.269  -->  00:00:39.010
file at all
17

17

00:00:39.010  -->  00:00:40.879
instead we'll start at doing everything
18

18

00:00:40.879  -->  00:00:43.129
through code so I'm going to comment out
19

19

00:00:43.129  -->  00:00:45.470
the fxml loader call on line
20

20

00:00:45.470  -->  00:00:49.339
13 and then we'll add the code that'll
21

21

00:00:49.339  -->  00:00:51.170
create a grid pane node and we'll set
22

22

00:00:51.170  -->  00:00:53.989
the node as the root of our scene so to
23

23

00:00:53.989  -->  00:00:57.830
do that we'll start here and start by
24

24

00:00:57.830  -->  00:01:02.269
typing....
25

25

00:01:02.269  -->  00:01:22.240
....
26

26

00:01:22.240  -->  00:01:26.179
....then we keep our
27

27

00:01:26.179  -->  00:01:28.579
other code in there our set title and
28

28

00:01:28.579  -->  00:01:30.710
set scene etc so basically what we're
29

29

00:01:30.710  -->  00:01:33.020
doing is looking at the FXML we're
30

30

00:01:33.020  -->  00:01:34.609
setting the equivalent of these
31

31

00:01:34.609  -->  00:01:37.039
attributes alignment hgap and vgap
32

32

00:01:37.039  -->  00:01:40.670
but we're doing that in code instead the
33

33

00:01:40.670  -->  00:01:41.990
alignment determines where the grid will
34

34

00:01:41.990  -->  00:01:43.700
actually sit within the grid panes width
35

35

00:01:43.700  -->  00:01:45.829
and height the set alignment method
36

36

00:01:45.829  -->  00:01:47.149
takes a pos value a we're using
37

37

00:01:47.149  -->  00:01:49.340
pos.Center so now that we've got a
38

38

00:01:49.340  -->  00:01:51.079
grid pane that matches what was in the FX
39

39

00:01:51.079  -->  00:01:53.359
ML file and we're adding it to our scene
40

40

00:01:53.359  -->  00:01:54.829
as we did before when we run our
41

41

00:01:54.829  -->  00:01:57.530
application now
42

42

00:01:57.530  -->  00:02:00.260
we get the same result as before this
43

43

00:02:00.260  -->  00:02:03.340
time without using the FXML file
44

44

00:02:03.340  -->  00:02:05.240
alright so next what we're going to do
45

45

00:02:05.240  -->  00:02:08.149
is add the welcome to JavaFX greeting to
46

46

00:02:08.149  -->  00:02:10.490
the window let's go ahead and do that so
47

47

00:02:10.490  -->  00:02:12.500
we're going to use the label control you
48

48

00:02:12.500  -->  00:02:14.330
want to make sure that we add the import
49

49

00:02:14.330  -->  00:02:16.490
for java.scene.control.label
50

50

00:02:16.490  -->  00:02:19.070
if it asks for it I'm gonna type
51

51

00:02:19.070  -->  00:02:22.280
...you can see javafx.scene.
52

52

00:02:22.280  -->  00:02:23.570
control is coming up for me because
53

53

00:02:23.570  -->  00:02:26.360
I've configured Auto imports and....
54

54

00:02:26.360  -->  00:02:35.990
....
55

55

00:02:35.990  -->  00:02:39.940
closing that off then....
56

56

00:02:39.940  -->  00:02:43.790
....
57

57

00:02:43.790  -->  00:02:48.050
...alright so you
58

58

00:02:48.050  -->  00:02:50.930
can see now that on line 24 we've
59

59

00:02:50.930  -->  00:02:54.050
actually added our label control to the
60

60

00:02:54.050  -->  00:02:55.940
grid pane and we've done that by calling
61

61

00:02:55.940  -->  00:02:57.920
the grid panes get children method which
62

62

00:02:57.920  -->  00:02:59.750
returns a list of the children and then
63

63

00:02:59.750  -->  00:03:01.910
we use the add method to add our label
64

64

00:03:01.910  -->  00:03:04.190
control to the list we always have to do
65

65

00:03:04.190  -->  00:03:06.709
it this way there isn't a shortcut we're
66

66

00:03:06.709  -->  00:03:07.970
now ready to run the application again
67

67

00:03:07.970  -->  00:03:10.070
so let's actually run this and confirm
68

68

00:03:10.070  -->  00:03:13.550
that we can see the label okay we can now see
69

69

00:03:13.550  -->  00:03:16.040
it says welcome to Java FX in the center
70

70

00:03:16.040  -->  00:03:18.350
of the window alright so let's change
71

71

00:03:18.350  -->  00:03:21.050
the color of the text to green now we do
72

72

00:03:21.050  -->  00:03:23.120
this using the labels control set text
73

73

00:03:23.120  -->  00:03:25.310
field method we passed the parameter
74

74

00:03:25.310  -->  00:03:27.860
being the color that we want I'm gonna
75

75

00:03:27.860  -->  00:03:30.860
go back and do that and add that after
76

76

00:03:30.860  -->  00:03:33.739
the line that we've actually used to
77

77

00:03:33.739  -->  00:03:35.660
create the greeting
78

78

00:03:35.660  -->  00:03:39.170
object so it's....
79

79

00:03:39.170  -->  00:03:42.110
...
80

80

00:03:42.110  -->  00:03:44.810
....noting that the
81

81

00:03:44.810  -->  00:03:46.790
import is javafx.scene.paint
82

82

00:03:46.790  -->  00:03:48.980
make sure you import the color class if
83

83

00:03:48.980  -->  00:03:51.470
you are getting an error dot in this
84

84

00:03:51.470  -->  00:03:53.150
case green is the color we want so I'm
85

85

00:03:53.150  -->  00:03:55.820
going to specify green there now we run
86

86

00:03:55.820  -->  00:04:00.620
the application we can see now the text
87

87

00:04:00.620  -->  00:04:05.299
is now showing in green alright so
88

88

00:04:05.299  -->  00:04:07.340
let's now change the font and make the
89

89

00:04:07.340  -->  00:04:09.860
font bold to do that we call the set
90

90

00:04:09.860  -->  00:04:11.220
font method and set the
91

91

00:04:11.220  -->  00:04:12.990
font to something we want in this case we'll
92

92

00:04:12.990  -->  00:04:15.540
go with Times New Roman and I'm using
93

93

00:04:15.540  -->  00:04:16.860
that because that should be available in
94

94

00:04:16.860  -->  00:04:18.780
all systems and what we'll do is we'll
95

95

00:04:18.780  -->  00:04:21.090
set the font weight to font weight.bold
96

96

00:04:21.090  -->  00:04:23.400
and we'll also set the size to 70 so
97

97

00:04:23.400  -->  00:04:24.780
lets actually try doing that just see
98

98

00:04:24.780  -->  00:04:26.880
what happens and the way to do that is
99

99

00:04:26.880  -->  00:04:29.720
on that next line we can type greeting
100

100

00:04:29.720  -->  00:04:36.150
....then in parentheses we're
101

101

00:04:36.150  -->  00:04:40.230
going to go....
102

102

00:04:40.230  -->  00:04:46.410
....
103

103

00:04:46.410  -->  00:04:47.910
....so make sure you type it exactly
104

104

00:04:47.910  -->  00:04:49.290
like that with the capitals where
105

105

00:04:49.290  -->  00:04:52.560
appropriate and I'm going to set the
106

106

00:04:52.560  -->  00:04:54.510
font weight to bold as I mentioned by
107

107

00:04:54.510  -->  00:04:58.530
typing...
108

108

00:04:58.530  -->  00:05:00.540
....
109

109

00:05:00.540  -->  00:05:04.320
....and that shouldn't be
110

110

00:05:04.320  -->  00:05:05.460
a right parenthesis there we I'll get rid
111

111

00:05:05.460  -->  00:05:07.590
of that and you can see now that
112

112

00:05:07.590  -->  00:05:09.360
we've correctly set that and if you
113

113

00:05:09.360  -->  00:05:13.620
run the application you can see that's
114

114

00:05:13.620  -->  00:05:16.140
now quite large in fact the text is too
115

115

00:05:16.140  -->  00:05:18.000
large for the window so we could reduce
116

116

00:05:18.000  -->  00:05:19.770
the font size but instead let's increase
117

117

00:05:19.770  -->  00:05:22.110
the size of the window by changing what
118

118

00:05:22.110  -->  00:05:24.419
we passed to the same constructor so the
119

119

00:05:24.419  -->  00:05:26.490
window Heights okay we just need to
120

120

00:05:26.490  -->  00:05:27.990
change the width so let's just close this
121

121

00:05:27.990  -->  00:05:28.220
down
122

122

00:05:28.220  -->  00:05:31.500
so that's this argument here on line 33 let's
123

123

00:05:31.500  -->  00:05:32.970
change that to instead of being three
124

124

00:05:32.970  -->  00:05:34.740
hundred by two seven five let's changed
125

125

00:05:34.740  -->  00:05:42.510
the 300 to 700 let's run that again you
126

126

00:05:42.510  -->  00:05:45.540
can see now it actually fits correctly
127

127

00:05:45.540  -->  00:05:47.070
alright so that's how to set things
128

128

00:05:47.070  -->  00:05:50.010
manually with code so let's see how to
129

129

00:05:50.010  -->  00:05:53.670
do the same thing in the FXML file so
130

130

00:05:53.670  -->  00:05:55.020
first things first i'm going to
131

131

00:05:55.020  -->  00:05:58.710
uncomment the previously commented out
132

132

00:05:58.710  -->  00:06:00.210
loader so that's going to start using
133

133

00:06:00.210  -->  00:06:02.850
our sample.fxml again I'm
134

134

00:06:02.850  -->  00:06:04.440
going to comment out all these extra
135

135

00:06:04.440  -->  00:06:06.600
commands that set the grid pane and then
136

136

00:06:06.600  -->  00:06:08.190
set the various colors and then
137

137

00:06:08.190  -->  00:06:11.100
added it comment all that out and just to
138

138

00:06:11.100  -->  00:06:12.360
confirm when we run it again we should
139

139

00:06:12.360  -->  00:06:15.750
now get an empty window again and note now
140

140

00:06:15.750  -->  00:06:17.460
that the window is still wider but
141

141

00:06:17.460  -->  00:06:19.170
because the welcome to Java FX message
142

142

00:06:19.170  -->  00:06:20.310
is no longer there because we've commented
143

143

00:06:20.310  -->  00:06:22.230
out that part of the code
144

144

00:06:22.230  -->  00:06:23.880
alright so let's move over to sample.fxml
145

145

00:06:23.880  -->  00:06:29.010
now alright so we want to start
146

146

00:06:29.010  -->  00:06:31.590
by creating the label we want to add our
147

147

00:06:31.590  -->  00:06:33.600
label control their we want it to be a
148

148

00:06:33.600  -->  00:06:35.700
child of the grid pane so therefore we
149

149

00:06:35.700  -->  00:06:36.870
need to insert the label element
150

150

00:06:36.870  -->  00:06:39.480
anywhere between the opening and closing
151

151

00:06:39.480  -->  00:06:41.610
tags so I want to go to the first part
152

152

00:06:41.610  -->  00:06:43.740
there and just tab down a little bit and
153

153

00:06:43.740  -->  00:06:46.050
I start typing label notice that
154

154

00:06:46.050  -->  00:06:49.020
IntelliJ is being helpful here
155

155

00:06:49.020  -->  00:06:51.270
select label there and what it should do
156

156

00:06:51.270  -->  00:06:53.400
in this case you can see that it
157

157

00:06:53.400  -->  00:06:55.530
highlighted the label import so that
158

158

00:06:55.530  -->  00:06:56.910
wasn't there it should auto add that
159

159

00:06:56.910  -->  00:06:59.220
import for us automatically alright so
160

160

00:06:59.220  -->  00:07:01.920
next we need to type text being the text
161

161

00:07:01.920  -->  00:07:04.440
attribute and set that to welcome to
162

162

00:07:04.440  -->  00:07:08.030
Java FX and an exclamation mark there
163

163

00:07:08.030  -->  00:07:11.820
add the closing tag there first if we
164

164

00:07:11.820  -->  00:07:15.330
run that we can see we've got our
165

165

00:07:15.330  -->  00:07:18.000
welcome to Java FX tag they're closing
166

166

00:07:18.000  -->  00:07:21.600
that down again alright so now let's set
167

167

00:07:21.600  -->  00:07:24.780
the text color and font so to set the
168

168

00:07:24.780  -->  00:07:26.880
color to green we need to set the labels
169

169

00:07:26.880  -->  00:07:29.280
text field property now IntelliJ will
170

170

00:07:29.280  -->  00:07:30.780
offer a color drop-down when we go into
171

171

00:07:30.780  -->  00:07:32.610
this value so back up here it'll be
172

172

00:07:32.610  -->  00:07:35.760
after the text going to add....
173

173

00:07:35.760  -->  00:07:38.460
....and notice how it's done
174

174

00:07:38.460  -->  00:07:40.590
that for us quite helpfully and we can
175

175

00:07:40.590  -->  00:07:42.330
either type it or we could just scroll
176

176

00:07:42.330  -->  00:07:45.300
down to gray to green rather and choose
177

177

00:07:45.300  -->  00:07:47.460
it from there and it will add it for us
178

178

00:07:47.460  -->  00:07:49.620
automatically I could have typed that as
179

179

00:07:49.620  -->  00:07:52.620
I said alright so that's the color next
180

180

00:07:52.620  -->  00:07:54.840
we need to add a font and we need to do
181

181

00:07:54.840  -->  00:07:57.270
that by adding a font child to the label
182

182

00:07:57.270  -->  00:07:58.870
so we need to come down here
183

183

00:07:58.870  -->  00:08:04.180
and type font...
184

184

00:08:04.180  -->  00:08:05.800
....and then we need to
185

185

00:08:05.800  -->  00:08:07.960
configure the font so....
186

186

00:08:07.960  -->  00:08:16.419
....
187

187

00:08:16.419  -->  00:08:20.770
...and we also want
188

188

00:08:20.770  -->  00:08:26.110
....and I'll add
189

189

00:08:26.110  -->  00:08:27.600
the closing tag for that automatically
190

190

00:08:27.600  -->  00:08:29.620
so you can see there that the font
191

191

00:08:29.620  -->  00:08:31.330
weight property doesn't actually exist
192

192

00:08:31.330  -->  00:08:33.880
so this is one case where FML differs
193

193

00:08:33.880  -->  00:08:36.039
from the way we do it in code so if we
194

194

00:08:36.039  -->  00:08:38.710
want to actually get bold working then
195

195

00:08:38.710  -->  00:08:40.000
what we do is we actually delete that
196

196

00:08:40.000  -->  00:08:44.500
attribute I would change the font name
197

197

00:08:44.500  -->  00:08:46.690
instead of Times New Roman that's gonna
198

198

00:08:46.690  -->  00:08:50.380
be Times New Roman bold okay then we run
199

199

00:08:50.380  -->  00:08:55.330
the application now we've got pretty
200

200

00:08:55.330  -->  00:08:56.589
much the same application this time
201

201

00:08:56.589  -->  00:08:59.140
using the FXML file instead of the
202

202

00:08:59.140  -->  00:09:00.760
manual controls that we added in code
203

203

00:09:00.760  -->  00:09:03.490
previously so when you define a UI
204

204

00:09:03.490  -->  00:09:06.010
control using FXML we can still change
205

205

00:09:06.010  -->  00:09:07.420
its properties in code
206

206

00:09:07.420  -->  00:09:09.430
in fact that's often what we want to do
207

207

00:09:09.430  -->  00:09:11.350
for example we might want to enable or
208

208

00:09:11.350  -->  00:09:13.270
disable buttons to respond to a user
209

209

00:09:13.270  -->  00:09:14.950
action and we'll cover how to work with
210

210

00:09:14.950  -->  00:09:17.920
controls to find in the FXML in a
211

211

00:09:17.920  -->  00:09:19.990
later video so as you see we can
212

212

00:09:19.990  -->  00:09:21.760
create the UI by creating the UI
213

213

00:09:21.760  -->  00:09:23.860
controls through code and setting their
214

214

00:09:23.860  -->  00:09:25.779
properties and then adding them to the
215

215

00:09:25.779  -->  00:09:28.150
appropriate parents or we can do it
216

216

00:09:28.150  -->  00:09:30.250
through FXML for the rest of the JavaFX
217

217

00:09:30.250  -->  00:09:33.160
videos we're going to focus on the FXML
218

218

00:09:33.160  -->  00:09:36.550
route FXML forces us to separate our UI
219

219

00:09:36.550  -->  00:09:39.459
from our business logic and data so it's
220

220

00:09:39.459  -->  00:09:41.110
considered best practice to the definethe
221

221

00:09:41.110  -->  00:09:43.720
UI through FXML as much as possible
222

222

00:09:43.720  -->  00:09:45.550
an exception would be the stage that the
223

223

00:09:45.550  -->  00:09:47.920
JavaFX runtime constructs for us and
224

224

00:09:47.920  -->  00:09:50.380
passes to the start method we have to
225

225

00:09:50.380  -->  00:09:52.270
work with it in code now another good
226

226

00:09:52.270  -->  00:09:54.610
reason for our defining UI controllers
227

227

00:09:54.610  -->  00:09:56.680
in FXML rather than through code is
228

228

00:09:56.680  -->  00:09:59.050
that if we decide we want to change how
229

229

00:09:59.050  -->  00:10:01.209
a UI control initially looks we don't
230

230

00:10:01.209  -->  00:10:03.760
have to touch a line of Java code when
231

231

00:10:03.760  -->  00:10:05.320
we added the greeting to the window and
232

232

00:10:05.320  -->  00:10:07.089
change the color and the front of the
233

233

00:10:07.089  -->  00:10:09.310
label using FXML you'll note that we
234

234

00:10:09.310  -->  00:10:10.959
didn't have to touch the main Java file
235

235

00:10:10.959  -->  00:10:12.370
so one of the strengths
236

236

00:10:12.370  -->  00:10:15.100
JavaFX is that we can change how an
237

237

00:10:15.100  -->  00:10:17.170
application looks without changing a
238

238

00:10:17.170  -->  00:10:19.480
line of Java code which is something we
239

239

00:10:19.480  -->  00:10:21.339
couldn't do with swing defining
240

240

00:10:21.339  -->  00:10:23.710
the UI using FXML is also similar to
241

241

00:10:23.710  -->  00:10:25.570
how UIs are coded in other
242

242

00:10:25.570  -->  00:10:27.839
applications such as Android and Windows
243

243

00:10:27.839  -->  00:10:30.520
the concepts are the same so
244

244

00:10:30.520  -->  00:10:32.350
understanding and using FXML for our
245

245

00:10:32.350  -->  00:10:34.510
Java FX applications will give you a
246

246

00:10:34.510  -->  00:10:36.339
head start when it comes to learning how
247

247

00:10:36.339  -->  00:10:39.010
to code other types of applications but I
248

248

00:10:39.010  -->  00:10:40.210
wanted to show you that you can create
249

249

00:10:40.210  -->  00:10:42.640
UI components using code but again we're
250

250

00:10:42.640  -->  00:10:44.830
going to stick with FXML whenever
251

251

00:10:44.830  -->  00:10:45.880
possible from now on
252

252

00:10:45.880  -->  00:10:47.350
alright so that's been a brief
253

253

00:10:47.350  -->  00:10:49.690
introduction to Java FX let's end the
254

254

00:10:49.690  -->  00:10:51.730
video here into the next one we'll take
255

255

00:10:51.730  -->  00:10:54.490
a look JavaFX layouts see you in the
256

256

00:10:54.490  -->  00:10:56.910
next video
