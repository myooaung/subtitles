alright so now that we can add contacts
2

2

00:00:07.100  -->  00:00:09.500
let's so go ahead and add the code to
alright so now that we can add contacts
3

3

00:00:09.500  -->  00:00:11.810
edit a contact so the first thing we
let's so go ahead and add the code to
4

4

00:00:11.810  -->  00:00:14.300
need to do is to add and edit item to
edit a contact so the first thing we
5

5

00:00:14.300  -->  00:00:17.020
our contact menu I'm going to look at
need to do is to add and edit item to
6

6

00:00:17.020  -->  00:00:19.910
the contact dialogue to do that and
our contact menu I'm going to look at
7

7

00:00:19.910  -->  00:00:22.850
let's add an entry in a menu so I said
the contact dialogue to do that and
8

8

00:00:22.850  -->  00:00:24.280
contact dialogue but of course menu is
let's add an entry in a menu so I said
9

9

00:00:24.280  -->  00:00:26.570
in main .fxml so we want
contact dialogue but of course menu is
10

10

00:00:26.570  -->  00:00:27.770
to add it here
in main .fxml so we want
11

11

00:00:27.770  -->  00:00:30.770
as another menu item below the add
to add it here
12

12

00:00:30.770  -->  00:00:33.100
we're going to come along here and put
as another menu item below the add
13

13

00:00:33.100  -->  00:00:36.590
our items again and we're going to put
we're going to come along here and put
14

14

00:00:36.590  -->  00:00:39.470
...
our items again and we're going to put
15

15

00:00:39.470  -->  00:01:05.690
...
...
16

16

00:01:05.690  -->  00:01:08.060
now what we're going to do is reuse the
...
17

17

00:01:08.060  -->  00:01:11.630
UI that we use for adding a contact now
now what we're going to do is reuse the
18

18

00:01:11.630  -->  00:01:13.270
we want to change the header text of the
UI that we use for adding a contact now
19

19

00:01:13.270  -->  00:01:15.670
dialogue we also want to fill the field
we want to change the header text of the
20

20

00:01:15.670  -->  00:01:18.200
with existing values of a contact that we are
dialogue we also want to fill the field
21

21

00:01:18.200  -->  00:01:20.990
editing when the user presses ok we
with existing values of a contact that we are
22

22

00:01:20.990  -->  00:01:22.790
don't want to add a new contact we want
editing when the user presses ok we
23

23

00:01:22.790  -->  00:01:24.590
to actually update the values in the
don't want to add a new contact we want
24

24

00:01:24.590  -->  00:01:27.800
existing contact instance but first we
to actually update the values in the
25

25

00:01:27.800  -->  00:01:29.360
need to know which contact the user
existing contact instance but first we
26

26

00:01:29.360  -->  00:01:31.310
wants to edit so we want to know which
need to know which contact the user
27

27

00:01:31.310  -->  00:01:33.130
contact the user has selected in the
wants to edit so we want to know which
28

28

00:01:33.130  -->  00:01:36.110
table then if nothing is selected show a
contact the user has selected in the
29

29

00:01:36.110  -->  00:01:37.580
message box that tells the user to
table then if nothing is selected show a
30

30

00:01:37.580  -->  00:01:39.770
select the item that they want to edit
message box that tells the user to
31

31

00:01:39.770  -->  00:01:41.300
that's what we're going to do so we'll
select the item that they want to edit
32

32

00:01:41.300  -->  00:01:44.150
go back to our controller class and
that's what we're going to do so we'll
33

33

00:01:44.150  -->  00:01:46.550
will actually add this function this method
go back to our controller class and
34

34

00:01:46.550  -->  00:01:51.010
...
will actually add this function this method
35

35

00:01:51.010  -->  00:01:52.950
alright so the method is going to be
...
36

36

00:01:52.950  -->  00:01:55.360
public void
alright so the method is going to be
37

37

00:01:55.360  -->  00:01:58.360
...
public void
38

38

00:01:58.360  -->  00:03:18.030
...
...
39

39

00:03:18.030  -->  00:03:21.750
alright so we get the selected item from
...
40

40

00:03:21.750  -->  00:03:24.810
the table if it's null it means
alright so we get the selected item from
41

41

00:03:24.810  -->  00:03:26.280
that nothing selected we're going to
the table if it's null it means
42

42

00:03:26.280  -->  00:03:27.780
show this alert that was just coded up
that nothing selected we're going to
43

43

00:03:27.780  -->  00:03:31.150
and then return now alerts can have a
show this alert that was just coded up
44

44

00:03:31.150  -->  00:03:33.250
header text or can have header text just
and then return now alerts can have a
45

45

00:03:33.250  -->  00:03:35.340
like dialogues but we don't need it and
header text or can have header text just
46

46

00:03:35.340  -->  00:03:37.300
that's why I've set it to null so let's
like dialogues but we don't need it and
47

47

00:03:37.300  -->  00:03:39.840
run this and try it out and
that's why I've set it to null so let's
48

48

00:03:39.840  -->  00:03:41.530
obviously to check this code we need to
run this and try it out and
49

49

00:03:41.530  -->  00:03:43.210
run it without actually selecting an
obviously to check this code we need to
50

50

00:03:43.210  -->  00:03:48.750
item from the table and we actually
run it without actually selecting an
51

51

00:03:48.750  -->  00:03:50.470
got an error here so let's check out what I've
item from the table and we actually
52

52

00:03:50.470  -->  00:03:53.560
done wrong with ok so i don't think it's
got an error here so let's check out what I've
53

53

00:03:53.560  -->  00:03:54.840
anything to do with the code that we
done wrong with ok so i don't think it's
54

54

00:03:54.840  -->  00:03:57.810
change...
anything to do with the code that we
55

55

00:03:57.810  -->  00:04:00.460
...and we go back
change...
56

56

00:04:00.460  -->  00:04:04.600
to our controller that looks
...and we go back
57

57

00:04:04.600  -->  00:04:07.150
ok to me just looking at data again our
to our controller that looks
58

58

00:04:07.150  -->  00:04:10.450
contacts xml and that's the problem
ok to me just looking at data again our
59

59

00:04:10.450  -->  00:04:12.100
you remember that i didn't add anything
contacts xml and that's the problem
60

60

00:04:12.100  -->  00:04:14.230
for notes we haven't got any validation
you remember that i didn't add anything
61

61

00:04:14.230  -->  00:04:16.600
and we're assuming that all the fields
for notes we haven't got any validation
62

62

00:04:16.600  -->  00:04:17.740
will actually have some information
and we're assuming that all the fields
63

63

00:04:17.740  -->  00:04:21.340
that's so i'm suspecting I changes this
will actually have some information
64

64

00:04:21.340  -->  00:04:23.280
some notes by editing the xml directly
that's so i'm suspecting I changes this
65

65

00:04:23.280  -->  00:04:25.810
then go back and run this again we
some notes by editing the xml directly
66

66

00:04:25.810  -->  00:04:27.790
should find that it works so that was my bad
then go back and run this again we
67

67

00:04:27.790  -->  00:04:29.440
for actually not putting any data
should find that it works so that was my bad
68

68

00:04:29.440  -->  00:04:31.150
in there we go so it's actually working
for actually not putting any data
69

69

00:04:31.150  -->  00:04:31.810
again
in there we go so it's actually working
70

70

00:04:31.810  -->  00:04:33.370
alright so let's do what I was
again
71

71

00:04:33.370  -->  00:04:35.980
going to originally do and going click
alright so let's do what I was
72

72

00:04:35.980  -->  00:04:37.900
on contacts and click on edit to see
going to originally do and going click
73

73

00:04:37.900  -->  00:04:40.480
with that dialog box pops up that we
on contacts and click on edit to see
74

74

00:04:40.480  -->  00:04:43.750
just created the alert I should say no
with that dialog box pops up that we
75

75

00:04:43.750  -->  00:04:45.130
contact selected please select the
just created the alert I should say no
76

76

00:04:45.130  -->  00:04:47.050
content you want to edit just
contact selected please select the
77

77

00:04:47.050  -->  00:04:49.450
confirming right then select one and
content you want to edit just
78

78

00:04:49.450  -->  00:04:51.820
click on edit again we don't get the
confirming right then select one and
79

79

00:04:51.820  -->  00:04:54.070
pop-up this time because we've actually
click on edit again we don't get the
80

80

00:04:54.070  -->  00:04:55.780
got a selected contact
pop-up this time because we've actually
81

81

00:04:55.780  -->  00:04:59.020
alright so that's working well alright
got a selected contact
82

82

00:04:59.020  -->  00:05:00.340
so we've got the code obviously we go
alright so that's working well alright
83

83

00:05:00.340  -->  00:05:03.190
back to our controller in the case of
so we've got the code obviously we go
84

84

00:05:03.190  -->  00:05:06.880
the selected contact being null
back to our controller in the case of
85

85

00:05:06.880  -->  00:05:07.990
in other words if there wasn't a
the selected contact being null
86

86

00:05:07.990  -->  00:05:09.970
selected contact so let us now write the
in other words if there wasn't a
87

87

00:05:09.970  -->  00:05:12.610
code in a situation where there was a
selected contact so let us now write the
88

88

00:05:12.610  -->  00:05:14.560
valid one selected so I'm gonna start
code in a situation where there was a
89

89

00:05:14.560  -->  00:05:17.620
down here and what we're going to do is
valid one selected so I'm gonna start
90

90

00:05:17.620  -->  00:05:19.780
create that dialogue so that we can pop
down here and what we're going to do is
91

91

00:05:19.780  -->  00:05:21.760
up the dialogue containing the fields and
create that dialogue so that we can pop
92

92

00:05:21.760  -->  00:05:24.930
enable the user to edit so start...
up the dialogue containing the fields and
93

93

00:05:24.930  -->  00:05:28.240
...
enable the user to edit so start...
94

94

00:05:28.240  -->  00:06:59.800
...
...
95

95

00:06:59.800  -->  00:07:05.290
and
...
96

96

00:07:05.290  -->  00:07:07.990
interesting enough intellij is smart enough
and
97

97

00:07:07.990  -->  00:07:08.830
figure out that we've got some
interesting enough intellij is smart enough
98

98

00:07:08.830  -->  00:07:11.080
duplicated code in this file so we could
figure out that we've got some
99

99

00:07:11.080  -->  00:07:12.430
have made a method or done this and some
duplicated code in this file so we could
100

100

00:07:12.430  -->  00:07:14.770
other way but I'll leave that for now we
have made a method or done this and some
101

101

00:07:14.770  -->  00:07:16.450
know that this code is duplicated from the
other way but I'll leave that for now we
102

102

00:07:16.450  -->  00:07:19.420
code that we added up here we work on
know that this code is duplicated from the
103

103

00:07:19.420  -->  00:07:21.040
the show add contact but leave that
code that we added up here we work on
104

104

00:07:21.040  -->  00:07:23.550
for now for the simplicity as we go through
the show add contact but leave that
105

105

00:07:23.550  -->  00:07:27.340
alright so again we just add
for now for the simplicity as we go through
106

106

00:07:27.340  -->  00:07:30.700
the rest of the code so...
alright so again we just add
107

107

00:07:30.700  -->  00:07:34.510
...
the rest of the code so...
108

108

00:07:34.510  -->  00:08:46.340
...
...
109

109

00:08:46.340  -->  00:08:50.940
....i'm going
...
110

110

00:08:50.940  -->  00:08:52.830
to touch on the changes from the add
....i'm going
111

111

00:08:52.830  -->  00:08:55.040
method and most of these occur after
to touch on the changes from the add
112

112

00:08:55.040  -->  00:08:57.410
we've added the buttons to the dialogue so
method and most of these occur after
113

113

00:08:57.410  -->  00:08:59.070
first i'm setting the title of the dialog
we've added the buttons to the dialogue so
114

114

00:08:59.070  -->  00:09:03.410
to add contact on line 74 the second
first i'm setting the title of the dialog
115

115

00:09:03.410  -->  00:09:04.620
rather than getting a reference to the
to add contact on line 74 the second
116

116

00:09:04.620  -->  00:09:06.570
contact controller when the user presses
rather than getting a reference to the
117

117

00:09:06.570  -->  00:09:09.590
ok i'm actually getting up front because
contact controller when the user presses
118

118

00:09:09.590  -->  00:09:12.090
we want the contact controller to
ok i'm actually getting up front because
119

119

00:09:12.090  -->  00:09:14.940
populate the dialogue values with the
we want the contact controller to
120

120

00:09:14.940  -->  00:09:17.780
existing value for the contact to do so
populate the dialogue values with the
121

121

00:09:17.780  -->  00:09:19.460
i'm calling the edit contact method
existing value for the contact to do so
122

122

00:09:19.460  -->  00:09:20.840
which we're going to be adding to the
i'm calling the edit contact method
123

123

00:09:20.840  -->  00:09:23.520
contact controller in a minute and third
which we're going to be adding to the
124

124

00:09:23.520  -->  00:09:26.430
and last if the user presses ok we call
contact controller in a minute and third
125

125

00:09:26.430  -->  00:09:27.960
the update contact method from the
and last if the user presses ok we call
126

126

00:09:27.960  -->  00:09:30.270
contact controller again and we'll be
the update contact method from the
127

127

00:09:30.270  -->  00:09:31.910
adding that method shortly as well
contact controller again and we'll be
128

128

00:09:31.910  -->  00:09:34.280
alright so let's go back to the contact
adding that method shortly as well
129

129

00:09:34.280  -->  00:09:37.740
control and add those methods so the
alright so let's go back to the contact
130

130

00:09:37.740  -->  00:09:40.220
first one
control and add those methods so the
131

131

00:09:40.220  -->  00:09:47.960
...
first one
132

132

accidentally forgot to put something in
190

190

00:13:21.060  -->  00:13:23.640
record we got it to crash at startup so you
the notes field for a particular
191

191

00:13:23.640  -->  00:13:24.960
may not notice that when you doing that
record we got it to crash at startup so you
192

192

00:13:24.960  -->  00:13:26.330
when you're adding a new record until you
may not notice that when you doing that
193

193

00:13:26.330  -->  00:13:28.710
get to the stage of reloading the data
when you're adding a new record until you
194

194

00:13:28.710  -->  00:13:30.690
so if that's the case just gonna come
get to the stage of reloading the data

over here to the contacts . xml edit and
197

197

00:13:35.070  -->  00:13:37.460
in a real-world application you wouldn't
put some values in there and obviously
198

198

00:13:37.460  -->  00:13:38.720
allow that to happen you would actually
in a real-world application you wouldn't
199

199

00:13:38.720  -->  00:13:40.830
you want to make sure that you've got
allow that to happen you would actually
200

200

00:13:40.830  -->  00:13:44.030
the ability to enter null values or have some
you want to make sure that you've got
201

201

00:13:44.030  -->  00:13:46.680
sort of verification validation to avoid
the ability to enter null values or have some
202

202

00:13:46.680  -->  00:13:47.150
that
sort of verification validation to avoid
