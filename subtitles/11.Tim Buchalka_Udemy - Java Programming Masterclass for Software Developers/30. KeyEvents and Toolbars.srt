1

00:00:05,250  -->  00:00:11,680
ok so let's now implement a way for the
user to delete items by pressing the delete
2

2

00:00:11,680  -->  00:00:16,800
key now when the user selects an
item and presses the the delete key we
3

3

00:00:16,800  -->  00:00:19,960
could do exactly what we do when they
right click and select Delete from the
4

4

00:00:19,960  -->  00:00:23,370
context menu and that's probably the
easiest way to do it so let's do that
5

5

00:00:23,370  -->  00:00:28,900
now so to achieve this we want to start listening for when a user presses a key when
6

6

00:00:28,900  -->  00:00:33,820
the list view itself has got focus so
typically a controller is given focus when
7

7

00:00:33,820  -->  00:00:38,040
the user clicks on it or clicks within it now for example when the user clicks
8

8

00:00:38,040  -->  00:00:43,430
within a text field it would be given focus
when the user presses a key a key event
9

9

00:00:43,430  -->  00:00:48,010
is raised and a key event handlers
associated with the text field will then
10

10

00:00:48,010  -->  00:00:53,120
be called and if their are key event handlers
associated with other controls they won't
11

11

00:00:53,120  -->  00:00:58,800
be called at that point so the focus
determines which controls event handlers
12

12

00:00:58,800  -->  00:01:03,980
are called when an event is raised so to associate a key event handler with a list
13

13

00:01:03,980  -->  00:01:07,960
view what we need to do is set its on
key press property in the fxml
14

14

00:01:07,960  -->  00:01:11,870
then we'll call upon our event handler once that is done so lets go to our fxml
15

15

00:01:11,870  -->  00:01:16,790
for the main window because that
of course is where the list view is and
16

16

00:01:16,790  -->  00:01:22,350
on here on line 26 we want to add that so
we needed an ID which we've already got
17

17

00:01:22,350  -->  00:01:30,610
there we need to put the set the on key press property and call our method
18

18

00:01:30,610  -->  00:01:38,710
which is.....
19

19

00:01:38,710  -->  00:01:46,360
....
20

20

00:01:46,360  -->  00:01:52,620
.....
21

21

00:01:53,410  -->  00:02:14,100
....
22

22

00:02:15,100  -->  00:02:33,450
....
23

23

00:02:33,450  -->  00:02:40,000
.....if the selected item isn't null what we need to do is check to see if
24

24

00:02:40,000  -->  00:02:45,970
the user has press the delete key so
let's go ahead and add the code for that so...
25

25

00:02:45,970  -->  00:03:07,730
....
26

26

00:03:07,730  -->  00:03:12,490
...so once that's
done if they have pressed it so we have determine
27

27

00:03:12,490  -->  00:03:17,120
that we got a valid selected item and they have pressed the delete key we confirm that
28

28

00:03:17,120  -->  00:03:22,690
then we can call the delete item passing the selected item which was the
29

29

00:03:22,690  -->  00:03:25,220
item that is currently beyond
30

30

00:03:25,220  -->  00:03:35,410
that we have selected on the screen so let's try running to see if it
works so first we should be able to
31

31

00:03:35,410  -->  00:03:38,470
click on some things and do a right click
that still works but now if I come down
32

32

00:03:38,470  -->  00:03:43,120
here say to this one here and press the
delete button del button on my keyboard we get
33

33

00:03:43,120  -->  00:03:48,590
the same pop up dialog which we would expect for delete and note that in that case
34

34

00:03:48,590  -->  00:03:51,660
that's the equivalent of this one so
this one's got an extra option the
35

35

00:03:51,660  -->  00:03:58,340
context menu press delete then it brings up the dialogue but
when we actually press Delete of course
36

36

00:03:58,340  -->  00:04:02,340
we get the confirmation dialog
straightaway and just confirming if I delete
37

37

00:04:02,340  -->  00:04:05,570
that by click ok the items get deleted successfully
38

38

00:04:06,940  -->  00:04:11,370
and just incidentally those confirmation
dialog if I select it again on the screen they
39

39

00:04:11,370  -->  00:04:15,870
can sometimes irritate users and the thing
also the user can develop a
40

40

00:04:15,870  -->  00:04:18,360
blindness towards those dialogue that
often pop up
41

41

00:04:18,360  -->  00:04:21,980
in other words they just stop reading them
and click OK very common to see that
42

42

00:04:21,980  -->  00:04:26,780
and what you probably want to do in a real-world
application will have a way for the user
43

43

00:04:26,780  -->  00:04:31,140
turned off the confirmation dialogs
now possibly by offering a settings a
44

44

00:04:31,140  -->  00:04:34,150
setting rather in the Settings dialog or in
a Settings dialog
45

45

00:04:34,930  -->  00:04:40,340
but we won't worry about that right now because at this point
we got a functional UI and it's not
46

46

00:04:40,340  -->  00:04:44,520
pretty and we certainly wouldn't leave it
like this but learned quite a few things not the
47

47

00:04:44,520  -->  00:04:48,900
least is how to layout a main window
populate a list view control handle
48

48

00:04:48,900  -->  00:04:53,610
selection and key events create menus
provide a cell factory and even
49

49

00:04:53,610  -->  00:04:58,770
create context menus in addition to that
we've also learn that using data binding means we
50

50

00:04:58,770  -->  00:05:02,910
don't have to explicitly update the UI
when the data backing control changes
51

51

00:05:02,910  -->  00:05:07,600
and that's obviously a good thing and the
other good thing to note is that everything
52

52

00:05:07,600  -->  00:05:10,400
we've learned in relation to the
ListView control can also be applied
53

53

00:05:10,400  -->  00:05:15,990
applied to controls like the table view the TreeView and the tree table view
54

54

00:05:15,990  -->  00:05:20,940
and these all display data collections so let's
do a few more enhancements to our UI
55

55

00:05:20,940  -->  00:05:25,220
just so that we can see how to
do some other common tasks what we gonna do
56

56

00:05:25,220  -->  00:05:29,780
is we want to start by adding a tool bar to our application now its only gonna have the new
57

57

00:05:29,780  -->  00:05:33,550
item on it but that's ok because it
will still serve as a good example how to
58

58

00:05:33,550  -->  00:05:39,940
add a tool bar to an application now since
we want both the menu and the toolbar
59

59

00:05:39,940  -->  00:05:47,670
to display at the top of our application
we are going to move our menu into a VBox so let's go back to our FXML
60

60

00:05:47,670  -->  00:06:04,950
looking at implementing that change back to main window we got our menu here so let's go ahead and put the menu bar in a Vbox and move the menu itself
61

61

00:06:04,950  -->  00:06:07,950
into the Vbox....
62

62

00:06:10,030  -->  00:06:13,460
now we are gonna add our tool bar
63

63

00:06:13,460  -->  00:06:18,500
below the menu because that is a conventional position when both exist we are
64

64

00:06:18,500  -->  00:06:24,140
gonna layout our toolbar items within an Hbox
65

65

00:06:24,860  -->  00:06:37,430
so.....and within the tool bar
66

66

00:06:37,430  -->  00:06:41,520
we want this new item to be a button and the good news is
that we can reuse the event handler that
67

67

00:06:41,520  -->  00:06:45,740
we have coded for the new menu item now there
isn't any code in the event handler the
68

68

00:06:45,740  -->  00:06:49,580
assumes that the event was raised so the handler doesn't care enough in other words whether
69

69

00:06:49,580  -->  00:06:54,030
the user click the Menu Item tool bar item will perform some other action and
70

70

00:06:54,030  -->  00:06:57,920
speaking about that that is a really good idea
to always keep in mind with this sort of
71

71

00:06:57,920  -->  00:07:01,050
thing when you are coding event handlers trying to make them as generic as
72

72

00:07:01,050  -->  00:07:04,800
possible so in other words always be
thinking about reusing that code in some
73

73

00:07:04,800  -->  00:07:16,450
way so to add the button to the toolbar we add...
74

74

00:07:16,450  -->  00:07:21,620
...
75

75

00:07:21,620  -->  00:07:27,200
....so that should be all we need to do now to add the toolbar
76

76

00:07:27,200  -->  00:07:33,150
until we have re-positioned things so they both appear on the screen you can see we still got our file menu
77

77

00:07:33,150  -->  00:07:38,920
it should still work which you can see we've now got our toolbar I can click on new and that
78

78

00:07:38,920  -->  00:07:41,970
does the same thing that also brings up
the dialog box so that we can add a new
79

79

00:07:41,970  -->  00:07:47,270
to-do item that's great and it's working
but we usually display icons on the
80

80

00:07:47,270  -->  00:07:51,710
tool bar so let's go back and change
our button to display an icon
81

81

00:07:51,710  -->  00:07:55,610
rather than the text and what we do is
we used the same icon jar file
82

82

00:07:55,610  -->  00:08:02,730
we use in the JavaFX controls lecture I'm gonna close it down so let's go ahead now and
83

83

00:08:02,730  -->  00:08:11,720
add that same jar file to the projects class so we can go back in a couple of way we can go to file project
84

84

00:08:11,720  -->  00:08:17,310
structure and select modules and click on the +
85

85

00:08:17,310  -->  00:08:20,660
button down here and click on jars or directories
86

86

00:08:21,180  -->  00:08:26,520
and what we wanted to do their is navigate to the folder that contained our
87

87

00:08:26,520  -->  00:08:31,580
earlier project which is the JavaFX controls
lecture so in my case i believe i called
88

88

00:08:31,580  -->  00:08:34,170
it controls so scroll up here
89

89

00:08:34,170  -->  00:08:38,830
controls if I click into that project
this is the file we want their
90

90

00:08:38,830  -->  00:08:46,510
jlfgr-1_0.jar so select that click on ok and IntelliJ pops up and asks what's
91

91

00:08:46,510  -->  00:08:51,690
inside the jar file we select classes even
though the jar contains icons and that's
92

92

00:08:51,690  -->  00:08:57,400
because certain classes adds the jar file
to the class path so that those icons can be
93

93

00:08:57,400  -->  00:09:01,240
basically found by IntelliJ and that is what we
want to do here so click on ok
94

94

00:09:01,240  -->  00:09:08,450
and you can see its has been added successfully so clicking ok will close the dialog so I want
95

95

00:09:08,450  -->  00:09:13,470
to do is now change it so we're
using that graphic so come back here
96

96

00:09:13,470  -->  00:09:20,990
to button leave the text new for now but we're
going to open this up here so we are gonna remove the
97

97

00:09:20,990  -->  00:09:24,590
closing tag for now and I'm going to add
a section in here we are gonna add...
98

98

00:09:24,590  -->  00:09:46,380
...
99

99

00:09:46,380  -->  00:09:56,400
....
100

100

00:09:56,400  -->  00:09:59,950
...
101

101

00:09:59,950  -->  00:10:13,630
....and the other thing
102

102

00:10:13,630  -->  00:10:23,730
here is with the text now actually let just run it first we get this
error because of the import and its having a
103

103

00:10:23,730  -->  00:10:27,390
problem with this reference on line 27 to
graphic
104

104

00:10:29,560  -->  00:10:36,160
and that will probably fix if I close the button tag so.... that fixes it like their because
105

105

00:10:36,160  -->  00:10:42,250
it was obviously part of the that was
obviously associated with button so if we try running it again now
106

106

00:10:42,250  -->  00:10:48,500
and incidentally that's normal I think you
saw in previous video IntelliJ complains
107

107

00:10:48,500  -->  00:10:53,110
that it can't find the icon we found
that in that previous example so long as you type it
108

108

00:10:53,110  -->  00:10:56,810
exactly like this it will still work at
run time that's more or less an IntelliJ
109

109

00:10:56,810  -->  00:11:03,660
bug their so we run it again and we can see its now working we've got our icon our new icon we've also got the text as
110

110

00:11:03,660  -->  00:11:09,310
well and I think we should remove this text to
the right of the icon but if we do we
111

111

00:11:09,310  -->  00:11:12,660
move it the user might not understand
what that button is for even though its
112

112

00:11:12,660  -->  00:11:16,350
probably fairly clear that its a button
to create something new what we should
113

113

00:11:16,350  -->  00:11:21,750
probably do in its place after we removed
the text is to add a tool tip that pops up
114

114

00:11:21,750  -->  00:11:25,560
when they hover their cursor up the toolbar
button to tell them what the
115

115

00:11:25,560  -->  00:11:30,580
functionality of the particular button is
and lets close it down and do that
116

116

00:11:30,580  -->  00:11:35,730
button itself has got a tool tip property
so let's go ahead first and remove the
117

117

00:11:35,730  -->  00:11:38,730
texts property...
118

118

00:11:40,020  -->  00:11:50,350
....
119

119

00:11:50,350  -->  00:12:01,840
...so when we run that we get an error and
120

120

00:12:01,840  -->  00:12:06,980
if we scroll up that is the error their
121

121

00:12:06,980  -->  00:12:12,540
we get unable to coerce add a new to do item to
class Javafx.scene.control.tooltip
122

122

00:12:12,540  -->  00:12:17,420
now this is one case where the
obvious way isn't the way to do it and
123

123

00:12:17,420  -->  00:12:22,090
it's where IntelliJ can lead us astray so
what's happening here why we
124

124

00:12:22,090  -->  00:12:24,670
are getting that error its because it looks like we've
done the right thing we just introduced
125

125

00:12:24,670  -->  00:12:29,290
the tool tip property and set it correctly
why it isn't working well the thing is the
126

126

00:12:29,290  -->  00:12:34,030
buttons tool tip property expects to be
assigned an instance of the tool tip
127

127

00:12:34,030  -->  00:12:40,690
class not a string then we run the
JavaFX runtime loads the FXML it's
128

128

00:12:40,690  -->  00:12:43,980
going to convert the value we've assigned
129

129

00:12:43,980  -->  00:12:48,340
which is a string into an instance of
the tool tip class it obviously
130

130

00:12:48,340  -->  00:12:51,780
can't do that because they're separate
classes and consequently the reason why
131

131

00:12:51,780  -->  00:12:56,010
throw an exception now what's interesting
here is that IntelliJ didn't complain
132

132

00:12:56,010  -->  00:13:01,260
about the FXML and actual fact that
suggests tool tip when we start typing our button
133

133

00:13:01,260  -->  00:13:09,230
element if remember I just delete that
briefly tool tip so IntelliJ
134

134

00:13:09,230  -->  00:13:14,460
it telling us giving us a tip that's its the right thing to type put it back and the reason for that it
135

135

00:13:14,460  -->  00:13:19,220
knows that tool tip is valid and does that from inspecting the button class that
136

136

00:13:19,220  -->  00:13:23,230
there is a tool tip property in there but
for some reason didn't understand that
137

137

00:13:23,230  -->  00:13:28,640
the tool tip property expects a class and
not a string now you may have noticed some
138

138

00:13:28,640  -->  00:13:31,640
FXML elements begin with a capital letter and
others don't
139

139

00:13:32,380  -->  00:13:36,410
with generalyl start with the capital letter when
defining a class we start with a
140

140

00:13:36,410  -->  00:13:40,140
lowercase letter when referring to a
property within a class for example
141

141

00:13:40,140  -->  00:13:43,130
let's take a look at the button element
and you can see that button on screen
142

142

00:13:43,130  -->  00:13:44,350
on line 21
143

143

00:13:44,350  -->  00:13:49,010
is a class and so begins with a capital
B text is a property of button
144

144

00:13:49,010  -->  00:13:54,430
which we've now deleted but its obviously started with a lowercase
T previously and on action is another
145

145

00:13:54,430  -->  00:13:58,270
example is still on the screen there
start with the lower case letter and
146

146

00:13:58,270  -->  00:14:02,600
expects a method name and graphic is also a property of button that we've used to
147

147

00:14:02,600  -->  00:14:08,340
surround our image view in and that expects a Node instance for its value
148

148

00:14:08,340  -->  00:14:12,400
and we can't directly assign it in our case of
course you can see on the screen on line
149

149

00:14:12,400  -->  00:14:17,330
23 we assing an ImageView and the ImageView image
properties expects the instance of the
150

150

00:14:17,330  -->  00:14:22,350
image class and fxml allows us to define
without having to put up with an image
151

151

00:14:22,350  -->  00:14:27,540
tags so FXML seems to be inconsistent
about this in other words sometimes when
152

152

00:14:27,540  -->  00:14:31,480
assigning a property that takes a class
instance we have to write the definition
153

153

00:14:31,480  -->  00:14:33,170
within the properties tags
154

154

00:14:33,170  -->  00:14:38,140
sometimes we don't as in this case so the
image class has a URL property which was
155

155

00:14:38,140  -->  00:14:43,760
set to the path for the icon that we want to
see there you can see that on line 24 so
156

156

00:14:43,760  -->  00:14:48,430
it's all this mean well it means we have to
assign the tool tip for our button in the same way
157

157

00:14:48,430  -->  00:14:57,030
that we assign its graphic so we are gonna remove the
tool tip from this line here...
158

158

00:14:57,030  -->  00:14:58,150
...
159

159

00:14:58,150  -->  00:15:19,980
....
160

160

00:15:20,630  -->  00:15:25,590
so let's run that and see that it works you
can see its now working we haven't got
161

161

00:15:25,590  -->  00:15:30,560
an error anymore if we hover over it theirs our tool tip on the new to do item
162

162

00:15:31,280  -->  00:15:37,530
obviously if we click its still working so I'm going to finish the video here now in the next video let's look at
163

163

00:15:37,530  -->  00:15:40,250
enhancing this UI in some other ways see you
in the next video
