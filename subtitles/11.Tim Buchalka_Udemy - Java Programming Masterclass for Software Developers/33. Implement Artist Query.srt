00:00:05,240  -->  00:00:07,160
- [Narrator] Alright, so
we ended the previous video
2

2

00:00:07,160  -->  00:00:11,180
by talking about, the need
to add a method to get
3

3

00:00:11,180  -->  00:00:13,060
the albums for an artist.
4

4

00:00:13,060  -->  00:00:15,110
And so we're going to return
a list of album objects.
5

5

00:00:15,110  -->  00:00:17,200
So let's go ahead and
write that query albums
6

6

00:00:17,200  -->  00:00:18,950
for artist ID method.
7

7

00:00:21,290  -->  00:00:22,980
So I'm just going to start
8

8

00:00:22,980  -->  00:00:27,680
I'll actually start below
the query artist method.
9

9

00:00:27,680  -->  00:00:28,510
So,
10

10

00:00:29,680  -->  00:00:32,290
we'll start with the method signatures,
11

11

00:00:32,290  -->  00:00:36,140
so public, it's going to
be a list of album objects
12

12

00:00:36,140  -->  00:00:38,900
is what we're going to return.
13

13

00:00:38,900  -->  00:00:41,060
And it's query artists,
14

14

00:00:41,060  -->  00:00:42,700
query album,
15

15

00:00:42,700  -->  00:00:43,780
or artist ID.
16

16

00:00:45,560  -->  00:00:49,160
And we get past the ID,
which is the actual record
17

17

00:00:49,160  -->  00:00:50,590
in sequa-lite.
18

18

00:00:50,590  -->  00:00:52,970
So I'll start with a try,
19

19

00:00:52,970  -->  00:00:56,370
then we're going to do a
query, albums by artist ID,
20

20

00:00:56,370  -->  00:00:57,870
dot set it to one,
21

21

00:01:00,830  -->  00:01:03,860
or part of the first field basically,
22

22

00:01:03,860  -->  00:01:06,310
first column in the data base
and ID being the parameter
23

23

00:01:06,310  -->  00:01:08,040
that's past in this method.
24

24

00:01:08,040  -->  00:01:12,990
Then we want results set,
results is equal to query,
25

25

00:01:12,990  -->  00:01:15,270
albums by artist ID,
26

26

00:01:15,270  -->  00:01:16,770
dot execute query,
27

27

00:01:19,620  -->  00:01:20,590
and we're getting this here at the moment
28

28

00:01:20,590  -->  00:01:22,280
because we haven't handled the exception
29

29

00:01:22,280  -->  00:01:25,590
which we'll be doing once we
get to the end of the try.
30

30

00:01:25,590  -->  00:01:26,820
List,
31

31

00:01:26,820  -->  00:01:27,650
album,
32

32

00:01:28,530  -->  00:01:29,720
albums,
33

33

00:01:29,720  -->  00:01:31,470
equal to your A list,
34

34

00:01:33,900  -->  00:01:35,650
all results dot next,
35

35

00:01:38,730  -->  00:01:40,290
and we're going through the data base now,
36

36

00:01:40,290  -->  00:01:41,560
one record at a time,
37

37

00:01:41,560  -->  00:01:43,320
brand new album object,
38

38

00:01:43,320  -->  00:01:45,240
album equals new album,
39

39

00:01:48,620  -->  00:01:50,030
album dot set ID,
40

40

00:01:52,680  -->  00:01:56,160
the results dot get it
and be the first row
41

41

00:01:56,160  -->  00:01:58,460
that's returned first column rather,
42

42

00:01:58,460  -->  00:02:00,040
album dot set name.
43

43

00:02:01,810  -->  00:02:05,390
That's gonna be results
dot get string too,
44

44

00:02:07,500  -->  00:02:09,080
then album dot set,
45

45

00:02:10,150  -->  00:02:12,650
artist ID, that's gonna be ID,
46

46

00:02:14,390  -->  00:02:15,560
albums dot at,
47

47

00:02:17,700  -->  00:02:21,550
to our albums or album
rather we'll just retrieve
48

48

00:02:21,550  -->  00:02:23,050
from the database.
49

49

00:02:25,220  -->  00:02:27,570
Then we gotta return from this method
50

50

00:02:27,570  -->  00:02:31,240
the albums, the list
that we've just created
51

51

00:02:32,200  -->  00:02:35,390
and then let's also add the catch
52

52

00:02:35,390  -->  00:02:36,780
to get rid of all those zeroes now,
53

53

00:02:36,780  -->  00:02:41,210
catch seeker exception, E and
we'll just print out a message
54

54

00:02:41,210  -->  00:02:44,290
if we do get a sequel file
there for some reason,
55

55

00:02:44,290  -->  00:02:47,200
query filed plus E dot get message,
56

56

00:02:48,640  -->  00:02:53,570
so we see something on the
screen and then you'll turn null.
57

57

00:02:53,570  -->  00:02:56,520
Alright so that's our
query album for artist,
58

58

00:02:56,520  -->  00:02:59,100
that should be albums rather,
59

59

00:02:59,100  -->  00:03:01,890
query albums for artist ID method.
60

60

00:03:01,890  -->  00:03:03,820
And a way of saying
there isn't really new,
61

61

00:03:03,820  -->  00:03:05,290
there's nothing really new there,
62

62

00:03:05,290  -->  00:03:08,930
we set in the artist ID
and the prepared statement
63

63

00:03:08,930  -->  00:03:12,570
up here on line 227 and
then we're running it
64

64

00:03:12,570  -->  00:03:14,860
and we had looped through the results
65

65

00:03:14,860  -->  00:03:18,170
and we're studying the artist
ID and the album instance
66

66

00:03:18,170  -->  00:03:22,020
one thing that's slightly
different is here on line 235
67

67

00:03:22,020  -->  00:03:24,850
what we're doing is were
setting the artist ID
68

68

00:03:24,850  -->  00:03:27,960
and the album instance
by using the Vel-ly path
69

69

00:03:27,960  -->  00:03:30,250
to the method rather than
getting it from the results
70

70

00:03:30,250  -->  00:03:33,150
because it's the same, we
know it's the same artist
71

71

00:03:33,150  -->  00:03:35,470
to here because we're
querying a specific artist
72

72

00:03:35,470  -->  00:03:38,080
there's no need for us to
do that extra retrieval
73

73

00:03:38,080  -->  00:03:42,180
from the database so we're
probably saving a bit of time.
74

74

00:03:42,180  -->  00:03:44,920
Alright so at this point we
can now get a list of albums
75

75

00:03:44,920  -->  00:03:49,520
based on an artist ID but now
we need a way to display them.
76

76

00:03:49,520  -->  00:03:51,570
Now what we're going to do
is reuse the existing table
77

77

00:03:51,570  -->  00:03:55,410
to do this and only
display the album name.
78

78

00:03:55,410  -->  00:03:59,270
Now fortunately the artist
class stores the artist name
79

79

00:03:59,270  -->  00:04:02,780
in a variable called names,
let's go back and have a look.
80

80

00:04:02,780  -->  00:04:06,560
We've got album, we've got
a name there for our album
81

81

00:04:06,560  -->  00:04:10,030
and then for our artist
we're also using name,
82

82

00:04:10,030  -->  00:04:13,340
so we're using the same name for both,
83

83

00:04:13,340  -->  00:04:15,800
so the reason I'm mentioning
that is the data binding
84

84

00:04:15,800  -->  00:04:18,170
will work for both types of data.
85

85

00:04:18,170  -->  00:04:20,710
Now this is probably a bit of a hack
86

86

00:04:20,710  -->  00:04:23,860
so we wouldn't really do this
in a real world application
87

87

00:04:23,860  -->  00:04:27,510
we'd probably get around that
by having multiple tables
88

88

00:04:27,510  -->  00:04:30,580
each on a tab or perhaps
have multiple tables
89

89

00:04:30,580  -->  00:04:33,030
but only one visible at a time.
90

90

00:04:33,030  -->  00:04:35,860
Another way of doing it
could be to use a combo box,
91

91

00:04:35,860  -->  00:04:38,530
like the sequel browser application does,
92

92

00:04:38,530  -->  00:04:40,360
and display the selected table.
93

93

00:04:40,360  -->  00:04:41,870
So there's many ways we could handle this
94

94

00:04:41,870  -->  00:04:44,160
but since this is at a UI lecture
95

95

00:04:44,160  -->  00:04:46,830
we're gonna go down the easiest route.
96

96

00:04:46,830  -->  00:04:49,780
Now we could refactor the
effects ID and the artist table
97

97

00:04:49,780  -->  00:04:51,620
variable names but we're
going to leave them
98

98

00:04:51,620  -->  00:04:53,580
as they are as well.
99

99

00:04:53,580  -->  00:04:56,120
Now what we do need
though is an event handler
100

100

00:04:56,120  -->  00:04:59,020
that will respond when
the user selects an artist
101

101

00:04:59,020  -->  00:05:01,440
and clicks the show albums artist button
102

102

00:05:01,440  -->  00:05:03,400
in our GUI interface.
103

103

00:05:03,400  -->  00:05:05,460
Now that's going to be very
similar to the one displaying
104

104

00:05:05,460  -->  00:05:08,120
the lists of artist but since
we're only going to call up
105

105

00:05:08,120  -->  00:05:10,410
when the buttons pressed,
we can go ahead and use
106

106

00:05:10,410  -->  00:05:12,460
an anonymous task for this.
107

107

00:05:12,460  -->  00:05:15,380
So let's go back to our controller,
108

108

00:05:16,420  -->  00:05:19,080
so were going to go ahead
and write the method now,
109

109

00:05:19,080  -->  00:05:23,870
the event handler for the
query albums by artist button,
110

110

00:05:23,870  -->  00:05:26,900
so we're going to do public, void,
111

111

00:05:26,900  -->  00:05:28,500
list albums,
112

112

00:05:28,500  -->  00:05:29,410
for artist,
113

113

00:05:31,220  -->  00:05:32,820
and we'll annotate that,
114

114

00:05:32,820  -->  00:05:33,740
fix it all,
115

115

00:05:35,690  -->  00:05:37,040
now the actual code is going too,
116

116

00:05:37,040  -->  00:05:38,580
we're going to start off
117

117

00:05:38,580  -->  00:05:39,970
by getting the selected items,
118

118

00:05:39,970  -->  00:05:41,390
so final artists,
119

119

00:05:43,120  -->  00:05:45,370
artist is equal to artists,
120

120

00:05:47,010  -->  00:05:50,780
artist table dot get selection model,
121

121

00:05:50,780  -->  00:05:52,610
dot get selected item,
122

122

00:05:57,120  -->  00:05:59,340
if artist is not a good to know,
123

123

00:05:59,340  -->  00:06:02,590
so it's valid somethings been selected,
124

124

00:06:05,030  -->  00:06:07,030
actually rather, what we
wanna do is we wanna test
125

125

00:06:07,030  -->  00:06:08,200
if it is null.
126

126

00:06:09,040  -->  00:06:10,790
So if artist is null,
127

127

00:06:12,000  -->  00:06:13,260
then we want to know
about it at that point
128

128

00:06:13,260  -->  00:06:15,960
we're gonna put no artist selected,
129

129

00:06:15,960  -->  00:06:17,320
so that would indicate as a problem,
130

130

00:06:17,320  -->  00:06:18,950
we're gonna return,
131

131

00:06:18,950  -->  00:06:21,610
because we need that valid
artist to be able to take this
132

132

00:06:21,610  -->  00:06:23,690
process further.
133

133

00:06:23,690  -->  00:06:25,700
Alright, so we're going
to go ahead now and use
134

134

00:06:25,700  -->  00:06:27,920
an anonymous task for this.
135

135

00:06:27,920  -->  00:06:28,750
So task,
136

136

00:06:30,840  -->  00:06:33,650
and we want an observable list,
137

137

00:06:33,650  -->  00:06:35,070
of album objects,
138

138

00:06:37,440  -->  00:06:40,610
and collect task is equal to new task,
139

139

00:06:42,150  -->  00:06:43,300
and it's observable list again
140

140

00:06:43,300  -->  00:06:44,720
of album objects.
141

141

00:06:46,620  -->  00:06:49,530
And then we want to override,
a cool method there,
142

142

00:06:49,530  -->  00:06:52,280
so I'm just going to select that,
143

143

00:06:53,710  -->  00:06:55,690
and we're not going to return null,
144

144

00:06:55,690  -->  00:06:59,420
in fact we're going to
return is effects collections
145

145

00:06:59,420  -->  00:07:02,090
dot, it's observable array list.
146

146

00:07:04,370  -->  00:07:07,860
It's going to be data
source, dot an instance,
147

147

00:07:07,860  -->  00:07:10,380
dot and our method query albums
148

148

00:07:10,380  -->  00:07:11,460
for artist ID
149

149

00:07:13,100  -->  00:07:15,620
and it's going to be artist dot get ID,
150

150

00:07:15,620  -->  00:07:17,350
the ID that we need to past-a this method
151

151

00:07:17,350  -->  00:07:19,840
that we've just retrieved.
152

152

00:07:19,840  -->  00:07:20,680
Like so.
153

153

00:07:23,820  -->  00:07:26,810
And we also put a semi colon
there to make that valid,
154

154

00:07:26,810  -->  00:07:30,120
so that's giving us the list
of albums for the artist
155

155

00:07:30,120  -->  00:07:33,800
and we then want a need
to do artist table,
156

156

00:07:33,800  -->  00:07:36,220
dot items property, dot bind,
157

157

00:07:38,810  -->  00:07:40,890
task, dot value property,
158

158

00:07:43,220  -->  00:07:44,470
and new thread,
159

159

00:07:46,240  -->  00:07:47,490
task dot start.
160

160

00:07:49,570  -->  00:07:51,520
Now we need to fix this up as well
161

161

00:07:51,520  -->  00:07:53,000
and what we need to do first of all
162

162

00:07:53,000  -->  00:07:55,460
we're going to go back in and add a button
163

163

00:07:55,460  -->  00:07:58,400
to our FXML but then we also after that
164

164

00:07:58,400  -->  00:08:01,160
need to go through and make
the same changes to album
165

165

00:08:01,160  -->  00:08:02,710
that we have previously for artist,
166

166

00:08:02,710  -->  00:08:05,370
in other words making the, over here,
167

167

00:08:05,370  -->  00:08:08,100
we need to use these
simple, these properties,
168

168

00:08:08,100  -->  00:08:09,620
in our album object.
169

169

00:08:09,620  -->  00:08:10,450
So we'll do that shortly,
170

170

00:08:10,450  -->  00:08:12,450
but we'll start with the button,
171

171

00:08:12,450  -->  00:08:14,930
so we go back to the main FXML
172

172

00:08:14,930  -->  00:08:18,260
and what we want to do is
add for the show albums
173

173

00:08:18,260  -->  00:08:20,880
artist button, up here we
want to change this button
174

174

00:08:20,880  -->  00:08:23,180
to little bit, we're going to,
175

175

00:08:23,180  -->  00:08:25,830
leave the max with the pneumonic pausing
176

176

00:08:25,830  -->  00:08:28,050
and the text should be before.
177

177

00:08:28,050  -->  00:08:31,890
And at the start we just
want to add on action
178

178

00:08:33,730  -->  00:08:38,200
equals, and it's going
to be equal to our method
179

179

00:08:38,200  -->  00:08:41,080
we just wrote in that controller, so list,
180

180

00:08:41,080  -->  00:08:42,930
albums for artist.
181

181

00:08:42,930  -->  00:08:46,280
Okay, so it knows which
code needs to be executed.
182

182

00:08:46,280  -->  00:08:47,830
Alright now that we've added that,
183

183

00:08:47,830  -->  00:08:49,560
we then need to swing
back over as I mentioned
184

184

00:08:49,560  -->  00:08:53,810
to our album class and
make those changes as well.
185

185

00:08:53,810  -->  00:08:56,100
So we're going to start by
changing these three entries
186

186

00:08:56,100  -->  00:08:59,880
the ID the name and the
artist ID to the properties,
187

187

00:08:59,880  -->  00:09:02,740
different properties so
it's going to be simple,
188

188

00:09:02,740  -->  00:09:05,160
integer property for our ID
189

189

00:09:05,160  -->  00:09:07,480
and also for our artist ID.
190

190

00:09:07,480  -->  00:09:08,320
Simple,
191

191

00:09:09,530  -->  00:09:12,900
integer property and
then instead of a string
192

192

00:09:12,900  -->  00:09:16,960
it's going to be simple string property.
193

193

00:09:16,960  -->  00:09:20,710
For the name, we also
need a constructor now,
194

194

00:09:21,860  -->  00:09:24,400
constructor and we're
going to select none there.
195

195

00:09:24,400  -->  00:09:25,670
Because you want an empty constructor
196

196

00:09:25,670  -->  00:09:29,980
so that we can initialise
these three objects now.
197

197

00:09:29,980  -->  00:09:33,240
So we're going to start
with this dot ID equals new.
198

198

00:09:33,240  -->  00:09:35,960
Simple integer property,
199

199

00:09:35,960  -->  00:09:38,460
this dot name is equal to new,
200

200

00:09:39,470  -->  00:09:42,040
simple string property,
201

201

00:09:42,040  -->  00:09:46,200
and this dot artist ID equals
new, simple integer property.
202

202

00:09:47,540  -->  00:09:49,670
Alright so that's them initialised.
203

203

00:09:49,670  -->  00:09:53,680
And then our getters and
setters we just need to change
204

204

00:09:53,680  -->  00:09:56,610
code slightly, so that's
going to be ID dot get
205

205

00:09:56,610  -->  00:09:58,990
instead of just ID.
206

206

00:09:58,990  -->  00:10:01,960
So we're still returning
the primitive type here
207

207

00:10:01,960  -->  00:10:06,230
into this case, and then
luck was for the setters.
208

208

00:10:06,230  -->  00:10:10,500
We're gonna change that
slot listed ID dot set.
209

209

00:10:10,500  -->  00:10:11,330
ID.
210

210

00:10:12,750  -->  00:10:16,910
And for the name, we're
gonna return name dot get.
211

211

00:10:19,870  -->  00:10:21,700
It's dot name dot set.
212

212

00:10:23,060  -->  00:10:27,270
Name, and then for the
artist ID return artist ID
213

213

00:10:27,270  -->  00:10:30,270
dot get and this dot artist dot set,
214

214

00:10:37,520  -->  00:10:39,430
alright, so that should be it.
215

215

00:10:39,430  -->  00:10:41,350
So we're going back to controller,
216

216

00:10:41,350  -->  00:10:42,820
alright so we've still got this error
217

217

00:10:42,820  -->  00:10:45,270
and if we just have a
look at that error again
218

218

00:10:45,270  -->  00:10:46,250
you can see at the moment
219

219

00:10:46,250  -->  00:10:49,190
that the property cannot be applied
220

220

00:10:49,190  -->  00:10:53,090
from the sample dot model dot
artist to the java effects
221

221

00:10:53,090  -->  00:10:55,790
dot beans dot property dot
read only object property
222

222

00:10:55,790  -->  00:10:57,300
and then it's looking for album.
223

223

00:10:57,300  -->  00:11:00,110
That's because of this
definition up here on line 15,
224

224

00:11:00,110  -->  00:11:02,160
because we made it specific to an artist
225

225

00:11:02,160  -->  00:11:03,670
so as I said this is
a little bit of a hack
226

226

00:11:03,670  -->  00:11:07,500
but to get around it,
we just remove that type
227

227

00:11:08,660  -->  00:11:10,460
so we just basically
being a bit more generic
228

228

00:11:10,460  -->  00:11:12,910
with what we're saying in
the table view contains,
229

229

00:11:12,910  -->  00:11:14,510
the error then disappears
230

230

00:11:14,510  -->  00:11:16,440
and again because we've got the same
231

231

00:11:16,440  -->  00:11:20,130
property name in album, name
here which we're gonna be
232

232

00:11:20,130  -->  00:11:23,200
displaying on the screen
and also for artist,
233

233

00:11:23,200  -->  00:11:24,670
this will then work.
234

234

00:11:24,670  -->  00:11:27,010
So we go back and now run this,
235

235

00:11:27,010  -->  00:11:31,590
we should firstly find the list
of artist comes up correctly
236

236

00:11:31,590  -->  00:11:33,390
so we can see that's working okay.
237

237

00:11:33,390  -->  00:11:35,260
But now if we select a particular artist,
238

238

00:11:35,260  -->  00:11:37,400
say AC/DC for example,
239

239

00:11:37,400  -->  00:11:40,390
and click on show albums for the artist,
240

240

00:11:40,390  -->  00:11:43,200
we get a list of in this
case two entries or AC/DC
241

241

00:11:43,200  -->  00:11:46,190
for the albums so clearly
that's working okay.
242

242

00:11:46,190  -->  00:11:48,850
Now obviously we haven't
implemented the code here
243

243

00:11:48,850  -->  00:11:51,430
for list artist and when I
click on that nothing happens
244

244

00:11:51,430  -->  00:11:55,600
so let's work on getting that
operational in the next video.
