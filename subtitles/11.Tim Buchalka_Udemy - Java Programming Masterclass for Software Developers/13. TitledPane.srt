1

00:00:05,450  -->  00:00:10,500
so the last control we are going to look at in
this section is the titled pane and what
2

2

00:00:10,510  -->  00:00:16,110
this is as the name suggests a
titled pane with a pane and a title now
3

3

00:00:16,480  -->  00:00:20,730
the name of this class ends with pane but it's not actually a layout
4

4

00:00:21,100  -->  00:00:25,380
it is actually a control so let's add 1 to our group and see what it looks like and
5

5

00:00:25,750  -->  00:00:30,090
will give it a title and add a label to it just so we can really get a feel for
6

6

00:00:30,460  -->  00:00:44,790
what it looks like so come down here and start
typing....
7

7

00:00:45,160  -->  00:00:50,040
....
8

8

00:00:51,500  -->  00:00:58,060
....
9

9

00:00:58,430  -->  00:01:04,320
....within that
10

10

00:01:04,690  -->  00:01:12,140
will actually put a label as well so.....
11

11

00:01:12,510  -->  00:01:26,480
...ok so lets run that...and you can see titled pane their we can open and close it as you can see
12

12

00:01:26,850  -->  00:01:32,200
their and that is one of the features
of Titled pane in that we can actually
13

13

00:01:32,570  -->  00:01:36,520
click it then you can open and close it
so that you can actually hide the
14

14

00:01:36,890  -->  00:01:39,810
content which can be very useful
depending on the application you're
15

15

00:01:40,180  -->  00:01:44,200
creating and once you hide it all the contents are hidden other than the title and
16

16

00:01:44,570  -->  00:01:48,950
you can expand that out so you probably
asking now ok looks good but where
17

17

00:01:49,320  -->  00:01:52,580
will we actually use this well we can use this alone as you see now we can
18

18

00:01:52,950  -->  00:01:58,150
actually add to it and accordion control
now what an accordion control is is a group
19

19

00:01:58,520  -->  00:02:02,590
of tiled panes and only one pane is allowed
to be open at a time so that is probably
20

20

00:02:02,960  -->  00:02:06,140
something that you would use an
application so lets add two more titled
21

21

00:02:06,510  -->  00:02:14,190
panes and put them in an a accordion so you can
see what it looks like so close that down close the run window
22

22

00:02:15,130  -->  00:02:20,600
so what we actually do is we actually put it
put it within an accordion so
23

23

00:02:20,970  -->  00:02:28,780
so come down here and type....
24

24

00:02:29,150  -->  00:02:32,750
.....
25

25

00:02:33,120  -->  00:02:39,490
...so thats
26

26

00:02:39,860  -->  00:02:50,360
our accordion and because we are doing panes we are gonna put...and lets take our titled pane
27

27

00:02:50,730  -->  00:02:58,420
paste that in there and we're going to
remove the grid pane.rowcolumn index
28

28

00:02:58,790  -->  00:03:05,640
because obviously we've done that in the accordion now that is the first one and lets add a couple more as well
29

29

00:03:06,010  -->  00:03:16,130
just to see what multiple ones look like.....
30

30

00:03:16,500  -->  00:03:25,930
....
31

31

00:03:26,300  -->  00:03:37,350
....and now if we run that have a bit of a look at it and
32

32

00:03:37,720  -->  00:03:41,890
you can see we've got three of them and we can
open only one at a time so its sort of
33

33

00:03:42,260  -->  00:03:46,480
closes the others automatically so that can be really
good way to actually add additional
34

34

00:03:46,850  -->  00:03:51,380
content on the one screen and only allow
the user to go into one at a time to
35

35

00:03:51,750  -->  00:03:56,940
do whatever processing you want done for
that that section for that individual titled pane
36

36

00:03:57,310  -->  00:04:02,030
and unfortunately there is an limitation there is no
currently no way to set the orientation
37

37

00:04:02,400  -->  00:04:06,290
of an accordion to horizontal you can do it in code by rotating the accordion and we
38

38

00:04:06,660  -->  00:04:10,210
may look at this in the later lectures so
its a little bit of limitation their and again
39

39

00:04:10,580  -->  00:04:14,750
probably a way around it or we can
do it in code by rotating it once it's
40

40

00:04:15,120  -->  00:04:18,810
actually on the screen but we might look at that a little bit later anyway and one
41

41

00:04:19,180  -->  00:04:21,590
of the things you probably noticed when
we ran it for the
42

42

00:04:21,960  -->  00:04:29,350
first ill run it again all of them
are closed by default and probably
43

43

00:04:29,720  -->  00:04:34,200
handy to actually expand one by default
when the UI first opens so you can sort
44

44

00:04:34,570  -->  00:04:37,830
of a default pane for the user to see what's in there so to do that
45

45

00:04:38,200  -->  00:04:43,740
what we need to do is we need to assign an
ID to the pane that we want extended and then
46

46

00:04:44,110  -->  00:04:46,890
have the accordions expanded pane
property set to that ID so lets
47

47

00:04:47,260  -->  00:04:56,070
do that and see what that looks like
so we will just expand the third one so
48

48

00:04:56,440  -->  00:05:01,290
if we are going to be expanding this one we put and id to that so...
49

49

00:05:02,290  -->  00:05:08,430
and will call the ID tp3....so you will assign and id
50

50

00:05:08,800  -->  00:05:13,480
to the one that you want and you come
up here into the accordion and we put
51

51

00:05:13,850  -->  00:05:14,620
expanded....
52

52

00:05:14,990  -->  00:05:23,170
....
53

53

00:05:23,540  -->  00:05:27,640
...so now if we do that we should find titled pane 3 is open by default when
54

54

00:05:28,010  -->  00:05:34,570
we ran the application you can see titled three is now open on
the screen so that's it that's all the
55

55

00:05:34,940  -->  00:05:39,700
controls to look at in
this section but later on you will see a
56

56

00:05:40,070  -->  00:05:45,360
few more controls in action thing is that
JavaFX offers a wide variety of control
57

57

00:05:45,730  -->  00:05:49,110
that we can use when building our UI and
obviously we've demoed quite a few
58

58

00:05:49,480  -->  00:05:53,360
controls and touched on some of their
properties in this area now do
59

59

00:05:53,730  -->  00:05:57,360
remember that whenever you are actually
working with the control check the
60

60

00:05:57,730  -->  00:06:01,520
controls documentation because that is usually
the best place to find now what is and
61

61

00:06:01,890  -->  00:06:02,670
isn't possible
62

62

00:06:03,040  -->  00:06:08,680
there is you know what functionality they've got in other
words it's just a good first pit stop to go to
63

63

00:06:09,050  -->  00:06:13,260
figure out whether there's something in
this going to be useful for your application ok
64

64

00:06:13,630  -->  00:06:17,140
so now we've actually seen how we can build a UI
but obviously that's only half
65

65

00:06:17,510  -->  00:06:21,870
the story we have to handle this user
interaction I talked very briefly in a
66

66

00:06:22,240  -->  00:06:26,740
previously video about events so in other
words what happens after we click the
67

67

00:06:27,110  -->  00:06:30,010
button when we are willing to get the
computer to actually do something and
68

68

00:06:30,380  -->  00:06:34,050
process that command or process the
input that the users has type in
69

69

00:06:34,420  -->  00:06:34,650
etc
70

70

00:06:35,020  -->  00:06:40,660
we are gonna cover events and threading in
the next section look forward to seeing you their cheers
71

71

00:06:41,030  -->  00:06:41,910
for now
