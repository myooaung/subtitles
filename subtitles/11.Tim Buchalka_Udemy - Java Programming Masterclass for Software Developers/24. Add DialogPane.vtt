00:00:05.500  -->  00:00:09.900
so when we left off at the end of the
last video we had a functional main
2

2

00:00:09.900  -->  00:00:15.190
UI but the user couldn't really do
much except look at hard coded data and
3

3

00:00:15.190  -->  00:00:19.840
we added right at the end of the last video a menu item that will let the user add another todo
4

4

00:00:19.840  -->  00:00:23.780
item to the list so now we need to
create the UI the user we'll see when
5

5

00:00:23.780  -->  00:00:28.760
they press the Menu item so we've got the
menu in place if we run our application
6

6

00:00:28.760  -->  00:00:36.370
we've got an option their to click to select
rather a new to-do item but we need to
7

7

00:00:36.370  -->  00:00:42.030
implement that functionality within
the application so what we gonna do is
8

8

00:00:42.030  -->  00:00:45.100
display a dialog that will accept a
short description
9

9

00:00:45.100  -->  00:00:49.870
the details and the deadline for the new
item and when the user presses the dialogs
10

10

00:00:49.870  -->  00:00:54.150
ok button we'll create a new to-do
item at that point we'll then add it to the
11

11

00:00:54.150  -->  00:01:00.330
list in our data model and then update the data
in the list view on the screen and we will
12

12

00:01:00.330  -->  00:01:03.620
also select the new items so that the
user can see the details and deadlines
13

13

00:01:03.620  -->  00:01:09.600
they just entered on screen now before Java 8u40 there wasn't any support for
14

14

00:01:09.600  -->  00:01:14.810
dialogue that really was a huge
oversight and on the part of JavaFX
15

15

00:01:14.810  -->  00:01:18.380
developers now they may have believed that
developers were mainly only going to use
16

16

00:01:18.380  -->  00:01:23.470
JavaFX for web and mobile applications
perhaps where dialogs don't really make as much
17

17

00:01:23.470  -->  00:01:27.750
sense but that hasn't turned out to be
the case and most desktop applications
18

18

00:01:27.750  -->  00:01:31.890
used dialogs so to create a dialog
using early versions of JavaFX
19

19

00:01:31.890  -->  00:01:36.380
even simple dialogs that just display confirmation message and an OK
20

20

00:01:36.380  -->  00:01:40.490
button to do that we had to create a
whole new window and take care most of
21

21

00:01:40.490  -->  00:01:46.030
the background plumbing code ourselves
but fortunately JavaFX 8u40
22

22

00:01:46.030  -->  00:01:49.820
introduced the dialogue and dialogue pane
classes and that makes creating
23

23

00:01:49.820  -->  00:01:54.630
dialogues a lot easier now at the same time
JavaFX also added support for a bunch of
24

24

00:01:54.630  -->  00:01:59.880
common dialog types and we are gonna use one of
the canned dialog types later but to start
25

25

00:01:59.880  -->  00:02:06.220
off we are going to create a custom dialog for the add new to do item case now if you're running a JDK
26

26

00:02:06.220  -->  00:02:11.200
earlier than Java 8u40 you won't be able
to use to the dialogue and dialogue
27

27

00:02:11.200  -->  00:02:15.140
pane classes and you should really
upgrade to the latest JDK version their
28

28

00:02:15.140  -->  00:02:17.680
isn't really a solid reason not too
update
29

29

00:02:17.680  -->  00:02:20.870
and just to check what version you are
running a couple of ways of doing it but
30

30

00:02:20.870  -->  00:02:25.540
the simplest ways just to right click on
the project name come down here to open module
31

31

00:02:25.540  -->  00:02:30.250
settings and it should show you where
you've got too module selected it will
32

32

00:02:30.250  -->  00:02:35.600
show you the module SDK project is
SDK 8.1 and you can just opened that up
33

33

00:02:35.600  -->  00:02:45.000
and have a look at the version their in this case of I've got 1_8_.0_73
so that is effectively sort
34

34

00:02:45.000  -->  00:02:49.850
of like 8u73 so you really want a number basically
that is version 8 and greater than
35

35

00:02:49.850  -->  00:02:53.720
the number 40 to be able to use this
and again as I said theirs no real reason not
36

36

00:02:53.720  -->  00:02:59.060
to update to the latest version of Java
8 so I suggested you do that now in terms
37

37

00:02:59.060  -->  00:03:03.780
of the dialogues UI we can't create this
in the same FXML file that we've used
38

38

00:03:03.780  -->  00:03:08.660
so far in our application for the main window
that's because each FXML file can really
39

39

00:03:08.660  -->  00:03:14.450
only have one root node and meaning
ultimately one scene graph now our dialogue we
40

40

00:03:14.450  -->  00:03:19.700
use a different scene graph from the main
window so we would have to create a new FXML
41

41

00:03:19.700  -->  00:03:25.150
file and then associate a separate
controller with it as well and unfortunately theirs
42

42

00:03:25.150  -->  00:03:28.130
no support in IntelliJ to do this so in other
words we really have to do this
43

43

00:03:28.130  -->  00:03:35.840
ourselves so start by coming over here to the package
basically the same level that we've got our FXML
44

44

00:03:35.840  -->  00:03:40.930
file and click in that we got
that on the screen there now and basically
45

45

00:03:40.930  -->  00:03:42.590
just click here in the package
46

46

00:03:42.590  -->  00:03:56.530
new file and call this one...so every instance of the dialogue
47

47

00:03:56.530  -->  00:04:00.910
wraps a dialogue pane instance in
other words a dialogue pane is always a
48

48

00:04:00.910  -->  00:04:05.400
top level layout of a dialogue what we
do is we gonna copy the bare bones from the
49

49

00:04:05.400  -->  00:04:07.870
main windows FXML file into the
dialogue
50

50

00:04:07.870  -->  00:04:13.840
FXML file so just we got something to start with
so lets go back temporarily to our main window
51

51

00:04:13.840  -->  00:04:22.380
we want to copy this first border pane....copy that and go back
to our to do dialogue we just created
52

52

00:04:22.380  -->  00:04:28.210
and paste that in their we are gonna change...
53

53

00:04:29.340  -->  00:04:37.090
...and the other thing we need to do is
54

54

00:04:37.090  -->  00:04:40.610
change our controller because that's pointing
to the controller that we have Associated for the
55

55

00:04:40.610  -->  00:04:46.470
main window so let's make that instead of controller.....
56

56

00:04:46.470  -->  00:05:01.070
...
57

57

00:05:01.070  -->  00:05:06.100
the error disappears because the class now exists
so lets talk about how the dialogue pane
58

58

00:05:06.100  -->  00:05:11.940
works now as a layout manager that is used for dialogue as you can probably guess and it allows
59

59

00:05:11.940  -->  00:05:17.630
us to set 4 properties namely the
header graphic content and buttons now
60

60

00:05:17.630  -->  00:05:22.470
each property expects a control because
we are often want to display text for the header
61

61

00:05:22.470  -->  00:05:26.530
in the content the dialogue pane also
has to convenient properties
62

62

00:05:26.530  -->  00:05:31.940
header text and content text and what we want the header or content to display a string using the
63

63

00:05:31.940  -->  00:05:36.220
convenience property saves us from having to create a label property
64

64

00:05:36.220  -->  00:05:40.690
for the text now if both the non-text
property and the text properly is set then
65

65

00:05:40.690  -->  00:05:44.660
the non text properly will take
precedence for example if we set the header
66

66

00:05:44.660  -->  00:05:49.370
property to a control and we also set
the header text property the header value
67

67

00:05:49.370  -->  00:05:52.840
will be used and then the header text value will be
ignored
68

68

00:05:53.770  -->  00:05:57.570
now there are additional rules that dictate
what happened to the header when the
69

69

00:05:57.570  -->  00:06:01.880
graphics properties set and we won't go
into those for our application right now
70

70

00:06:01.880  -->  00:06:06.110
but if you're interested you can
consult the dialogue pane documentation and I'll put that on
71

71

00:06:06.110  -->  00:06:09.110
the screen so you can check that at your
leisure
72

72

00:06:10.090  -->  00:06:14.150
theirs the link their on the screen....
73

73

00:06:18.900  -->  00:06:26.610
..so that refer to that link if you need to for
more information about the dialogue pane
74

74

00:06:26.610  -->  00:06:31.140
lets go back to building our dialogue UI now
we don't really need to put anything
75

75

00:06:31.140  -->  00:06:35.810
into the header text but will do it anyway just to
see what it looks like on screen so the way
76

76

00:06:35.810  -->  00:06:44.460
we do it is we create a header text sections so....
77

77

00:06:44.460  -->  00:06:48.580
....
78

78

00:06:48.580  -->  00:06:53.660
...now notice this looks a bit different when we set
the text to a control
79

79

00:06:53.660  -->  00:06:59.160
usually there's a text properly in this
case header text is the Text property it's a
80

80

00:06:59.160  -->  00:07:04.880
string property and consequently its
contents consists of a string so now we'll set the content
81

81

00:07:04.880  -->  00:07:09.230
area for the dialogue so we need to
display more than just text and this is where
82

82

00:07:09.230  -->  00:07:14.550
the user will typically input the to
do the to do time
83

83

00:07:14.550  -->  00:07:15.830
short description
84

84

00:07:15.830  -->  00:07:19.840
the details and the deadline so we
really need three label controls a
85

85

00:07:19.840  -->  00:07:25.120
text field control a text area control and
a date picker control and we want our
86

86

00:07:25.120  -->  00:07:29.770
labels and input fields to line up nicely
so why don't we use a grid pane layout to help us
87

87

00:07:29.770  -->  00:07:35.490
with that and the grid is gonna consequently
have three rows and 2 columns first
88

88

00:07:35.490  -->  00:07:40.070
column will contain
rather than label controls let's start
89

89

00:07:40.070  -->  00:07:49.510
by adding a content element to our FXML below
the header text....
90

90

00:07:49.510  -->  00:08:08.760
....
91

91

00:08:08.760  -->  00:08:15.410
...so first add the label and text field
for the short description so....
92

92

00:08:17.830  -->  00:08:24.620
....
93

93

00:08:25.860  -->  00:08:40.970
....
94

94

00:08:42.140  -->  00:08:48.230
....
95

95

00:08:48.230  -->  00:09:00.820
...so that is
96

96

00:09:00.820  -->  00:09:05.790
our short description now so let's go
ahead and add the labels and controls
97

97

00:09:05.790  -->  00:09:09.570
for the details and deadlines so put a
deadline label into the first column
98

98

00:09:09.570  -->  00:09:24.970
on the second row so...
99

99

00:09:24.970  -->  00:09:40.570
...
100

100

00:09:40.570  -->  00:09:46.360
...so that's a text
area and finally we got our deadline and
101

101

00:09:46.360  -->  00:09:50.680
that will be...
102

102

00:09:53.720  -->  00:10:14.670
....
103

103

00:10:14.670  -->  00:10:21.920
....so that is our basic interface but we also need an ok and
104

104

00:10:21.920  -->  00:10:24.920
cancel buttons however will add those through
code
105

105

00:10:25.570  -->  00:10:30.830
now JavaFX provides a set of predefined
buttons that can use but currently their is no FXML
106

106

00:10:30.830  -->  00:10:34.450
support for them and I'm sure
that will come in later versions of Java
107

107

00:10:34.450  -->  00:10:39.140
FX as I mentioned earlier the dialogue pane itself is new to Java 8u40
108

108

00:10:39.140  -->  00:10:44.180
so its relatively new to Java FX so where do we add the code to add the buttons and show the
109

109

00:10:44.180  -->  00:10:50.000
dialogue so thinking about it you thought first be to do it in the dialogues controller but that would
110

110

00:10:50.000  -->  00:10:54.080
actually be incorrect we show the
dialogue when the user presses file on
111

111

00:10:54.080  -->  00:10:58.550
the main windows menu and then New so we have to handle this in the
112

112

00:10:58.550  -->  00:11:02.470
main window's control because that's
where the functionality is so what we want
113

113

00:11:02.470  -->  00:11:06.870
to do is add an event handler to the
controller class and lets go and do that
114

114

00:11:06.870  -->  00:11:12.830
this is the controller classic controls
the main window as opposed to putting it
115

115

00:11:12.830  -->  00:11:17.670
in the dialog control so let's go ahead
and add that and what
116

116

00:11:17.670  -->  00:11:23.900
I'll do now is delete that commented out code and put this below
117

117

00:11:24.650  -->  00:11:36.280
in the initialize so want to add a method show new item dialogue we will call it...
118

118

00:11:36.280  -->  00:11:37.870
....
119

119

00:11:37.870  -->  00:11:52.480
....so when the user presses
120

120

00:11:52.480  -->  00:11:56.130
file and select new we want our new
121

121

00:11:56.130  -->  00:12:00.930
dialogue to pop up so first what we need to do
is need to create an instance of the dialogue
122

122

00:12:00.930  -->  00:12:10.120
class so let's go ahead and do that  its gonna be...
123

123

00:12:13.110  -->  00:12:19.810
...now we want this dialogue to be modul and what that
means is that while the dialogue is
124

124

00:12:19.810  -->  00:12:24.890
visible the users won't be able to
interact with any other part of the
125

125

00:12:24.890  -->  00:12:30.630
applications UI in other words they won't be able to interact with dialogue while its open if they click on the
126

126

00:12:30.630  -->  00:12:35.130
main window to give it focus nothing
will happen so they will have to dismiss the dialogue by
127

127

00:12:35.130  -->  00:12:39.570
clicking the ok or cancel button or by
clicking the close button in the upper
128

128

00:12:39.570  -->  00:12:42.680
right hand corner of the dialogue before
they can ultimately interact with the
129

129

00:12:42.680  -->  00:12:48.930
main window again and by default when we created
dialogue using this dialogue class the
130

130

00:12:48.930  -->  00:12:54.020
dialogue will be modul so it's not something
you need to change by the default and most
131

131

00:12:54.020  -->  00:12:59.700
of the times you will want a dialogue box to be modul so what we want to do is we want
132

132

00:12:59.700  -->  00:13:08.660
to assign an ID to the border pane in the main
window FXML so that we can access it...because
133

133

00:13:08.660  -->  00:13:13.610
it currently has got an ID so...
134

134

00:13:18.100  -->  00:13:22.760
....and its good practice to set the dialogues parent which is
135

135

00:13:22.760  -->  00:13:26.410
usually the window the dialogue was open
from and we could set the owner to
136

136

00:13:26.410  -->  00:13:29.880
null and the JavaFX runtime would still
block input to other parts of the
137

137

00:13:29.880  -->  00:13:31.130
application
138

138

00:13:31.130  -->  00:13:36.640
but lets set the owner so we can see how
it's done then the owner has to be of type
139

139

00:13:36.640  -->  00:13:40.920
window and this is the reason that we're
setting the ID so to get the parent
140

140

00:13:40.920  -->  00:13:44.880
window instance we need to assign the
ID to this border pane and the
141

141

00:13:44.880  -->  00:13:51.320
we can refer to it in the controller so let's go
back to our controller code and we can
142

142

00:13:51.320  -->  00:14:01.490
now add an instance variable for the border
pane so....
143

143

00:14:01.490  -->  00:14:09.190
...so now that
we've done that we can ask the boarder
144

144

00:14:09.190  -->  00:14:13.410
pane for the reference to its parent and
we can do that by calling get scene which
145

145

00:14:13.410  -->  00:14:18.200
will return a scene from the border pane
and then will call scenes get window
146

146

00:14:18.200  -->  00:14:22.200
method and set the result as the owner
of the dialogue so now we've set that
147

147

00:14:22.200  -->  00:14:27.930
main pane lets go back to the code we are adding here in show new item dialogue and
148

148

00:14:27.930  -->  00:14:38.740
we can type in....
149

149

00:14:38.740  -->  00:14:46.610
.....and you probably recall that we load our main
window FXML in main.java and we
150

150

00:14:46.610  -->  00:14:51.120
created an instance of the dialogue class
but that doesn't load the UI we defined
151

151

00:14:51.120  -->  00:14:57.470
in the FXML so we have to load the
FXML here and we do it the same way that we do it
152

152

00:14:57.470  -->  00:15:02.500
in a main class once we've done that
will have to set $dialogues dialogue pane to the
153

153

00:15:02.500  -->  00:15:07.760
dialogue pane we defined in the FXML so go ahead and add that code now so its going to
154

154

00:15:07.760  -->  00:15:12.310
be...and reason we are adding a try block is that the
155

155

00:15:12.310  -->  00:15:19.660
load method can throw an IO exception so we need
to catch that so put that code in
156

156

00:15:19.660  -->  00:15:56.590
....
157

157

00:15:58.000  -->  00:16:07.380
....
158

158

00:16:08.180  -->  00:16:17.540
....so this video has gone on for quite some time
159

159

00:16:17.540  -->  00:16:22.830
s we are gonna stop this video now in the next video I'm gonna continue on and now that
160

160

00:16:22.830  -->  00:16:25.340
we've created to dialogue here in code
161

161

00:16:25.340  -->  00:16:30.050
we are gonna add the buttons to the dialogue pane so see you in the next video
