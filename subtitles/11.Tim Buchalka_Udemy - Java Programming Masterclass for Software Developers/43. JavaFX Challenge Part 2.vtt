00:00:05.450  -->  00:00:09.020
ok so let's now move on to the UI we're
2

2

00:00:09.020  -->  00:00:11.120
going to start with the main window and
ok so let's now move on to the UI we're
3

3

00:00:11.120  -->  00:00:13.010
that's what's obviously defined in our
going to start with the main window and
4

4

00:00:13.010  -->  00:00:15.440
main.fxml file so i'm going to open
that's what's obviously defined in our
5

5

00:00:15.440  -->  00:00:21.640
our main.fxml now our UI is always going
main.fxml file so i'm going to open
6

6

00:00:21.640  -->  00:00:23.890
to consist of a table that occupies the
our main.fxml now our UI is always going
7

7

00:00:23.890  -->  00:00:27.130
entire window so an anchor pane or border
to consist of a table that occupies the
8

8

00:00:27.130  -->  00:00:29.300
pane layout would work so let's actually
entire window so an anchor pane or border
9

9

00:00:29.300  -->  00:00:31.850
use a border pane since it's simple to
pane layout would work so let's actually
10

10

00:00:31.850  -->  00:00:34.820
use and also worked with it before I'm
use a border pane since it's simple to
11

11

00:00:34.820  -->  00:00:36.800
going to change our grid pane to border pane
use and also worked with it before I'm
12

12

00:00:36.800  -->  00:00:40.000
so let's start by the deleting some
going to change our grid pane to border pane
13

13

00:00:40.000  -->  00:00:43.640
of these unused imports and actually
so let's start by the deleting some
14

14

00:00:43.640  -->  00:00:45.650
delete grid pane because we are about to change that to a border
of these unused imports and actually
15

15

00:00:45.650  -->  00:00:48.430
pane so added that again automatically so
delete grid pane because we are about to change that to a border
16

16

00:00:48.430  -->  00:00:53.120
change to border pane and remove the
pane so added that again automatically so
17

17

00:00:53.120  -->  00:00:57.320
import and we need to remove these
change to border pane and remove the
18

18

00:00:57.320  -->  00:00:59.390
properties that aren't appropriate for border
import and we need to remove these
19

19

00:00:59.390  -->  00:01:04.880
pane so we just got the basic border
properties that aren't appropriate for border
20

20

00:01:04.880  -->  00:01:09.880
pane defined now ok now since the table
pane so we just got the basic border
21

21

00:01:09.880  -->  00:01:11.320
as I mentioned will occupy the entire
pane defined now ok now since the table
22

22

00:01:11.320  -->  00:01:13.700
window let's add it to the center
as I mentioned will occupy the entire
23

23

00:01:13.700  -->  00:01:17.110
position so I'm going to add that so i'm
window let's add it to the center
24

24

00:01:17.110  -->  00:01:21.400
going to do a center....
position so I'm going to add that so i'm
25

25

00:01:21.400  -->  00:01:23.170
and mentioned in the slide for the challenge we're
going to do a center....
26

26

00:01:23.170  -->  00:01:25.450
going to use a table view control now we
and mentioned in the slide for the challenge we're
27

27

00:01:25.450  -->  00:01:26.830
want to access that in code so let's
going to use a table view control now we
28

28

00:01:26.830  -->  00:01:29.170
add it and also assigned and ID to it as
want to access that in code so let's
29

29

00:01:29.170  -->  00:01:33.970
well so within the center table view and
add it and also assigned and ID to it as
30

30

00:01:33.970  -->  00:01:37.850
...
well so within the center table view and
31

31

00:01:37.850  -->  00:01:42.310
alright so define the table
...
32

32

00:01:42.310  -->  00:01:44.630
columns using the columns element and
alright so define the table
33

33

00:01:44.630  -->  00:01:47.350
the table column class so will set the
columns using the columns element and
34

34

00:01:47.350  -->  00:01:49.700
text property for each table column to
the table column class so will set the
35

35

00:01:49.700  -->  00:01:51.490
the text that we want the column heading
text property for each table column to
36

36

00:01:51.490  -->  00:01:54.280
to display so start by doing that so
the text that we want the column heading
37

37

00:01:54.280  -->  00:01:56.950
this is under the table view
to display so start by doing that so
38

38

00:01:56.950  -->  00:01:59.680
I actually set this up like that so within
this is under the table view
39

39

00:01:59.680  -->  00:02:01.210
the table view itself
I actually set this up like that so within
40

40

00:02:01.210  -->  00:02:05.040
we're gonna have columns
the table view itself
41

41

00:02:05.040  -->  00:02:07.350
and within the columns you are going to have
we're gonna have columns
42

42

00:02:07.350  -->  00:02:09.270
a table column for each one for each one of
and within the columns you are going to have
43

43

00:02:09.270  -->  00:02:11.430
our fields it's going to be....
a table column for each one for each one of
44

44

00:02:11.430  -->  00:02:14.000
...
our fields it's going to be....
45

45

00:02:14.000  -->  00:02:18.570
...then within that we
...
46

46

00:02:18.570  -->  00:02:20.370
want to actually have a cell value
...then within that we
47

47

00:02:20.370  -->  00:02:22.440
factory so do the first one and will
want to actually have a cell value
48

48

00:02:22.440  -->  00:02:23.880
do all of these and we'll talk
factory so do the first one and will
49

49

00:02:23.880  -->  00:02:28.440
about it.....
do all of these and we'll talk
50

50

00:02:28.440  -->  00:02:30.420
...
about it.....
51

51

00:02:30.420  -->  00:03:28.170
...
...
52

52

00:03:28.170  -->  00:03:32.760
alright now because I wanted to take
...
53

53

00:03:32.760  -->  00:03:35.150
advantage of data binding and have the
alright now because I wanted to take
54

54

00:03:35.150  -->  00:03:36.870
table automatically updated when a
advantage of data binding and have the
55

55

00:03:36.870  -->  00:03:39.780
contact is added deleted or changed we
table automatically updated when a
56

56

00:03:39.780  -->  00:03:41.760
needed to assign a cell value factory
contact is added deleted or changed we
57

57

00:03:41.760  -->  00:03:44.250
for each column and I've assign
needed to assign a cell value factory
58

58

00:03:44.250  -->  00:03:46.050
instance of the property value factory
for each column and I've assign
59

59

00:03:46.050  -->  00:03:48.900
class which is specifically designed to
instance of the property value factory
60

60

00:03:48.900  -->  00:03:50.840
be used with the cell value
class which is specifically designed to
61

61

00:03:50.840  -->  00:03:53.730
factory of a table column this is how we
be used with the cell value
62

62

00:03:53.730  -->  00:03:55.590
use data binding with tables ultimately
factory of a table column this is how we
63

63

00:03:55.590  -->  00:03:57.720
and we assigned
use data binding with tables ultimately
64

64

00:03:57.720  -->  00:04:00.240
self-explanatory labels to each column
and we assigned
65

65

00:04:00.240  -->  00:04:02.550
where the value assigned to the property
self-explanatory labels to each column
66

66

00:04:02.550  -->  00:04:05.900
field of property field value must match
where the value assigned to the property
67

67

00:04:05.900  -->  00:04:08.060
the name of the corresponding field in
field of property field value must match
68

68

00:04:08.060  -->  00:04:10.080
the contact class since this is the
the name of the corresponding field in
69

69

00:04:10.080  -->  00:04:13.080
field we want to tie in to each table
the contact class since this is the
70

70

00:04:13.080  -->  00:04:15.560
column for example for the first name
field we want to tie in to each table
71

71

00:04:15.560  -->  00:04:17.730
column we assign property the
column for example for the first name
72

72

00:04:17.730  -->  00:04:18.660
value first name
column we assign property the
73

73

00:04:18.660  -->  00:04:21.480
this is the code in line 13 which
value first name
74

74

00:04:21.480  -->  00:04:22.860
matches the name of the field in the
this is the code in line 13 which
75

75

00:04:22.860  -->  00:04:24.720
contact class come back to contact class
matches the name of the field in the
76

76

00:04:24.720  -->  00:04:27.150
theirs our first name field so i have to
contact class come back to contact class
77

77

00:04:27.150  -->  00:04:29.670
actually match for this to actually work
theirs our first name field so i have to
78

78

00:04:29.670  -->  00:04:32.790
via data binding now once we
actually match for this to actually work
79

79

00:04:32.790  -->  00:04:34.770
associated the table with our contacts
via data binding now once we
80

80

00:04:34.770  -->  00:04:38.250
list the table column will notice when
associated the table with our contacts
81

81

00:04:38.250  -->  00:04:39.930
the first name value of a contact
list the table column will notice when
82

82

00:04:39.930  -->  00:04:42.570
changes and we'll update the value is
the first name value of a contact
83

83

00:04:42.570  -->  00:04:44.460
displaying in other words you would have
changes and we'll update the value is
84

84

00:04:44.460  -->  00:04:46.440
to explicitly update the table ourselves
displaying in other words you would have
85

85

00:04:46.440  -->  00:04:47.520
which is pretty cool
to explicitly update the table ourselves
86

86

00:04:47.520  -->  00:04:50.400
alright so at this point let's try
which is pretty cool
87

87

00:04:50.400  -->  00:04:52.440
running the application to make sure
alright so at this point let's try
88

88

00:04:52.440  -->  00:04:53.580
that everything is working as it should
running the application to make sure
89

89

00:04:53.580  -->  00:04:56.340
be at this point so I'm going to run it
that everything is working as it should
90

90

00:04:56.340  -->  00:05:02.640
run our main we can expand a little bit
be at this point so I'm going to run it
91

91

00:05:02.640  -->  00:05:08.250
and we can see the table column heading
run our main we can expand a little bit
92

92

00:05:08.250  -->  00:05:09.840
and the text here that actually
and we can see the table column heading
93

93

00:05:09.840  -->  00:05:13.140
says no content in table now you saw
and the text here that actually
94

94

00:05:13.140  -->  00:05:14.820
that the column widths aren't ideal but
says no content in table now you saw
95

95

00:05:14.820  -->  00:05:17.070
we won't actually fix that right now but
that the column widths aren't ideal but
96

96

00:05:17.070  -->  00:05:20.250
the next step will be the UI that allows
we won't actually fix that right now but
97

97

00:05:20.250  -->  00:05:23.250
a user to add a contact so we need
the next step will be the UI that allows
98

98

00:05:23.250  -->  00:05:25.110
something to display in the table though
a user to add a contact so we need
99

99

00:05:25.110  -->  00:05:27.750
note that we could load some dummy data in our
something to display in the table though
100

100

00:05:27.750  -->  00:05:30.120
contacts data class just to get ourselves
note that we could load some dummy data in our
101

101

00:05:30.120  -->  00:05:32.730
started and that's often how i
contacts data class just to get ourselves
102

102

00:05:32.730  -->  00:05:33.840
recommend you do it when you're
started and that's often how i
103

103

00:05:33.840  -->  00:05:36.060
developing a real-world application but
recommend you do it when you're
104

104

00:05:36.060  -->  00:05:37.320
here we're just going to keep it simple
developing a real-world application but
105

105

00:05:37.320  -->  00:05:40.080
and start from scratch now we need a
here we're just going to keep it simple
106

106

00:05:40.080  -->  00:05:42.150
dialogue that allows us to provide the
and start from scratch now we need a
107

107

00:05:42.150  -->  00:05:44.730
information for a contact and a way to
dialogue that allows us to provide the
108

108

00:05:44.730  -->  00:05:47.850
get to the dialogue so if you go back
information for a contact and a way to
109

109

00:05:47.850  -->  00:05:49.200
now and look at the challenge image
get to the dialogue so if you go back
110

110

00:05:49.200  -->  00:05:50.310
for the application we're trying to
now and look at the challenge image
111

111

00:05:50.310  -->  00:05:52.230
generate we see that we've got a menu
for the application we're trying to
112

112

00:05:52.230  -->  00:05:54.750
there with a single item called contacts
generate we see that we've got a menu
113

113

00:05:54.750  -->  00:05:57.330
when we pull down that menu will also
there with a single item called contacts
114

114

00:05:57.330  -->  00:06:00.240
want an add item to appear so let's
when we pull down that menu will also
115

115

00:06:00.240  -->  00:06:03.450
add that menu in this item now i'm going
want an add item to appear so let's
116

116

00:06:03.450  -->  00:06:05.100
to put the menu into the top position of
add that menu in this item now i'm going
117

117

00:06:05.100  -->  00:06:06.690
the border pane so go back to our code
to put the menu into the top position of
118

118

00:06:06.690  -->  00:06:11.370
and I'll close this down back to our main dot
the border pane so go back to our code
119

119

00:06:11.370  -->  00:06:13.860
FXML so I'm going to add this at the top
and I'll close this down back to our main dot
120

120

00:06:13.860  -->  00:06:15.690
so we are actually going to put it in the
FXML so I'm going to add this at the top
121

121

00:06:15.690  -->  00:06:20.400
top part of the border pane top position so
so we are actually going to put it in the
122

122

00:06:20.400  -->  00:06:23.460
...
top part of the border pane top position so
123

123

00:06:23.460  -->  00:06:53.460
...
...
124

124

00:06:53.460  -->  00:06:57.030
...top
...
125

125

00:06:57.030  -->  00:06:59.130
position is going to be our menu but we do
...top
126

126

00:06:59.130  -->  00:07:01.620
have one more step here we have to add
position is going to be our menu but we do
127

127

00:07:01.620  -->  00:07:03.360
an action handler to open the dialogue
have one more step here we have to add
128

128

00:07:03.360  -->  00:07:06.660
so let's do that add it here
an action handler to open the dialogue
129

129

00:07:06.660  -->  00:07:13.470
...
so let's do that add it here
130

130

00:07:13.470  -->  00:07:16.020
...
...
131

131

00:07:16.020  -->  00:07:18.480
we'll get it showing in red to indicate
...
132

132

00:07:18.480  -->  00:07:21.180
that we need to add that let's go ahead
we'll get it showing in red to indicate
133

133

00:07:21.180  -->  00:07:22.500
and do that i'll just take a copy of
that we need to add that let's go ahead
134

134

00:07:22.500  -->  00:07:26.640
that and go back to our controller and
and do that i'll just take a copy of
135

135

00:07:26.640  -->  00:07:29.970
we'll add the action handler....
that and go back to our controller and
136

136

201

201

00:12:16.530  -->  00:12:19.370
h gap properties to 10 now for each
ok so i set the grid panes v gap and
202

202

00:12:19.370  -->  00:12:21.210
piece of contact information you can see
h gap properties to 10 now for each
203

203

00:12:21.210  -->  00:12:23.400
I added a label followed by an input field
piece of contact information you can see
204

204

00:12:23.400  -->  00:12:26.690
the text field now i'm using a text
I added a label followed by an input field
205

205

00:12:26.690  -->  00:12:28.610
field for all the values possibly you
the text field now i'm using a text
206

206

00:12:28.610  -->  00:12:30.110
might have considered using a text area
field for all the values possibly you
207

207

00:12:30.110  -->  00:12:32.180
for the notes value but since we're
might have considered using a text area
208

208

00:12:32.180  -->  00:12:34.610
displaying each contact in the table we
for the notes value but since we're
209

209

00:12:34.610  -->  00:12:36.780
want the notes to be kept short and for
displaying each contact in the table we
210

210

00:12:36.780  -->  00:12:38.850
that reason I'm using a text field but
want the notes to be kept short and for
211

211

00:12:38.850  -->  00:12:40.550
in a real world application you might
that reason I'm using a text field but
212

212

00:12:40.550  -->  00:12:42.110
will limit the number of characters the
in a real world application you might
213

213

00:12:42.110  -->  00:12:44.660
user can enter into the notes field
will limit the number of characters the
214

214

00:12:44.660  -->  00:12:45.880
we might not display the notes in the
user can enter into the notes field
215

215

00:12:45.880  -->  00:12:47.750
table at all you know maybe the user
we might not display the notes in the
216

216

00:12:47.750  -->  00:12:49.250
will have to click something to see the
table at all you know maybe the user
217

217

00:12:49.250  -->  00:12:51.860
notes and that way we could allow them
will have to click something to see the
218

218

00:12:51.860  -->  00:12:53.500
to enter longer notes using a text area
notes and that way we could allow them
219

219

00:12:53.500  -->  00:12:55.870
obviously there's a multiple there are
to enter longer notes using a text area
220

220

00:12:55.870  -->  00:12:56.990
multiple ways that we could have
obviously there's a multiple there are
221

221

00:12:56.990  -->  00:12:59.540
designed the UI and you saw that I also
multiple ways that we could have
222

222

00:12:59.540  -->  00:13:02.900
assigned an fxml id to each field because
designed the UI and you saw that I also
223

223

00:13:02.900  -->  00:13:04.310
we need to get the values the user
assigned an fxml id to each field because
224

224

00:13:04.310  -->  00:13:05.900
inputs ultimately to be able to process
we need to get the values the user
225

225

00:13:05.900  -->  00:13:08.270
them alright so let's finish the video
inputs ultimately to be able to process
226

226

00:13:08.270  -->  00:13:10.400
here in the next video will start
them alright so let's finish the video
227

227

00:13:10.400  -->  00:13:12.190
writing the code for the action handler
here in the next video will start
228

228

00:13:12.190  -->  00:13:14.720
that will show this dialogue see you
writing the code for the action handler
229

229

00:13:14.720  -->  00:13:20.350
in the next video
that will show this dialogue see you
