00:00:05.000  -->  00:00:06.600
<v ->Congratulations, you made it.</v>
2

2

00:00:06.600  -->  00:00:08.270
Welcome to the Java Masterclass
3

3

00:00:08.270  -->  00:00:10.870
and thank you for investing in it.
4

4

00:00:10.870  -->  00:00:12.660
So my name is Tim Buchalka.
5

5

00:00:12.660  -->  00:00:14.540
And I'll be the instructor leading you
6

6

00:00:14.540  -->  00:00:15.633
through this course.
7

7

00:00:16.490  -->  00:00:18.050
My mission is a simple one,
8

8

00:00:18.050  -->  00:00:19.800
and that's to teach you Java
9

9

00:00:19.800  -->  00:00:23.550
to the level where you can become a Java programmer.
10

10

00:00:23.550  -->  00:00:25.480
Now whether you're new to programming,
11

11

00:00:25.480  -->  00:00:26.810
whether you've got some experience
12

12

00:00:26.810  -->  00:00:28.280
in another programming language,
13

13

00:00:28.280  -->  00:00:29.840
or whether you know some Java
14

14

00:00:29.840  -->  00:00:31.540
and are looking to take those existing skills
15

15

00:00:31.540  -->  00:00:32.830
to the next level,
16

16

00:00:32.830  -->  00:00:34.780
in any of those scenarios this course
17

17

00:00:34.780  -->  00:00:36.637
is most definitely for you.
18

18

00:00:37.670  -->  00:00:40.090
Now this has been the best-selling Java course on Udemy
19

19

00:00:40.090  -->  00:00:41.280
for many years.
20

20

00:00:41.280  -->  00:00:42.970
And I think one of the main reasons
21

21

00:00:42.970  -->  00:00:45.240
is that it's constantly updated.
22

22

00:00:45.240  -->  00:00:49.100
And in fact, as I record this video in July of 2019,
23

23

00:00:49.100  -->  00:00:52.143
I'm updating the course to JDK version 11.
24

24

00:00:53.020  -->  00:00:55.860
Now if I just lost you when I used the term JDK
25

25

00:00:55.860  -->  00:00:57.920
that stands for Java Development Kit,
26

26

00:00:57.920  -->  00:01:00.620
and it's the software that is used
27

27

00:01:00.620  -->  00:01:02.590
to create Java programmes.
28

28

00:01:02.590  -->  00:01:04.060
But we'll find out a lot more about that
29

29

00:01:04.060  -->  00:01:06.540
as we go through the course in detail actually.
30

30

00:01:06.540  -->  00:01:08.220
But if you know something about the JDK
31

31

00:01:08.220  -->  00:01:09.227
you might be wondering,
32

32

00:01:09.227  -->  00:01:12.487
"Well Tim, why are you updating the course to JDK 11
33

33

00:01:12.487  -->  00:01:14.487
"when JDK 12 is out already
34

34

00:01:14.487  -->  00:01:19.170
"and JDK 13 is due in September 2019?"
35

35

00:01:19.170  -->  00:01:20.003
Well fear not,
36

36

00:01:20.003  -->  00:01:23.230
because I've actually got a video entitled "Which JDK?"
37

37

00:01:23.230  -->  00:01:26.670
which explains my reasoning for using JDK version 11.
38

38

00:01:26.670  -->  00:01:29.330
So check out that video to understand the reasoning.
39

39

00:01:29.330  -->  00:01:31.230
But look, no matter version you are using
40

40

00:01:31.230  -->  00:01:32.430
if you are using a newer version
41

41

00:01:32.430  -->  00:01:33.660
and wanna stick to that,
42

42

00:01:33.660  -->  00:01:34.493
that's fine
43

43

00:01:34.493  -->  00:01:36.370
because the concepts that you'll learn in this course
44

44

00:01:36.370  -->  00:01:38.700
are applicable literally to any version
45

45

00:01:38.700  -->  00:01:40.500
of Java Development Kit, or Java in general,
46

46

00:01:40.500  -->  00:01:42.660
from JDK 8 and above.
47

47

00:01:42.660  -->  00:01:45.030
And if you've got no idea what I'm talking about
48

48

00:01:45.030  -->  00:01:45.863
fear not,
49

49

00:01:45.863  -->  00:01:48.700
you'll learn more about that as we go through the course.
50

50

00:01:48.700  -->  00:01:50.660
Now one of the other things that I want to mention
51

51

00:01:50.660  -->  00:01:52.120
just before we finish off,
52

52

00:01:52.120  -->  00:01:54.550
is to please don't skip the next few videos
53

53

00:01:54.550  -->  00:01:56.080
in this section,
54

54

00:01:56.080  -->  00:01:57.220
because there's a few videos there
55

55

00:01:57.220  -->  00:01:59.630
talking about things like video quality
56

56

00:01:59.630  -->  00:02:00.990
and so on and so forth.
57

57

00:02:00.990  -->  00:02:02.200
And they are short,
58

58

00:02:02.200  -->  00:02:04.750
but they'll help you get the most out of this course
59

59

00:02:04.750  -->  00:02:05.583
if you just follow them.
60

60

00:02:05.583  -->  00:02:06.416
They're only a couple of minutes long
61

61

00:02:06.416  -->  00:02:08.060
so do check those out.
62

62

00:02:08.060  -->  00:02:09.810
And the topics for video quality,
63

63

00:02:09.810  -->  00:02:11.980
which can be an issue sometimes on Udemy,
64

64

00:02:11.980  -->  00:02:13.500
ensuring that the videos are playing
65

65

00:02:13.500  -->  00:02:15.640
in the best possible quality for you.
66

66

00:02:15.640  -->  00:02:17.440
How to access and use subtitles.
67

67

00:02:17.440  -->  00:02:19.270
How to get access to the source code.
68

68

00:02:19.270  -->  00:02:20.600
And more importantly,
69

69

00:02:20.600  -->  00:02:23.170
how to get to access to support if you need it.
70

70

00:02:23.170  -->  00:02:24.003
So that's it.
71

71

00:02:24.003  -->  00:02:24.836
Welcome again.
72

72

00:02:24.836  -->  00:02:26.823
Let's move on now to the next video.
