00:00:05.010  -->  00:00:07.230
in this video we're going to install the
2

2

00:00:07.230  -->  00:00:09.510
sqlite three command line shell for
3

3

00:00:09.510  -->  00:00:12.180
Windows computers now if you're using a
4

4

00:00:12.180  -->  00:00:13.590
Mac or Linux machine
5

5

00:00:13.590  -->  00:00:15.420
skip to the next video or the video
6

6

00:00:15.420  -->  00:00:17.910
after that for your operating system but
7

7

00:00:17.910  -->  00:00:19.200
if you're in Windows you're in the right
8

8

00:00:19.200  -->  00:00:21.150
place so let's make a start
9

9

00:00:21.150  -->  00:00:22.980
thing to keep in mind here is that
10

10

00:00:22.980  -->  00:00:24.990
writing data base code straightaway
11

11

00:00:24.990  -->  00:00:26.610
isn't the easiest way to learn about
12

12

00:00:26.610  -->  00:00:29.550
sqlite and the sql language so
13

13

00:00:29.550  -->  00:00:31.590
if you get errors have to work out if
14

14

00:00:31.590  -->  00:00:33.720
it's the error or the errors in your
15

15

00:00:33.720  -->  00:00:36.510
code or in the sql statement that
16

16

00:00:36.510  -->  00:00:39.030
you've used so what we're going to do to
17

17

00:00:39.030  -->  00:00:40.620
start is we're going to start by
18

18

00:00:40.620  -->  00:00:42.530
installing the sqlite command line
19

19

00:00:42.530  -->  00:00:45.170
shell so that we can create databases
20

20

00:00:45.170  -->  00:00:46.970
and use sql commands without having
21

21

00:00:46.970  -->  00:00:49.460
to worry about code yet on Windows the
22

22

00:00:49.460  -->  00:00:51.470
sqlite command-line shell is an
23

23

00:00:51.470  -->  00:00:53.940
executable file called sqlite 3
24

24

00:00:53.940  -->  00:00:57.510
dot exe so in this video we're going
25

25

00:00:57.510  -->  00:00:59.030
to see how to download that executable
26

26

00:00:59.030  -->  00:01:01.220
add it to our computers path so that we
27

27

00:01:01.220  -->  00:01:02.100
can use it
28

28

00:01:02.100  -->  00:01:03.950
first things first we're going to go to
29

29

00:01:03.950  -->  00:01:12.360
the sqlite website.....and
30

30

00:01:12.360  -->  00:01:13.650
you can see at the top when get there there's
31

31

00:01:13.650  -->  00:01:15.060
a download link so i'm going to click on
32

32

00:01:15.060  -->  00:01:18.630
that now there is actually an installer
33

33

00:01:18.630  -->  00:01:20.190
for sqlite and it's packaged
34

34

00:01:20.190  -->  00:01:22.500
into a number of zip files the file we
35

35

00:01:22.500  -->  00:01:25.230
want actually is a bundle up command
36

36

00:01:25.230  -->  00:01:26.910
line tools for managing sqlite databases
37

37

00:01:26.910  -->  00:01:28.110
you can see we've got one
38

38

00:01:28.110  -->  00:01:30.540
here we got an osx version there and
39

39

00:01:30.540  -->  00:01:31.860
down here we've got a windows version
40

40

00:01:31.860  -->  00:01:33.930
here a bundle command line tools for
41

41

00:01:33.930  -->  00:01:36.480
managing sqlite databases going to
42

42

00:01:36.480  -->  00:01:38.790
click on that link now bearing in mind
43

43

00:01:38.790  -->  00:01:39.720
that when you're watching this
44

44

00:01:39.720  -->  00:01:41.310
video the version number may have
45

45

00:01:41.310  -->  00:01:43.470
changed but that's alright if it's a
46

46

00:01:43.470  -->  00:01:45.300
later version click on that one and
47

47

00:01:45.300  -->  00:01:48.630
leave that downloading that's actually
48

48

00:01:48.630  -->  00:01:50.670
finished it was quite a quick download I
49

49

00:01:50.670  -->  00:01:53.640
do notice that the description for this file
50

50

00:01:53.640  -->  00:01:55.590
includes links to the three executables
51

51

00:01:55.590  -->  00:01:57.930
over here we've got to the command shell
52

52

00:01:57.930  -->  00:02:00.720
sql diff . exe sqlite .
53

53

00:02:00.720  -->  00:02:03.510
analyzer dot exe I suggest you bookmark
54

54

00:02:03.510  -->  00:02:05.150
this page so that you can come back here
55

55

00:02:05.150  -->  00:02:06.420
and check those links  in the future
56

56

00:02:06.420  -->  00:02:09.150
but the tool we need at the moment is the
57

57

00:02:09.150  -->  00:02:11.390
command line shell so what we need to do is
58

58

00:02:11.390  -->  00:02:13.100
extract the contents of the zip file to
59

59

00:02:13.100  -->  00:02:14.540
a suitable directory and then add that
60

60

00:02:14.540  -->  00:02:16.760
directory to our path i'm going to do is
61

61

00:02:16.760  -->  00:02:17.580
just
62

62

00:02:17.580  -->  00:02:19.410
go to the folder where that does sqlite
63

63

00:02:19.410  -->  00:02:21.420
file was opened and you can see
64

64

00:02:21.420  -->  00:02:22.770
that I've actually got sqlite tools
65

65

00:02:22.770  -->  00:02:25.260
there so I'm just going to extract all
66

66

00:02:25.260  -->  00:02:27.510
extracted currently in that current path
67

67

00:02:27.510  -->  00:02:30.330
for now it's quite quick because it's
68

68

00:02:30.330  -->  00:02:32.910
only a small file but what I'm going to do
69

69

00:02:32.910  -->  00:02:33.990
now I'm going to move these going
70

70

00:02:33.990  -->  00:02:35.700
to right-click that the file that was
71

71

00:02:35.700  -->  00:02:38.100
extracted i'm going to cut that
72

72

00:02:38.100  -->  00:02:39.480
folder then what i'm going to do i'm
73

73

00:02:39.480  -->  00:02:42.030
actually going to put this in my users
74

74

00:02:42.030  -->  00:02:45.150
main home folder you can put
75

75

00:02:45.150  -->  00:02:46.950
this in the program files directory or
76

76

00:02:46.950  -->  00:02:49.290
somewhere else doesn't really matter but
77

77

00:02:49.290  -->  00:02:50.880
for simplicity what I'm going to do is
78

78

00:02:50.880  -->  00:02:53.610
just go to my local disk going to my
79

79

00:02:53.610  -->  00:02:55.920
users and Tim which is the folder
80

80

00:02:55.920  -->  00:02:57.030
that I'm going to put it I'm going to
81

81

00:02:57.030  -->  00:02:58.770
actually save it in there but again the
82

82

00:02:58.770  -->  00:02:59.970
choice is yours to where you want to
83

83

00:02:59.970  -->  00:03:02.100
save it so i'm going to right click and do a
84

84

00:03:02.100  -->  00:03:04.440
paste put in their and that's now the
85

85

00:03:04.440  -->  00:03:07.200
folder and moved over and we
86

86

00:03:07.200  -->  00:03:08.640
double-click it now to open the folder
87

87

00:03:08.640  -->  00:03:11.910
what we can do up here is we can
88

88

00:03:11.910  -->  00:03:13.890
actually come up here and click over
89

89

00:03:13.890  -->  00:03:15.030
to the address bar and then click on
90

90

00:03:15.030  -->  00:03:17.130
control c that's actually going to
91

91

00:03:17.130  -->  00:03:19.050
take a copy of the path which we can use
92

92

00:03:19.050  -->  00:03:20.910
to actually update to the path on the
93

93

00:03:20.910  -->  00:03:23.610
computer now the instructions to set the
94

94

00:03:23.610  -->  00:03:25.800
path start off slightly differently
95

95

00:03:25.800  -->  00:03:27.480
depending on which version of windows
96

96

00:03:27.480  -->  00:03:29.790
that you're using i'm using
97

97

00:03:29.790  -->  00:03:32.070
Windows 10 here and if your
98

98

00:03:32.070  -->  00:03:34.700
keyboards got a Windows key the quickest
99

99

00:03:34.700  -->  00:03:36.720
way for all versions of windows is to
100

100

00:03:36.720  -->  00:03:38.880
use windows and pause so hold down the
101

101

00:03:38.880  -->  00:03:40.590
windows key press pause or
102

102

00:03:40.590  -->  00:03:42.930
click pause that brings up this
103

103

00:03:42.930  -->  00:03:45.230
window here otherwise we just need to
104

104

00:03:45.230  -->  00:03:47.580
navigate to the control panel system and
105

105

00:03:47.580  -->  00:03:49.920
security and system  on your version of
106

106

00:03:49.920  -->  00:03:52.530
windows to get access to it and then
107

107

00:03:52.530  -->  00:03:54.030
from here we can actually click on the
108

108

00:03:54.030  -->  00:03:56.220
advanced system settings on the left so
109

109

00:03:56.220  -->  00:03:58.700
i'm going to click on that that takes
110

110

00:03:58.700  -->  00:04:00.600
you to the system properties dialog
111

111

00:04:00.600  -->  00:04:03.000
which is we're all of the windows
112

112

00:04:03.000  -->  00:04:05.250
version should already be so basically a
113

113

00:04:05.250  -->  00:04:06.720
couple ways to get there but the bottom
114

114

00:04:06.720  -->  00:04:07.950
line is you want to get to this location
115

115

00:04:07.950  -->  00:04:10.650
and from here what we want to do is
116

116

00:04:10.650  -->  00:04:14.310
click on environment variables and just a
117

117

00:04:14.310  -->  00:04:15.690
quick note that if the some reason you
118

118

00:04:15.690  -->  00:04:17.850
couldn't get there with the windows key
119

119

00:04:17.850  -->  00:04:19.730
you can actually just right click the
120

120

00:04:19.730  -->  00:04:21.350
my computer icon on your desktop and
121

121

00:04:21.350  -->  00:04:23.790
choose properties and your there as well
122

122

00:04:23.790  -->  00:04:26.220
alright so we're actually here now and
123

123

00:04:26.220  -->  00:04:28.500
what we want to do is come down here to
124

124

00:04:28.500  -->  00:04:30.590
where it's got the
125

125

00:04:30.590  -->  00:04:32.930
edit button making sure that path is
126

126

00:04:32.930  -->  00:04:34.820
selected over here under user variables
127

127

00:04:34.820  -->  00:04:37.940
unless you really comfortable with doing
128

128

00:04:37.940  -->  00:04:39.740
this leave the system variable section
129

129

00:04:39.740  -->  00:04:41.150
down here at the bottom completely alone
130

130

00:04:41.150  -->  00:04:43.790
if you mess up the system path variables
131

131

00:04:43.790  -->  00:04:44.990
it can be really quite difficult to
132

132

00:04:44.990  -->  00:04:46.720
recover windows you can get into
133

133

00:04:46.720  -->  00:04:48.680
difficulty so just you don't touch
134

134

00:04:48.680  -->  00:04:50.870
that area but under the user variable
135

135

00:04:50.870  -->  00:04:52.340
they may or may not already be a path
136

136

00:04:52.340  -->  00:04:54.880
variable as you can see here in my case
137

137

00:04:54.880  -->  00:04:56.270
it already exists and actually got my
138

138

00:04:56.270  -->  00:04:58.610
python installation actually in the path
139

139

00:04:58.610  -->  00:05:00.410
but if you're is not there
140

140

00:05:00.410  -->  00:05:02.270
you don't see a path variable you click
141

141

00:05:02.270  -->  00:05:05.600
on new and you actually specify the
142

142

00:05:05.600  -->  00:05:07.580
path names as path the word path and then
143

143

00:05:07.580  -->  00:05:09.020
you type in the value paste in the
144

144

00:05:09.020  -->  00:05:11.510
value like here so put those details in but
145

145

00:05:11.510  -->  00:05:13.040
in my case because the path already
146

146

00:05:13.040  -->  00:05:15.290
exists i'm going to click on edit
147

147

00:05:15.290  -->  00:05:17.930
self path click on edit and
148

148

00:05:17.930  -->  00:05:19.760
what we're going to do now is actually
149

149

00:05:19.760  -->  00:05:21.770
add the path now this is actually
150

150

00:05:21.770  -->  00:05:23.530
showing a new path variable being
151

151

00:05:23.530  -->  00:05:26.380
created on Windows 10 if the editing an
152

152

00:05:26.380  -->  00:05:28.030
existing path variable leave the name
153

153

00:05:28.030  -->  00:05:30.380
unchange just add a semicolon to the
154

154

00:05:30.380  -->  00:05:32.600
end of the previous value as a couple of
155

155

00:05:32.600  -->  00:05:33.910
ways of doing it but this is the new way
156

156

00:05:33.910  -->  00:05:36.770
on Windows 10 where youo click on new
157

157

00:05:36.770  -->  00:05:39.160
just actually paste in the value
158

158

00:05:39.160  -->  00:05:41.030
here alright for some reason the
159

159

00:05:41.030  -->  00:05:43.550
control c that I did didn't
160

160

00:05:43.550  -->  00:05:44.960
work so i'll just go back to the
161

161

00:05:44.960  -->  00:05:48.680
Explorer again i can actually just go
162

162

00:05:48.680  -->  00:05:49.820
into their we can make sure that that's
163

163

00:05:49.820  -->  00:05:51.160
actually showing like that I think that's
164

164

00:05:51.160  -->  00:05:52.720
what i did last time will control c
165

165

00:05:52.720  -->  00:05:55.280
their or right-click and copy
166

166

00:05:55.280  -->  00:05:56.660
if I want to that way to copy the entire
167

167

00:05:56.660  -->  00:05:59.900
path now get back now to the system
168

168

00:05:59.900  -->  00:06:03.130
environment variables area click on new and I can
169

169

00:06:03.130  -->  00:06:05.870
paste it in and that's now the
170

170

00:06:05.870  -->  00:06:08.300
variable that's been added so either way
171

171

00:06:08.300  -->  00:06:09.530
whether you've got the option to do it
172

172

00:06:09.530  -->  00:06:11.780
this way we've got an older way may just
173

173

00:06:11.780  -->  00:06:13.610
be shown the entire path you've got the
174

174

00:06:13.610  -->  00:06:14.450
old way
175

175

00:06:14.450  -->  00:06:17.510
go to the end the end of the paths
176

176

00:06:17.510  -->  00:06:19.550
settings that the various parts that are
177

177

00:06:19.550  -->  00:06:22.030
defined in your system put a semicolon here and
178

178

00:06:22.030  -->  00:06:23.750
paste in the values but in this case this is
179

179

00:06:23.750  -->  00:06:25.760
a new way that Windows 10 does it where
180

180

00:06:25.760  -->  00:06:27.080
you just select new and you enter another
181

181

00:06:27.080  -->  00:06:30.130
value there click on ok and what's
182

182

00:06:30.130  -->  00:06:32.380
happened now is that Windows 10 has
183

183

00:06:32.380  -->  00:06:33.880
actually updated and environment
184

184

00:06:33.880  -->  00:06:36.620
variables so click okay close it down i can
185

185

00:06:36.620  -->  00:06:38.960
click on ok alright that
186

186

00:06:38.960  -->  00:06:41.150
point the path now been set so what we
187

187

00:06:41.150  -->  00:06:42.710
can do now is check that the sqlite
188

188

00:06:42.710  -->  00:06:44.060
command line shell is working
189

189

00:06:44.060  -->  00:06:46.250
the easiest way to do that is just
190

190

00:06:46.250  -->  00:06:48.800
to come down to here you can either just
191

191

00:06:48.800  -->  00:06:52.130
type in their it if it's under Windows 10 type cmd
192

192

00:06:52.130  -->  00:06:55.400
alternatively you can actually click on
193

193

00:06:55.400  -->  00:06:57.880
the right click on the windows startup
194

194

00:06:57.880  -->  00:07:00.590
image down here right click and select
195

195

00:07:00.590  -->  00:07:02.720
run and type CMD either way you get to
196

196

00:07:02.720  -->  00:07:04.010
the command line prompt like you
197

197

00:07:04.010  -->  00:07:05.780
can see the screen there and what we can
198

198

00:07:05.780  -->  00:07:09.020
do is type....just to
199

199

00:07:09.020  -->  00:07:10.630
verify that sqlite three is working
200

200

00:07:10.630  -->  00:07:12.770
and you can see that it's actually
201

201

00:07:12.770  -->  00:07:14.810
working actually came up and started up
202

202

00:07:14.810  -->  00:07:16.520
for us and that's good and as we can see
203

203

00:07:16.520  -->  00:07:18.050
that the things are now working nicely
204

204

00:07:18.050  -->  00:07:20.840
and keep in mind you may see a slightly
205

205

00:07:20.840  -->  00:07:23.300
different version number showing on the
206

206

00:07:23.300  -->  00:07:25.100
screen to what I got here but that's ok so
207

207

00:07:25.100  -->  00:07:26.450
long as it actually works
208

208

00:07:26.450  -->  00:07:28.580
it means it's the sqlite command
209

209

00:07:28.580  -->  00:07:31.040
line shell is now ready to go we can
210

210

00:07:31.040  -->  00:07:32.870
start using that in future videos
211

211

00:07:32.870  -->  00:07:36.110
alright so type .quit to get out of
212

212

00:07:36.110  -->  00:07:38.930
sqlite three and type exit to close down
213

213

00:07:38.930  -->  00:07:41.060
the command prompt window and this point
214

214

00:07:41.060  -->  00:07:42.590
your good to go sqlite 3 is
215

215

00:07:42.590  -->  00:07:45.830
installed on your Windows machine unless
216

216

00:07:45.830  -->  00:07:47.900
you've got a mac and a linux machine also
217

217

00:07:47.900  -->  00:07:49.490
you can actually skip the next two
218

218

00:07:49.490  -->  00:07:51.530
videos and move on to start where we
219

219

00:07:51.530  -->  00:07:53.840
actually start using sqlite 3 i'll
220

220

00:07:53.840  -->  00:07:59.770
see you in the next video
