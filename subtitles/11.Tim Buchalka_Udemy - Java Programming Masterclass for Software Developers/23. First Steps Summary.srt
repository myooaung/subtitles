00:00:04,810  -->  00:00:07,070
<v ->All righty, so this is the end of the section.</v>
2

2

00:00:07,070  -->  00:00:08,040
Now it's a summary.
3

3

00:00:08,040  -->  00:00:10,460
We went through quite a bit in this section of the course.
4

4

00:00:10,460  -->  00:00:12,120
We looked at Java keywords.
5

5

00:00:12,120  -->  00:00:13,640
We looked at code blocks.
6

6

00:00:13,640  -->  00:00:16,620
We looked at variables, primitive types.
7

7

00:00:16,620  -->  00:00:18,070
We looked at expressions.
8

8

00:00:18,070  -->  00:00:20,340
We looked at operators and operands,
9

9

00:00:20,340  -->  00:00:22,980
the ternary operator, the if-then statement,
10

10

00:00:22,980  -->  00:00:23,813
and a whole lot more.
11

11

00:00:23,813  -->  00:00:25,920
So we really covered quite a bit of ground,
12

12

00:00:25,920  -->  00:00:27,290
and this is the fundamental,
13

13

00:00:27,290  -->  00:00:29,380
sort of building block section of the course.
14

14

00:00:29,380  -->  00:00:31,210
From here, we'll take the basic knowledge
15

15

00:00:31,210  -->  00:00:33,490
that we've gathered in this section
16

16

00:00:33,490  -->  00:00:35,750
and move on to more complex stuff.
17

17

00:00:35,750  -->  00:00:37,480
Now, if you're stuck in any video
18

18

00:00:37,480  -->  00:00:39,000
in this section of the course,
19

19

00:00:39,000  -->  00:00:43,220
don't be afraid to go back and rewatch the video again.
20

20

00:00:43,220  -->  00:00:46,370
I would suggest that when any time anything's unclear,
21

21

00:00:46,370  -->  00:00:47,430
there's no shame in going back
22

22

00:00:47,430  -->  00:00:49,250
and watching a video the second time.
23

23

00:00:49,250  -->  00:00:51,560
Look, use the analogy of watching a video.
24

24

00:00:51,560  -->  00:00:53,740
If you're like me and you watch a video, a movie rather,
25

25

00:00:53,740  -->  00:00:56,680
for the second time, you generally will pick up things
26

26

00:00:56,680  -->  00:00:59,320
that you missed at the first time you watched the video.
27

27

00:00:59,320  -->  00:01:01,350
The same is true with training.
28

28

00:01:01,350  -->  00:01:02,880
If somebody's not quite clear,
29

29

00:01:02,880  -->  00:01:05,970
just rewatching the video again, retyping the code,
30

30

00:01:05,970  -->  00:01:08,070
will make things clear, so don't rush.
31

31

00:01:08,070  -->  00:01:09,840
Again, this is not a competition
32

32

00:01:09,840  -->  00:01:12,520
to get to the end of the course as quickly as possible.
33

33

00:01:12,520  -->  00:01:15,290
The goal is for you to learn Java so that hopefully,
34

34

00:01:15,290  -->  00:01:17,270
you can become a productive Java programmer
35

35

00:01:17,270  -->  00:01:19,340
and earn some good money in the meantime.
36

36

00:01:19,340  -->  00:01:20,280
So keep at it.
37

37

00:01:20,280  -->  00:01:21,890
Well, now time to move on to the next section.
38

38

00:01:21,890  -->  00:01:24,330
We'll get into the next level of Java code
39

39

00:01:24,330  -->  00:01:26,790
and build on the concepts that we've been through
40

40

00:01:26,790  -->  00:01:27,840
in this section of the course.
41

41

00:01:27,840  -->  00:01:29,440
So, see you in the next section.
