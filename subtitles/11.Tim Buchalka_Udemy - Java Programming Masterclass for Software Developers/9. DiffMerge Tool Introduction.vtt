00:00:04.720  -->  00:00:07.210
So let's discuss what the diffmerge
2

2

00:00:07.210  -->  00:00:09.760
tool is and how it can help you as a
3

3

00:00:09.760  -->  00:00:13.389
programmer. So diffmerge is a program
4

4

00:00:13.389  -->  00:00:15.670
that will help you to visually compare
5

5

00:00:15.670  -->  00:00:18.490
and merge files on any operating system.
6

6

00:00:18.490  -->  00:00:20.470
It can be very helpful with programming
7

7

00:00:20.470  -->  00:00:22.630
as well some other tools like code
8

8

00:00:22.630  -->  00:00:24.880
repositories use similar merge
9

9

00:00:24.880  -->  00:00:27.340
operations, so this will actually help
10

10

00:00:27.340  -->  00:00:29.320
you in the future when you start working
11

11

00:00:29.320  -->  00:00:32.259
with code repositories. So what are we
12

12

00:00:32.259  -->  00:00:33.760
trying to do with the diffmerge tool?
13

13

00:00:33.760  -->  00:00:36.129
Well when you code along with the videos
14

14

00:00:36.129  -->  00:00:38.710
in this course, it's easy to make a typo
15

15

00:00:38.710  -->  00:00:40.719
and get stuck and this is where the
16

16

00:00:40.719  -->  00:00:43.329
diffmerge tool will ultimately help you.
17

17

00:00:43.329  -->  00:00:46.090
Now every lesson has the code attached
18

18

00:00:46.090  -->  00:00:48.670
to it that I typed in the video and you
19

19

00:00:48.670  -->  00:00:51.010
can download that code in a zip file and
20

20

00:00:51.010  -->  00:00:53.410
unzip it on your computer and I'm going
21

21

00:00:53.410  -->  00:00:55.059
to explain and show you later how to go
22

22

00:00:55.059  -->  00:00:56.829
ahead and do that it is a pretty
23

23

00:00:56.829  -->  00:00:58.320
straightforward process.
24

24

00:00:58.320  -->  00:01:00.940
So by downloading and unzipping the code
25

25

00:01:00.940  -->  00:01:03.460
from the video and comparing it in other
26

26

00:01:03.460  -->  00:01:04.809
words comparing my version with what
27

27

00:01:04.809  -->  00:01:06.640
you've typed, you'll be able to easily
28

28

00:01:06.640  -->  00:01:08.619
find any errors or typos or
29

29

00:01:08.619  -->  00:01:11.110
inconsistencies using the diff merged
30

30

00:01:11.110  -->  00:01:13.060
tools it'll tell you what you've typed
31

31

00:01:13.060  -->  00:01:15.039
incorrectly in other words which will be
32

32

00:01:15.039  -->  00:01:17.770
the problem in most cases. So in other
33

33

00:01:17.770  -->  00:01:20.259
words it'll give you a way to figure out
34

34

00:01:20.259  -->  00:01:23.530
what's wrong with your code. Now with
35

35

00:01:23.530  -->  00:01:26.020
diffmerge, you can compare a single file
36

36

00:01:26.020  -->  00:01:29.080
or even the whole folder and visually
37

37

00:01:29.080  -->  00:01:31.360
see the differences side-by-side, so in
38

38

00:01:31.360  -->  00:01:32.979
other words, it'll show you your code and
39

39

00:01:32.979  -->  00:01:35.050
show you my code and you'll be able to
40

40

00:01:35.050  -->  00:01:37.539
see very easily what the difference is
41

41

00:01:37.539  -->  00:01:40.750
between the two code bases are. So that's
42

42

00:01:40.750  -->  00:01:42.789
the differmerge tool. In the next video,
43

43

00:01:42.789  -->  00:01:44.289
we're going to go ahead and install the
44

44

00:01:44.289  -->  00:01:45.849
program the differmerge program and
45

45

00:01:45.849  -->  00:01:47.440
then after that I'm going to take you
46

46

00:01:47.440  -->  00:01:48.670
through a process and show you how to
47

47

00:01:48.670  -->  00:01:51.069
use it to get the maximum benefit from
48

48

00:01:51.069  -->  00:01:55.590
it in this course. See you in the next video.
