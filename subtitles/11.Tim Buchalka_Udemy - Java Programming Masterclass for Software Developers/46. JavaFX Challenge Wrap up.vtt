00:00:05.560  -->  00:00:08.940
alright so let's so now add the code or

00:00:08.940  -->  00:00:12.430
the setup here to delete a contact so
alright so let's so now add the code or
3

the setup here to delete a contact so
4

4

00:00:15.220  -->  00:00:17.140
don't need a dialogue that would be nice
like edit we will need a menu item but we
5

5

00:00:17.140  -->  00:00:19.120
if we display a message though asking
don't need a dialogue that would be nice
6

6

00:00:19.120  -->  00:00:21.660
the user to confirm the deletion we can
if we display a message though asking
7

7

00:00:21.660  -->  00:00:23.580
do that instead of using the dialog box
the user to confirm the deletion we can
8

8

00:00:23.580  -->  00:00:25.960
which we don't need by using an alert
do that instead of using the dialog box
9

9

00:00:25.960  -->  00:00:28.630
box so first let's go ahead and add the
which we don't need by using an alert
10

10

00:00:28.630  -->  00:00:31.900
menu code to the main.xml come
box so first let's go ahead and add the
11

11

00:00:31.900  -->  00:00:34.960
over here duplicate the line we have
menu code to the main.xml come
12

12

00:00:34.960  -->  00:00:38.580
for edit copy and paste that will change that
over here duplicate the line we have
13

13

00:00:38.580  -->  00:00:46.260
to delete then the delete method going
for edit copy and paste that will change that
14

14

00:00:46.260  -->  00:00:48.490
to change the name of that to be the on
to delete then the delete method going
15

15

00:00:48.490  -->  00:00:50.760
action should say to delete contact
to change the name of that to be the on
16

16

00:00:50.760  -->  00:00:54.600
okay look take a copy of that so
action should say to delete contact
17

17

00:00:54.600  -->  00:00:56.100
let go now to our
okay look take a copy of that so
18

18

00:00:56.100  -->  00:00:58.380
controller and we're going to change the code or
let go now to our
19

19

00:00:58.380  -->  00:01:02.100
add the code so that's we
controller and we're going to change the code or
20

20

00:01:02.100  -->  00:01:03.490
can delete the record so we're going to
add the code so that's we
21

21

00:01:03.490  -->  00:01:08.100
clean it up a little bit and the code....
can delete the record so we're going to
22

22

00:01:08.100  -->  00:01:14.860
...
clean it up a little bit and the code....
23

23

00:01:14.860  -->  00:02:40.180
...
...
24

24

00:02:40.180  -->  00:02:41.860
we're going to add another alert now
...
25

25

00:02:41.860  -->  00:02:43.990
just as a confirmation before we go
we're going to add another alert now
26

26

00:02:43.990  -->  00:02:46.150
ahead and delete we do that with...
just as a confirmation before we go
27

27

00:02:46.150  -->  00:02:51.250
...
ahead and delete we do that with...
28

28

00:02:51.250  -->  00:03:48.030
...
...
29

29

00:03:48.030  -->  00:03:50.440
the last thing we need
...
30

30

00:03:50.440  -->  00:03:52.750
to do is just add our handling of the
the last thing we need
31

31

00:03:52.750  -->  00:03:57.190
the alert so optional button type....
to do is just add our handling of the
32

32

00:03:57.190  -->  00:04:03.780
....
the alert so optional button type....
33

33

00:04:03.780  -->  00:04:30.880
....
....
34

34

00:04:30.880  -->  00:04:32.680
code is very similar to the edit
....
35

35

00:04:32.680  -->  00:04:34.740
contact handler except we don't have to
code is very similar to the edit
36

36

00:04:34.740  -->  00:04:37.390
show a dialogue so first we're ensuring
contact handler except we don't have to
37

37

00:04:37.390  -->  00:04:39.520
that a contact is selected then we
show a dialogue so first we're ensuring
38

38

00:04:39.520  -->  00:04:41.650
display the confirmation message and
that a contact is selected then we
39

39

00:04:41.650  -->  00:04:43.390
just to be user-friendly we've included
display the confirmation message and
40

40

00:04:43.390  -->  00:04:45.760
the selected contacts first and last
just to be user-friendly we've included
41

41

00:04:45.760  -->  00:04:49.330
name in the confirmation message if the
the selected contacts first and last
42

42

00:04:49.330  -->  00:04:51.330
user confirms the delete by clicking ok
name in the confirmation message if the
43

43

00:04:51.330  -->  00:04:53.580
we are calling the delete contact method with
user confirms the delete by clicking ok
44

00:04:53.580  -->  00:04:56.050
the selected contact and after the

00:04:58.770  -->  00:05:01.150
remaining contacts now since we're using
we're going to we do save the
48

48

00:05:01.150  -->  00:05:02.800
data binding the table will
remaining contacts now since we're using
49

49

00:05:02.800  -->  00:05:04.150
automatically update as it has in the
data binding the table will
50

50

00:05:04.150  -->  00:05:06.130
other scenarios so let's just run this
automatically update as it has in the
51

51

00:05:06.130  -->  00:05:13.060
to confirm that will work out so firstly
other scenarios so let's just run this

in the case of not selecting contact

hasn't updated to be a hundred percent
63

63

00:05:35.410  -->  00:05:38.580
again to make sure that record still
sure will close the app down and run it
64

64

00:05:38.580  -->  00:05:41.110

this time going to click on OK
70

70

00:05:51.270  -->  00:05:54.910
and again shut down the to be sure their
the records deleted as you can see there
71

71

00:05:54.910  -->  00:05:58.830
aren't any issues and we got our three
and again shut down the to be sure their
72

72

00:05:58.830  -->  00:06:00.550
records
aren't any issues and we got our three
73

73

00:06:00.550  -->  00:06:02.380
alright so that's it we've completed our
records
74

74

00:06:02.380  -->  00:06:05.520
application now it would be nice if the
alright so that's it we've completed our
75

75

00:06:05.520  -->  00:06:07.330
table always filled the parent window
application now it would be nice if the
76

76

00:06:07.330  -->  00:06:09.990
depending on the contacts you added you
table always filled the parent window
77

77

00:06:09.990  -->  00:06:11.640
may find this an empty space to the
depending on the contacts you added you
78

78

00:06:11.640  -->  00:06:13.570
right of the columns and if we actually
may find this an empty space to the
79

79

00:06:13.570  -->  00:06:16.870
make this bigger you can see we end up
right of the columns and if we actually
80

80

00:06:16.870  -->  00:06:20.290
having a lot of space but also what we
make this bigger you can see we end up
81

81

00:06:20.290  -->  00:06:21.940
want to do here is that if we want to
having a lot of space but also what we
82

82

00:06:21.940  -->  00:06:24.310
make this smaller or larger we should
want to do here is that if we want to
83

83

00:06:24.310  -->  00:06:25.180
really be seeing that
make this smaller or larger we should
84

84

00:06:25.180  -->  00:06:28.210
table resizing just to basically fit the
really be seeing that
85

85

00:06:28.210  -->  00:06:30.910
window so that occupies the entire width
table resizing just to basically fit the
86

86

00:06:30.910  -->  00:06:34.060
so let's say add a bonus tip here to get
window so that occupies the entire width
87

87

00:06:34.060  -->  00:06:35.350
that to work
so let's say add a bonus tip here to get
88

88

00:06:35.350  -->  00:06:36.850
what you have to do is we have to set
that to work
89

89

00:06:36.850  -->  00:06:39.940
the column resize policy of the table
what you have to do is we have to set
90

90

00:06:39.940  -->  00:06:42.370
view so that the width of the columns
the column resize policy of the table
91

91

00:06:42.370  -->  00:06:43.960
will add up to the width of the
view so that the width of the columns
92

92

00:06:43.960  -->  00:06:46.960
tableview so right now the table view is
will add up to the width of the
93

93

00:06:46.960  -->  00:06:48.250
occupying the full width of the window
tableview so right now the table view is
94

94

00:06:48.250  -->  00:06:50.770
and we can see that in this case because
occupying the full width of the window
95

95

00:06:50.770  -->  00:06:53.020
of the alternating background color of
and we can see that in this case because
96

96

00:06:53.020  -->  00:06:55.270
the rows stretching across the entire
of the alternating background color of
97

97

00:06:55.270  -->  00:06:57.760
width of the window you can see between
the rows stretching across the entire
98

98

00:06:57.760  -->  00:07:00.460
as it is now but the column width
width of the window you can see between
99

99

00:07:00.460  -->  00:07:02.350
then selves aren't adding up to the width
as it is now but the column width
100

100

00:07:02.350  -->  00:07:04.240
of the tableview so in other words un
then selves aren't adding up to the width
101

101

00:07:04.240  -->  00:07:07.240
occupied space in the tableview so
of the tableview so in other words un
102

102

00:07:07.240  -->  00:07:09.160
let's go ahead and set the resize policy
occupied space in the tableview so
103

103

00:07:09.160  -->  00:07:13.210
to fix that we need to go back to our
let's go ahead and set the resize policy
104

104

00:07:13.210  -->  00:07:16.810
main . fxml file and just below
to fix that we need to go back to our
105

105

00:07:16.810  -->  00:07:19.960
where we have defined the tableview line
main . fxml file and just below
106

106

00:07:19.960  -->  00:07:22.210
after first definition we add
where we have defined the tableview line
107

107

00:07:22.210  -->  00:07:24.220
a column resize policies we put...
after first definition we add
108

108

00:07:24.220  -->  00:07:28.390
...
a column resize policies we put...
109

109

00:07:28.390  -->  00:07:40.540
...
...
110

110

00:07:40.540  -->  00:07:42.700
let's just run this and then we'll go
...
111

111

00:07:42.700  -->  00:07:48.400
back and talk about it notice already
let's just run this and then we'll go
112

112

00:07:48.400  -->  00:07:50.080
have things of space themselves a little
back and talk about it notice already
113

113

00:07:50.080  -->  00:07:52.690
bit more and make this a bigger we now got
have things of space themselves a little
114

114

00:07:52.690  -->  00:07:54.670
things expanding automatically to use up
bit more and make this a bigger we now got
115

115

00:07:54.670  -->  00:07:56.830
the amount of space we've got whether we
things expanding automatically to use up
116

116

00:07:56.830  -->  00:07:58.480
resize to make it larger or smaller
the amount of space we've got whether we
117

117

00:07:58.480  -->  00:08:00.490
that's obviously much better than what
resize to make it larger or smaller
118

118

00:08:00.490  -->  00:08:08.920
we had it so there are some other things
that's obviously much better than what
119

119

00:08:08.920  -->  00:08:10.510
you could certainly do to enhance this
we had it so there are some other things
120

120

00:08:10.510  -->  00:08:12.910
application example of a few things you
you could certainly do to enhance this
121

121

00:08:12.910  -->  00:08:13.750
could
application example of a few things you
122

122

00:08:13.750  -->  00:08:15.910
firstly allow the user to add more input
could
123

123

00:08:15.910  -->  00:08:19.480
about each contact or you could add the
firstly allow the user to add more input
124

124

00:08:19.480  -->  00:08:21.160
code to verify user input which will
about each contact or you could add the
125

125

00:08:21.160  -->  00:08:22.690
probably be something that i would
code to verify user input which will
126

126

00:08:22.690  -->  00:08:24.880
highly recommend you could look at
probably be something that i would
127

127

00:08:24.880  -->  00:08:26.860
adding cell factories to differentiate
highly recommend you could look at
128

128

00:08:26.860  -->  00:08:29.410
contacts in someway for example business
adding cell factories to differentiate
129

129

00:08:29.410  -->  00:08:32.260
vs personal etc allow the user to
contacts in someway for example business
130

130

00:08:32.260  -->  00:08:35.170
add a photo of each contact perhaps you
vs personal etc allow the user to
131

131

00:08:35.170  -->  00:08:37.090
can add a toolbar and if you're really
add a photo of each contact perhaps you
132

132

00:08:37.090  -->  00:08:38.860
feeling adventurous maybe add
can add a toolbar and if you're really
133

133

00:08:38.860  -->  00:08:40.570
error handling code to the load/store
feeling adventurous maybe add
134

134

00:08:40.570  -->  00:08:42.760
methods so that the user doesn't have to
error handling code to the load/store
135

135

00:08:42.760  -->  00:08:45.210
provide any notes for contact again you
methods so that the user doesn't have to
136

136

00:08:45.210  -->  00:08:46.540
saw what happened when I didn't provide
provide any notes for contact again you
