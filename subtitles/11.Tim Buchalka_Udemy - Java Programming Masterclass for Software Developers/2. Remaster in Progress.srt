00:00:04,900  -->  00:00:06,740
<v ->So I wanna let you know that I'm currently</v>
2

2

00:00:06,740  -->  00:00:10,130
in the process of remastering this entire course.
3

3

00:00:10,130  -->  00:00:12,840
So this course, firstly this is a 100% free,
4

4

00:00:12,840  -->  00:00:15,660
the upgrade, this remastering process for you.
5

5

00:00:15,660  -->  00:00:17,410
But what it involves is going through
6

6

00:00:17,410  -->  00:00:19,120
each and every video,
7

7

00:00:19,120  -->  00:00:20,960
and looking at what can be improved,
8

8

00:00:20,960  -->  00:00:23,150
adding new things. For example adding slides,
9

9

00:00:23,150  -->  00:00:25,550
because that was something that I got feedback on,
10

10

00:00:25,550  -->  00:00:27,760
but also common questions and answers.
11

11

00:00:27,760  -->  00:00:30,280
If there was any confusion in any of the videos,
12

12

00:00:30,280  -->  00:00:32,150
I'm addressing that, I'm looking at the
13

13

00:00:32,150  -->  00:00:33,470
questions that were asked,
14

14

00:00:33,470  -->  00:00:36,340
and improving the content were appropriate,
15

15

00:00:36,340  -->  00:00:38,320
and adding those answers to the videos.
16

16

00:00:38,320  -->  00:00:40,360
So it's all about making this a better experience
17

17

00:00:40,360  -->  00:00:41,510
for you, the student.
18

18

00:00:41,510  -->  00:00:43,240
And if there was any confusion,
19

19

00:00:43,240  -->  00:00:45,890
I'm looking to eliminate that in the new content.
20

20

00:00:45,890  -->  00:00:48,610
So the is that the remastered video content
21

21

00:00:48,610  -->  00:00:51,480
will still be substantially the same content,
22

22

00:00:51,480  -->  00:00:53,820
but with that said, it's going to be improved,
23

23

00:00:53,820  -->  00:00:56,580
and I guess I mentioned for the other reasons
24

24

00:00:56,580  -->  00:00:57,630
it's going to I think be
25

25

00:00:57,630  -->  00:00:59,430
a better experience for you.
26

26

00:00:59,430  -->  00:01:02,480
Now I'm remastering it one section at a time.
27

27

00:01:02,480  -->  00:01:05,890
It wouldn't work, certainly we're going through
28

28

00:01:05,890  -->  00:01:07,020
the process and trying to do
29

29

00:01:07,020  -->  00:01:08,790
one video at a time, because there would be
30

30

00:01:08,790  -->  00:01:11,720
some continuity issues, flowing from one video,
31

31

00:01:11,720  -->  00:01:15,050
into new credit content, comparing that
32

32

00:01:15,050  -->  00:01:16,420
to the old style content.
33

33

00:01:16,420  -->  00:01:18,240
It'll just put a bait for a confusing experience.
34

34

00:01:18,240  -->  00:01:20,310
So the best way to get around this
35

35

00:01:20,310  -->  00:01:22,520
is to do it one section at a time.
36

36

00:01:22,520  -->  00:01:24,570
So what I'm doing is, as I complete
37

37

00:01:24,570  -->  00:01:27,020
an entire section, I'm putting all the
38

38

00:01:27,020  -->  00:01:29,600
newly remastered content for that section
39

39

00:01:29,600  -->  00:01:30,870
in place at the same time,
40

40

00:01:30,870  -->  00:01:32,820
at the one time, and I'll be here
41

41

00:01:32,820  -->  00:01:34,360
sending through an announcement to mention that.
42

42

00:01:34,360  -->  00:01:37,010
So keep that in mind, also that it is
43

43

00:01:37,010  -->  00:01:38,160
a work in progress, and it's going to
44

44

00:01:38,160  -->  00:01:39,100
take a while.
45

45

00:01:39,100  -->  00:01:40,960
But if you're looking to check out
46

46

00:01:40,960  -->  00:01:42,500
the current work in progress,
47

47

00:01:42,500  -->  00:01:44,270
there is actually a work in progress section
48

48

00:01:44,270  -->  00:01:45,540
at the end of the course.
49

49

00:01:45,540  -->  00:01:47,310
So we skip on down to the end of the section,
50

50

00:01:47,310  -->  00:01:48,330
if you want, you can early access
51

51

00:01:48,330  -->  00:01:49,440
towards section content.
52

52

00:01:49,440  -->  00:01:50,386
By all mean you can do that.
53

53

00:01:50,386  -->  00:01:52,180
By all means, you can do that.
54

54

00:01:52,180  -->  00:01:53,630
But generally though, with that said,
55

55

00:01:53,630  -->  00:01:56,250
I would suggest you keep working through the course.
56

56

00:01:56,250  -->  00:01:58,660
Even though some of the other content is old,
57

57

00:01:58,660  -->  00:02:00,340
it's still 100% relevant.
58

58

00:02:00,340  -->  00:02:01,710
I mean it may not look quite as good
59

59

00:02:01,710  -->  00:02:03,410
because the videos are a little bit older
60

60

00:02:03,410  -->  00:02:05,100
that the ones I'm currently working on.
61

61

00:02:05,100  -->  00:02:06,400
But the worst thing you could do,
62

62

00:02:06,400  -->  00:02:09,720
is stop and not actually continue studying
63

63

00:02:09,720  -->  00:02:12,090
and wait for this new content to be released,
64

64

00:02:12,090  -->  00:02:13,216
because this is gonna stop and impact
65

65

00:02:13,216  -->  00:02:15,390
your journey to becoming a programmer.
66

66

00:02:15,390  -->  00:02:17,710
So you don't need to wait for the new content,
67

67

00:02:17,710  -->  00:02:19,140
but when the new content is there,
68

68

00:02:19,140  -->  00:02:20,335
obviously take advantage of it,
69

69

00:02:20,335  -->  00:02:21,440
and actually use it.
70

70

00:02:21,440  -->  00:02:23,480
So very important there, don't get into
71

71

00:02:23,480  -->  00:02:26,190
the trap of actually waiting for
72

72

00:02:26,190  -->  00:02:27,230
the new content, because I mean,
73

73

00:02:27,230  -->  00:02:29,530
it's a 77 hour course, it is going to
74

74

00:02:29,530  -->  00:02:31,081
take a while to finish.
75

75

00:02:31,081  -->  00:02:32,770
The other thing here just to keep in mind,
76

76

00:02:32,770  -->  00:02:35,150
the slides for the new content is available.
77

77

00:02:35,150  -->  00:02:36,940
There's a section at the end of the course,
78

78

00:02:36,940  -->  00:02:38,990
which gives you the process to go
79

79

00:02:38,990  -->  00:02:40,220
and grab the slides.
80

80

00:02:40,220  -->  00:02:41,900
Now those slides will be a work in progress
81

81

00:02:41,900  -->  00:02:44,140
as well, and as I complete the new sections,
82

82

00:02:44,140  -->  00:02:45,930
there'll be a new version of the slides file
83

83

00:02:45,930  -->  00:02:47,940
for you to grab and be able to access
84

84

00:02:47,940  -->  00:02:48,773
on your computer.
85

85

00:02:48,773  -->  00:02:50,410
So check that out at the end of the course,
86

86

00:02:50,410  -->  00:02:51,811
if you're interested in that.
87

87

00:02:51,811  -->  00:02:54,231
Other than that, as I mentioned I'll send out
88

88

00:02:54,231  -->  00:02:56,680
announcements of progress as I make it,
89

89

00:02:56,680  -->  00:02:58,210
as new content's released,
90

90

00:02:58,210  -->  00:02:59,460
just so you can be kept up to date.
91

91

00:02:59,460  -->  00:03:02,200
So make sure you got the announcements set,
92

92

00:03:02,200  -->  00:03:04,180
so you get my educational announcements
93

93

00:03:04,180  -->  00:03:05,600
on what content is up.
94

94

00:03:05,600  -->  00:03:07,130
And other than that, I hope you enjoy
95

95

00:03:07,130  -->  00:03:08,187
this new content.
96

96

00:03:08,187  -->  00:03:09,743
See you in the next video.
