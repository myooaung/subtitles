00:00:04.580  -->  00:00:07.850
<v ->So let's start our first Java programme in this course.</v>
2

2

00:00:07.850  -->  00:00:09.260
And it's always been a tradition
3

3

00:00:09.260  -->  00:00:11.140
when you're learning a new programming language
4

4

00:00:11.140  -->  00:00:13.225
to create a simple programme that outputs
5

5

00:00:13.225  -->  00:00:15.410
the text, hello world.
6

6

00:00:15.410  -->  00:00:17.690
Now we're going to do that in today's video.
7

7

00:00:17.690  -->  00:00:19.500
So for the best results for this course
8

8

00:00:19.500  -->  00:00:22.080
follow along and type where I'm typing
9

9

00:00:22.080  -->  00:00:24.400
and perform the operations that I'm performing.
10

10

00:00:24.400  -->  00:00:26.190
Don't just watch because you'll find you'll
11

11

00:00:26.190  -->  00:00:27.220
get a lot more out of it
12

12

00:00:27.220  -->  00:00:29.550
and things will just make a lot more sense.
13

13

00:00:29.550  -->  00:00:31.700
All right, so we've got IntelliJ IDEA loaded
14

14

00:00:31.700  -->  00:00:32.980
as you can see here.
15

15

00:00:32.980  -->  00:00:35.453
I'm gonna come up here and click on Create New Project.
16

16

00:00:38.247  -->  00:00:39.910
And this screen, this is the Community Edition,
17

17

00:00:39.910  -->  00:00:40.980
the free edition that I'm running.
18

18

00:00:40.980  -->  00:00:42.310
If you're running Ultimate Edition
19

19

00:00:42.310  -->  00:00:44.834
you will find there's some extra options down
20

20

00:00:44.834  -->  00:00:45.667
the left-hand side.
21

21

00:00:45.667  -->  00:00:47.180
However, both have the Java option here
22

22

00:00:47.180  -->  00:00:48.670
so make sure that's checked.
23

23

00:00:48.670  -->  00:00:50.190
And then you'll come over here and also make sure
24

24

00:00:50.190  -->  00:00:53.837
that Project SDK has got the current version 11,
25

25

00:00:53.837  -->  00:00:54.927
JDK Version 11.
26

26

00:00:54.927  -->  00:00:56.363
Now as of the time I'm recording this video
27

27

00:00:56.363  -->  00:01:00.059
it's 11.0.3, so if you haven't got anything there
28

28

00:01:00.059  -->  00:01:01.960
or you've got a different version
29

29

00:01:01.960  -->  00:01:03.900
go back to the instal win-stallation of
30

30

00:01:03.900  -->  00:01:06.897
the Java Development Kit videos and grab JDK 11,
31

31

00:01:06.897  -->  00:01:08.970
And there's also a video in there which explains
32

32

00:01:08.970  -->  00:01:12.500
the reasoning for using JDK 11 in case you're wondering
33

33

00:01:12.500  -->  00:01:13.333
because, of course, there is
34

34

00:01:13.333  -->  00:01:15.320
a newer version already available.
35

35

00:01:15.320  -->  00:01:17.840
Right, so once that's selected, click on Next.
36

36

00:01:17.840  -->  00:01:19.580
Now there's an option there to create a template.
37

37

00:01:19.580  -->  00:01:21.770
We're going to not use that for now
38

38

00:01:21.770  -->  00:01:23.670
but we'll be using that later in the course.
39

39

00:01:23.670  -->  00:01:25.020
So I'm gonna click on Next.
40

40

00:01:26.000  -->  00:01:27.595
Now here is where we define the location
41

41

00:01:27.595  -->  00:01:29.510
and the project name.
42

42

00:01:29.510  -->  00:01:32.890
So I'm gonna start by calling this one Hello World.
43

43

00:01:32.890  -->  00:01:35.000
Now note that I can out spaces in there
44

44

00:01:35.000  -->  00:01:36.500
but it's not a good idea in general
45

45

00:01:36.500  -->  00:01:39.201
to use spaces either as a name, as a file name,
46

46

00:01:39.201  -->  00:01:41.470
a project name in this case because that will
47

47

00:01:41.470  -->  00:01:44.430
ultimately be part of the folder or the project location.
48

48

00:01:44.430  -->  00:01:47.400
So I'm gonna suggest your always just capitalise
49

49

00:01:47.400  -->  00:01:49.040
the words if you want to separate
50

50

00:01:49.040  -->  00:01:50.740
them instead of using space.
51

51

00:01:50.740  -->  00:01:54.210
The other thing we need to do is specify a project location.
52

52

00:01:54.210  -->  00:01:57.640
And what I suggest you do, just for ease of organisation
53

53

00:01:57.640  -->  00:02:01.070
to put all the projects in a specific directory
54

54

00:02:01.070  -->  00:02:03.070
noting that every time we create a new project
55

55

00:02:03.070  -->  00:02:05.910
in IntelliJ it's gonna create a subfolder.
56

56

00:02:05.910  -->  00:02:07.610
So what I'm gonna do is navigate, in my case
57

57

00:02:07.610  -->  00:02:09.030
I've create network drive.
58

58

00:02:09.030  -->  00:02:10.450
I'm gonna navigate to that by clicking on
59

59

00:02:10.450  -->  00:02:12.060
the ellipses here, the three dots,
60

60

00:02:12.060  -->  00:02:14.030
and I'm gonna go to that folder,
61

61

00:02:14.030  -->  00:02:16.310
and what I'm going to do, is put all my code in there.
62

62

00:02:16.310  -->  00:02:18.130
So I'm gonna go in this folder.
63

63

00:02:18.130  -->  00:02:20.587
I've got one here called Java Masterclass Remaster.
64

64

00:02:20.587  -->  00:02:22.220
So I'm gonna select Current.
65

65

00:02:22.220  -->  00:02:24.110
That's really where I want all my files to be.
66

66

00:02:24.110  -->  00:02:25.500
Now the first time you do this.
67

67

00:02:25.500  -->  00:02:27.200
If you come down and have a look down the end of
68

68

00:02:27.200  -->  00:02:29.030
the folder location here.
69

69

00:02:29.030  -->  00:02:31.210
It's going to put that in the root folder.
70

70

00:02:31.210  -->  00:02:33.516
So what you may need to do the first time you specify
71

71

00:02:33.516  -->  00:02:36.913
a new project location is go back in there a second time.
72

72

00:02:37.950  -->  00:02:39.810
Once you're in that folder, we wanna create a new
73

73

00:02:39.810  -->  00:02:41.063
folder in that subfolder.
74

74

00:02:41.920  -->  00:02:44.150
And come over here in this case to New Folder.
75

75

00:02:44.150  -->  00:02:45.440
And it might look slightly different
76

76

00:02:45.440  -->  00:02:47.357
on a Mac or a Lynx platform,
77

77

00:02:47.357  -->  00:02:49.030
but there's a New Folder option
78

78

00:02:49.030  -->  00:02:53.000
and I'm gonna call it HelloWorld, again without spaces.
79

79

00:02:53.000  -->  00:02:54.490
Click on OK.
80

80

00:02:54.490  -->  00:02:55.930
Click on OK again.
81

81

00:02:55.930  -->  00:02:57.660
So what you should see now on your screen is
82

82

00:02:57.660  -->  00:02:59.530
the project name and the end of
83

83

00:02:59.530  -->  00:03:01.970
the project location showing the same thing.
84

84

00:03:01.970  -->  00:03:03.950
So in subsequent projects as I mentioned,
85

85

00:03:03.950  -->  00:03:06.660
you should find that it will automatically do that for you.
86

86

00:03:06.660  -->  00:03:08.698
So we've now got a subfolder being created,
87

87

00:03:08.698  -->  00:03:11.410
our current Java Masterclass Remaster,
88

88

00:03:11.410  -->  00:03:13.550
that's the folder that I've decided to use
89

89

00:03:13.550  -->  00:03:14.960
everytime you create a new project
90

90

00:03:14.960  -->  00:03:17.380
it's going to create a subfolder with our project.
91

91

00:03:17.380  -->  00:03:20.560
And that's just, is really a nice way to organise things.
92

92

00:03:20.560  -->  00:03:23.023
All right, so I'm gonna click on Finish at this point.
93

93

00:03:25.360  -->  00:03:26.570
All right, you can see that there's a bit
94

94

00:03:26.570  -->  00:03:29.050
of setting-up from IntelliJ and eventually we got
95

95

00:03:29.050  -->  00:03:31.009
this little project pane on the left-hand side opened.
96

96

00:03:31.009  -->  00:03:34.110
Now this project location, we're gonna be talking more
97

97

00:03:34.110  -->  00:03:36.263
about that later but essentially this is like
98

98

00:03:36.263  -->  00:03:39.360
an area that has automatically been set-up by IntelliJ
99

99

00:03:39.360  -->  00:03:41.550
for our programme code and it's organising
100

100

00:03:41.550  -->  00:03:42.810
things in a certain way.
101

101

00:03:42.810  -->  00:03:43.930
So we can come over here and click on
102

102

00:03:43.930  -->  00:03:45.670
this little greater than sign there
103

103

00:03:45.670  -->  00:03:47.360
which will open up the folder.
104

104

00:03:47.360  -->  00:03:50.550
So we've got this .idea which is IntelliJ IDEA's
105

105

00:03:50.550  -->  00:03:53.280
sort of working files, and this IML file.
106

106

00:03:53.280  -->  00:03:55.380
We don't need to worry about any of these now.
107

107

00:03:55.380  -->  00:03:56.495
What we wanna do is now create
108

108

00:03:56.495  -->  00:03:59.430
our first Java programming class.
109

109

00:03:59.430  -->  00:04:02.570
So to do that, we're gonna right-click this SLC Folder,
110

110

00:04:02.570  -->  00:04:04.220
that's actually a folder.
111

111

00:04:04.220  -->  00:04:06.970
Click on New and select Java Class.
112

112

00:04:06.970  -->  00:04:08.820
And we're gonna call this one, Hello.
113

113

00:04:10.090  -->  00:04:10.923
Click on OK.
114

114

00:04:12.390  -->  00:04:14.740
And you can see that when I've done that I've automatically
115

115

00:04:14.740  -->  00:04:17.140
got some code showing on the right-hand window
116

116

00:04:17.140  -->  00:04:19.150
and to the left in the Project Pane
117

117

00:04:19.150  -->  00:04:21.600
we've got Hello with a little c in blue
118

118

00:04:21.600  -->  00:04:24.410
and that just denotes that it's a class.
119

119

00:04:24.410  -->  00:04:26.190
Now Java programmes and most other
120

120

00:04:26.190  -->  00:04:28.520
programming languages have keywords.
121

121

00:04:28.520  -->  00:04:30.700
Now each keyword has a specific meaning
122

122

00:04:30.700  -->  00:04:33.620
and sometimes they need to be used in a specific order.
123

123

00:04:33.620  -->  00:04:35.980
You write Java programmes by following a specific
124

124

00:04:35.980  -->  00:04:38.760
set of rules, a syntax, using a combination
125

125

00:04:38.760  -->  00:04:40.500
of these keywords and other things you'll see
126

126

00:04:40.500  -->  00:04:44.020
which collectively form a Java programme.
127

127

00:04:44.020  -->  00:04:46.536
And just a thing to note, keywords are case sensitive.
128

128

00:04:46.536  -->  00:04:50.370
So the word public, for example, and public with a capital p
129

129

00:04:50.370  -->  00:04:53.060
and even public all in uppercase, well they're considered
130

130

00:04:53.060  -->  00:04:55.830
as different things to Java and in fact many other
131

131

00:04:55.830  -->  00:04:57.480
programming languages.
132

132

00:04:57.480  -->  00:05:00.050
Right, so looking at the code we can see on the screen there
133

133

00:05:00.050  -->  00:05:02.990
public and class are two Java keywords.
134

134

00:05:02.990  -->  00:05:06.080
And note that IntelliJ highlights those or bolds them.
135

135

00:05:06.080  -->  00:05:07.560
They have both got a specific meaning
136

136

00:05:07.560  -->  00:05:09.770
which we'll find more about moving forward.
137

137

00:05:09.770  -->  00:05:12.033
So the public Java keyword is what's called
138

138

00:05:12.033  -->  00:05:14.090
an access modifier.
139

139

00:05:14.090  -->  00:05:16.610
So an access modifier allows us to define the scope
140

140

00:05:16.610  -->  00:05:18.540
or how other parts of your code
141

141

00:05:18.540  -->  00:05:22.048
or even someone else's code can access our code.
142

142

00:05:22.048  -->  00:05:24.750
But we'll be going into details for that later.
143

143

00:05:24.750  -->  00:05:26.950
For now, we're gonna be using the public access modifier
144

144

00:05:26.950  -->  00:05:30.000
anytime we create a new project to give full access.
145

145

00:05:30.000  -->  00:05:31.810
And again, we'll come back to access modifiers
146

146

00:05:31.810  -->  00:05:33.790
at the appropriate stage in the course
147

147

00:05:33.790  -->  00:05:34.970
once we've filled in some of
148

148

00:05:34.970  -->  00:05:37.360
the blanks with your Java knowledge.
149

149

00:05:37.360  -->  00:05:39.520
All right so, next we're gonna look at class
150

150

00:05:39.520  -->  00:05:41.130
the keyword class.
151

151

00:05:41.130  -->  00:05:43.480
So what we've done here is we've defined the class.
152

152

00:05:43.480  -->  00:05:45.809
Now the class keyword is used to define a class
153

153

00:05:45.809  -->  00:05:49.220
and the class name will be the text following the keyword,
154

154

00:05:49.220  -->  00:05:50.980
so hello in this case.
155

155

00:05:50.980  -->  00:05:53.178
Also notice the left and right curly braces used
156

156

00:05:53.178  -->  00:05:56.170
to define the class block.
157

157

00:05:56.170  -->  00:05:58.290
So to define a class it requires an optional
158

158

00:05:58.290  -->  00:06:00.120
access modifier at the start, and in this case
159

159

00:06:00.120  -->  00:06:03.050
we've used public followed by the keyword class
160

160

00:06:03.050  -->  00:06:05.700
followed by the left and right curly braces.
161

161

00:06:05.700  -->  00:06:07.160
And the left and right curly braces
162

162

00:06:07.160  -->  00:06:09.310
are defining the class body.
163

163

00:06:09.310  -->  00:06:10.950
Now anything in between that body,
164

164

00:06:10.950  -->  00:06:13.180
between the left curly brace and the right curly brace,
165

165

00:06:13.180  -->  00:06:15.800
is considered part of this class.
166

166

00:06:15.800  -->  00:06:17.280
We can have data and code,
167

167

00:06:17.280  -->  00:06:20.277
as you'll see as we progress through the course.
168

168

00:06:20.277  -->  00:06:21.730
All right so, that's our first project
169

169

00:06:21.730  -->  00:06:23.830
and our first class defined.
170

170

00:06:23.830  -->  00:06:25.127
Let's finish the video here.
171

171

00:06:25.127  -->  00:06:26.580
And in the next one,
172

172

00:06:26.580  -->  00:06:28.638
we're going to add our first ever method
173

173

00:06:28.638  -->  00:06:30.740
as well as finding out what a method is
174

174

00:06:30.740  -->  00:06:32.350
and then move forward to printing out
175

175

00:06:32.350  -->  00:06:33.900
that hello world message.
176

176

00:06:33.900  -->  00:06:35.600
So I'll see you in the next video.
