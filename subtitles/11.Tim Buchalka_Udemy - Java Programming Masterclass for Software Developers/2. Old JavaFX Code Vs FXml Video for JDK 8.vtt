00:00:05.450  -->  00:00:10.300
ok so continuing on so we talked about
this code that has been
2

2

00:00:10.300  -->  00:00:14.230
automatically generated by IntelliJ
let's start making some changes to it
3

3

00:00:14.230  -->  00:00:18.290
now so first things first let's change
the title but before I do that lets just
4

4

00:00:18.290  -->  00:00:23.900
run it again as a recap you can see it's a
very basic interface their its got hello world at
5

5

00:00:23.900  -->  00:00:27.430
the top so to change title you probably guess how to do that we come
6

6

00:00:27.430  -->  00:00:30.730
back here on to line 14 and change that to Hello JavaFX
7

7

00:00:31.930  -->  00:00:41.200
...make that change and run it again and
obviously now on the title of the window is now
8

8

00:00:41.200  -->  00:00:46.150
has been changed to Hello
JavaFX but let's make another change lets actually
9

9

00:00:46.150  -->  00:00:50.800
get it to say Welcome to JavaFX within the
window instead of changing the title now
10

10

00:00:50.800  -->  00:00:55.170
there's two ways to go about this we can
use code in the java code itself or we can
11

11

00:00:55.170  -->  00:01:00.230
change the fxml file so I'm gonna show
you both ways but let's change the
12

12

00:01:00.230  -->  00:01:04.820
application so that it doesn't use xml file at all instead will do everything
13

13

00:01:04.820  -->  00:01:09.420
through code and then later on we'll go
back and look at the fxml so first
14

14

00:01:09.420  -->  00:01:13.490
we going to do is we are going to comment out the load on line 13 because we're not
15

15

00:01:13.490  -->  00:01:16.310
gonna be using the same fxml so comment that out
16

16

00:01:16.310  -->  00:01:19.880
then we need to add the
code manually that's going to create
17

17

00:01:19.880  -->  00:01:24.740
this grid pane node and it can be very
useful you to learn how to do this
18

18

00:01:24.740  -->  00:01:28.420
way as well doing it manually and also learning to use the fxml
19

19

00:01:28.420  -->  00:01:33.530
file so what we're going to do is type
in what is the equivalent code to what
20

20

00:01:33.530  -->  00:01:41.880
was in the fxml file so type....
21

21

00:01:41.880  -->  00:01:48.030
.....
22

22

00:01:49.140  -->  00:01:58.770
.....
23

23

00:01:58.770  -->  00:02:02.590
......
24

24

00:02:03.640  -->  00:02:10.130
....and in case your wondering on what am i
25

25

00:02:10.130  -->  00:02:14.390
doing here looking back at the sample fxml file the code I'm typing is
26

26

00:02:14.390  -->  00:02:18.430
effectively the replacement for this
setting the alignment to center
27

27

00:02:18.430  -->  00:02:22.340
the horizontal gap to 10 and vertical
gap to 10 so we're doing that in code
28

28

00:02:22.340  -->  00:02:28.090
here on line 18 to 20 so I've done that manually and
consequently there we've got a route
29

29

00:02:28.090  -->  00:02:31.780
object so the rest there should work
so before we actually make a change
30

30

00:02:31.780  -->  00:02:34.680
putting text in the window we should be
able to run this and get the same result
31

31

00:02:34.680  -->  00:02:43.840
we had when we had the sample.fxml file so if we run that you can see we still got our window so we are now constructing a window
32

32

00:02:43.840  -->  00:02:50.450
creating it without the fxml file and
incidentally I didn't really say what h gap or v gap was you can
33

33

00:02:50.450  -->  00:02:55.680
probably guess it it's the horizontal
gap between columns in the grid that is what h gap
34

34

00:02:55.680  -->  00:03:00.100
is and v gap is the vertical gap
between rows and grids and we set them both
35

35

00:03:00.100  -->  00:03:05.700
to 10 because that what was set in the
sample.fxml for now you could certainly
36

36

00:03:05.700  -->  00:03:09.820
experiment with different values if you wanted
to and the alignment itself determines
37

37

00:03:09.820  -->  00:03:13.510
where the grid will actually sit
within the grid panes width and height
38

38

00:03:13.510  -->  00:03:17.230
and the set alignment so we are using Pos.CENTER which again is the equivalent
39

39

00:03:17.230  -->  00:03:23.820
of that alignment command that used that I showed you earlier from that sample.fxml so now that we got the same basis to
40

40

00:03:23.820  -->  00:03:27.590
what we had before before I commented out the sample.fxml
41

41

00:03:27.590  -->  00:03:34.790
file let's now add to that so what I'm going to do is add some code to add a label so to do that what I'm going to do
42

42

00:03:34.790  -->  00:03:39.840
is come down to here and before the primaryStage.Show I'm gonna start typing the code in
43

43

00:03:39.840  -->  00:03:45.700
their so lets type....noticing that is javafx.scene control and.....
44

44

00:03:45.700  -->  00:03:51.870
.....we are using the javafx.scene as the
45

45

00:03:51.870  -->  00:04:00.010
import......
46

46

00:04:00.010  -->  00:04:13.340
...so it seems a bit cumbersome
47

47

00:04:13.340  -->  00:04:17.620
to add but on line 27 that's what we need
to do any time we're adding a control
48

48

00:04:17.620  -->  00:04:19.340
basically to our
49

49

00:04:19.340  -->  00:04:22.690
scene that's the way it actually works
you need to use the root.get
50

50

00:04:22.690  -->  00:04:26.700
children and .add and whenever the name
of the controllers we are adding we
51

51

00:04:26.700  -->  00:04:30.050
need to put that code in before the
primaryStage.show so that it is
52

52

00:04:30.050  -->  00:04:30.880
on screen and then
53

53

00:04:30.880  -->  00:04:33.770
when we run it should actually work so if
we run this now and have a look and see
54

54

00:04:33.770  -->  00:04:40.770
what's happened you we now got Welcome to
JavaFX showing within the window itself so
55

55

00:04:40.770  -->  00:04:45.360
that's good that its has been added
automatically so closing that down let's
56

56

00:04:45.360  -->  00:04:48.370
change it a little bit let's actually
change the color so to do that we're going
57

57

00:04:48.370  -->  00:04:54.270
to come down here and type greeting will do that just
after the definition with declaration on
58

58

00:04:54.270  -->  00:05:04.130
line 26 so....now noticing when it is asking
59

59

00:05:04.130  -->  00:05:07.090
which import we want to make sure each time
you doing this that you are actually
60

60

00:05:07.090  -->  00:05:08.340
importing the right one
61

61

00:05:08.340  -->  00:05:12.870
JavaFX.scene.paint is the right package in this case so I'm gonna click
62

62

00:05:12.870  -->  00:05:22.150
on that and I'm gonna use .green for this....we should be able to run again and see the text in
63

63

00:05:22.150  -->  00:05:27.210
green you can see that their just focusing at it you can see it is now in green so
64

64

00:05:27.210  -->  00:05:31.310
that's working that's good ok so let's
do something else now let's actually
65

65

00:05:31.310  -->  00:05:36.190
change the font and make it bold and to
do this we need to call the set font
66

66

00:05:36.190  -->  00:05:40.720
method and then we set the font we are going to set the font to Times New Roman as well
67

67

00:05:40.720  -->  00:05:46.650
so how we do that we come down here to line 28 just after the set fill I'm
68

68

00:05:46.650  -->  00:05:47.520
going to type
69

69

00:05:47.520  -->  00:05:51.000
......
70

70

00:05:51.860  -->  00:05:58.810
change the font set that to....so we are using a static method.....
71

71

00:05:58.810  -->  00:06:01.880
and you can see on the screen their javafx.scene so we are getting you to be
72

72

00:06:01.880  -->  00:06:05.250
making sure your imports are from javafx because you can see lots of different
73

73

00:06:05.250  -->  00:06:13.330
choices their the so....
74

74

00:06:13.330  -->  00:06:18.500
...and this is case sensitive so make sure you type it exactly as you see it and
75

75

00:06:18.500  -->  00:06:24.190
we said we are gonna do it in bold so....
76

76

00:06:24.190  -->  00:06:27.610
.....again making sure
77

77

00:06:27.610  -->  00:06:31.180
that javafx.scene is selected
I'm just trying to get into the habit of
78

78

00:06:31.180  -->  00:06:36.830
making sure your imports are using
JavaFX all the time so we specified bold you
79

79

00:06:36.830  -->  00:06:40.380
might also want to change the font size
lets changed that to 70 so that's an
80

80

00:06:40.380  -->  00:06:42.890
additional parameter so it's 70
81

81

00:06:42.890  -->  00:06:48.450
....and once we do that we should be
able to run that again
82

82

00:06:48.450  -->  00:06:56.480
so we run that and you can see that is now much larger
and we can expand this out and have a nice screen their
83

83

00:06:56.480  -->  00:07:00.790
as you see on the middle their in green and is
now taking up a lot more space because
84

84

00:07:00.790  -->  00:07:06.080
it's a much larger because we've use a larger font so
that's how to go about doing some coding
85

85

00:07:06.080  -->  00:07:11.600
within the actual java code itself instead of
using the fxml file so I'm going to
86

86

00:07:11.600  -->  00:07:15.960
close it down but let's have a look at
how to make the same changes using
87

87

00:07:15.960  -->  00:07:21.400
fxml so what we gonna do is firstly
un-comment the fxml loader.load again
88

88

00:07:21.400  -->  00:07:24.530
and we are gonna comment the other line that we actually introduced
89

89

00:07:24.530  -->  00:07:31.280
so lets come up down here first and comment out all these
lines and we need do it in two parts so
90

90

00:07:31.280  -->  00:07:36.690
comment out that first part first and then
down here we need to do those as well and the
91

91

00:07:36.690  -->  00:07:42.650
add as well just to make it easier to read
I'm gonna come up here paste that at the top
92

92

00:07:42.650  -->  00:07:47.610
there and let's put this code and down here as well
just so that it's actually separate and
93

93

00:07:47.610  -->  00:07:53.550
its not gonna confuse us so basically all that code their on lines 26 to 34 was the code that we added
94

94

00:07:53.550  -->  00:07:59.850
manually and I'm now going un delete or
remove the comments to make this valid
95

95

00:07:59.850  -->  00:08:04.060
so we are now using the fxml file again
and just to confirm will run this we
96

96

00:08:04.060  -->  00:08:09.100
should have our basic Windows showing
again basic window again and it is
97

97

00:08:09.100  -->  00:08:13.420
showing Hello JavaFX and that's because we'd
still have made the code change on line 21
98

98

00:08:13.420  -->  00:08:18.170
for the title but lets now go into the fxml file and make same changes we made
99

99

00:08:18.170  -->  00:08:22.800
in code but using the fxml file and obviously the welcome isn't their anymore
100

100

00:08:22.800  -->  00:08:27.820
because of course we deleted that code so in the sample.fxml let's make the same
101

101

00:08:27.820  -->  00:08:31.920
change and to do that we leave the first
bit in the grid pane but within the
102

102

00:08:31.920  -->  00:08:35.500
grid pane we come to the end here and we
actually add our label so now we can type.....
103

103

00:08:35.500  -->  00:08:41.440
.....
104

104

00:08:43.660  -->  00:08:50.420
...and notice how it automatically added another label for
105

105

00:08:50.420  -->  00:08:54.230
us and we're going to the ending
label for us to close it off and will
106

106

00:08:54.230  -->  00:08:59.880
leave that in their now so if we run it again we should see our greeting again Welcome to JavaFX
107

107

00:08:59.880  -->  00:09:03.510
is showing on the screen again so that's
good you can see that's working now so
108

108

00:09:03.510  -->  00:09:08.870
lets now set the font and text color
and sizes as well and to do that we need to put
109

109

00:09:08.870  -->  00:09:16.260
that within the label section so we are gonna
start up by typing....
110

110

00:09:16.260  -->  00:09:20.910
...and it adds the closing section
automatically and within their we need
111

111

00:09:20.910  -->  00:09:21.370
to type....
112

112

00:09:21.370  -->  00:09:29.020
......and notice how it did the import
for us you saw that change and...
113

113

00:09:29.020  -->  00:09:36.450
.....
114

114

00:09:36.450  -->  00:09:47.380
...but you will see here that font weight
115

115

00:09:47.380  -->  00:09:52.690
it properly doesn't exist so this is one
case where the fxml differs from the
116

116

00:09:52.690  -->  00:09:57.630
way we do it in code so what we gonna do
is delete the font weight property I'll show you the
117

117

00:09:57.630  -->  00:10:01.730
alternate way to do it in
the fxml code you don't do it like that instead
118

118

00:10:01.730  -->  00:10:05.940
what we do is we come back to
the font name change that to
119

119

00:10:05.940  -->  00:10:08.570
....
120

120

00:10:08.570  -->  00:10:13.700
you do it like that so the font weight is specified as part of the font
121

121

00:10:13.700  -->  00:10:18.510
name when using the fxml and I guess
it's not too surprising and the reason I
122

122

00:10:18.510  -->  00:10:21.690
say that is because when presenting
font choices some programs list the fonts
123

123

00:10:21.690  -->  00:10:25.740
this way you may have seen that in Microsoft Word for argument sake but with that said its a little
124

124

00:10:25.740  -->  00:10:29.360
unexpected which is the reason I wanted
to show you that and how things can
125

125

00:10:29.360  -->  00:10:34.260
differ sometimes when you comparing the
code way of doing it versus the fxml way and
126

126

00:10:34.260  -->  00:10:38.660
lastly let's also set the color so
we've actually defined the front but we
127

127

00:10:38.660  -->  00:10:42.160
want to change the color of the lable
so how we do that well that's done in the
128

128

00:10:42.160  -->  00:10:50.040
label sections and so we come down here after the end of our message we put.....
129

129

00:10:50.040  -->  00:10:53.110
....
130

130

00:10:53.110  -->  00:10:58.970
you notice that helpfully IntelliJ actually showing you the code and the actual causes it is going to be used so press enter for
131

131

00:10:58.970  -->  00:11:04.640
that one and you'll may also have notice that shown the hex codes on the right hand side which is pretty cool as well so when we
132

132

00:11:04.640  -->  00:11:07.640
run that now we should see something
very similar to what we had before
133

133

00:11:08.660  -->  00:11:14.000
again we've got our Welcome expanded it out and there's
the same thing we've got using the fxml
134

134

00:11:14.000  -->  00:11:17.730
file what we did earlier in
the video in Java code
135

135

00:11:17.730  -->  00:11:22.970
interestingly enough when we define a UI
controller using fxml we can still change its property
136

136

00:11:22.970  -->  00:11:28.410
Code and in fact that is often you
probably want to do so for example we
137

137

00:11:28.410  -->  00:11:32.330
might want to enable or disable buttons
in response to a user action now we are gonna
138

138

00:11:32.330  -->  00:11:36.730
cover how to work with controls to find
in the fxml in the later lectures just
139

139

00:11:36.730  -->  00:11:41.110
to let you know so as you see we can
create the UI by creating the UI
140

140

00:11:41.110  -->  00:11:44.560
control through code and setting their
properties and adding it to the
141

141

00:11:44.560  -->  00:11:48.570
appropriate parents or we can do it
through if fxml now for the rest of the
142

142

00:11:48.570  -->  00:11:54.200
JavaFX lectures we are gonna focus on the
fxml route the fxml forces
143

143

00:11:54.200  -->  00:11:58.680
as two separate our UI from our business
logic and data and that is considered best
144

144

00:11:58.680  -->  00:12:03.200
practice to define the UI through fxml as much as possible and for that reason
145

145

00:12:03.200  -->  00:12:06.050
we are going to be doing that in this
section
146

146

00:12:06.050  -->  00:12:10.570
now an exception to that would be the stage
the java runtime constructs for us
147

147

00:12:10.570  -->  00:12:15.220
and passes the start method we have to
work within code that first part now another
148

148

00:12:15.220  -->  00:12:20.240
good reason for defining UI controls in
fxml rather than through code is if
149

149

00:12:20.240  -->  00:12:22.240
we decided we want to show how a UI controller
150

150

00:12:22.240  -->  00:12:26.990
looks we don't have to touch a line of
Java code and that's pretty cool so when we
151

151

00:12:26.990  -->  00:12:30.790
added the greeting to window and change
the color and font of the label using
152

152

00:12:30.790  -->  00:12:35.580
fxml we didn't have to touch the main Java
file and one of the strengths of java
153

153

00:12:35.580  -->  00:12:39.060
FX is that we can change how an
application looks without actually
154

154

00:12:39.060  -->  00:12:42.760
changing a line of Java code which is
something we couldn't do previously
155

155

00:12:42.760  -->  00:12:47.770
with swing which was the previous
GUI tool that java use to used so the
156

156

00:12:47.770  -->  00:12:51.630
defining the UI using fxml is also
similar to how UIs are coded in
157

157

00:12:51.630  -->  00:12:55.920
other types of applications like Android
which you may have seen if you've taken my
158

158

00:12:55.920  -->  00:12:58.040
android course but also for Windows as
well
159

159

00:12:58.040  -->  00:13:02.190
the concepts are the same and so
understanding and using fxml for our JavaFX
160

160

00:13:02.190  -->  00:13:05.170
applications will give us a head start
when
161

161

00:13:05.170  -->  00:13:08.360
it comes to learning how to code other
types of applications but I wanted to
162

162

00:13:08.360  -->  00:13:12.170
show you that you can create UI
components using code but with that said we are gonna
163

163

00:13:12.170  -->  00:13:17.260
stick with fxml whenever possible from now for the reason I have outlined earlier it is really the best
164

164

00:13:17.260  -->  00:13:22.600
practice ok so that's been a really brief introduction to JavaFX so in the next video we are gonna start
165

165

00:13:22.600  -->  00:13:25.950
taking a look at the JavaFX layouts I will see you oin the next video
