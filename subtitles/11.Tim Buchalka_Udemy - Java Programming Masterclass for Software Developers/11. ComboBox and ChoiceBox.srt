1

00:00:05,400  -->  00:00:08,490
so just before we go on with textView I just want to show you one other
2

2

00:00:08,490  -->  00:00:12,870
quick thing that we can do with radio buttons now we set up a v box
3

3

00:00:12,870  -->  00:00:17,360
and a h box for the check boxes and
toggle buttons we can all put radio
4

4

00:00:17,360  -->  00:00:22,290
buttons in our boxes as well so I'm gonna put the
radio buttons in the v box now it often can be
5

5

00:00:22,290  -->  00:00:26,110
convenient to do that because we only
set up the row index and column index
6

6

00:00:26,110  -->  00:00:30,460
once instead having to set up for each
radio button so I'm gonna go ahead and do
7

7

00:00:30,460  -->  00:00:40,860
that so create a v box..... set the row index 0....and column index
8

8

00:00:40,860  -->  00:00:53,240
I'm gonna set to 2 now I'm just gonna put these three radio buttons in
the v box and I'm gonna get rid of
9

9

00:00:53,240  -->  00:00:58,760
the grid pane row index and column index
which is no not needed for each
10

10

00:00:58,760  -->  00:01:07,930
individual radio button and
consequently now that we've done that we
11

11

00:01:07,930  -->  00:01:12,960
can we now need to change the column index
so I'm gonna make the check box column
12

12

00:01:12,960  -->  00:01:18,500
index 3 because the column index for
line 39 is so we need to make it
13

13

00:01:18,500  -->  00:01:25,920
three and for the h box for the toggle
buttons I'm gonna make that 4 and if we
14

14

00:01:25,920  -->  00:01:32,750
run that we should still get the identical results
we had in the previous video other than the
15

15

00:01:32,750  -->  00:01:40,060
fact that these are now vertical and the weren't vertical
before they were going left to right across in a column
16

16

00:01:40,060  -->  00:01:44,490
situation obviously everything else is
still working like it was before and
17

17

00:01:44,490  -->  00:01:48,900
obviously the group is still working as
you can see there can't a radio button
18

18

00:01:48,900  -->  00:01:54,870
of now because one has to be selected at all times
as we put it in a toggle group ok so
19

19

00:01:54,870  -->  00:01:58,510
theirs that so close it down now so
let's continue on now and we're going to
20

20

00:01:58,510  -->  00:02:03,330
look at a text field now text field as
I mentioned towards the end of the last
21

21

00:02:03,330  -->  00:02:07,150
video gives the ability for the user to type
22

22

00:02:07,150  -->  00:02:12,000
information in so that we can actually
then interpret those results and perform
23

23

00:02:12,000  -->  00:02:13,600
some action with that data
24

24

00:02:13,600  -->  00:02:17,370
now a text field won't be long
usually they are a few words because this is
25

25

00:02:17,370  -->  00:02:21,740
a single line field so lets just go
ahead and add 1 to our group we are gonna start
26

26

00:02:21,740  -->  00:02:27,140
on a new row and put a text field into that first
column so I would start with the text
27

27

00:02:27,140  -->  00:02:37,780
field.....
28

28

00:02:37,780  -->  00:02:42,020
...so that's the basic form of a text field
29

29

00:02:42,020  -->  00:02:47,270
and when we run this we would be able
to type something in that field and theirs
30

30

00:02:47,270  -->  00:02:54,770
our text field......and obviously
that's working accepting input just
31

31

00:02:54,770  -->  00:03:01,480
fine so that's good we can also
initialize the field with text by
32

32

00:03:01,480  -->  00:03:06,090
setting the text properly but that can often be
irritating unless we also add the
33

33

00:03:06,090  -->  00:03:10,100
code to remove the text as soon as the
user places the cursor in the text field
34

34

00:03:10,100  -->  00:03:13,610
otherwise the users has to delete whatever is in
the field before they start typing
35

35

00:03:13,610  -->  00:03:20,140
now the text field class also contains a
copy cut paste and select all methods
36

36

00:03:20,140  -->  00:03:24,120
that let us copy its contents to the
clipboard delete and copy its content to the
37

37

00:03:24,120  -->  00:03:28,930
clipboard and paste it from the
clipboard and lastly of course the select
38

38

00:03:28,930  -->  00:03:32,590
contents that's the select all method
so that's a text field there's also a
39

39

00:03:32,590  -->  00:03:38,030
password field and this could control the
same as you might imagine directly
40

40

00:03:38,030  -->  00:03:41,150
from the text field control the only
visual difference between the two is
41

41

00:03:41,150  -->  00:03:45,700
that a password field masks whatever has
been type into and I'm sure you've seen a
42

42

00:03:45,700  -->  00:03:49,850
password field before and also its
copy and cut methods don't do anything so you
43

43

00:03:49,850  -->  00:03:54,380
can't copy and paste into a password field after
all there's no point masking its contents
44

44

00:03:54,380  -->  00:03:58,920
if they can be copied to the clipboard so lets add 1 to our group in the second
45

45

00:03:58,920  -->  00:04:07,720
column of the second row so...
46

46

00:04:07,720  -->  00:04:15,030
...and we run that
we should see that it operates just like a
47

47

00:04:15,030  -->  00:04:21,590
regular text field so there is the regular
one and I type same thing in the
48

48

00:04:22,120  -->  00:04:27,050
password field we get the stars or the little circles to indicate that it's a
49

49

00:04:27,050  -->  00:04:31,500
password and we can't see what's being
type and again its pretty well identical to a
50

50

00:04:31,500  -->  00:04:34,680
text field other than the fact that it's
masking what we're typing and of
51

51

00:04:34,680  -->  00:04:39,350
course it looks pretty well identical which
isn't surprising because text fields is its
52

52

00:04:39,350  -->  00:04:45,630
parent class ok so moving on the next
one controller we want to look at is the combo
53

53

00:04:45,630  -->  00:04:50,310
box now the combo box is another way to offer
the user a choice of several options where they
54

54

00:04:50,310  -->  00:04:55,900
can only choose one we saw that in the
previous video with radio buttons if we
55

55

00:04:55,900  -->  00:04:57,880
want to offer say the user 10 options
56

56

00:04:57,880  -->  00:05:01,120
radio buttons wouldn't be the best
choice because it probably take up too much
57

57

00:05:01,120  -->  00:05:02,940
room on your screen
58

58

00:05:02,940  -->  00:05:07,130
but a combo box takes up about the
same room as a text field until the uses
59

59

00:05:07,130  -->  00:05:08,500
wants to interact with it
60

60

00:05:08,500  -->  00:05:11,780
of course at that point they can revealed
the list of options by clicking on it
61

61

00:05:11,780  -->  00:05:16,810
so lets add one to our grid in the third column of
the second row just to see what they look
62

62

00:05:16,810  -->  00:05:19,810
so.....
63

63

00:05:22,620  -->  00:05:32,540
.....
64

64

00:05:32,540  -->  00:05:41,190
now to populate this we need to add a list of
items obviously each one of these will be separate
65

65

00:05:41,190  -->  00:05:50,970
selectable option so the way we do that is we
type.....and within their what
66

66

00:05:50,970  -->  00:05:56,650
we need to do is add the following code so we type...
67

67

00:05:57,990  -->  00:06:06,770
....so obviously the ArrayList is
68

68

00:06:06,770  -->  00:06:09,770
what we are building here a list of options
69

69

00:06:10,310  -->  00:06:14,180
know what we need to do is we need to do
an import and IntelliJ doesn't always
70

70

00:06:14,180  -->  00:06:16,600
automatically add this so I'm gonna go ahead and
do it
71

71

00:06:16,600  -->  00:06:21,850
so if your getting some weird results just come up here and actually add them so what I'm gonna do is
72

72

00:06:21,850  -->  00:06:24,850
do an import.....
73

73

00:06:25,470  -->  00:06:30,860
....just to make sure that it's
74

74

00:06:30,860  -->  00:06:35,800
imported again it may do that but
just in case it doesn't its a good one to
75

75

00:06:35,800  -->  00:06:39,030
add just to make sure that it's actually
doing the right thing
76

76

00:06:41,450  -->  00:06:45,010
...and will also import the
string because it on the next line about
77

77

00:06:45,010  -->  00:06:51,990
to start typing strings so...
78

78

00:06:52,610  -->  00:06:57,100
and that is essentially what these are going to be
the entries for each item that's
79

79

00:06:57,100  -->  00:07:04,910
selectable from the combo box so they may be imported but if by chance they are not then
80

80

00:07:04,910  -->  00:07:07,500
you need to type them in and obviously
that's greyed out because we haven't
81

81

00:07:07,500  -->  00:07:11,920
actually used it but I'm gonna go down here
you can see fx collections is now
82

82

00:07:11,920  -->  00:07:17,970
working correctly where it was red a minute ago and to add the options we just type
83

83

00:07:17,970  -->  00:07:24,750
string..... which should now work because we
imported and...
84

84

00:07:24,750  -->  00:07:30,170
....
85

85

00:07:30,170  -->  00:07:41,250
.....
86

86

00:07:43,500  -->  00:07:54,910
....
87

87

00:07:54,910  -->  00:08:03,880
...ok so its given us five options
for a combo box and I haven't talked about
88

88

00:08:03,880  -->  00:08:07,690
it yet but we introduce new classes and
attributes here so fx collections
89

89

00:08:07,690  -->  00:08:13,690
fx:factory which you saw this
on line 65 fx value which you see in
90

90

00:08:13,690  -->  00:08:19,600
use on line 66 through 70 and also
the observable array list which is also
91

91

00:08:19,600  -->  00:08:24,750
defined on line 65 now we are gonna go over those in detail in the
later lecture but for now just
92

92

00:08:24,750  -->  00:08:29,360
understand what we're trying to do here is we are
populating the combo box with a list of
93

93

00:08:29,360  -->  00:08:33,480
strings now when we run and click on
the combo box we should see a pull down
94

94

00:08:33,480  -->  00:08:35,860
list of options so lets go and have a look
95

95

00:08:35,860  -->  00:08:43,410
and see if it actually works so their is our drop down list
there and if we click on that you can see we got our
96

96

00:08:43,410  -->  00:08:49,000
options so move this so you can see it
and also see FXML and notice how we got our
97

97

00:08:49,000  -->  00:08:53,830
various options there which correspond
to the ones we added on lines 66 through 70
98

98

00:08:53,830  -->  00:08:58,830
and we can select one and once we select once it operates just like a normal combo box would and
99

99

00:08:58,830  -->  00:09:04,300
that it closes down and selects that
particular option and getting to the stage if
100

100

00:09:04,300  -->  00:09:08,070
for something like that you might find it a little bit too small and you can't sort of
101

101

00:09:08,070  -->  00:09:11,280
unnecessarily read all the options and
what we can do is we can extend this
102

102

00:09:11,280  -->  00:09:16,070
column to make sure it fits but to see
the problem better lets just make this little
103

103

00:09:16,070  -->  00:09:18,100
bit wider longer
104

104

00:09:18,100  -->  00:09:37,110
rather each option so we can see a potential problem and I'll show you how to fix that so....and run it again....you can see it automatically expanded
105

105

00:09:37,110  -->  00:09:43,240
it for us which is pretty handy but if we had a smaller window and we find
106

106

00:09:43,240  -->  00:09:46,160
that they wouldn't necessarily fit
properly we can select that and it does expand
107

107

00:09:46,160  -->  00:09:49,620
it and show the whole thing but it
doesn't actually show at all in the
108

108

00:09:49,620  -->  00:09:54,770
column so what we can do is we can actually
increase the column span by using the
109

109

00:09:54,770  -->  00:09:59,340
gridPane.columnspan command to make sure that it goes over 2 columns so we can sort
110

110

00:09:59,340  -->  00:10:04,930
of sure to see what it looks like even after we have selected the options so to do that we just come back up
111

111

00:10:04,930  -->  00:10:13,000
to the combo box and.....so now if we run that again
112

112

00:10:13,000  -->  00:10:17,840
.....making this a bit smaller
113

113

00:10:24,400  -->  00:10:38,550
..ok just make it a bit bigger take it to the 3 a span of 3 lets just make this a really one so that you can see what
114

114

00:10:38,550  -->  00:10:47,470
the problem is it does depend on the
size of the window etc as to how much
115

115

00:10:47,470  -->  00:11:01,090
of this will show......so now if we run this again now we can see the results now because
116

116

00:11:01,090  -->  00:11:06,780
we've got wider entries we can see that
this is expanded a bit better and I can take this back and
117

117

00:11:06,780  -->  00:11:15,950
put it back to a column span of 2 run it again you can still see we've got enough space now to fit
118

118

00:11:15,950  -->  00:11:21,240
it so this was actually problem I was trying to
show you before so notice how that has been cut off
119

119

00:11:21,240  -->  00:11:26,840
and its not actually showing the whole combo box and because I made it so long I need to go to the
120

120

00:11:26,840  -->  00:11:34,070
column span of 3 if we do that now
we can actually see the full results
121

121

00:11:34,070  -->  00:11:38,320
after we've selected it where we couldn't before until
we've done that so depending on the
122

122

00:11:38,320  -->  00:11:42,420
length of the text is too how much space
you want to assign how many column spans you
123

123

00:11:42,420  -->  00:11:46,840
wanna go over obviously I made this
super long for this example just to work by
124

124

00:11:46,840  -->  00:11:51,120
default it probably would have fitted ok
just with the short relatively short
125

125

00:11:51,120  -->  00:11:54,400
string selections that I had for each item
126

126

00:11:54,400  -->  00:11:58,410
betting that column span is the way to actually get it to
expand it so that you can see what the
127

127

00:11:58,410  -->  00:12:02,800
selection was now sometimes in relation
to his combo box you might want to set one of the
128

128

00:12:02,800  -->  00:12:07,170
options as the default option and that's
so that the combo box is empty when it
129

129

00:12:07,170  -->  00:12:11,140
first displays and this could also be if
you've gotten some sort of application
130

130

00:12:11,140  -->  00:12:15,400
and you're saving the defaults
setting you might want to set those up every time the program
131

131

00:12:15,400  -->  00:12:21,600
runs for example so let's go through and
set up the fourth option and make that
132

132

00:12:21,600  -->  00:12:26,880
the default option so that its automatically
selected every time the programs run so to
133

133

00:12:26,880  -->  00:12:32,110
do that after the items come down here we put....
134

134

00:12:33,220  -->  00:12:43,400
.....
135

135

00:12:43,400  -->  00:12:47,910
....
136

136

00:12:47,910  -->  00:12:57,910
...and that's going to be our default option.....run that...you can see its automatically option 4 was
137

137

00:12:57,910  -->  00:13:05,070
selected but when we actually run this
now the other thing that you can
138

138

00:13:05,070  -->  00:13:09,600
find with the combo box or you can set rather
is you can actually set it so that its editable
139

139

00:13:09,600  -->  00:13:14,420
this is not a common use case and it
really can be quite confusing for users
140

140

00:13:14,420  -->  00:13:18,380
but if you want to you can just set it's
eligible property to true so come
141

141

00:13:18,380  -->  00:13:22,870
back here to combo box.....
142

142

00:13:22,870  -->  00:13:32,910
and once we do that and run it notice how the default options is no longer working but we can
143

143

00:13:32,910  -->  00:13:37,970
select that and notice how then we can all
also actually type some text in here
144

144

00:13:37,970  -->  00:13:41,040
again its not something you would ordinarily do
but if that is something you want in
145

145

00:13:41,040  -->  00:13:44,110
your application you can do that and I'm
going to actually remove the editable
146

146

00:13:44,110  -->  00:13:50,960
and we don't want to make this one editable for now and run it again just to confirms it works and we're back to the
147

147

00:13:50,960  -->  00:13:55,080
default now working and I select an option and is no longer editable
148

148

00:13:55,080  -->  00:14:03,930
now closely related to the combo box is
another control called the choice box so
149

149

00:14:03,930  -->  00:14:07,000
let's add 1 to our grid right after the
combo box just so we can sort of see what
150

150

00:14:07,000  -->  00:14:10,710
it does and what I'm going to do is just
make this a bit smaller again and go back
151

151

00:14:10,710  -->  00:14:14,980
to a column span of 2......
152

152

00:14:17,890  -->  00:14:27,800
.....so this all fits and
153

153

00:14:27,800  -->  00:14:30,840
lets go and create a choice box so....
154

154

00:14:30,840  -->  00:14:39,100
.....
155

155

00:14:39,100  -->  00:14:49,550
....
156

156

00:14:49,550  -->  00:14:58,600
......
157

157

00:14:58,600  -->  00:15:07,110
....again we'll be
158

158

00:15:07,110  -->  00:15:15,740
talking about these in later videos and
we type in the value....
159

159

00:15:15,740  -->  00:15:24,730
....
160

160

00:15:24,730  -->  00:15:32,910
.....so pretty well looking at that that's identical to what we had for the
161

161

00:15:32,910  -->  00:15:37,130
combo box other than obviously the the
values different values and we're not
162

162

00:15:37,130  -->  00:15:43,600
using a column span so if we run this there is
actually a distinct difference if we
163

163

00:15:43,600  -->  00:15:46,600
select it
164

164

00:15:47,640  -->  00:15:55,170
and noticed the tick here so its like a
combo box the user can only select one
165

165

00:15:55,170  -->  00:16:00,230
item so you might notice that the
space in front of each choice in the pull
166

166

00:16:00,230  -->  00:16:04,190
down and that is that little tick here as you can see
when we select a choice and open the
167

167

00:16:04,190  -->  00:16:09,790
pull down again we can see that the
check mark was select cb2 and cb2 is actually
168

168

00:16:09,790  -->  00:16:15,460
tick again and the check mark is being placed
next to the item we selected apart from
169

169

00:16:15,460  -->  00:16:17,910
that there isn't really much of a
difference in how the user interacts
170

170

00:16:17,910  -->  00:16:21,580
with the a combo box and check box
but there are implementation differences
171

171

00:16:21,580  -->  00:16:25,600
so according to one of the JavaFx
developers the choice box control is
172

172

00:16:25,600  -->  00:16:30,660
more suited to a smaller number of items
a combobox can handle a large a list
173

173

00:16:30,660  -->  00:16:35,990
of items also we can use what's called
a cell factory with a combo box and will
174

174

00:16:35,990  -->  00:16:39,770
cover these cell factories in a later lecture but to be honest many
175

175

00:16:39,770  -->  00:16:44,480
developers had wondered you know why
both controls exist combo box can be used
176

176

00:16:44,480  -->  00:16:48,910
with a small number of items as well so
what I would personally suggest you do
177

177

00:16:48,910  -->  00:16:52,410
is stick with a combo box and only use a
choice box because you have a small
178

178

00:16:52,410  -->  00:16:56,590
number of options in if you don't like the tick and i
don't think its really needed but it's
179

179

00:16:56,590  -->  00:16:58,030
obviously personal preference
180

180

00:16:58,030  -->  00:17:01,610
alright so I'm going to finish the video
here now in the next video we're going to
181

181

00:17:01,610  -->  00:17:06,730
continue on looking through controls
we are gonna look at the slider control
182

182

00:17:06,730  -->  00:17:10,880
and tick labels and a few other controls
along those lines
183

183

00:17:10,880  -->  00:17:12,630
so we'll talk about that in the next video
