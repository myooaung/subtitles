1

00:00:04.760  -->  00:00:07.220
Java applications can have graphical
2

2

00:00:07.220  -->  00:00:09.559
user interfaces that contain buttons
3

3

00:00:09.559  -->  00:00:14.360
lists checkboxes menus toolbars and many
4

4

00:00:14.360  -->  00:00:16.369
other controls that allow users to
5

5

00:00:16.369  -->  00:00:18.740
interact with rich client applications
6

6

00:00:18.740  -->  00:00:22.490
JavaFX is a set of api's that we use to
7

7

00:00:22.490  -->  00:00:25.130
build user interfaces in Java it's
8

8

00:00:25.130  -->  00:00:27.080
essentially a set of Java packages and
9

9

00:00:27.080  -->  00:00:29.330
it's the successor to swing which was
10

10

00:00:29.330  -->  00:00:32.029
java's UI toolkit for many years so you
11

11

00:00:32.029  -->  00:00:33.800
can use JavaFX to develop the UI
12

12

00:00:33.800  -->  00:00:36.170
for desktop applications, internet
13

13

00:00:36.170  -->  00:00:39.050
applications and mobile devices but in
14

14

00:00:39.050  -->  00:00:40.760
this course we want to focus on desktop
15

15

00:00:40.760  -->  00:00:43.820
applications. With the release of JDK 11,
16

16

00:00:43.820  -->  00:00:46.309
Java effects is no longer part of the
17

17

00:00:46.309  -->  00:00:48.650
core JDK. So that means we need to
18

18

00:00:48.650  -->  00:00:51.290
download the Java effects jar files and
19

19

00:00:51.290  -->  00:00:53.299
configure them separately to get them
20

20

00:00:53.299  -->  00:00:54.949
working so in this video I'm going to go
21

21

00:00:54.949  -->  00:00:58.040
through the steps to set up the Java FX
22

22

00:00:58.040  -->  00:01:01.010
package to work with the JDK 11 in the
23

23

00:01:01.010  -->  00:01:02.510
next video we will actually start building a
24

24

00:01:02.510  -->  00:01:05.990
project so if you're using JDK 8 then
25

25

00:01:05.990  -->  00:01:07.369
you don't need to watch the rest of this
26

26

00:01:07.369  -->  00:01:08.810
video just fast-forward to the next
27

27

00:01:08.810  -->  00:01:10.880
video where we start actually building
28

28

00:01:10.880  -->  00:01:14.390
our first Java FX application alright so
29

29

00:01:14.390  -->  00:01:15.939
the process we need to follow to get
30

30

00:01:15.939  -->  00:01:19.490
Java FX working with the JDK 11 involved
31

31

00:01:19.490  -->  00:01:21.109
firstly doing a download so we're going
32

32

00:01:21.109  -->  00:01:25.789
to download the file that we need so
33

33

00:01:25.789  -->  00:01:27.859
we wanna go to our browser and the website we
34

34

00:01:27.859  -->  00:01:34.817
want to go to is gluonhq.com/products/javafx
35

35

00:01:35.149  -->  00:01:36.740
and you can see here that it talks about the
36

36

00:01:36.740  -->  00:01:38.570
Java effects runtime being available as
37

37

00:01:38.570  -->  00:01:41.060
a platform specific SDK so we need the
38

38

00:01:41.060  -->  00:01:44.810
Java FX SDK for your operating system to
39

39

00:01:44.810  -->  00:01:47.149
be downloaded and installed and just a
40

40

00:01:47.149  -->  00:01:49.310
note here is it is important to download
41

41

00:01:49.310  -->  00:01:51.049
the correct version for example if you
42

42

00:01:51.049  -->  00:01:52.729
downloaded the Windows version of the
43

43

00:01:52.729  -->  00:01:56.179
Java FX Windows SDK you'd be able to
44

44

00:01:56.179  -->  00:01:58.310
install it and set it up on a Mac but
45

45

00:01:58.310  -->  00:01:59.899
you'll find that it won't work so make
46

46

00:01:59.899  -->  00:02:01.310
sure you do download the right version
47

47

00:02:01.310  -->  00:02:03.200
I'm on a Windows machine so I'm going to
48

48

00:02:03.200  -->  00:02:05.810
download the Windows version of the SDK
49

49

00:02:05.810  -->  00:02:08.840
for JavaFX good news is it's quite
50

50

00:02:08.840  -->  00:02:10.280
a small download you can see it's under
51

51

00:02:10.280  -->  00:02:11.600
38 megabytes
52

52

00:02:11.600  -->  00:02:13.970
going to save that and give my
53

53

00:02:13.970  -->  00:02:16.250
computer on moment to run the security
54

54

00:02:16.250  -->  00:02:20.750
scan then we'll continue with the installation
55

55

00:02:20.750  -->  00:02:22.470
alright so it's finished downloading
56

56

00:02:22.470  -->  00:02:24.570
so what I'm going to do is just go to
57

57

00:02:24.570  -->  00:02:26.700
open the folder if you have any
58

58

00:02:26.700  -->  00:02:28.850
difficulties like I have just go to
59

59

00:02:28.850  -->  00:02:32.460
Explorer and just go to the folder in my
60

60

00:02:32.460  -->  00:02:34.110
case the Downloads folder so I'm going
61

61

00:02:34.110  -->  00:02:36.690
to go there now and you can see this
62

62

00:02:36.690  -->  00:02:40.110
open jfx 11 that's the file that I'm
63

63

00:02:40.110  -->  00:02:42.150
going to take a copy of now we need to
64

64

00:02:42.150  -->  00:02:44.220
put that somewhere in a good spot
65

65

00:02:44.220  -->  00:02:46.410
because we need to put it in that spot
66

66

00:02:46.410  -->  00:02:47.910
and then it will need to be referred to
67

67

00:02:47.910  -->  00:02:51.450
any time you use JavaFX in a project so
68

68

00:02:51.450  -->  00:02:52.350
in other words you don't want to put it
69

69

00:02:52.350  -->  00:02:54.060
into a temporary location or put it on
70

70

00:02:54.060  -->  00:02:55.470
your desktop or somewhere that you
71

71

00:02:55.470  -->  00:02:57.720
accidentally delete so in my case what
72

72

00:02:57.720  -->  00:02:58.620
I'm going to do is I'm going to put it
73

73

00:02:58.620  -->  00:03:00.930
in the Documents folder in a subfolder
74

74

00:03:00.930  -->  00:03:01.650
called lib
75

75

00:03:01.650  -->  00:03:05.010
I'm going to paste it into there now
76

76

00:03:05.010  -->  00:03:12.030
going to extract the zip file
77

77

00:03:12.030  -->  00:03:14.290
alright so that's finish now then we're
78

78

00:03:14.290  -->  00:03:16.270
going to go into that unzipped folder
79

79

00:03:16.270  -->  00:03:19.720
and I'm going to cut the sub folder
80

80

00:03:19.720  -->  00:03:22.090
which is Java FX - SDK 11
81

81

00:03:22.090  -->  00:03:24.160
then we can go back to my lib folder
82

82

00:03:24.160  -->  00:03:26.080
and paste it in there so in other words
83

83

00:03:26.080  -->  00:03:29.050
we've now got a subfolder Java FX - SDK
84

84

00:03:29.050  -->  00:03:32.860
- 11 in my lib subfolder I'm gonna delete
85

85

00:03:32.860  -->  00:03:34.120
those other two files there because we
86

86

00:03:34.120  -->  00:03:34.930
no longer need them
87

87

00:03:34.930  -->  00:03:36.790
alright so that's that file there and
88

88

00:03:36.790  -->  00:03:38.290
what we need to do then is swing back to
89

89

00:03:38.290  -->  00:03:40.240
IntelliJ so just minimize the browser
90

90

00:03:40.240  -->  00:03:42.880
for now, now we need to configure a
91

91

00:03:42.880  -->  00:03:44.920
global library so that we can
92

92

00:03:44.920  -->  00:03:47.260
automatically use Java FX in any
93

93

00:03:47.260  -->  00:03:49.840
projects we create so to define a global
94

94

00:03:49.840  -->  00:03:52.540
library click on configure click on
95

95

00:03:52.540  -->  00:03:55.780
project defaults and click on project
96

96

00:03:55.780  -->  00:03:56.520
structure
97

97

00:03:56.520  -->  00:03:58.630
next we'll come over here to global
98

98

00:03:58.630  -->  00:04:03.550
libraries I'm gonna click on plus wanna
99

99

00:04:03.550  -->  00:04:06.700
select Java now we need to navigate to
100

100

00:04:06.700  -->  00:04:09.430
the folder where we've just created that
101

101

00:04:09.430  -->  00:04:12.250
Java FX folder from the unzipped folder
102

102

00:04:12.250  -->  00:04:14.410
that we downloaded so in my case its going
103

103

00:04:14.410  -->  00:04:18.609
to be in my users folder and go to My
104

104

00:04:18.609  -->  00:04:19.630
Documents folder
105

105

00:04:19.630  -->  00:04:22.120
there's the lib folder in my case it's
106

106

00:04:22.120  -->  00:04:24.490
the JavaFX folder I need to go into the
107

107

00:04:24.490  -->  00:04:27.730
subfolder of lib then Java FX SDK
108

108

00:04:27.730  -->  00:04:29.860
then the subfolder lib and I need to
109

109

00:04:29.860  -->  00:04:32.440
select all the jar files that are in
110

110

00:04:32.440  -->  00:04:35.230
that folder select them like so and click
111

111

00:04:35.230  -->  00:04:38.410
on ok and the other thing I suggest you do
112

112

00:04:38.410  -->  00:04:39.640
is just change the name there to
113

113

00:04:39.640  -->  00:04:40.900
something more meaningful I'm going to
114

114

00:04:40.900  -->  00:04:45.610
call that JavaFX 11 just so for me I
115

115

00:04:45.610  -->  00:04:48.850
know that that's the JavaFX library for
116

116

00:04:48.850  -->  00:04:52.270
the JDK 11 so I'm going to save that at
117

117

00:04:52.270  -->  00:04:54.040
this point we've now defined the
118

118

00:04:54.040  -->  00:04:56.860
global library for JDK 11 so I'm going
119

119

00:04:56.860  -->  00:04:58.600
to end the video here now in the next
120

120

00:04:58.600  -->  00:05:00.460
one we're going to start creating our
121

121

00:05:00.460  -->  00:05:03.280
first Java FX application so I'll see
122

122

00:05:03.280  -->  00:05:06.090
you in the next video
