00:00:04.790  -->  00:00:07.000
Now, as I mentioned in the last video
2

2

00:00:07.000  -->  00:00:09.770
there is actually a problem with the
3

3

00:00:09.770  -->  00:00:11.629
method as written this is the add to
4

4

00:00:11.629  -->  00:00:12.980
playlist method as you can see on the
5

5

00:00:12.980  -->  00:00:15.770
screen there, now the problem is the if
6

6

00:00:15.770  -->  00:00:18.500
statement this statement here on line 40
7

7

00:00:18.500  -->  00:00:20.210
that's incorrect
8

8

00:00:20.210  -->  00:00:22.519
and that's because in the index always
9

9

00:00:22.519  -->  00:00:25.220
starts from zero, so consequently when
10

10

00:00:25.220  -->  00:00:26.929
we're running the program if we enter
11

11

00:00:26.929  -->  00:00:29.900
track number one, the index value will be
12

12

00:00:29.900  -->  00:00:32.029
zero and that's because one take one is
13

13

00:00:32.029  -->  00:00:34.400
zero so what will happen there in that
14

14

00:00:34.400  -->  00:00:37.610
particular test is that track one will
15

15

00:00:37.610  -->  00:00:39.140
not be recognized, in other words the
16

16

00:00:39.140  -->  00:00:41.180
album will come up and say the this
17

17

00:00:41.180  -->  00:00:43.309
album does not have a track one and
18

18

00:00:43.309  -->  00:00:44.449
that's obviously incorrect.
19

19

00:00:44.449  -->  00:00:46.309
So what we need to do is make a simple
20

20

00:00:46.309  -->  00:00:47.899
little change and basically make the
21

21

00:00:47.899  -->  00:00:50.390
greater-than here to be greater than
22

22

00:00:50.390  -->  00:00:52.730
equal to. Once we do that it'll correct
23

23

00:00:52.730  -->  00:00:55.609
correctly identify track number one as
24

24

00:00:55.609  -->  00:00:56.960
it should have done in the first place,
25

25

00:00:56.960  -->  00:00:58.969
so that's that small little bug fix.
26

26

00:00:58.969  -->  00:01:02.500
So let's move on now to the next video.
