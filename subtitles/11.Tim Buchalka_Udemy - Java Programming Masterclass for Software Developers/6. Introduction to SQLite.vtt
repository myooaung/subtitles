1

00:00:05.060  -->  00:00:09.520
so we got the computer setup so that we
can use sql lite from the command
2

2

00:00:09.520  -->  00:00:13.450
line we're going to have a look at how
to create databases and tables and start
3

3

00:00:13.450  -->  00:00:18.170
to see how the sql language is used
so we'll be using sql lite in our
4

4

00:00:18.170  -->  00:00:22.640
programs later but for now we're just
going to focus on the sql language so
5

5

00:00:22.640  -->  00:00:25.990
that we can concentrate on learning a
bit about sql without worrying about
6

6

00:00:25.990  -->  00:00:30.710
the java side of things so you need to
start a terminal session or command
7

7

00:00:30.710  -->  00:00:34.750
prompt on your computer on windows
click on the start menu and type command
8

8

00:00:34.750  -->  00:00:38.780
to launch a command prompt or you could
just use the same methods that I used
9

9

00:00:38.780  -->  00:00:43.280
in the setup video to start a command
prompt for Windows 10 depending on what
10

10

00:00:43.280  -->  00:00:47.510
version you're running on a Mac command
space and type in terminal and on
11

11

00:00:47.510  -->  00:00:52.190
Linux you can launch this terminal
quickly using ctrl alt t alright I'm
12

12

00:00:52.190  -->  00:00:56.180
on a mac as I said so I'm going to
start sql lite and the way we start
13

13

00:00:56.180  -->  00:01:01.430
that is by typing sql lite 3 and press enter
14

14

00:01:01.430  -->  00:01:07.510
so that starts the sql lite shell
program and we can also specify the name
15

15

00:01:07.510  -->  00:01:11.140
of a database on the command line so I'm
going to show you how to do this I'm
16

16

00:01:11.140  -->  00:01:19.180
going to quit out of this by typing
.quit
17

17

00:01:19.180  -->  00:01:23.210
as I mentioned we can specify the name
of a database on the command line so i'm
18

18

00:01:23.210  -->  00:01:27.590
going to call this database test so to
do that we type a space after the
19

19

00:01:27.590  -->  00:01:35.210
sql lite 3 program name and type test . DB and press enter incidentally
20

20

00:01:35.210  -->  00:01:39.200
there's also command to open a
database file if you forget to put the name
21

21

00:01:39.200  -->  00:01:43.240
on the command line and we'll have a
look at that a bit later you will find
22

22

00:01:43.240  -->  00:01:47.530
that this sql lite program is a
fairly minimal interface that just
23

23

00:01:47.530  -->  00:01:51.130
really tells us the version of sql lite that were using and that we can use
24

24

00:01:51.130  -->  00:01:55.880
. help to get some instructions we can
also enter sql statements and with
25

25

00:01:55.880  -->  00:01:59.470
some versions there's also a helpful
reminder that sql statement must be
26

26

00:01:59.470  -->  00:02:03.770
terminated with a semi colon and you
can see earlier i put a semicolon to
27

27

00:02:03.770  -->  00:02:08.710
finish to finish up the command quit but
the quit was meant to be a . quit which
28

28

00:02:08.710  -->  00:02:12.350
doesn't have a semicolon but in any
event will talk more about semicolons in
29

29

00:02:12.350  -->  00:02:16.430
and the need to out those in a little bit
later and it is normal that you forget
30

30

00:02:16.430  -->  00:02:17.860
to do this quite often
31

31

00:02:17.860  -->  00:02:21.100
you'll have forget to put a semicolon in
but as you say it's not the end of the
32

32

00:02:21.100  -->  00:02:24.370
world you can just enter the semi colon
on the next line and the statement will
33

33

00:02:24.370  -->  00:02:28.360
then be executed but we'll get to that
in a minute but let's start off that by
34

34

00:02:28.360  -->  00:02:32.770
typing . help you can see that sql lite is helpfully are telling us that
35

35

00:02:32.770  -->  00:02:37.960
if we type .help we'll get some help so
we'll do that . help press enter and you
36

36

00:02:37.960  -->  00:02:41.260
can see it's got a whole page of
information on the screen there and I'm
37

37

00:02:41.260  -->  00:02:44.080
just scrolling up and down with my mouse
lots of different command options
38

38

00:02:44.080  -->  00:02:49.180
they're available for us is well its not a lot
but really in the scheme of things it's
39

39

00:02:49.180  -->  00:02:52.630
not really a lot of commands they're
comparing that so to the Java language
40

40

00:02:52.630  -->  00:02:56.730
is a significantly higher number of
things you need to know in java than
41

41

00:02:56.730  -->  00:03:01.030
sql lite but even with that said you
probably won't remember them all
42

42

00:03:01.030  -->  00:03:04.600
straight away if ever though so .
help is a useful way to remind yourself of them
43

43

00:03:04.600  -->  00:03:08.230
if you ever need to go back and
see what a particular command all about
44

44

00:03:08.800  -->  00:03:13.450
alright so before creating a new table
in the database you want to type in .
45

45

00:03:13.450  -->  00:03:20.260
headers....this
actually shows the column names at the
46

46

00:03:20.260  -->  00:03:24.250
start of the data which is a handy
reminder of what we call the columns
47

47

00:03:24.760  -->  00:03:29.440
ok so those are a list of the commands
that sql lite recognizes but
48

48

00:03:29.440  -->  00:03:34.510
when creating and querying tables we
just use sql statements so let's
49

49

00:03:34.510  -->  00:03:39.700
create a simple contacts table with the
sql commander we are about the type i'm going
50

50

00:03:39.700  -->  00:03:50.110
to type in.....
51

51

00:03:50.110  -->  00:03:57.450
....
52

52

00:03:57.450  -->  00:04:03.340
....and i'm
going to press enter now that doesn't
53

53

00:04:03.340  -->  00:04:07.200
seem to do much and that's something
you'll notice on the sql lite if you
54

54

00:04:07.200  -->  00:04:10.900
do something wrong it will let you know
but if everything works fine then it is
55

55

00:04:10.900  -->  00:04:14.680
keeps quiet so this case because we
haven't got anything back other
56

56

00:04:14.680  -->  00:04:19.030
than the prompt asking us to type in
something else on the next line it's
57

57

00:04:19.030  -->  00:04:22.900
nice and quiet and it generally doesn't
mean that the command worked so in this
58

58

00:04:22.900  -->  00:04:27.910
case it's created that table for us that
table called contacts has three columns
59

59

00:04:28.610  -->  00:04:33.220
the name the phone and the email but to
sql lite doesn't tell us that it
60

60

00:04:33.220  -->  00:04:37.610
worked and again if it hadn't worked
would get an error but otherwise we'll
61

61

00:04:37.610  -->  00:04:39.940
just move on to the next instruction
62

62

00:04:39.940  -->  00:04:43.630
alright so with this table now let's
actually put some data into that table
63

63

00:04:43.630  -->  00:04:50.750
and we can use the sql insert statement
to do that so we can type....
64

64

00:04:50.750  -->  00:05:17.330
....
65

65

00:05:17.330  -->  00:05:23.810
....press enter
once again we get no confirmation that
66

66

00:05:23.810  -->  00:05:29.180
it worked but in this case no news is good
news and I use single quotes there but
67

67

00:05:29.180  -->  00:05:33.160
you can also use double quotes thing to
remember those if your embedding sql
68

68

00:05:33.160  -->  00:05:37.430
commands in java that makes sense to use
double quotes for the strings and single
69

69

00:05:37.430  -->  00:05:41.210
quotes around the sql statements and
you'll see me do that when it comes to
70

70

00:05:41.210  -->  00:05:44.150
creating programs that work on our
databases
71

71

00:05:44.150  -->  00:05:47.000
alright so how do we know that this
actually worked these commands actually
72

72

00:05:47.000  -->  00:05:51.620
did something we can actually check that
it has we can query the table now the
73

73

00:05:51.620  -->  00:05:56.750
Select statement is very useful in
sql or SQL and it's how you query the
74

74

00:05:56.750  -->  00:05:58.270
data at the table
75

75

00:05:58.270  -->  00:06:02.560
now it's a very flexible command but as
at its simplest you can just tell it
76

76

00:06:02.560  -->  00:06:07.000
what columns you want and the name of
the table to get it from now i'm going
77

77

00:06:07.000  -->  00:06:11.990
to actually type the sql reserved
words in capitals in this statement and
78

78

00:06:11.990  -->  00:06:15.520
it's actually useful to do that
especially in programs and scripts but to
79

79

00:06:15.520  -->  00:06:17.300
sql itself doesn't care
80

80

00:06:17.300  -->  00:06:21.520
people generally just do it to make it
obvious which other sql reserved
81

81

00:06:21.520  -->  00:06:26.330
words and which are things like tables
and columns names so to see whats in the contacts
82

82

00:06:26.330  -->  00:06:31.270
table we use this we type....
83

83

00:06:31.270  -->  00:06:41.370
....and press enter
84

84

00:06:41.370  -->  00:06:46.560
we can now see the record that we just
inserted now the asterix there by the
85

85

00:06:46.560  -->  00:06:51.090
way means all columns you saw me type in the Select statement we could
86

86

00:06:51.090  -->  00:06:55.160
have been more explicit and type
something like this....
87

87

00:06:55.160  -->  00:07:04.160
.....that give
us the same result and we just wanted an
88

88

00:07:04.160  -->  00:07:10.710
email addresses for example we could
just do select email from contacts and
89

89

00:07:10.710  -->  00:07:14.760
that would just give us the email
alright I'm gonna do that command again
90

90

00:07:14.760  -->  00:07:18.660
but this time I'm going to forget to put
a semicolon at the end so select email
91

91

00:07:18.660  -->  00:07:27.030
from contacts press enter you can see that
nothing is printed and sql lite has
92

92

00:07:27.030  -->  00:07:30.600
just to put another prompt up waiting
for more input and notice it's got the
93

93

00:07:30.600  -->  00:07:33.600
three dots and then the greater than
sign here rather than the sql lite
94

94

00:07:33.600  -->  00:07:37.590
greater than that normally starts
up the command prompt when we are about to
95

95

00:07:37.590  -->  00:07:42.690
type command in now you can add other
clauses after select and it's nice to be
96

96

00:07:42.690  -->  00:07:46.880
able to spit them on two different lines
to make it more readable so sql lite
97

97

00:07:46.880  -->  00:07:50.700
will keep letting you type a sql command and won't try to execute it until
98

98

00:07:50.700  -->  00:07:54.510
you type the semicolon now at the moment I
don't want to add anything to the
99

99

00:07:54.510  -->  00:08:00.000
statement so I'm just going to enter a
semicolon and press enter the statement
100

100

00:08:00.000  -->  00:08:04.160
executes as you can see and we get the
email address for our one record so when
101

101

00:08:04.160  -->  00:08:07.680
you forget the semicolon just type it on
the next line and generally everything
102

102

00:08:07.680  -->  00:08:08.550
will work fine
103

103

00:08:08.550  -->  00:08:12.810
ok so let's add a couple of additional
records are going to use double quotes
104

104

00:08:12.810  -->  00:08:15.570
for the first ones just to show you it's still works fine....
105

105

00:08:15.570  -->  00:08:30.000
so.....
106

106

00:08:33.440  -->  00:08:37.560
notice  that's a slightly different form of
the insert statement and because we're
107

107

00:08:37.560  -->  00:08:40.950
providing values for all the fields and
giving them in the order that the fields
108

108

00:08:40.950  -->  00:08:45.000
were defined in the table there's no
need in this case to specify the list of
109

109

00:08:45.000  -->  00:08:51.320
fields so it actually works out to
be a bit simpler if we try this insert.....
110

110

00:08:52.670  -->  00:09:05.660
....
111

111

00:09:05.660  -->  00:09:10.760
....press enter we actually get an error and
obviously that's because we've been
112

112

00:09:10.760  -->  00:09:14.600
specified two values but the table
contacts got three columns like it's
113

113

00:09:14.600  -->  00:09:19.190
telling us on the screen so i could fix
that by adding another value but if we
114

114

00:09:19.190  -->  00:09:23.260
don't know the email address and that
wouldn't be an option so instead i can
115

115

00:09:23.260  -->  00:09:27.070
tell which columns i want to add data
for just provide value to insert into
116

116

00:09:27.070  -->  00:09:35.510
those columns so i could do something
like....
117

117

00:09:35.510  -->  00:09:47.540
....you can see there's no error in
118

118

00:09:47.540  -->  00:09:51.760
that case and we can now check what's in
the table so let's look at that so
119

119

00:09:51.760  -->  00:10:00.070
select star from contacts and you can see
we've got 3 entries showing on
120

120

00:10:00.070  -->  00:10:04.190
the screen now and note that timand
Brian have email addresses but steve
121

121

00:10:04.190  -->  00:10:08.320
hasn't incidentally you can see the
column names appearing at the start of
122

122

00:10:08.320  -->  00:10:09.110
the list
123

123

00:10:09.110  -->  00:10:13.790
that's because we use that command .
headers on earlier without that would
124

124

00:10:13.790  -->  00:10:17.690
see the data but the commons wouldn't be
labeled for us and that's maybe not that
125

125

00:10:17.690  -->  00:10:21.560
important in this example as there aren't any three fields and they
126

126

00:10:21.560  -->  00:10:25.160
all contain obvious values in other
words it's easy to see that brian is a
127

127

00:10:25.160  -->  00:10:28.940
name and Brian@email.com is an email address but if there
128

128

00:10:28.940  -->  00:10:32.570
are a lot of say numeric fields then
it could be useful to have a reminder of
129

129

00:10:32.570  -->  00:10:37.570
what's in each column now talking about
numbers we probably shouldn't store the
130

130

00:10:37.570  -->  00:10:41.320
phone number in an integer column i just
did that to show you how you can specify
131

131

00:10:41.320  -->  00:10:45.560
the type of columns when you create the
table and a phone number is really best
132

132

00:10:45.560  -->  00:10:50.180
stored as text field now sql lite
doesn't actually have type for its fields
133

133

00:10:50.180  -->  00:10:54.880
it's strange in that respect although you
specify a type when defining the columns
134

134

00:10:54.880  -->  00:10:59.750
that's really just  what you intend
to put into them and in fact because the
135

135

00:10:59.750  -->  00:11:04.060
sql lite implement standard sql it
has to use that standard form for
136

136

00:11:04.060  -->  00:11:05.600
creating tables
137

137

00:11:05.600  -->  00:11:10.130
