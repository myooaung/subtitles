00:00:05.413  -->  00:00:06.940
<v Tim>All right, so moving on with our discussion</v>
2

2

00:00:06.940  -->  00:00:10.120
on operators, there is a way to abbreviate
3

3

00:00:10.120  -->  00:00:12.660
when we're actually using many operators.
4

4

00:00:12.660  -->  00:00:14.150
So let's have a look at one,
5

5

00:00:14.150  -->  00:00:15.490
now we've used the example before
6

6

00:00:15.490  -->  00:00:17.500
and I'm just gonna introduce a comment here.
7

7

00:00:17.500  -->  00:00:21.180
We've done this before, we've done result = result + 1,
8

8

00:00:21.180  -->  00:00:23.230
so we saw what happened when we did that statement.
9

9

00:00:23.230  -->  00:00:27.620
We can abbreviate that statement by typing result++.
10

10

00:00:27.620  -->  00:00:31.460
Two + operators, and a semi-colon to end the line.
11

11

00:00:31.460  -->  00:00:33.140
Let's add a comment there,
12

12

00:00:33.140  -->  00:00:35.792
we know that the value from the last operation
13

13

00:00:35.792  -->  00:00:37.150
gave us the result of one.
14

14

00:00:37.150  -->  00:00:39.543
This is going to be 1 + 1.
15

15

00:00:40.530  -->  00:00:43.680
No surprises that's gonna give us the value two.
16

16

00:00:43.680  -->  00:00:48.680
Lets just confirm it so I will put 1 + 1 = + result.
17

17

00:00:49.230  -->  00:00:53.690
That's an abbreviation for doing the result = result + 1,
18

18

00:00:53.690  -->  00:00:54.820
using result++.
19

19

00:00:54.820  -->  00:00:56.820
One plus one equals two, all right?
20

20

00:00:56.820  -->  00:00:59.410
So far so good, and we can do the same
21

21

00:00:59.410  -->  00:01:02.030
for the other major operators as well.
22

22

00:01:02.030  -->  00:01:05.410
So let's do the same for the subtraction.
23

23

00:01:05.410  -->  00:01:10.410
So we do result-- and that's going to give us.
24

24

00:01:11.647  -->  00:01:14.383
You know the last operation was two, so 2 - 1 = 1.
25

25

00:01:16.297  -->  00:01:19.557
Let's print that out 2 - 1 = + result.
26

26

00:01:23.021  -->  00:01:24.210
Now that's just a shorthand way of writing
27

27

00:01:24.210  -->  00:01:26.560
result equals result take one.
28

28

00:01:26.560  -->  00:01:27.810
Two minus one equals one.
29

29

00:01:28.970  -->  00:01:32.650
Now we can actually even reduce assigning a value
30

30

00:01:32.650  -->  00:01:33.630
by a different value.
31

31

00:01:33.630  -->  00:01:36.610
If you wanna add two for example to result,
32

32

00:01:36.610  -->  00:01:37.840
you'd normally have to do something like this.
33

33

00:01:37.840  -->  00:01:42.840
Result = result + 2, we can abbreviate that by typing
34

34

00:01:43.100  -->  00:01:48.100
result += 2; what that should give us,
35

35

00:01:48.580  -->  00:01:50.600
we know that the result's currently one so that's gonna be
36

36

00:01:50.600  -->  00:01:55.600
1 + 2 = 3, let's print it out, 1 + 2 = + result
37

37

00:01:58.430  -->  00:01:59.720
should give us three.
38

38

00:01:59.720  -->  00:02:02.210
Let's run that, so again that's just an abbreviation
39

39

00:02:02.210  -->  00:02:06.560
to result = result + 2 is 1 + 2 = 3.
40

40

00:02:06.560  -->  00:02:09.320
And we can do the same for multiplication.
41

41

00:02:09.320  -->  00:02:10.600
Let's do a couple of 'em just to show you
42

42

00:02:10.600  -->  00:02:11.960
that that will still work.
43

43

00:02:11.960  -->  00:02:16.820
So we can type equivalent to result = result * 10,
44

44

00:02:20.630  -->  00:02:25.630
we can do result *= 10, now that should give us,
45

45

00:02:26.947  -->  00:02:30.040
we know the last answer was three.
46

46

00:02:30.040  -->  00:02:34.890
That should give us 3 * 10 = 30.
47

47

00:02:34.890  -->  00:02:39.890
Let's print that out, 3 * 10 = that should be 30.
48

48

00:02:45.837  -->  00:02:48.680
And there it is 3 * 10 = 30.
49

49

00:02:48.680  -->  00:02:51.623
All right and I'll do one more, we'll do the division,
50

50

00:02:54.080  -->  00:02:56.300
and obviously subtraction will work the same way as plus.
51

51

00:02:56.300  -->  00:03:01.300
Result = result / 3 can be abbreviated to result /=,
52

52

00:03:05.458  -->  00:03:08.280
so /= 3.
53

53

00:03:08.280  -->  00:03:10.740
And that should give us, we know we've got 30
54

54

00:03:10.740  -->  00:03:14.773
on the left hand side, / 3 should give us 10.
55

55

00:03:16.080  -->  00:03:21.080
So print that out 30 / 3 = the answer should be 10.
56

56

00:03:27.121  -->  00:03:27.954
All right, let's do one last,
57

57

00:03:27.954  -->  00:03:29.847
we'll actually finish off and do the other one
58

58

00:03:29.847  -->  00:03:31.223
just to be consistent if we end the video.
59

59

00:03:31.223  -->  00:03:36.100
Result = result - 2 for arguments sake, let's do that.
60

60

00:03:36.100  -->  00:03:41.100
Result -= 2, we know the value for that is,
61

61

00:03:41.360  -->  00:03:44.950
the last value of result was 10 so 10 - 2
62

62

00:03:44.950  -->  00:03:46.350
should give us the answer 8.
63

63

00:03:47.447  -->  00:03:49.597
So we'll print that out, 10 - 2 = + result,
64

64

00:03:53.197  -->  00:03:55.947
it should give us the value of 8.
65

65

00:03:57.557  -->  00:04:00.860
10 - 2 = 8, And you can see that is done there.
66

66

00:04:00.860  -->  00:04:02.700
All right so let's finish the video here.
67

67

00:04:02.700  -->  00:04:04.760
In the next one, we're gonna continue exploring
68

68

00:04:04.760  -->  00:04:07.880
yet more operators, but to do that we need to first talk
69

69

00:04:07.880  -->  00:04:09.270
about the if then statement.
70

70

00:04:09.270  -->  00:04:11.483
So we'll work on that in the next video.
