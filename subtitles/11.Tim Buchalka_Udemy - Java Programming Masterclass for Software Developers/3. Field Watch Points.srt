1

00:00:04,810  -->  00:00:07,170
ok so continuing on with our debugging
2

2

00:00:07,170  -->  00:00:09,000
session lets actually stop the
3

3

00:00:09,000  -->  00:00:10,620
application one last time if you haven't
4

4

00:00:10,620  -->  00:00:11,860
already and we're going to rerun the
5

5

00:00:11,860  -->  00:00:14,130
debugger again so I have stopped it so I'm going
6

6

00:00:14,130  -->  00:00:16,290
to rerun let's get to the bottom of this
7

7

00:00:16,290  -->  00:00:18,820
bug see if we can actually fix it
8

8

00:00:18,820  -->  00:00:21,600
alright so you can see that execution
9

9

00:00:21,600  -->  00:00:24,270
has been suspended on the...
10

10

00:00:24,270  -->  00:00:26,610
...line we're
11

11

00:00:26,610  -->  00:00:28,410
going to now press the step-over button
12

12

00:00:28,410  -->  00:00:29,560
and take a look at the state of our
13

13

00:00:29,560  -->  00:00:31,260
application going to come down and press
14

14

00:00:31,260  -->  00:00:32,320
this step over button over here
15

15

00:00:32,320  -->  00:00:36,130
click at once let's see what actually
16

16

00:00:36,130  -->  00:00:38,830
happened so noticing over here now to
17

17

00:00:38,830  -->  00:00:41,410
the right the....and the
18

18

00:00:41,410  -->  00:00:44,140
variables pane has now got
19

19

00:00:44,140  -->  00:00:46,690
a value of a and if we expand the
20

20

00:00:46,690  -->  00:00:49,150
s building and the variable section you can
21

21

00:00:49,150  -->  00:00:50,770
see that the count has been set to one
22

22

00:00:50,770  -->  00:00:53,110
but over here if we actually expand
23

23

00:00:53,110  -->  00:00:55,600
s builder we can see that the value has
24

24

00:00:55,600  -->  00:00:58,120
been set to zero is still zero and we're
25

25

00:00:58,120  -->  00:01:00,820
also the value of the actual
26

26

00:01:00,820  -->  00:01:03,340
stringbuilder itself hasn't changed
27

27

00:01:03,340  -->  00:01:05,830
unlike the field version of our s builder
28

28

00:01:05,830  -->  00:01:08,790
variable so case it's not clear this
29

29

00:01:08,790  -->  00:01:11,040
tells us npw that we're updating the
30

30

00:01:11,040  -->  00:01:13,030
wrong variable we actually wanted to
31

31

00:01:13,030  -->  00:01:15,210
update the stringbuilder pass to the
32

32

00:01:15,210  -->  00:01:17,070
method but you can see here actually
33

33

00:01:17,070  -->  00:01:19,090
updating the instance variable and
34

34

00:01:19,090  -->  00:01:20,820
obviously that this dot would give that
35

35

00:01:20,820  -->  00:01:24,030
away as well let's step out of the
36

36

00:01:24,030  -->  00:01:26,170
method using the step out button so you
37

37

00:01:26,170  -->  00:01:29,530
come over and click on step out again so
38

38

00:01:29,530  -->  00:01:31,420
we've now suspended after executing the
39

39

00:01:31,420  -->  00:01:33,630
call to add char around the last line
40

40

00:01:33,630  -->  00:01:36,150
here we can see the variables here for
41

41

00:01:36,150  -->  00:01:38,020
the add char method and click one more
42

42

00:01:38,020  -->  00:01:40,560
time now you can see how they disappear
43

43

00:01:40,560  -->  00:01:42,060
now that we've stepped and we're now
44

44

00:01:42,060  -->  00:01:44,880
back in the main class in the main
45

45

00:01:44,880  -->  00:01:47,430
method and we are now seeing the variables
46

46

00:01:47,430  -->  00:01:50,770
for that method other thing to note here
47

47

00:01:50,770  -->  00:01:51,880
is now on the left hand side there's
48

48

00:01:51,880  -->  00:01:55,170
only one frame in the frames area now so
49

49

00:01:55,170  -->  00:01:57,310
if we expand the SB variable here in the
50

50

00:01:57,310  -->  00:01:59,560
variables area we can see that it's
51

51

00:01:59,560  -->  00:02:03,060
still empty now the editor is still also
52

52

00:02:03,060  -->  00:02:06,340
display the current value of SB so
53

53

00:02:06,340  -->  00:02:07,650
hopefully now you understand why our
54

54

00:02:07,650  -->  00:02:09,700
applications running out of memory so
55

55

00:02:09,700  -->  00:02:11,770
we're appending the character to the
56

56

00:02:11,770  -->  00:02:13,450
string utilities instance variable
57

57

00:02:13,450  -->  00:02:15,760
rather than to the string builder that
58

58

00:02:15,760  -->  00:02:17,760
we're passing to the method therefor the
59

59

00:02:17,760  -->  00:02:20,140
loop is never going to terminate and a
60

60

00:02:20,140  -->  00:02:22,030
string utilities stringbuilder instance
61

61

00:02:22,030  -->  00:02:24,340
will continue to grow until the
62

62

00:02:24,340  -->  00:02:26,920
application runs out of memory to fix
63

63

00:02:26,920  -->  00:02:28,950
this bug pretty simple fix go back to
64

64

00:02:28,950  -->  00:02:31,390
string utilities we're going to actually
65

65

00:02:31,390  -->  00:02:35,340
change this by removing the this.....
66

66

00:02:35,340  -->  00:02:36,790
take this opportunity to close these extra
67

67

00:02:36,790  -->  00:02:39,220
java files so we're going to be
68

68

00:02:39,220  -->  00:02:41,820
updating the variable pass
69

69

00:02:41,820  -->  00:02:43,650
to this method instead of local instance
70

70

00:02:43,650  -->  00:02:46,230
variable and if go back now
71

71

00:02:46,230  -->  00:02:49,420
and will stop this and we'll run
72

72

00:02:49,420  -->  00:02:54,870
it again and now we check the values
73

73

00:02:54,870  -->  00:02:58,260
so we step over again and you can see
74

74

00:02:58,260  -->  00:02:59,980
now that we actually got the right
75

75

00:02:59,980  -->  00:03:01,980
values being updated we got this we can
76

76

00:03:01,980  -->  00:03:04,320
open up we can now see that the field
77

77

00:03:04,320  -->  00:03:06,400
for the class is no longer being updated
78

78

00:03:06,400  -->  00:03:09,730
and in fact the local the parameter
79

79

00:03:09,730  -->  00:03:12,210
the sbuilder variable pass to this
80

80

00:03:12,210  -->  00:03:14,430
method is now being updated you can see
81

81

00:03:14,430  -->  00:03:15,730
the count is going up as well as the
82

82

00:03:15,730  -->  00:03:18,250
actual value so that should be that bug
83

83

00:03:18,250  -->  00:03:20,620
fixed so what we can then do is you can
84

84

00:03:20,620  -->  00:03:22,150
remove the breakpoint by clicking on it
85

85

00:03:22,150  -->  00:03:23,980
here and then coming up and clicking on
86

86

00:03:23,980  -->  00:03:27,210
a resume and we can see that the program
87

87

00:03:27,210  -->  00:03:28,560
is now finished because these buttons are
88

88

00:03:28,560  -->  00:03:30,510
now deemed down and no loonger
89

89

00:03:30,510  -->  00:03:32,730
available and click on the console to see
90

90

00:03:32,730  -->  00:03:34,680
the output the program finished without
91

91

00:03:34,680  -->  00:03:36,120
any errors and there's no more
92

92

00:03:36,120  -->  00:03:37,120
exceptions
93

93

00:03:37,120  -->  00:03:39,570
alright so let's go back to our debug
94

94

00:03:39,570  -->  00:03:42,210
view again i'm going to go to set the
95

95

00:03:42,210  -->  00:03:43,710
breakpoint again in the same area the
96

96

00:03:43,710  -->  00:03:45,960
same one on line 11 i'm going to click on
97

97

00:03:45,960  -->  00:03:47,620
the debug as normal to start again
98

98

00:03:47,620  -->  00:03:50,700
we want to talk a bit more now about these
99

99

00:03:50,700  -->  00:03:52,930
variables with the glasses on
100

100

00:03:52,930  -->  00:03:54,790
them you can see that we've got this one
101

101

00:03:54,790  -->  00:03:56,170
down here this chars added with the
102

102

00:03:56,170  -->  00:03:59,560
little picture of sunglasses so at
103

103

00:03:59,560  -->  00:04:00,730
the moment that's the only one there
104

104

00:04:00,730  -->  00:04:02,400
that's because we no longer referencing
105

105

00:04:02,400  -->  00:04:04,090
this . s builder within the method
106

106

00:04:04,090  -->  00:04:06,340
but if you had keen eyes you probably
107

107

00:04:06,340  -->  00:04:08,850
notice that in a previous video and even
108

108

00:04:08,850  -->  00:04:10,420
earlier in this video before we fix this
109

109

00:04:10,420  -->  00:04:12,640
that there was two variables there
110

110

00:04:12,640  -->  00:04:15,870
the class instance field s builder was
111

111

00:04:15,870  -->  00:04:18,340
also showing there as well so these
112

112

00:04:18,340  -->  00:04:20,680
variables with glasses next to them are
113

113

00:04:20,680  -->  00:04:22,630
actually called watches and their
114

114

00:04:22,630  -->  00:04:24,750
feature of the IntelliJ debugger
115

115

00:04:24,750  -->  00:04:26,560
now watchers always appear in the
116

116

00:04:26,560  -->  00:04:28,230
variables pane
117

117

00:04:28,230  -->  00:04:30,270
they're updated as the application runs
118

118

00:04:30,270  -->  00:04:33,210
so let's actually go and step over each
119

119

00:04:33,210  -->  00:04:35,490
statement in the add char method until
120

120

00:04:35,490  -->  00:04:37,320
were actually suspended on the closing
121

121

00:04:37,320  -->  00:04:41,880
curly brace now the step-over do one
122

122

00:04:41,880  -->  00:04:43,530
more now we are actually suspended on
123

123

00:04:43,530  -->  00:04:45,840
the curly braces you can see we can see
124

124

00:04:45,840  -->  00:04:48,270
we've had some values updated so
125

125

00:04:48,270  -->  00:04:50,340
chars added has been updated to one
126

126

00:04:50,340  -->  00:04:53,760
and if we click on resume the
127

127

00:04:53,760  -->  00:04:55,230
application was suspended again at the
128

128

00:04:55,230  -->  00:04:57,600
same break point because of the loop in
129

129

00:04:57,600  -->  00:05:00,120
the main method we step over to the
130

130

00:05:00,120  -->  00:05:03,900
curly brace again you see the values
131

131

00:05:03,900  -->  00:05:06,780
updated to 2 so this is a convenient way to
132

132

00:05:06,780  -->  00:05:08,700
watch what's going on with variables of
133

133

00:05:08,700  -->  00:05:10,710
interest now it may not seem like much
134

134

00:05:10,710  -->  00:05:12,540
but it's because we don't have many
135

135

00:05:12,540  -->  00:05:14,340
variables when we're dealing with a
136

136

00:05:14,340  -->  00:05:16,020
class with a lot of instance variables
137

137

00:05:16,020  -->  00:05:17,610
and we interested in one of two of them
138

138

00:05:17,610  -->  00:05:19,710
in particular we can actually want to
139

139

00:05:19,710  -->  00:05:22,740
set them as watches and as we've seen
140

140

00:05:22,740  -->  00:05:24,690
intellij has set these
141

141

00:05:24,690  -->  00:05:26,580
default ones up for us because we didn't
142

142

00:05:26,580  -->  00:05:28,500
actually set these watches up for
143

143

00:05:28,500  -->  00:05:30,690
ourselves individually so we're actually
144

144

00:05:30,690  -->  00:05:32,550
interested to see what happens to the s
145

145

00:05:32,550  -->  00:05:34,800
builder parameter now we can see the
146

146

00:05:34,800  -->  00:05:36,300
value is easily enough by coming
147

147

00:05:36,300  -->  00:05:37,620
down here and clicking on it and having
148

148

00:05:37,620  -->  00:05:40,350
to look like that but lets suppose we were
149

149

00:05:40,350  -->  00:05:42,990
very interested specifically in s builder
150

150

00:05:42,990  -->  00:05:45,630
dot count now we can expand the s builder
151

151

00:05:45,630  -->  00:05:47,160
parameters as you just saw and see the
152

152

00:05:47,160  -->  00:05:48,810
count but if you want to do this with
153

153

00:05:48,810  -->  00:05:50,340
several fields belonging to say
154

154

00:05:50,340  -->  00:05:52,560
different instances our variables
155

155

00:05:52,560  -->  00:05:54,150
window will quickly becoming a pretty
156

156

00:05:54,150  -->  00:05:56,160
cluttered full as expanding everything
157

157

00:05:56,160  -->  00:05:58,410
as it everything out down here and then
158

158

00:05:58,410  -->  00:06:00,480
we may have to scroll up and down to see
159

159

00:06:00,480  -->  00:06:02,160
all the values that were interested in
160

160

00:06:02,160  -->  00:06:04,800
so to avoid this what we can do is we
161

161

00:06:04,800  -->  00:06:07,680
can make s builder . count a watch to
162

162

00:06:07,680  -->  00:06:09,330
do so i'm going to open this up again
163

163

00:06:09,330  -->  00:06:12,450
we're going to come over here to count in
164

164

00:06:12,450  -->  00:06:15,330
the variables pane right click on it and
165

165

00:06:15,330  -->  00:06:18,720
click on add to watches up
166

166

00:06:18,720  -->  00:06:21,750
here now its actually showing on its own line
167

167

00:06:21,750  -->  00:06:23,580
going to click away from that
168

168

00:06:23,580  -->  00:06:25,470
because i wanted to make a point about
169

169

00:06:25,470  -->  00:06:28,050
the color which will see shortly so lets
170

170

00:06:28,050  -->  00:06:29,850
go and step over this again so I'm
171

171

00:06:29,850  -->  00:06:33,270
going to resume and going to step over
172

172

00:06:33,270  -->  00:06:36,540
there did you notice what happened there
173

173

00:06:36,540  -->  00:06:39,030
to the watch the sbuilder .count
174

174

00:06:39,030  -->  00:06:40,800
watch that we've just added notice how
175

175

00:06:40,800  -->  00:06:41,810
it went blue there
176

176

00:06:41,810  -->  00:06:43,430
we're we actually when we stepped over
177

177

00:06:43,430  -->  00:06:46,610
that line 11 now watch will turn blue
178

178

00:06:46,610  -->  00:06:49,520
when the last statement executed changed
179

179

00:06:49,520  -->  00:06:52,160
its value so that's a good thing to know
180

180

00:06:52,160  -->  00:06:53,930
that you can sort of see
181

181

00:06:53,930  -->  00:06:56,960
that when something's updated it changes
182

182

00:06:56,960  -->  00:06:59,120
to blue a quick update quick scan you
183

183

00:06:59,120  -->  00:07:00,620
can sort of see anything in Blue has
184

184

00:07:00,620  -->  00:07:03,440
been updated now we can simplify this
185

185

00:07:03,440  -->  00:07:06,410
even further by opening the watches
186

186

00:07:06,410  -->  00:07:09,800
panel if the panel isn't already opened going
187

187

00:07:09,800  -->  00:07:11,660
to open it using the show watches in
188

188

00:07:11,660  -->  00:07:13,700
variables tab toggle which is down here
189

189

00:07:13,700  -->  00:07:16,800
so if you see that their click on that to
190

190

00:07:16,800  -->  00:07:20,360
open it but once you've done it once and
191

191

00:07:20,360  -->  00:07:21,890
if you could come over here and hide it
192

192

00:07:21,890  -->  00:07:24,990
you notice that this option doesn't come
193

193

00:07:24,990  -->  00:07:27,110
back here at some point in the future
194

194

00:07:27,110  -->  00:07:29,960
its then available here to click to restore
195

195

00:07:29,960  -->  00:07:31,910
the watches view so either those two
196

196

00:07:31,910  -->  00:07:33,650
places will actually show it but the
the watches view so either those t
197

197

00:07:33,650  -->  00:07:34,680
bottom line is there we've got a
198

198

00:07:34,680  -->  00:07:36,890
separate pane for our watches
199

199

00:07:36,890  -->  00:07:40,110
now depending on how much screen real
200

200

00:07:40,110  -->  00:07:41,510
estate you've got you might find that
201

201

00:07:41,510  -->  00:07:43,370
either of those options wasn't available to
202

202

00:07:43,370  -->  00:07:45,710
find that little watches
203

203

00:07:45,710  -->  00:07:47,870
pane be able to click that so you
204

204

00:07:47,870  -->  00:07:49,220
might actually happen you might see 2
205

205

00:07:49,220  -->  00:07:51,200
greater than signs and you may be seen
206

206

00:07:51,200  -->  00:07:52,880
it before in this course we'll have a
207

207

00:07:52,880  -->  00:07:54,930
lot of windows open here at the top a
208

208

00:07:54,930  -->  00:07:56,870
little greater than sign 2 greater
209

209

00:07:56,870  -->  00:07:59,000
than signs and you click on that and it
210

210

00:07:59,000  -->  00:07:59,990
opens up and gives you some other
211

211

00:07:59,990  -->  00:08:02,120
options so if you can't find it look for
212

212

00:08:02,120  -->  00:08:04,580
the option here that you can click which
213

213

00:08:04,580  -->  00:08:06,240
will open up and enable you to
214

214

00:08:06,240  -->  00:08:09,470
select that option the
215

215

00:08:09,470  -->  00:08:11,510
show watches in variables tab toggle
216

216

00:08:11,510  -->  00:08:14,960
option now one thing to note in
217

217

00:08:14,960  -->  00:08:16,970
here is that this will only show
218

218

00:08:16,970  -->  00:08:19,490
you watches that you added yourself
219

219

00:08:19,490  -->  00:08:23,330
not the ones that as set by IntelliJ and
220

220

00:08:23,330  -->  00:08:24,410
if you want to hide it again as you saw
221

221

00:08:24,410  -->  00:08:26,030
i can click on the option here to
222

222

00:08:26,030  -->  00:08:29,030
hide it and can add it back anytime you
223

223

00:08:29,030  -->  00:08:29,630
want
224

224

00:08:29,630  -->  00:08:32,150
so if you're no longer want to actually
225

225

00:08:32,150  -->  00:08:34,400
watch a variable any longer you can
226

226

00:08:34,400  -->  00:08:35,810
right-click on it and select the remove
227

227

00:08:35,810  -->  00:08:38,390
watch lets just run
228

228

00:08:38,390  -->  00:08:41,030
this again and then open this
229

229

00:08:41,030  -->  00:08:43,680
so again if i wanted to remove that just
230

230

00:08:43,680  -->  00:08:46,860
right click remove watch that removes it
231

231

00:08:46,860  -->  00:08:48,660
from that window we can hide that again
232

232

00:08:48,660  -->  00:08:50,800
okay
233

233

00:08:50,800  -->  00:08:53,830
now don't confuse watches with field
234

234

00:08:53,830  -->  00:08:56,800
watch points which is our next topic so
235

235

00:08:56,800  -->  00:08:58,540
a field watch point is a type of
236

236

00:08:58,540  -->  00:09:01,330
breakpoint so let's say we suspect that
237

237

00:09:01,330  -->  00:09:03,910
somewhere in our code the value of a
238

238

00:09:03,910  -->  00:09:06,010
variable is changing in an unexpected
239

239

00:09:06,010  -->  00:09:08,440
way we want to locate the code that's
240

240

00:09:08,440  -->  00:09:10,690
changing the value so what we can do is
241

241

00:09:10,690  -->  00:09:12,490
we can set a field watch point on that
242

242

00:09:12,490  -->  00:09:14,890
variable then whenever the value of the
243

243

00:09:14,890  -->  00:09:17,350
variable is accessed or updated the
244

244

00:09:17,350  -->  00:09:19,750
application will spend now we can
245

245

00:09:19,750  -->  00:09:21,510
actually create field watch points in
246

246

00:09:21,510  -->  00:09:23,860
two ways in the editor we can actually
247

247

00:09:23,860  -->  00:09:25,300
place the cursor in the field
248

248

00:09:25,300  -->  00:09:27,130
declaration and then al click in the
249

249

00:09:27,130  -->  00:09:27,850
gutter
250

250

00:09:27,850  -->  00:09:29,620
so in other words we want to
251

251

00:09:29,620  -->  00:09:31,810
know this whenever this char added was
252

252

00:09:31,810  -->  00:09:33,880
updated come over here hold alt
253

253

00:09:33,880  -->  00:09:37,770
and click to create the breakpoint
254

254

00:09:37,770  -->  00:09:39,040
their so that's actually to be more
255

255

00:09:39,040  -->  00:09:41,410
precise the field watch point notice
256

256

00:09:41,410  -->  00:09:42,910
that that's a little bit different the
257

257

00:09:42,910  -->  00:09:44,860
icon to the one we can see there for a
258

258

00:09:44,860  -->  00:09:46,810
regular breakpoint that's to tell it
259

259

00:09:46,810  -->  00:09:47,920
telling you that this is actually a
260

260

00:09:47,920  -->  00:09:50,380
different type of breakpoint or
261

261

00:09:50,380  -->  00:09:52,930
it's a watch point in this case so
262

262

00:09:52,930  -->  00:09:54,130
that's one way of doing it the other way
263

263

00:09:54,130  -->  00:09:55,420
of doing it is to come up to the run
264

264

00:09:55,420  -->  00:10:00,160
menu click on View breakpoints we want
265

265

00:10:00,160  -->  00:10:02,050
to select click on plus here and select
266

266

00:10:02,050  -->  00:10:04,690
java field watch points click on that
267

267

00:10:04,690  -->  00:10:06,550
and then we can actually specify the
268

268

00:10:06,550  -->  00:10:08,520
name of the class this code string
269

269

00:10:08,520  -->  00:10:12,160
utilities and the name of the variable
270

270

00:10:12,160  -->  00:10:14,800
that we want saying in this case chars
271

271

00:10:14,800  -->  00:10:17,200
added and click on OK and that would
272

272

00:10:17,200  -->  00:10:19,120
actually add it when we click on OK and
273

273

00:10:19,120  -->  00:10:21,760
obviously have done a similar thing with
274

274

00:10:21,760  -->  00:10:23,580
the way that I've clicked into the
275

275

00:10:23,580  -->  00:10:25,140
gutter so i'm going to cancel that I won't
276

276

00:10:25,140  -->  00:10:28,270
add that for now so lets try this i'm
277

277

00:10:28,270  -->  00:10:30,370
going to remove the breakpoint that
278

278

00:10:30,370  -->  00:10:32,350
we've had here on line 11 just click on
279

279

00:10:32,350  -->  00:10:33,640
it click that in the gutter to turn it
280

280

00:10:33,640  -->  00:10:36,670
off and I've set a java field watch point
281

281

00:10:36,670  -->  00:10:38,440
in the chars added variable as you can
282

282

00:10:38,440  -->  00:10:41,470
see here on line 8 and that's going to
283

283

00:10:41,470  -->  00:10:43,080
click on that again to show something
284

284

00:10:43,080  -->  00:10:45,330
here so click on that again because it's
285

285

00:10:45,330  -->  00:10:47,860
two different ways to showing
286

286

00:10:47,860  -->  00:10:49,200
this and depending which option you
287

287

00:10:49,200  -->  00:10:51,640
select one will be selected so click on this
288

288

00:10:51,640  -->  00:10:54,510
one here on line 8 holding alt that should
289

289

00:10:54,510  -->  00:10:56,920
work for both the pc and mac right to
290

290

00:10:56,920  -->  00:10:58,420
take it off I just click it without
291

291

00:10:58,420  -->  00:11:01,000
holding down alt that turns it off we're
292

292

00:11:01,000  -->  00:11:03,420
going back to our menu our run menu
293

293

00:11:03,420  -->  00:11:06,750
click on View breakpoints click on +
294

294

00:11:06,750  -->  00:11:09,870
select java field watch point
295

295

00:11:09,870  -->  00:11:12,930
select the class string utilities and
296

296

00:11:12,930  -->  00:11:15,300
the name of the instance variable field
297

297

00:11:15,300  -->  00:11:18,140
chars added click on OK click on OK
298

298

00:11:18,140  -->  00:11:18,720
again
299

299

00:11:18,720  -->  00:11:20,370
see that's added here and when we're
300

300

00:11:20,370  -->  00:11:22,940
done we can see that added to this area
301

301

00:11:22,940  -->  00:11:26,760
here as well now this is the way it's
302

302

00:11:26,760  -->  00:11:29,010
set up with this little dash and this
303

303

00:11:29,010  -->  00:11:31,070
basically means any time that chars
304

304

00:11:31,070  -->  00:11:34,640
added the field is modified the program
305

305

00:11:34,640  -->  00:11:37,110
will automatically break not sure what
306

306

00:11:37,110  -->  00:11:38,100
happened there I might have accidentally
307

307

00:11:38,100  -->  00:11:38,880
click that
308

308

00:11:38,880  -->  00:11:40,920
so any time that it's actually modified
309

309

00:11:40,920  -->  00:11:42,870
what we can do is hold down alt again and
310

310

00:11:42,870  -->  00:11:45,770
right click here we get this little menu
311

311

00:11:45,770  -->  00:11:47,450
and we've got a couple of different
312

312

00:11:47,450  -->  00:11:49,640
options here so we can actually set the
313

313

00:11:49,640  -->  00:11:52,560
watch to be anytime the field is
314

314

00:11:52,560  -->  00:11:54,930
accessed as opposed to modification
315

315

00:11:54,930  -->  00:11:56,690
modification usually be the one that you
316

316

00:11:56,690  -->  00:11:58,320
you checking but in any event you can
317

317

00:11:58,320  -->  00:12:01,820
select either click on done but also
318

318

00:12:01,820  -->  00:12:03,180
want to show you by coming over here
319

319

00:12:03,180  -->  00:12:05,010
clicking on alt and right-click again
320

320

00:12:05,010  -->  00:12:07,170
there's another option here when we
321

321

00:12:07,170  -->  00:12:09,660
click on more and that it will automatically
322

322

00:12:09,660  -->  00:12:11,160
open up the view breakpoints window with
323

323

00:12:11,160  -->  00:12:13,470
that variable that's been defined we can
324

324

00:12:13,470  -->  00:12:16,260
also click on here remove once hit if we
325

325

00:12:16,260  -->  00:12:18,570
click on that remove once hit click on
326

326

00:12:18,570  -->  00:12:21,690
done what happened there is that the
327

327

00:12:21,690  -->  00:12:24,240
first time the variable is accessed it
328

328

00:12:24,240  -->  00:12:25,470
will break and then after that point
329

329

00:12:25,470  -->  00:12:27,000
that point onwards it actually won't
330

330

00:12:27,000  -->  00:12:28,740
break so if we just click on right click
331

331

00:12:28,740  -->  00:12:31,260
that again we can see now that I've done
332

332

00:12:31,260  -->  00:12:34,050
that we've got this removed once hit and
333

333

00:12:34,050  -->  00:12:35,820
my IntelliJ seems to be playing up a
334

334

00:12:35,820  -->  00:12:36,750
little bit because what should have
335

335

00:12:36,750  -->  00:12:39,120
happened at that point is that what we
336

336

00:12:39,120  -->  00:12:40,470
should have seen a little one showing
337

337

00:12:40,470  -->  00:12:42,950
their indicating that it was only going
338

338

00:12:42,950  -->  00:12:45,180
to be a watch point once and then it
339

339

00:12:45,180  -->  00:12:47,100
would turn itself off automatically
340

340

00:12:47,100  -->  00:12:48,480
so lets actually just try running this
341

341

00:12:48,480  -->  00:12:50,270
in to see what happens i'm going to work
342

342

00:12:50,270  -->  00:12:55,070
resume and see what happened there I
343

343

00:12:55,070  -->  00:12:57,510
resumed and it only allowed me to
344

344

00:12:57,510  -->  00:12:59,810
resume once and then you can see the
345

345

00:12:59,810  -->  00:13:01,920
other program actually finished in other
346

346

00:13:01,920  -->  00:13:03,440
words the watch point come into effect
347

347

00:13:03,440  -->  00:13:07,350
once and that first time we've got a
348

348

00:13:07,350  -->  00:13:09,770
break when that chars added variables
349

349

00:13:09,770  -->  00:13:12,120
change that field for the first time and
350

350

00:13:12,120  -->  00:13:13,940
from that point on it then went through
351

351

00:13:13,940  -->  00:13:15,830
and allowed to program to exit in some
352

352

00:13:15,830  -->  00:13:17,130
scenarios you may only
353

353

00:13:17,130  -->  00:13:19,350
want that to happen you may want to break
354

354

00:13:19,350  -->  00:13:21,240
just the first time of a variable
355

355

00:13:21,240  -->  00:13:23,670
values changed but their can also be
356

356

00:13:23,670  -->  00:13:25,710
other scenarios where you want to change
357

357

00:13:25,710  -->  00:13:27,630
each time we come back and add that
358

358

00:13:27,630  -->  00:13:29,760
break point again just doing an alt click
359

359

00:13:29,760  -->  00:13:32,700
again now where it wasn't
360

360

00:13:32,700  -->  00:13:34,200
doing that before now it's actually
361

361

00:13:34,200  -->  00:13:34,980
working
362

362

00:13:34,980  -->  00:13:36,660
that's the one that I was trying to show
363

363

00:13:36,660  -->  00:13:38,160
you earlier in the video and it it might
364

364

00:13:38,160  -->  00:13:40,110
be that we have to debug at least
365

365

00:13:40,110  -->  00:13:42,240
once from perhaps for that to happen but
366

366

00:13:42,240  -->  00:13:43,560
in any event this what i wanted to show you so
367

367

00:13:43,560  -->  00:13:47,310
the one there is going to do that to
368

368

00:13:47,310  -->  00:13:49,200
remove once hit so if I
369

369

00:13:49,200  -->  00:13:51,300
hold down alt right-clicking again you can
370

370

00:13:51,300  -->  00:13:52,620
see how that's not showing in this menu
371

371

00:13:52,620  -->  00:13:54,180
or if you go back and check the earlier
372

372

00:13:54,180  -->  00:13:56,460
this video wasn't showing so that's the
373

373

00:13:56,460  -->  00:13:58,380
case where it's only going to show
374

374

00:13:58,380  -->  00:14:00,420
or its only going to break once the
375

375

00:14:00,420  -->  00:14:02,880
variables change for the first time we
376

376

00:14:02,880  -->  00:14:05,580
can take that off if we want we click on done
377

377

00:14:05,580  -->  00:14:08,250
and the little icon changes that
378

378

00:14:08,250  -->  00:14:10,500
little dash and the dash means that each
379

379

00:14:10,500  -->  00:14:12,930
time the variable the variable is
380

380

00:14:12,930  -->  00:14:15,660
changed in value its going to break so
381

381

00:14:15,660  -->  00:14:18,330
let's actually test this by debugging
382

382

00:14:18,330  -->  00:14:20,940
this again so what i'm going to do as you can see
383

383

00:14:20,940  -->  00:14:22,500
the first time we've gotta break their
384

384

00:14:22,500  -->  00:14:25,080
i'm just gonna click on resume and
385

385

00:14:25,080  -->  00:14:26,460
clicking on resume you notice how
386

386

00:14:26,460  -->  00:14:28,380
each time clicking on resume once it's
387

387

00:14:28,380  -->  00:14:29,730
breaking at that point that's because
388

388

00:14:29,730  -->  00:14:32,100
this has been specified to be anywhere
389

389

00:14:32,100  -->  00:14:34,050
in the code with that particular field
390

390

00:14:34,050  -->  00:14:36,510
is changed in value
391

391

00:14:36,510  -->  00:14:38,220
it's going to break it so that can be
392

392

00:14:38,220  -->  00:14:39,690
really handy if you're trying to figure
393

393

00:14:39,690  -->  00:14:42,330
out how this variable how this field
394

394

00:14:42,330  -->  00:14:43,980
actually got updated you might have
395

395

00:14:43,980  -->  00:14:45,390
quite a complex class and you can't
396

396

00:14:45,390  -->  00:14:46,350
figure it out
397

397

00:14:46,350  -->  00:14:47,820
that's what you do to actually set it up
398

398

00:14:47,820  -->  00:14:51,330
so again you can come here and alt right
399

399

00:14:51,330  -->  00:14:54,180
click and notice now that
400

400

00:14:54,180  -->  00:14:56,070
we've actually remove that checkpoint we
401

401

00:14:56,070  -->  00:14:57,540
can't add it again here from this screen
402

402

00:14:57,540  -->  00:14:59,430
we can click on more if we wanted to
403

403

00:14:59,430  -->  00:15:04,110
remove once hit click on done you have
404

404

00:15:04,110  -->  00:15:05,280
to set it up that way
405

405

00:15:05,280  -->  00:15:06,390
probably not a good idea to be doing
406

406

00:15:06,390  -->  00:15:08,640
that during debugging session but i'll
407

407

00:15:08,640  -->  00:15:10,380
try working in and we'll just confirm
408

408

00:15:10,380  -->  00:15:13,560
that it works you can see that i click
409

409

00:15:13,560  -->  00:15:15,600
once and click again and then the watch
410

410

00:15:15,600  -->  00:15:17,520
point automatically got deactivated
411

411

00:15:17,520  -->  00:15:20,640
alright so again we just hold down alt
412

412

00:15:20,640  -->  00:15:23,790
and click you get the one there which is
413

413

00:15:23,790  -->  00:15:24,990
should have happened I'm not
414

414

00:15:24,990  -->  00:15:26,220
sure why it didn't happen earlier in the
415

415

00:15:26,220  -->  00:15:28,770
video and that would be when the value
416

416

00:15:28,770  -->  00:15:30,090
changes once
417

417

00:15:30,090  -->  00:15:31,650
the program will then break and we can
418

418

00:15:31,650  -->  00:15:33,270
just confirm that by just a debugging
419

419

00:15:33,270  -->  00:15:38,400
and resume never asks again as you can
420

420

00:15:38,400  -->  00:15:39,180
see
421

421

00:15:39,180  -->  00:15:41,460
alternatively I can do it alt click i
422

422

00:15:41,460  -->  00:15:43,950
can do an alt right click click on the remove
423

423

00:15:43,950  -->  00:15:44,640
once hit
424

424

00:15:44,640  -->  00:15:48,150
click on done I can debug again and then
425

425

00:15:48,150  -->  00:15:50,460
i can just resume each time to track
426

426

00:15:50,460  -->  00:15:52,830
any time that the field is
427

427

00:15:52,830  -->  00:15:54,300
actually change in value
428

428

00:15:54,300  -->  00:15:56,280
alright so what I'm shown
429

429

00:15:56,280  -->  00:15:58,500
you is probably the features that will
430

430

00:15:58,500  -->  00:16:00,330
be used that you use for debugging
431

431

00:16:00,330  -->  00:16:03,330
probably 99% of the time there's a
432

432

00:16:03,330  -->  00:16:04,920
lot we can do but setting breakpoints
433

433

00:16:04,920  -->  00:16:06,930
and watch points are really what we do
434

434

00:16:06,930  -->  00:16:09,030
the most but i want to touch on a few
435

435

00:16:09,030  -->  00:16:11,130
more things so let's start working on
436

436

00:16:11,130  -->  00:16:17,420
those things in the next video
