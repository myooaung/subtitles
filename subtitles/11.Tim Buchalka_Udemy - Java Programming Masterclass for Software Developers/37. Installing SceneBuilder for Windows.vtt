32

32

00:01:18.070  -->  00:01:19.390
on windows
in this case I'm going to be installing
33

33

00:01:19.390  -->  00:01:20.920
the other thing you need to know is
on windows
34

34

00:01:20.920  -->  00:01:23.230
whether you're running 32 or 64 bit
the other thing you need to know is
35

35

00:01:23.230  -->  00:01:26.020
version of Windows if you're unsure go
whether you're running 32 or 64 bit
36

36

00:01:26.020  -->  00:01:29.320
back and check the installation of Java
version of Windows if you're unsure go
37

37

00:01:29.320  -->  00:01:31.390
video right in section 1 of this course
back and check the installation of Java
38

38

00:01:31.390  -->  00:01:32.980
because actually show you that in
video right in section 1 of this course
39

39

00:01:32.980  -->  00:01:35.380
particular video how to check wether
because actually show you that in
40

40

00:01:35.380  -->  00:01:38.680
your running of 32 or 64 bit version i happen
particular video how to check wether
41

41

00:01:38.680  -->  00:01:40.630
to know that i'm running a 64-bit so
your running of 32 or 64 bit version i happen
42

42

00:01:40.630  -->  00:01:41.920
this is the version i'm going to choose
to know that i'm running a 64-bit so
43

43

00:01:41.920  -->  00:01:44.950
the x64 which stands for 64-bit so i'm
this is the version i'm going to choose
44

44

00:01:44.950  -->  00:01:46.870

60

00:02:13.620  -->  00:02:15.510
browser does look give it a moment to
support the clicking of a downlad like my
61

61

00:02:15.510  -->  00:02:17.410

tim app data local scene builder we'll
66

66

00:02:30.580  -->  00:02:31.240
video
need to know that folder later in this
67

67

00:02:31.240  -->  00:02:33.430
now once it's finished installing you
video
68

68

00:02:33.430  -->  00:02:34.870
can see it's automatically loaded the
now once it's finished installing you
69

69

00:02:34.870  -->  00:02:37.180
tool and i think i click that twice their
can see it's automatically loaded the
70

70

00:02:37.180  -->  00:02:38.710
that is why the second install
tool and i think i click that twice their
71

71

00:02:38.710  -->  00:02:39.940
scene builder started i'm going to
that is why the second install
72

72

00:02:39.940  -->  00:02:43.420
cancel out of that one and the first time
scene builder started i'm going to
73

73

00:02:43.420  -->  00:02:45.010
you load it actually asks for your email
cancel out of that one and the first time
74

74

00:02:45.010  -->  00:02:46.300
address you don't need to register that
you load it actually asks for your email
75

75

00:02:46.300  -->  00:02:47.920
unless you want to keep in touch
address you don't need to register that
76

76

00:02:47.920  -->  00:02:50.260
click on cancel now this is the
unless you want to keep in touch
77

77

00:02:50.260  -->  00:02:52.570
standalone version of scene builder so from the
click on cancel now this is the
78

78

00:02:52.570  -->  00:02:53.800
head there were going to be able to
standalone version of scene builder so from the
79

79

00:02:53.800  -->  00:02:57.430
construct and set up fxml screens
head there were going to be able to
80

80

00:02:57.430  -->  00:02:59.290
but other really cool feature here is
construct and set up fxml screens
81

81

00:02:59.290  -->  00:03:01.750
that we can actually configure IntelliJ
but other really cool feature here is
82

82

00:03:01.750  -->  00:03:04.060
to use the scene builder and it means
that we can actually configure IntelliJ
83

83

00:03:04.060  -->  00:03:05.560
that we can then access scene builder
to use the scene builder and it means
84

84

00:03:05.560  -->  00:03:07.510
from within IntelliJ and I think that's a
that we can then access scene builder
85

85

00:03:07.510  -->  00:03:09.370
far more intuitive way to use it so for
from within IntelliJ and I think that's a
86

86

00:03:09.370  -->  00:03:11.200
that reason I'm actually going to close
far more intuitive way to use it so for
87

87

00:03:11.200  -->  00:03:13.330
this down here and once I
that reason I'm actually going to close
88

88

00:03:13.330  -->  00:03:15.970
close down the browser and i'm going to
this down here and once I
89

89

00:03:15.970  -->  00:03:18.670
make sure intelliJ is started and what
close down the browser and i'm going to
90

90

00:03:18.670  -->  00:03:20.950
we need to do is point IntelliJ to the
make sure intelliJ is started and what
91

91

00:03:20.950  -->  00:03:23.740
location of scene builder that has been
we need to do is point IntelliJ to the
92

92

00:03:23.740  -->  00:03:25.270
installed on your system to do that
location of scene builder that has been
93

93

00:03:25.270  -->  00:03:27.220
we're going to click on configure click
installed on your system to do that
94

94

00:03:27.220  -->  00:03:30.670
on settings and come down here to
we're going to click on configure click
95

95

00:03:30.670  -->  00:03:32.440
languages and frameworks click on that
on settings and come down here to
96

96

00:03:32.440  -->  00:03:35.200
i'm going to select java fx by
languages and frameworks click on that
97

97

00:03:35.200  -->  00:03:37.960
clicking it and what we need to do now
i'm going to select java fx by
98

98

00:03:37.960  -->  00:03:40.240
is basically put it in or select the path
clicking it and what we need to do now
99

99

00:03:40.240  -->  00:03:43.210
where scene borders installed so we're
is basically put it in or select the path
100

100

00:03:43.210  -->  00:03:45.670
going to click on the ellipse there and if
where scene borders installed so we're
101

101

00:03:45.670  -->  00:03:47.740
you recall I said the folder that was
going to click on the ellipse there and if
102

102

00:03:47.740  -->  00:03:50.050
saved to is in the users folder

whatever your username is then it'll be
105

105

00:03:55.870  -->  00:03:57.760
you can't see files because the
under app data now you might find that
106

106

00:03:57.760  -->  00:03:59.140
select the hidden files are actually
you can't see files because the

118

00:04:29.090  -->  00:04:30.770
the way to actually open up scene
gives IntelliJ
119

119

00:04:30.770  -->  00:04:32.960
builder from within IntelliJ last thing to
the way to actually open up scene
120

120

00:04:32.960  -->  00:04:35.360
do is to click on OK and at that
builder from within IntelliJ last thing to
121

121

00:04:35.360  -->  00:04:37.730
point we now configured IntelliJ so
do is to click on OK and at that
122

122

00:04:37.730  -->  00:04:41.120
that we can start using scene builder within
point we now configured IntelliJ so
123

123

00:04:41.120  -->  00:04:43.610
IntelliJ for our Java fx
that we can start using scene builder within
124

124

00:04:43.610  -->  00:04:46.970
projects so we have done we've
IntelliJ for our Java fx
125

125

00:04:46.970  -->  00:04:49.400
completed the installation ill so unless
projects so we have done we've
126

126

00:04:49.400  -->  00:04:51.620
you've got a mac skip the next video and

skip on instead to the video after that
you've got a mac skip the next video and
128

128

00:04:53.810  -->  00:04:56.120
where we actually start using scene
skip on instead to the video after that
129

129

00:04:56.120  -->  00:04:58.310
builder within IntelliJ so we'll see you
where we actually start using scene
130

130

00:04:58.310  -->  00:05:04.060
in the next video
builder within IntelliJ so we'll see you
