00:00:05,450  -->  00:00:07,160
in this video we'll start by taking a
2

2

00:00:07,540  -->  00:00:10,380
whirlwind tour of a few javafx features
in this video we'll start by taking a
3

3

00:00:10,760  -->  00:00:12,170
that we haven't touched on yet in that
whirlwind tour of a few javafx features
4

4

00:00:12,550  -->  00:00:14,310
section of the course we're going to
that we haven't touched on yet in that
5

5

00:00:14,690  -->  00:00:15,710
learn how to do a couple of things that
section of the course we're going to
6

6

00:00:16,090  -->  00:00:18,620
most client applications will
learn how to do a couple of things that
7

7

00:00:19,000  -->  00:00:21,420
typically want to do we're gonna start
most client applications will
8

8

00:00:21,800  -->  00:00:24,900
with styling controls using CSS now
typically want to do we're gonna start
9

9

00:00:25,280  -->  00:00:25,890
we've already done this in a previous
with styling controls using CSS now
10

10

00:00:26,270  -->  00:00:29,460
lecture we added a border to control so
we've already done this in a previous
11

11

00:00:29,840  -->  00:00:30,720
that we can see it better within a
lecture we added a border to control so
12

12

00:00:31,100  -->  00:00:32,880
layout but we didn't really discuss it
that we can see it better within a
13

13

00:00:33,260  -->  00:00:35,430
or explain the power of using CSS to
layout but we didn't really discuss it
14

14

00:00:35,810  -->  00:00:38,580
style controls let's start by creating a
or explain the power of using CSS to
15

15

00:00:38,960  -->  00:00:40,800
new project so i'm going to click on the
style controls let's start by creating a
16

16

00:00:41,180  -->  00:00:42,000
create new project we're going to
new project so i'm going to click on the
17

17

00:00:42,380  -->  00:00:44,820
select javafx click on next
create new project we're going to
18

18

00:00:45,200  -->  00:00:47,280
i'm going to call this one javafx
select javafx click on next
19

19

00:00:47,660  -->  00:00:56,640
application and click on finish
i'm going to call this one javafx
20

20

00:00:57,020  -->  00:01:00,710
give us a bit more room here
application and click on finish
21

21

00:01:01,090  -->  00:01:04,110
alright so going to start by
give us a bit more room here
22

22

00:01:04,490  -->  00:01:07,490
changing our fxml file and what
alright so going to start by
23

23

00:01:07,870  -->  00:01:10,290
we're going to do here is we're going to
changing our fxml file and what
24

24

00:01:10,670  -->  00:01:16,110
add some buttons....
we're going to do here is we're going to
25

25

00:01:16,490  -->  00:01:22,380
...
add some buttons....
26

26

00:01:22,760  -->  00:02:13,660
...
...
27

27

00:02:14,040  -->  00:02:14,890
no surprises there it's actually working
...
28

28

00:02:15,270  -->  00:02:18,220
well alright so let's now change the
no surprises there it's actually working
29

29

00:02:18,600  -->  00:02:20,920
background color of button 1 to green and
well alright so let's now change the
30

30

00:02:21,300  -->  00:02:23,950
the text color to white now we could set
background color of button 1 to green and
31

31

00:02:24,330  -->  00:02:25,670
the text color by setting the buttons
the text color to white now we could set
32

32

00:02:26,050  -->  00:02:28,220
text field property since button if you
the text color by setting the buttons
33

33

00:02:28,600  -->  00:02:29,860
recall descends from the labeled class
text field property since button if you
34

34

00:02:30,240  -->  00:02:32,270
let's actually try doing this with
recall descends from the labeled class
35

35

00:02:32,650  -->  00:02:35,230
or using CSS and for the background color
let's actually try doing this with
36

36

00:02:35,610  -->  00:02:37,940
already seen that we have to use CSS to
or using CSS and for the background color
37

37

00:02:38,320  -->  00:02:39,280
change that we've done that previously
already seen that we have to use CSS to
38

38

00:02:39,660  -->  00:02:42,110
let's go back to our fxml file for button
change that we've done that previously
39

39

00:02:42,490  -->  00:02:46,360
one and will add....
let's go back to our fxml file for button
40

40

00:02:46,740  -->  00:02:49,750
...
one and will add....
41

41

00:02:50,130  -->  00:03:03,700
...
...
42

42

00:03:04,080  -->  00:03:06,200
...so if we run this
...
43

43

00:03:06,580  -->  00:03:09,920
application we should see the background
...so if we run this
44

44

00:03:10,300  -->  00:03:13,130
green text on white so that's working
application we should see the background
45

45

00:03:13,510  -->  00:03:15,970
nicely so be nice if we can actually
green text on white so that's working
46

46

00:03:16,350  -->  00:03:18,410
just quickly do that so all the buttons
nicely so be nice if we can actually
47

47

00:03:18,790  -->  00:03:19,850
in the application try to look the
just quickly do that so all the buttons
48

48

00:03:20,230  -->  00:03:20,500
same
in the application try to look the
49

49

00:03:20,880  -->  00:03:23,170
let's try changing button 2 so we
same
50

50

00:03:23,550  -->  00:03:26,570
could do something similar button 2 we
let's try changing button 2 so we
51

51

00:03:26,950  -->  00:03:29,230
can literally just copy the same code
could do something similar button 2 we
52

52

00:03:29,610  -->  00:03:37,160
just replace that line...
can literally just copy the same code
53

53

00:03:37,540  -->  00:03:39,500
....
just replace that line...
54

54

00:03:39,880  -->  00:03:41,140
obviously we can do that change the
....
55

55

00:03:41,520  -->  00:03:42,590
second one run it again
obviously we can do that change the
56

56

00:03:42,970  -->  00:03:44,750
no surprises there we should see the
second one run it again
57

57

00:03:45,130  -->  00:03:47,090
second button has now got the same color
no surprises there we should see the
58

58

00:03:47,470  -->  00:03:49,720
scheme or the same style so it would be
second button has now got the same color
59

59

00:03:50,100  -->  00:03:51,350
nice if we could do this to all the
scheme or the same style so it would be
60

60

00:03:51,730  -->  00:03:52,940
buttons in our application so they look
nice if we could do this to all the
61

61

00:03:53,320  -->  00:03:53,750
the same
buttons in our application so they look
62

62

00:03:54,130  -->  00:03:56,000
now obviously we can just set the style
the same
63

63

00:03:56,380  -->  00:03:57,380
for the remaining three buttons you can
now obviously we can just set the style
64

64

00:03:57,760  -->  00:03:58,480
just come back and do the equivalent
for the remaining three buttons you can
65

65

00:03:58,860  -->  00:04:01,540
thing here in the sample dot fxml file
just come back and do the equivalent
66

66

00:04:01,920  -->  00:04:03,670
to make the buttons three four and five
thing here in the sample dot fxml file
67

67

00:04:04,050  -->  00:04:06,560
look the same but think about scenario
to make the buttons three four and five
68

68

00:04:06,940  -->  00:04:07,910
where your applications perhaps got
look the same but think about scenario
69

69

00:04:08,290  -->  00:04:10,420
hundreds of buttons and whatever have
where your applications perhaps got
70

70

00:04:10,800  -->  00:04:12,610
lots of Windows and dialogues each defined
hundreds of buttons and whatever have
71

71

00:04:12,990  -->  00:04:15,440
in their own fxml file imagine
lots of Windows and dialogues each defined
72

72

00:04:15,820  -->  00:04:17,230
having to go through three literally
in their own fxml file imagine
73

73

00:04:17,610  -->  00:04:20,440
every fxml file to find every button
having to go through three literally
74

74

00:04:20,820  -->  00:04:22,750
and then adding the style properly to it
every fxml file to find every button
75

75

00:04:23,130  -->  00:04:25,610
and worse imagine that we didn't do it
and then adding the style properly to it
76

76

00:04:25,990  -->  00:04:26,810
we actually spent consider
and worse imagine that we didn't do it
77

77

00:04:27,190  -->  00:04:29,120
amount of time we change the buttons so
we actually spent consider
78

78

00:04:29,500  -->  00:04:30,350
they will have a green background and
amount of time we change the buttons so
79

79

00:04:30,730  -->  00:04:32,810
white text but then our manager or a client
they will have a green background and
80

80

00:04:33,190  -->  00:04:34,660
change their mind and decided that no
white text but then our manager or a client
81

81

00:04:35,040  -->  00:04:36,530
we don't want green we want
change their mind and decided that no
82

82

00:04:36,910  -->  00:04:38,270
our buttons in fact to
we don't want green we want
83

83

00:04:38,650  -->  00:04:39,440
have a blue background
our buttons in fact to
84

84

00:04:39,820  -->  00:04:41,120
you then have to go back and change the
have a blue background
85

85

00:04:41,500  -->  00:04:43,460
fxml for every button all
you then have to go back and change the
86

86

00:04:43,840  -->  00:04:45,320
over again so that would be a bit of a
fxml for every button all
87

87

00:04:45,700  -->  00:04:47,750
nightmare but fortunately there's a way
over again so that would be a bit of a
88

88

00:04:48,130  -->  00:04:49,190
to style all the buttons in our
nightmare but fortunately there's a way
89

89

00:04:49,570  -->  00:04:51,100
application without having to add the
to style all the buttons in our
90

90

00:04:51,480  -->  00:04:53,270
style property to every single
application without having to add the
91

91

00:04:53,650  -->  00:04:55,850
button we can actually put our styles
style property to every single
92

92

00:04:56,230  -->  00:04:58,370
into a separate file just as we can with
button we can actually put our styles
93

93

00:04:58,750  -->  00:05:01,040
the CSS for a webpage so let's actually
into a separate file just as we can with
94

94

00:05:01,420  -->  00:05:04,790
add a CSS file now what we need to do is
the CSS for a webpage so let's actually
95

95

00:05:05,170  -->  00:05:07,070
just to open up our project pane need to
add a CSS file now what we need to do is
96

96

00:05:07,450  -->  00:05:08,780
make sure that this is expanded we're in
just to open up our project pane need to
97

97

00:05:09,160  -->  00:05:10,400
sample we want to actually put it in the
make sure that this is expanded we're in
98

98

00:05:10,780  -->  00:05:14,630
sample package so click on sample click
sample we want to actually put it in the
99

99

00:05:15,010  -->  00:05:18,470
on file new the new file i'm going to
sample package so click on sample click
100

100

00:05:18,850  -->  00:05:19,600
call this file that we're creating
on file new the new file i'm going to
101

101

00:05:19,980  -->  00:05:23,720
styles.css just
call this file that we're creating
102

102

00:05:24,100  -->  00:05:29,870
close the bottom window so you see up
styles.css just
103

103

00:05:30,250  -->  00:05:31,630
here just with a little icon that
close the bottom window so you see up
104

104

00:05:32,010  -->  00:05:33,820
intellij does recognize that this is a
here just with a little icon that
105

105

00:05:34,200  -->  00:05:37,430
CSS file based on the file extension so
intellij does recognize that this is a
106

106

00:05:37,810  -->  00:05:39,190
okay we want all our buttons in our
CSS file based on the file extension so
107

107

00:05:39,570  -->  00:05:40,790
application to have a green background
okay we want all our buttons in our
108

108

00:05:41,170  -->  00:05:44,150
and white text now in CSS we can use a
application to have a green background
109

109

00:05:44,530  -->  00:05:46,540
selector to specify what we want to
and white text now in CSS we can use a
110

110

00:05:46,920  -->  00:05:49,250
style when we wanted to find a style for
selector to specify what we want to
111

111

00:05:49,630  -->  00:05:51,170
all the buttons on our application we
style when we wanted to find a style for
112

112

00:05:51,550  -->  00:05:53,690
use the dot button selector because we
all the buttons on our application we
113

113

00:05:54,070  -->  00:05:55,880
want to style all instances of the
use the dot button selector because we
114

114

00:05:56,260  -->  00:05:58,130
button class so going to assign the
want to style all instances of the
115

115

00:05:58,510  -->  00:05:59,840
properties within a set of curly braces
button class so going to assign the
116

116

00:06:00,220  -->  00:06:01,970
and separate the property and value with
properties within a set of curly braces
117

117

00:06:02,350  -->  00:06:04,000
a colon just as we did in the fxml
and separate the property and value with
118

118

00:06:04,380  -->  00:06:05,900
so let's go ahead and do
a colon just as we did in the fxml
119

119

00:06:06,280  -->  00:06:07,430
that bearing in mind that each properly
so let's go ahead and do
120

120

00:06:07,810  -->  00:06:10,600
assignment in CSS ends with a semicolon
that bearing in mind that each properly
121

121

00:06:10,980  -->  00:06:13,670
so we'll start with...
assignment in CSS ends with a semicolon
122

122

00:06:14,050  -->  00:06:17,030
....
so we'll start with...
123

123

00:06:17,410  -->  00:06:20,500
...
....
124

124

00:06:20,880  -->  00:06:21,820
...
...
125

125

00:06:22,200  -->  00:06:26,000
....
...
126

126

00:06:26,380  -->  00:06:27,940
...
....
127

127

00:06:28,320  -->  00:06:33,650
...
...
128

128

00:06:34,030  -->  00:06:36,070
alright so now we've created the styles
...
129

129

00:06:36,450  -->  00:06:38,960
. CSS file we need to associate that
alright so now we've created the styles
130

130

00:06:39,340  -->  00:06:40,160
file with our application
. CSS file we need to associate that
131

131

00:06:40,540  -->  00:06:42,950
so we do that in the fxml file will come
file with our application
132

132

00:06:43,330  -->  00:06:45,110
back here to our sample .fxml
so we do that in the fxml file will come
133

133

00:06:45,490  -->  00:06:47,120
and clear up some of these imports
back here to our sample .fxml
134

134

00:06:47,500  -->  00:06:49,550
that we added automatically but aren't
and clear up some of these imports
135

135

00:06:49,930  -->  00:06:54,080
being used at the moment
that we added automatically but aren't
136

136

00:06:54,460  -->  00:06:56,930
alright so we do it in the fxml files
being used at the moment
137

137

00:06:57,310  -->  00:06:58,850
as I mentioned using the stylesheet properly
alright so we do it in the fxml files
138

138

00:06:59,230  -->  00:07:01,220
and actually put that up here in our grid
as I mentioned using the stylesheet properly
139

139

00:07:01,600  -->  00:07:02,990
pane so we're going to come down here
and actually put that up here in our grid
140

140

00:07:03,370  -->  00:07:05,900
...
pane so we're going to come down here
141

141

00:07:06,280  -->  00:07:10,100
....
...
142

142

00:07:10,480  -->  00:07:13,100
...
....
143

143

00:07:13,480  -->  00:07:28,160
...
...
144

144

00:07:28,540  -->  00:07:31,640
alright so let's now run the app and
...
145

145

00:07:32,020  -->  00:07:37,070
just make sure that it works now and you
alright so let's now run the app and
146

146

00:07:37,450  -->  00:07:38,570
can see all five buttons have been
just make sure that it works now and you
147

147

00:07:38,950  -->  00:07:41,270
styled based on the how we defined
can see all five buttons have been
148

148

00:07:41,650  -->  00:07:44,690
that in the styles . CSS file so
styled based on the how we defined
149

149

00:07:45,070  -->  00:07:46,340
hopefully getting an idea and seeing how
that in the styles . CSS file so
150

150

00:07:46,720  -->  00:07:49,160
CSS makes it much easier to change the
hopefully getting an idea and seeing how
151

151

00:07:49,540  -->  00:07:50,570
entire appearance of an application
CSS makes it much easier to change the
152

152

00:07:50,950  -->  00:07:52,820
rather than having to manually sort of
entire appearance of an application
153

153

00:07:53,200  -->  00:07:54,350
go through and do each element which
rather than having to manually sort of
154

154

00:07:54,730  -->  00:07:57,470
would be a rather painful exercise and
go through and do each element which
155

155

00:07:57,850  -->  00:07:59,180
turns out in fact that our applications
would be a rather painful exercise and
156

156

00:07:59,560  -->  00:08:01,370
been using CSS behind-the-scenes all
turns out in fact that our applications
157

157

00:08:01,750  -->  00:08:04,460
along and that's because javafx uses a
been using CSS behind-the-scenes all
158

158

00:08:04,840  -->  00:08:07,340
default style sheet to style javafx
along and that's because javafx uses a
159

159

00:08:07,720  -->  00:08:10,040
applications now obviously this is not a
default style sheet to style javafx
160

160

00:08:10,420  -->  00:08:12,070
CSS course I can't go into a lot of
applications now obviously this is not a
161

161

00:08:12,450  -->  00:08:14,480
detail with CSS but you are familiar
CSS course I can't go into a lot of
162

162

00:08:14,860  -->  00:08:16,280
with web development or software like
detail with CSS but you are familiar
163

163

00:08:16,660  -->  00:08:18,560
wordpress you probably know that you
with web development or software like
164

164

00:08:18,940  -->  00:08:20,360
can change the appearance of a website
wordpress you probably know that you
165

165

00:08:20,740  -->  00:08:22,880
by changing its theme sometimes called a
can change the appearance of a website
166

166

00:08:23,260  -->  00:08:26,060
template so a theme is simply a set of CSS
by changing its theme sometimes called a
167

167

00:08:26,440  -->  00:08:29,180
definitions javafx uses themes and the
template so a theme is simply a set of CSS
168

168

00:08:29,560  -->  00:08:32,090
default theme is the medina theme in a
definitions javafx uses themes and the
169

169

00:08:32,470  -->  00:08:33,260
minute we going to see how to change to
default theme is the medina theme in a
170

170

00:08:33,640  -->  00:08:35,660
another theme provided by javafx
minute we going to see how to change to
171

171

00:08:36,040  -->  00:08:38,870
but first looking at to our was sample
another theme provided by javafx
172

172

00:08:39,250  -->  00:08:41,320
.fxml let's consider what we'd
but first looking at to our was sample
173

173

00:08:41,700  -->  00:08:43,040
do if we want button 3 in our
.fxml let's consider what we'd
174

174

00:08:43,420  -->  00:08:44,930
application to have a blue background
do if we want button 3 in our
175

175

00:08:45,310  -->  00:08:47,030
now it's obviously can come down here
application to have a blue background
176

176

00:08:47,410  -->  00:08:48,470
and actually try to make a change to
now it's obviously can come down here
177

177

00:08:48,850  -->  00:08:51,200
that style
and actually try to make a change to
178

178

00:08:51,580  -->  00:08:54,410
and we can put...
that style
179

179

00:08:54,790  -->  00:08:59,600
....
and we can put...
180

180

00:08:59,980  -->  00:09:04,550
...if you run
....
181

181

00:09:04,930  -->  00:09:10,910
that we can see that works the buttons
...if you run
182

182

00:09:11,290  -->  00:09:12,710
button three now got a blue background
that we can see that works the buttons
183

183

00:09:13,090  -->  00:09:15,140
and white text and that's because when
button three now got a blue background
184

184

00:09:15,520  -->  00:09:17,510
the CSS is included in the fxml
and white text and that's because when
185

185

00:09:17,890  -->  00:09:20,060
within a control element or in line in
the CSS is included in the fxml
186

186

00:09:20,440  -->  00:09:22,580
other words it takes precedence over the
within a control element or in line in
187

187

00:09:22,960  -->  00:09:25,370
CSS in the style sheet so in other words
other words it takes precedence over the
188

188

00:09:25,750  -->  00:09:27,590
it overrides the definition in the style
CSS in the style sheet so in other words
189

189

00:09:27,970  -->  00:09:29,840
sheet in a similar way to how the
it overrides the definition in the style
190

190

00:09:30,220  -->  00:09:32,330
overriding a method works in Java as
sheet in a similar way to how the
191

191

00:09:32,710  -->  00:09:35,390
we talk about in the course but with that said
overriding a method works in Java as
192

192

00:09:35,770  -->  00:09:38,330
defining CSS in line generally isn't
we talk about in the course but with that said
193

193

00:09:38,710  -->  00:09:40,910
recommended if we decided to change the
defining CSS in line generally isn't
194

194

00:09:41,290  -->  00:09:43,490
background color of button 3 to yellow
recommended if we decided to change the
195

195

00:09:43,870  -->  00:09:45,200
we then have to change in the fxml file
background color of button 3 to yellow
196

196

00:09:45,580  -->  00:09:47,480
again this would be trivial for small
we then have to change in the fxml file
197

197

00:09:47,860  -->  00:09:49,280
application like this one but in a
again this would be trivial for small
198

198

00:09:49,660  -->  00:09:51,470
larger application we might not actually
application like this one but in a
199

199

00:09:51,850  -->  00:09:53,360
know that the style and the style sheet
larger application we might not actually
200

200

00:09:53,740  -->  00:09:56,390
has been overridden in the fxml file and
know that the style and the style sheet
201

201

00:09:56,770  -->  00:09:58,100
we might try to set the color for button 3
has been overridden in the fxml file and
202

202

00:09:58,480  -->  00:09:59,900
in the style sheet which will see how to
we might try to set the color for button 3
203

203

00:10:00,280  -->  00:10:02,090
do in a minute and wonder why it's not
in the style sheet which will see how to
204

204

00:10:02,470  -->  00:10:04,220
working and also it could be that
do in a minute and wonder why it's not
205

205

00:10:04,600  -->  00:10:06,020
another developer is not familiar with
working and also it could be that
206

206

00:10:06,400  -->  00:10:08,660
the code that has to make the change and
another developer is not familiar with
207

207

00:10:09,040  -->  00:10:09,800
that they would actually look at the
the code that has to make the change and
208

208

00:10:10,180  -->  00:10:11,330
style sheet first
that they would actually look at the
209

209

00:10:11,710  -->  00:10:12,980
so generally again in lining these
style sheet first
210

210

00:10:13,360  -->  00:10:16,130
styles isn't recommended so go back
so generally again in lining these
211

211

00:10:16,510  -->  00:10:18,950
to our sample fxml file instead of
styles isn't recommended so go back
212

212

00:10:19,330  -->  00:10:21,290
styling button 3 in line we can
to our sample fxml file instead of
213

213

00:10:21,670  -->  00:10:23,630
actually do it in the stylesheet now
styling button 3 in line we can
214

214

00:10:24,010  -->  00:10:25,790
this time we won't use a cart class
actually do it in the stylesheet now
215

215

00:10:26,170  -->  00:10:27,920
selector because we don't want every
this time we won't use a cart class
216

216

00:10:28,300  -->  00:10:29,540
button instance in our application to
selector because we don't want every
217

217

00:10:29,920  -->  00:10:31,550
have a blue background instead we can
button instance in our application to
218

218

00:10:31,930  -->  00:10:34,430
use an ID selector so first thing we
have a blue background instead we can
219

219

00:10:34,810  -->  00:10:36,710
need to do is assign an ID to the button
use an ID selector so first thing we
220

220

00:10:37,090  -->  00:10:39,140
this case button three let's go back to
need to do is assign an ID to the button
221

221

00:10:39,520  -->  00:10:41,900
do that so here we're going to put...
this case button three let's go back to
222

222

00:10:42,280  -->  00:10:47,330
...
do that so here we're going to put...
223

223

00:10:47,710  -->  00:10:53,290
...
...
224

224

00:10:53,670  -->  00:10:55,330
...and just a
...
225

225

00:10:55,710  -->  00:10:57,190
note here not we're not assigning the
...and just a
226

226

00:10:57,570  -->  00:10:59,620
fx colon ID which we do when we
note here not we're not assigning the
227

227

00:11:00,000  -->  00:11:01,360
want to reference a control in our
fx colon ID which we do when we
228

228

00:11:01,740  -->  00:11:03,910
control in our controller this is an
want to reference a control in our
229

229

00:11:04,290  -->  00:11:06,220
id which is a different which is
control in our controller this is an
230

230

00:11:06,600  -->  00:11:07,810
different to that completely
id which is a different which is
231

231

00:11:08,190  -->  00:11:09,280
alright and you notice that I also
different to that completely
232

232

00:11:09,660  -->  00:11:11,110
remove the in-line style definition
alright and you notice that I also
233

233

00:11:11,490  -->  00:11:13,810
so next we go back to our styles
remove the in-line style definition
234

234

00:11:14,190  -->  00:11:16,570
. CSS file I'm going to make a change
so next we go back to our styles
235

235

00:11:16,950  -->  00:11:18,460
here instead of it being .
. CSS file I'm going to make a change
236

236

00:11:18,840  -->  00:11:21,070
button I will delete that will make that
here instead of it being .
237

237

00:11:21,450  -->  00:11:25,480
...
button I will delete that will make that
238

238

00:11:25,860  -->  00:11:27,310
everything else actually remains the same other
...
239

239

00:11:27,690  -->  00:11:28,300
than the fact here going to change
everything else actually remains the same other
240

240

00:11:28,680  -->  00:11:33,160
from green to blue now when referring to
than the fact here going to change
241

241

00:11:33,540  -->  00:11:35,260
an id we're using a hash character in case your
from green to blue now when referring to
242

242

00:11:35,640  -->  00:11:36,520
wondering why i have used to hash their
an id we're using a hash character in case your
243

243

00:11:36,900  -->  00:11:39,610
so that relates to the the id that we
wondering why i have used to hash their
244

244

00:11:39,990  -->  00:11:41,620
specified here so the style sheet would
so that relates to the the id that we
245

245

00:11:42,000  -->  00:11:43,330
know which basically which control this
specified here so the style sheet would
246

246

00:11:43,710  -->  00:11:45,490
case to override alright so let's
know which basically which control this
247

247

00:11:45,870  -->  00:11:51,430
actually try running that and we can see
case to override alright so let's
248

248

00:11:51,810  -->  00:11:52,930
now that the button 3 has got a
actually try running that and we can see
249

249

00:11:53,310  -->  00:11:55,960
blue background and better that is still
now that the button 3 has got a
250

250

00:11:56,340  -->  00:11:57,790
an all-out styling is in a style sheet
blue background and better that is still
251

251

00:11:58,170  -->  00:11:59,590
and that's going to make changing the
an all-out styling is in a style sheet
252

252

00:11:59,970  -->  00:12:00,820
style is much easier in the future
and that's going to make changing the
253

253

00:12:01,200  -->  00:12:02,680
because we go straight to the styles
style is much easier in the future
254

254

00:12:03,060  -->  00:12:05,320
. CSS file for making our changes
because we go straight to the styles
255

255

00:12:05,700  -->  00:12:07,990
alright so that's the basics of styling
. CSS file for making our changes
256

256

00:12:08,370  -->  00:12:10,900
our application using CSS now we can also
alright so that's the basics of styling
257

257

00:12:11,280  -->  00:12:13,540
style controls within the java code by
our application using CSS now we can also
258

258

00:12:13,920  -->  00:12:15,640
calling the appropriate methods using
style controls within the java code by
259

259

00:12:16,020  -->  00:12:17,740
the instances we want to style but i'll
calling the appropriate methods using
260

260

00:12:18,120  -->  00:12:19,210
leave that as an exercise for you
the instances we want to style but i'll
261

261

00:12:19,590  -->  00:12:20,980
because generally speaking you probably
leave that as an exercise for you
262

262

00:12:21,360  -->  00:12:22,390
don't want to do that very often
because generally speaking you probably
263

263

00:12:22,770  -->  00:12:24,580
now to find out what selectors to use
don't want to do that very often
264

264

00:12:24,960  -->  00:12:26,920
when styling java fx controls check
now to find out what selectors to use
265

265

00:12:27,300  -->  00:12:30,040
the javafx ccs says documentation and
when styling java fx controls check
266

266

00:12:30,420  -->  00:12:32,320
i'm just going to copy link and i'm
the javafx ccs says documentation and
267

267

00:12:32,700  -->  00:12:33,790
going to just open it up so you can take
i'm just going to copy link and i'm
268

00:12:34,170  -->  00:12:35,230
a look at that at your leisure
going to just open it up so you can take
269

there's a lot of information you can
272

272

00:12:47,350  -->  00:12:49,490
javafx controls on this page so i
find out about CSS how it relates to
273

273

00:12:49,870  -->  00:12:52,460
suggest you check it out and looking
javafx controls on this page so i
274

274

00:12:52,840  -->  00:12:53,900
through here to spend a bit of time
suggest you check it out and looking
275

275

00:12:54,280  -->  00:12:55,580
through there you'll actually find out
through here to spend a bit of time
276

276

00:12:55,960  -->  00:12:57,890
that you can also style layouts and other
through there you'll actually find out
277

277

00:12:58,270  -->  00:13:00,350
javafx elements but there's actually
that you can also style layouts and other
278

278

00:13:00,730  -->  00:13:01,850
advanced features which you won't be
javafx elements but there's actually
279

279

00:13:02,230  -->  00:13:04,460
going into this section now before we
advanced features which you won't be
280

280

00:13:04,840  -->  00:13:06,260
leave see css though let's go back
going into this section now before we
281

281

00:13:06,640  -->  00:13:10,370
to our code and change the appearance by
leave see css though let's go back
282

282

00:13:10,750  -->  00:13:11,900
changing the theme and what I'll do you saw all
to our code and change the appearance by
283

283

00:13:12,280  -->  00:13:13,310
those programs are running their so
changing the theme and what I'll do you saw all
284

284

00:13:13,690  -->  00:13:18,620
stop some of those probably should close
those programs are running their so
285

285

00:13:19,000  -->  00:13:19,880
this down before
stop some of those probably should close
286

286

00:13:20,260  -->  00:13:30,050
ok so how do we do this how do we change the
this down before
287

287

00:13:30,430  -->  00:13:32,840
appearance of our application by changing
ok so how do we do this how do we change the
288

288

00:13:33,220  -->  00:13:36,080
the entire theme now I mentioned theirs
appearance of our application by changing
289

289

00:13:36,460  -->  00:13:37,670
a medina is the default theme use
the entire theme now I mentioned theirs
290

290

00:13:38,050  -->  00:13:40,280
by javafx but we can also use the
a medina is the default theme use
291

291

00:13:40,660  -->  00:13:42,350
Caspian theme that's provided also by
by javafx but we can also use the
292

292

00:13:42,730  -->  00:13:44,870
javafx and to do that we actually go
Caspian theme that's provided also by
293

293

00:13:45,250  -->  00:13:47,870
back to our main start up here and what
javafx and to do that we actually go
294

294

00:13:48,250  -->  00:13:51,380
we need to do is use the set user agent
back to our main start up here and what
295

295

00:13:51,760  -->  00:13:53,840
stylesheet method to actually
we need to do is use the set user agent
296

296

00:13:54,220  -->  00:13:56,270
activate this particular style sheet we
stylesheet method to actually
297

297

00:13:56,650  -->  00:13:57,650
want to do that right under this parent
activate this particular style sheet we
298

298

00:13:58,030  -->  00:14:01,820
root so we would type...
want to do that right under this parent
299

299

00:14:02,200  -->  00:14:04,040
...
root so we would type...
300

300

00:14:04,420  -->  00:14:14,240
...
...
301

301

00:14:14,620  -->  00:14:16,730
alright so let's actually run this but
...
302

302

00:14:17,110  -->  00:14:19,370
bearing in mind that the changes when
alright so let's actually run this but
303

303

00:14:19,750  -->  00:14:21,710
we run it is going to be very subtle because the
bearing in mind that the changes when
304

304

00:14:22,090  -->  00:14:23,930
interface is actually so simple at this stage
we run it is going to be very subtle because the
305

305

00:14:24,310  -->  00:14:26,480
so you can see there that i'm not sure
interface is actually so simple at this stage
306

306

00:14:26,860  -->  00:14:28,460
you've noticed but size it up
so you can see there that i'm not sure
307

307

00:14:28,840  -->  00:14:31,040
a little bit but the button corners
you've noticed but size it up
308

308

00:14:31,420  -->  00:14:32,780
are more rounded when we use the Caspian
a little bit but the button corners
309

309

00:14:33,160  -->  00:14:34,850
theme then when we used the medina theme
are more rounded when we use the Caspian
310

310

00:14:35,230  -->  00:14:37,310
so let's just try adding a radio button
theme then when we used the medina theme
311

311

00:14:37,690  -->  00:14:40,160
to our layout in the second row so we can
so let's just try adding a radio button
312

312

00:14:40,540  -->  00:14:41,750
maybe get a better idea what this is
to our layout in the second row so we can
313

313

00:14:42,130  -->  00:14:45,230
going to look like going back to our
maybe get a better idea what this is
314

314

00:14:45,610  -->  00:14:48,680
samples and we'll add the radio button
going to look like going back to our
315

315

00:14:49,060  -->  00:14:53,420
on the next line the next row so text
samples and we'll add the radio button
316

316

00:14:53,800  -->  00:14:54,710
here
on the next line the next row so text
317

317

00:14:55,090  -->  00:14:59,920
...
here
318

318

00:15:00,300  -->  00:15:07,180
...
...
319

319

00:15:07,560  -->  00:15:09,980
...so let's have a look and
...
320

320

00:15:10,360  -->  00:15:15,170
see what that looks like
...so let's have a look and
321

321

00:15:15,550  -->  00:15:16,700
alright so that shows you again what
see what that looks like
322

322

00:15:17,080  -->  00:15:19,850
this caspian theme or style
alright so that shows you again what
323

323

00:15:20,230  -->  00:15:22,480
sheet looks like what we do
this caspian theme or style
324

324

00:15:22,860  -->  00:15:24,490
we'll run this again but i'll actually
sheet looks like what we do
325

325

00:15:24,870  -->  00:15:26,090
leave that running so we can actually
we'll run this again but i'll actually
326

326

00:15:26,470  -->  00:15:28,300
compare the two themes and come back
leave that running so we can actually
327

327

00:15:28,680  -->  00:15:31,220
here and actually comment out the setting
compare the two themes and come back
328

328

00:15:31,600  -->  00:15:33,530
so we can see what they both look like so we
here and actually comment out the setting
329

329

00:15:33,910  -->  00:15:42,260
run that again
so we can see what they both look like so we
330

330

00:15:42,640  -->  00:15:44,980
ok now we've got the two side by side so
run that again
331

331

00:15:45,360  -->  00:15:46,100
you can see that there is a difference
ok now we've got the two side by side so
332

332

00:15:46,480  -->  00:15:48,110
that in also in the background color
you can see that there is a difference
333

333

00:15:48,490  -->  00:15:49,910
which may be different if you're running
that in also in the background color
334

334

00:15:50,290  -->  00:15:51,830
on windows or linux compared to me
which may be different if you're running
335

335

00:15:52,210  -->  00:15:53,900
running on the mac but definitely you
on windows or linux compared to me
336

336

00:15:54,280  -->  00:15:55,610
can see the buttons certainly on this
running on the mac but definitely you
337

337

00:15:55,990  -->  00:15:57,290
side here over here with the Caspian style sheet
can see the buttons certainly on this
338

338

00:15:57,670  -->  00:16:00,890
they're much more rounded so
side here over here with the Caspian style sheet
339

339

00:16:01,270  -->  00:16:03,890
close it down we go back to the code
they're much more rounded so
340

340

00:16:04,270  -->  00:16:07,100
again you might be asking why we setting
close it down we go back to the code
341

341

00:16:07,480  -->  00:16:08,680
the style sheet through code rather than
again you might be asking why we setting
342

342

00:16:09,060  -->  00:16:10,700
associating it with our
the style sheet through code rather than
343

343

00:16:11,080  -->  00:16:12,800
application in the fxml file
associating it with our
344

344

00:16:13,180  -->  00:16:14,210
well in this particular case we're
application in the fxml file
345

345

00:16:14,590  -->  00:16:15,710
setting the theme for the entire
well in this particular case we're
346

346

00:16:16,090  -->  00:16:18,530
application so the theme stylesheet will
setting the theme for the entire
347

347

00:16:18,910  -->  00:16:20,390
apply to every window and dialogue in
application so the theme stylesheet will
348

348

00:16:20,770  -->  00:16:22,850
control without having to specifically
apply to every window and dialogue in
349

349

00:16:23,230  -->  00:16:25,670
add it to every fxml file so we can
control without having to specifically
350

350

00:16:26,050  -->  00:16:28,400
override the themes style definitions by
add it to every fxml file so we can
351

351

00:16:28,780  -->  00:16:31,130
adding stylesheets to fxml file or
override the themes style definitions by
352
