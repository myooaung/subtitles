00:00:05.010  -->  00:00:08.430
alright so as I mentioned at the end of
the last video we finish the
2

2

00:00:08.430  -->  00:00:12.180
introduction to databases in the sql
language and what we're going to start
3

3

00:00:12.180  -->  00:00:17.820
working on the next video is how we can
use sql lite in java programs but
4

4

00:00:17.820  -->  00:00:21.720
before we actually get to that video
let's get through into a few more things
5

5

00:00:21.720  -->  00:00:25.770
we're going to start with backing up the
database again I'm going to type....
6

6

00:00:25.770  -->  00:00:34.170
.....so what I suggest you do
7

7

00:00:34.170  -->  00:00:38.390
now is experiment with the commands that
we've used to search for different
8

8

00:00:38.390  -->  00:00:43.130
groups of records from the three tables
and also try creating queries that use
9

9

00:00:43.130  -->  00:00:48.050
joins as well as they already joined view
that we created and actually there's not
10

10

00:00:48.050  -->  00:00:51.650
much point showing you how to back up the
database if I don't show you how to get
11

11

00:00:51.650  -->  00:00:55.220
back should you need to I know we have
restored it previously but we're going
12

12

00:00:55.220  -->  00:01:00.030
to restore this music one now database is
restored from the backup as you saw
13

13

00:01:00.030  -->  00:01:04.640
using the .restore command but if we
restore right now you have no real
14

14

00:01:04.640  -->  00:01:09.000
indication that it worked so let's
actually trash some songs first so that
15

15

00:01:09.000  -->  00:01:13.680
we can confirm that now most of the
album's have fewer than 50 tracks so we
16

16

00:01:13.680  -->  00:01:17.850
can delete all songs whos track number is
less than 50 and that should leave us
17

17

00:01:17.850  -->  00:01:21.360
with very few records so let's go ahead
and do that i'm going to type....
18

18

00:01:21.360  -->  00:01:33.720
....
19

19

00:01:33.720  -->  00:01:37.620
....obviously we've got too much smaller
list than what we had before and in
20

20

00:01:37.620  -->  00:01:42.960
fact we're left with songs from only two
albums and that is easy to see if we use
21

21

00:01:42.960  -->  00:01:49.110
the view so if you look at the views so....
22

22

00:01:49.110  -->  00:01:55.110
...you can see they're clearly there's
only two now as you saw for the
23

23

00:01:55.110  -->  00:01:59.010
condition in the where clause you can
use less than greater than less than or
24

24

00:01:59.010  -->  00:02:01.970
equal to and so on just like
you'd expect
25

25

00:02:01.970  -->  00:02:06.690
now sql uses less than or greater than
or not equal to which makes
26

26

00:02:06.690  -->  00:02:12.030
sense when you read it and avoid having
to introduce another symbol other than
27

27

00:02:12.030  -->  00:02:16.310
that the comparison operators are the
same you'd normally expect in Java so we
28

28

00:02:16.310  -->  00:02:18.150
can drop a song from the list
29

29

00:02:18.150  -->  00:02:22.860
only selecting songs with a track number
not equal to 71 so we could do that with
30

30

00:02:22.860  -->  00:02:35.180
select....so you can see at that point
31

31

00:02:35.180  -->  00:02:39.390
now recycled vinyl blues which was
showing in the previous list is now no
32

32

00:02:39.390  -->  00:02:43.890
longer showing now the other thing you
can do which we haven't talked about is
33

33

00:02:43.890  -->  00:02:47.700
you can include functions in the Select
statement now i'm not going to go into a
34

34

00:02:47.700  -->  00:02:51.750
range of functions available but one
useful one is count so you can do....
35

35

00:02:51.750  -->  00:03:12.560
....
36

36

00:03:12.560  -->  00:03:19.430
....you can see we've got
24 entries for songs 439
37

37

00:03:19.430  -->  00:03:22.680
records for albums and 202 for artists
38

38

00:03:23.570  -->  00:03:28.040
alright so let's now restore the database
and actually see how many records you've
39

39

00:03:28.040  -->  00:03:36.150
got back so do . restore music back up 2
remember there's no semicolon because
40

40

00:03:36.150  -->  00:03:40.880
it's a sql lite command because it
starts with the . let's do the
41

41

00:03:40.880  -->  00:03:48.620
equivalent commands now the select....
42

42

00:03:48.620  -->  00:04:04.070
....
43

43

00:04:04.070  -->  00:04:09.230
....so clearly
44

44

00:04:09.230  -->  00:04:13.310
the restore worked alright so let's
finish this video now with a challenge
45

45

00:04:13.310  -->  00:04:16.310
for you to help get you started
46

46

00:04:18.440  -->  00:04:20.980
so I got a number of things for
you too
47

47

00:04:20.980  -->  00:04:25.940
come up with the sql commands to
return these the results that I'm asking
48

48

00:04:25.940  -->  00:04:31.190
for so first one here number one select
the titles of all the songs on the album
49

49

00:04:31.190  -->  00:04:37.130
forbidden and second one repeat the
previous query but this time display the
50

50

00:04:37.130  -->  00:04:41.240
songs in track order now you may want to
include the track number in the output
51

51

00:04:41.240  -->  00:04:45.500
to verify that it worked okay number
three display all songs for the band
52

52

00:04:45.500  -->  00:04:51.800
deep purple number 4 rename the band
mehitable to one kitten hope I pronounce
53

53

00:04:51.800  -->  00:04:56.300
that right and note that this is an
exception to the advice to always fully
54

54

00:04:56.300  -->  00:05:01.090
qualify your column names set space
artist.name won't work
55

55

00:05:01.090  -->  00:05:04.430
you just need to specify name and you'll
see that when you give that a go
56

56

00:05:04.970  -->  00:05:08.330
number five check that the record was
correctly renamed that you did in part
57

57

00:05:08.330  -->  00:05:10.690
four
58

58

00:05:10.690  -->  00:05:16.030
continuing on number six select the
title of all the songs by aerosmith in
59

59

00:05:16.030  -->  00:05:21.880
alphabetical order include only the
title in the output number 7 replace the
60

60

00:05:21.880  -->  00:05:26.470
column that you used in the previous
answer with count title in parentheses
61

61

00:05:26.470  -->  00:05:31.090
to get just a count of the number of the
songs number of songs number 8
62

62

00:05:31.090  -->  00:05:35.150
search the internet to find out how to
get a list of the songs from step 6
63

63

00:05:35.150  -->  00:05:38.440
without any duplicates number 9
64

64

00:05:38.440  -->  00:05:42.520
search the internet again this time to
find out how to get a count of the songs
65

65

00:05:42.520  -->  00:05:47.150
without duplicates and hint it uses the
same keyword as step 8
66

66

00:05:47.150  -->  00:05:52.900
but the syntax may not be obvious and
number ten repeat the previous query to
67

67

00:05:52.900  -->  00:05:56.530
find the number of artists which
obviously should be one and the number
68

68

00:05:56.530  -->  00:06:00.680
of albums so that's it that's your
challenge 10 things for you to have
69

69

00:06:00.680  -->  00:06:04.990
a go at so pause the video and
go away and see if you can figure those out and
70

70

00:06:04.990  -->  00:06:08.210
when you're ready to see me come up with
the answers start the video again so
71

71

00:06:08.210  -->  00:06:15.490
pause the video now and i'll see you
when you get back alright so how did you go
72

72

00:06:15.490  -->  00:06:17.270
hopefully you managed to figure it out
73

73

00:06:17.270  -->  00:06:22.460
let's have a go so start the first one
and if you recall the first
74

74

00:06:22.460  -->  00:06:28.060
challenge was select the titles of all
the songs on the album forbidden to do
75

75

00:06:28.060  -->  00:06:39.340
that we do.....
76

76

00:06:39.340  -->  00:06:50.380
....
77

77

00:06:50.380  -->  00:06:58.210
alright so that's all the title from
the album forbidden number two was to
78

78

00:06:58.210  -->  00:07:03.250
repeat the previous query but this time
display the songs in track order and you
79

79

00:07:03.250  -->  00:07:07.060
may want to include the track number in
the output to verify that work ok so
80

80

00:07:07.060  -->  00:07:13.490
let's type that up....
81

81

00:07:13.490  -->  00:07:16.900
.....
82

82

00:07:18.450  -->  00:07:33.150
.....
83

83

00:07:33.150  -->  00:07:44.850
...so we got the equivalent to the previous query
84

84

00:07:44.850  -->  00:07:48.180
but this time sorted in track order and
you can see we've got the track order on the
85

85

00:07:48.180  -->  00:07:52.620
screen they're verifying that worked all
right number three display all songs for
86

86

00:07:52.620  -->  00:08:02.460
the band deep purple alright so....
87

87

00:08:02.460  -->  00:08:41.190
....
88

88

00:08:41.190  -->  00:08:45.930
....you can see we've got
89

89

00:08:45.930  -->  00:08:48.480
quite a few entries there for deep
purple
90

90

00:08:48.480  -->  00:08:52.230
alternatively also you could have used
the artists_list view that
91

91

00:08:52.230  -->  00:08:55.290
would have been acceptable as well so
that would have been much easier
92

92

00:08:55.290  -->  00:09:04.170
actually just select....
93

93

00:09:04.170  -->  00:09:12.300
....
94

94

00:09:12.300  -->  00:09:17.550
alright continuing on now number 4 we want
to rename the band mehitable
95

95

00:09:17.550  -->  00:09:22.290
to one kitten and
this was the one where I mention that there was
96

96

00:09:22.290  -->  00:09:25.860
an exception to the advice to always
fully qualify your column
97

97

00:09:25.860  -->  00:09:29.310
names because set artist.name
won't work
98

98

00:09:29.310  -->  00:09:31.320
you just need to specify name in this
scenario
99

99

00:09:31.320  -->  00:09:43.530
so to do that we do update.....
100

100

00:09:43.530  -->  00:09:54.600
....
101

101

00:09:54.600  -->  00:09:58.200
......so now we can confirm that
confirm the update working in otherword
102

102

00:09:58.200  -->  00:10:10.350
select star.....and we can now
103

103

00:10:10.350  -->  00:10:14.640
see that we've got an entry for that so
that worked okay and checking it was ok
104

104

00:10:14.640  -->  00:10:18.090
the records correctly rename which was actually
challenge 5 just to be clear
105

105

00:10:18.090  -->  00:10:22.410
alright so that's one we've just done
so moving on now number 6 we have to
106

106

00:10:22.410  -->  00:10:26.730
select the titles of all the songs
by aerosmith in alphabetical order
107

107

00:10:26.730  -->  00:10:31.530
including only the title in the output
that's actually quite simple one so....
108

108

00:10:31.530  -->  00:10:42.450
....
109

109

00:10:42.450  -->  00:10:47.910
.....
110

110

00:10:47.910  -->  00:10:54.540
....alright the next one we want is you
want to replace the column that you used
111

111

00:10:54.540  -->  00:10:58.920
in the previous answer with count title
to get just a count of the number of the
112

112

00:10:58.920  -->  00:11:04.680
songs instead of the actual titles that
would be....
113

113

00:11:04.680  -->  00:11:16.350
.....we should
114

114

00:11:16.850  -->  00:11:22.640
get the answer 151 their 151 as you can see now note that
115

115

00:11:22.640  -->  00:11:26.780
the in this particular case the order by
Clause is redundant here because we're
116

116

00:11:26.780  -->  00:11:28.370
doing a count we don't need that
117

117

00:11:28.370  -->  00:11:30.680
however living in there won't caused the
problems so if you have left it in there
118

118

00:11:30.680  -->  00:11:31.430
that's fine
119

119

00:11:31.430  -->  00:11:34.820
alright next we're going to a couple of
the ones that require a bit of research
120

120

00:11:34.820  -->  00:11:38.870
number 8 search the internet to
find out how to get a list of the songs
121

121

00:11:38.870  -->  00:11:44.120
from step 6 without any duplicates
hopefully managed to find that so to do
122

122

00:11:44.120  -->  00:11:45.440
that the command is select....
123

123

00:11:45.440  -->  00:11:56.540
.....
124

124

00:11:56.540  -->  00:12:07.010
....and you can see theirs no longer duplicates their
125

125

00:12:07.010  -->  00:12:10.350
number 9 search the internet again to find out
how to get a count of the songs without
126

126

00:12:10.350  -->  00:12:15.320
duplicates and hint that i gave you was
it uses the same keyword as step 8
127

127

00:12:15.320  -->  00:12:22.070
but the syntax may not be obvious so to
do that one.....
128

128

00:12:22.070  -->  00:12:29.690
....
129

129

00:12:29.690  -->  00:12:42.740
.....
130

130

00:12:42.740  -->  00:12:46.190
....
131

131

00:12:46.190  -->  00:12:55.250
.....because we're going on
132

132

00:12:55.250  -->  00:13:02.630
the actual song title that's from
artists_list where....
133

133

00:13:02.630  -->  00:13:07.310
....o that should actually give
us the same count before and 128 that's
134

134

00:13:07.310  -->  00:13:07.980
better
135

135

00:13:07.980  -->  00:13:12.050
alright so that was number nine and
the last one was to repeat the previous
136

136

00:13:12.050  -->  00:13:15.620
query to find the number of artists
which obviously should be one and the
137

137

00:13:15.620  -->  00:13:19.130
number of albums so the first one
already type up there so we're just
138

138

00:13:19.130  -->  00:13:22.430
going to copy and pasting again this is
the one that I accidentally typed in the
139

139

00:13:22.430  -->  00:13:23.240
wrong place
140

140

00:13:23.240  -->  00:13:27.800
so that's going to give us the paste it
in that's going to give us the number of
141

141

00:13:27.800  -->  00:13:31.280
artists which obviously in this case
should be 1 because we got our where
142

142

00:13:31.280  -->  00:13:36.860
clause that is looking for aerosmith you can
see that returns 1 then the last one the
