00:00:04.490  -->  00:00:06.980
In this video, we're going to see how to
2

2

00:00:06.980  -->  00:00:09.620
use diffmerge with sort code from this
3

3

00:00:09.620  -->  00:00:12.379
course. So specifically we're going to
4

4

00:00:12.379  -->  00:00:14.720
learn how to compare your code against
5

5

00:00:14.720  -->  00:00:17.450
other code using diffmerge and then as a
6

6

00:00:17.450  -->  00:00:19.730
result find common errors like typos and
7

7

00:00:19.730  -->  00:00:21.980
also go through the process of fixing
8

8

00:00:21.980  -->  00:00:25.000
those, so let's swing over to IntelliJ.
9

9

00:00:25.000  -->  00:00:28.669
Now I've opened the methods project this
10

10

00:00:28.669  -->  00:00:30.800
is the one we worked on now fairly
11

11

00:00:30.800  -->  00:00:33.530
recently, in fact we worked on this we
12

12

00:00:33.530  -->  00:00:35.899
put the final changes if you recall the
13

13

00:00:35.899  -->  00:00:38.690
final changes to the methods challenge
14

14

00:00:38.690  -->  00:00:41.570
and we made fixed another bug and I also
15

15

00:00:41.570  -->  00:00:44.300
showed you an alternate way to code the
16

16

00:00:44.300  -->  00:00:45.920
calculated high score position method
17

17

00:00:45.920  -->  00:00:48.500
and so I've got that project open so
18

18

00:00:48.500  -->  00:00:51.079
what you'll need to do is download that
19

19

00:00:51.079  -->  00:00:53.210
and be happy and have that version of
20

20

00:00:53.210  -->  00:00:56.089
the code available and just to confirm
21

21

00:00:56.089  -->  00:00:57.859
you got to run this to make sure that it
22

22

00:00:57.859  -->  00:01:01.550
works you can see that was the output
23

23

00:01:01.550  -->  00:01:03.679
that we saw previously so that's working
24

24

00:01:03.679  -->  00:01:05.840
nicely. Now what we're going to do is
25

25

00:01:05.840  -->  00:01:08.030
introduce an error here so that we can
26

26

00:01:08.030  -->  00:01:10.070
then compare the code using the diff
27

27

00:01:10.070  -->  00:01:12.229
merge tool, so what I'm going to do is
28

28

00:01:12.229  -->  00:01:14.420
put in what is a relatively common error
29

29

00:01:14.420  -->  00:01:17.780
so get down here to this line here on
30

30

00:01:17.780  -->  00:01:19.909
line 82 I'm going to put a semicolon
31

31

00:01:19.909  -->  00:01:23.570
after the right parenthesis, you'll
32

32

00:01:23.570  -->  00:01:25.009
notice when I do that the code is still
33

33

00:01:25.009  -->  00:01:27.200
valid and this is something that someone
34

34

00:01:27.200  -->  00:01:29.540
new to programming may often do because
35

35

00:01:29.540  -->  00:01:31.520
an if statement doesn't have a semicolon
36

36

00:01:31.520  -->  00:01:33.590
that's the bottom line there, so by doing
37

37

00:01:33.590  -->  00:01:35.899
that what we've done is we've actually
38

38

00:01:35.899  -->  00:01:38.090
change the code and as you can see
39

39

00:01:38.090  -->  00:01:39.680
there's no compilation errors and we'll
40

40

00:01:39.680  -->  00:01:41.750
still be able to run this and it's a
41

41

00:01:41.750  -->  00:01:43.610
small error it's literally only one
42

42

00:01:43.610  -->  00:01:46.280
character a semicolon and it's hard to
43

43

00:01:46.280  -->  00:01:48.320
notice if you're not careful enough so
44

44

00:01:48.320  -->  00:01:51.259
that means that the last else now is
45

45

00:01:51.259  -->  00:01:53.509
basically an empty statement this is the
46

46

00:01:53.509  -->  00:01:55.219
one down here so the code for that last
47

47

00:01:55.219  -->  00:01:58.159
else position equals three on line there
48

48

00:01:58.159  -->  00:02:01.460
83 so that's going to always execute so
49

49

00:02:01.460  -->  00:02:03.109
in other words that one simple change
50

50

00:02:03.109  -->  00:02:05.600
this method will now always return
51

51

00:02:05.600  -->  00:02:07.789
position three, so just to confirm that
52

52

00:02:07.789  -->  00:02:12.170
we'll run it and you can see now clearly
53

53

00:02:12.170  -->  00:02:13.340
we've got a different result we've got
54

54

00:02:13.340  -->  00:02:15.740
all the results coming back as position 3.
55

55

00:02:15.740  -->  00:02:18.230
So we've introduced a bug into
56

56

00:02:18.230  -->  00:02:20.420
the source-code, so what we're going to
57

57

00:02:20.420  -->  00:02:23.420
do now is get another copy of that
58

58

00:02:23.420  -->  00:02:25.280
source code that hasn't got the error
59

59

00:02:25.280  -->  00:02:27.110
and what I've done is I've attached the
60

60

00:02:27.110  -->  00:02:30.110
source code to this video, so you can use
61

61

00:02:30.110  -->  00:02:32.690
that and download this source code and
62

62

00:02:32.690  -->  00:02:35.030
open it up and make this change but then
63

63

00:02:35.030  -->  00:02:37.430
we need a second copy of the source code
64

64

00:02:37.430  -->  00:02:39.890
so that we can use up for comparison and
65

65

00:02:39.890  -->  00:02:42.049
obviously the second copy that we
66

66

00:02:42.049  -->  00:02:43.970
download shouldn't have the error
67

67

00:02:43.970  -->  00:02:45.170
because what we're trying to do is
68

68

00:02:45.170  -->  00:02:47.269
compare the version of the code that
69

69

00:02:47.269  -->  00:02:48.950
works against the copy that doesn't work.
70

70

00:02:48.950  -->  00:02:51.230
Now I've already done that I'm not going
71

71

00:02:51.230  -->  00:02:52.610
to go through the process of unzipping
72

72

00:02:52.610  -->  00:02:53.959
it because I'm sure you're familiar
73

73

00:02:53.959  -->  00:02:55.700
enough with zips to do that now
74

74

00:02:55.700  -->  00:02:57.739
basically you just want to unzip it into
75

75

00:02:57.739  -->  00:02:59.390
a folder I'm going to show you what I've
76

76

00:02:59.390  -->  00:03:04.940
done, so we look like now my desktop I've
77

77

00:03:04.940  -->  00:03:06.680
got the code that we've just made a
78

78

00:03:06.680  -->  00:03:09.260
change to in this folder and the other
79

79

00:03:09.260  -->  00:03:11.329
one there's a folder called original so
80

80

00:03:11.329  -->  00:03:13.280
button zip the files there and that's
81

81

00:03:13.280  -->  00:03:15.200
the version that doesn't have any errors
82

82

00:03:15.200  -->  00:03:16.849
and what we're going to do is we're
83

83

00:03:16.849  -->  00:03:18.440
going to compare the two projects and
84

84

00:03:18.440  -->  00:03:19.549
I'm going to show you how you can find
85

85

00:03:19.549  -->  00:03:21.639
errors. Alright, so back to IntelliJ
86

86

00:03:21.639  -->  00:03:23.989
then we need to start the program that
87

87

00:03:23.989  -->  00:03:25.459
will install previously called diff
88

88

00:03:25.459  -->  00:03:29.389
merge, so on a Mac what I can do is I can
89

89

00:03:29.389  -->  00:03:31.040
just press command space and type in
90

90

00:03:31.040  -->  00:03:32.930
diffmerge so you'll start that up
91

91

00:03:32.930  -->  00:03:35.000
on your operating system with Windows or
92

92

00:03:35.000  -->  00:03:37.280
Linux the way you'd normally start but
93

93

00:03:37.280  -->  00:03:38.419
I'm starting up diffmerge and you
94

94

00:03:38.419  -->  00:03:39.680
can see that's now loaded up on the
95

95

00:03:39.680  -->  00:03:42.049
screen. Now with this tool, we can compare
96

96

00:03:42.049  -->  00:03:44.000
folders and we can also compare
97

97

00:03:44.000  -->  00:03:46.639
individual files. Now some projects in
98

98

00:03:46.639  -->  00:03:48.230
this course as we move forward will
99

99

00:03:48.230  -->  00:03:50.810
contain multiple files so it's easier to
100

100

00:03:50.810  -->  00:03:52.130
get into the habit of the comparing
101

101

00:03:52.130  -->  00:03:54.019
folders, so what we're going to do now
102

102

00:03:54.019  -->  00:03:55.639
that we've loaded diffmerge is click on
103

103

00:03:55.639  -->  00:03:58.519
this first icon here and that's the icon
104

104

00:03:58.519  -->  00:04:00.859
to open a folder window and this will
105

105

00:04:00.859  -->  00:04:02.900
look very very similar irrespective of
106

106

00:04:02.900  -->  00:04:04.310
your operating system, so I click on that.
107

107

00:04:04.310  -->  00:04:06.230
Now what I've got here is I've already
108

108

00:04:06.230  -->  00:04:08.239
entered the details but you'd normally
109

109

00:04:08.239  -->  00:04:11.000
click on browse and you'd never get to
110

110

00:04:11.000  -->  00:04:13.220
the folder that contains the downloaded
111

111

00:04:13.220  -->  00:04:15.680
copy of the source code from the course,
112

112

00:04:15.680  -->  00:04:17.930
so in other words if you had a project
113

113

00:04:17.930  -->  00:04:19.789
that you were working on and you found
114

114

00:04:19.789  -->  00:04:21.349
that you weren't able to get it to work
115

115

00:04:21.349  -->  00:04:24.470
how I got it to work in the video, then
116

116

00:04:24.470  -->  00:04:26.510
you would download the version from the
117

117

00:04:26.510  -->  00:04:27.979
resources section of whichever video you
118

118

00:04:27.979  -->  00:04:30.080
want to check and you unzip it and put
119

119

00:04:30.080  -->  00:04:32.200
it somewhere in my case I've actually put
120

120

00:04:32.200  -->  00:04:34.210
in a folder called original just so that
121

121

00:04:34.210  -->  00:04:36.370
I know that that's the original code so
122

122

00:04:36.370  -->  00:04:39.010
I've selected that with browse and on
123

123

00:04:39.010  -->  00:04:40.510
the right hand side the right folder
124

124

00:04:40.510  -->  00:04:42.820
that would be your code in this case
125

125

00:04:42.820  -->  00:04:44.140
that's the code that we've got in
126

126

00:04:44.140  -->  00:04:46.240
IntelliJ and we're going to compare the
127

127

00:04:46.240  -->  00:04:48.400
two, so I can click on browse and select
128

128

00:04:48.400  -->  00:04:50.350
that again but we can see that we've
129

129

00:04:50.350  -->  00:04:51.850
actually got two different versions of
130

130

00:04:51.850  -->  00:04:54.280
the code showing now. Once I do that I
131

131

00:04:54.280  -->  00:04:57.820
can click ok and you can see what's
132

132

00:04:57.820  -->  00:04:59.710
happened when I've done that, we've now
133

133

00:04:59.710  -->  00:05:02.500
got two selected folders and once we
134

134

00:05:02.500  -->  00:05:04.570
selected those folders, we can see on the
135

135

00:05:04.570  -->  00:05:05.860
left hand side and the right hand side
136

136

00:05:05.860  -->  00:05:08.110
we're getting some information about the
137

137

00:05:08.110  -->  00:05:10.210
fact that things are different here so
138

138

00:05:10.210  -->  00:05:12.640
the diffmerge tool has compared the
139

139

00:05:12.640  -->  00:05:15.130
two folders and what it will do by
140

140

00:05:15.130  -->  00:05:17.890
default it will only show files that are
141

141

00:05:17.890  -->  00:05:19.420
different, so if you have done something
142

142

00:05:19.420  -->  00:05:21.400
identical to what I've done then it
143

143

00:05:21.400  -->  00:05:23.290
won't come up in here at all but in this
144

144

00:05:23.290  -->  00:05:25.660
case the file that we're looking at we
145

145

00:05:25.660  -->  00:05:27.790
want to look at is main dot Java because
146

146

00:05:27.790  -->  00:05:29.350
that's the code that's got the file
147

147

00:05:29.350  -->  00:05:30.970
rather that's got the code that we want
148

148

00:05:30.970  -->  00:05:33.520
to check against and we've also got the
149

149

00:05:33.520  -->  00:05:36.370
IntelliJ dot IDEA folder and I'll show you
150

150

00:05:36.370  -->  00:05:38.410
later in this video how to remove that
151

151

00:05:38.410  -->  00:05:40.570
and we've also got these class files
152

152

00:05:40.570  -->  00:05:42.280
which you wouldn't normally want to
153

153

00:05:42.280  -->  00:05:43.960
check because if you tried to check
154

154

00:05:43.960  -->  00:05:45.040
those and I could just do that by double
155

155

00:05:45.040  -->  00:05:48.520
clicking them, we actually get some weird
156

156

00:05:48.520  -->  00:05:50.560
messages because it's not actually the
157

157

00:05:50.560  -->  00:05:52.510
right file type to check so I wouldn't
158

158

00:05:52.510  -->  00:05:55.480
normally want to check a class file, so
159

159

00:05:55.480  -->  00:05:56.380
I'm going to show you later how to
160

160

00:05:56.380  -->  00:05:58.750
remove those but the one that we do want
161

161

00:05:58.750  -->  00:06:01.330
to check is the Java file and again once
162

162

00:06:01.330  -->  00:06:03.010
you get into more complex projects as
163

163

00:06:03.010  -->  00:06:04.870
you move through this course you find
164

164

00:06:04.870  -->  00:06:07.330
that any other Java program files and
165

165

00:06:07.330  -->  00:06:09.850
other files will show up here as well so
166

166

00:06:09.850  -->  00:06:11.620
we want to do here is check our Java
167

167

00:06:11.620  -->  00:06:14.410
code I'm going to double click now you
168

168

00:06:14.410  -->  00:06:15.490
can see once I've done that I'm just
169

169

00:06:15.490  -->  00:06:16.720
going to open this up and make it a bit
170

170

00:06:16.720  -->  00:06:20.230
bigger we can see now that we've got two
171

171

00:06:20.230  -->  00:06:23.200
versions of the main Java files showing
172

172

00:06:23.200  -->  00:06:25.450
on the screen here and notice also that
173

173

00:06:25.450  -->  00:06:27.970
it's immediately moved down to the line
174

174

00:06:27.970  -->  00:06:30.820
on line 82 and it's actually saying here
175

175

00:06:30.820  -->  00:06:33.130
what's actually showing us the original
176

176

00:06:33.130  -->  00:06:34.960
code and we'll know that this is the
177

177

00:06:34.960  -->  00:06:37.000
original because up here it's got the
178

178

00:06:37.000  -->  00:06:38.920
low folder location that says original
179

179

00:06:38.920  -->  00:06:41.110
you can see that hasn't got a semicolon
180

180

00:06:41.110  -->  00:06:43.390
after the right parenthesis on line 82
181

181

00:06:43.390  -->  00:06:45.610
but this one here notice the
182

182

00:06:45.610  -->  00:06:47.259
semicolon showing in red on the
183

183

00:06:47.259  -->  00:06:49.750
right-hand side and again clearly that's
184

184

00:06:49.750  -->  00:06:51.460
a different folder as well, so that's
185

185

00:06:51.460  -->  00:06:53.409
telling us straight away that there's a
186

186

00:06:53.409  -->  00:06:55.870
difference between the two files so this
187

187

00:06:55.870  -->  00:06:58.270
software has automatically figured out
188

188

00:06:58.270  -->  00:06:59.620
that there's a probable there's a
189

189

00:06:59.620  -->  00:07:01.990
difference between those two lines so
190

190

00:07:01.990  -->  00:07:03.550
again on the left-hand side we've got
191

191

00:07:03.550  -->  00:07:05.379
the code that was downloaded from the
192

192

00:07:05.379  -->  00:07:07.539
lesson and on the right is the code from
193

193

00:07:07.539  -->  00:07:10.000
IntelliJ. So diffmerge is showing all the
194

194

00:07:10.000  -->  00:07:12.370
differences between those two files so
195

195

00:07:12.370  -->  00:07:15.219
notice these blue vertical lines where
196

196

00:07:15.219  -->  00:07:16.479
our lines different in this case is only
197

197

00:07:16.479  -->  00:07:18.610
the one line so lines that have the same
198

198

00:07:18.610  -->  00:07:21.340
code they don't have those blue vertical
199

199

00:07:21.340  -->  00:07:23.199
lines and if I clicked on another line
200

200

00:07:23.199  -->  00:07:24.819
and notice that it's not showing me
201

201

00:07:24.819  -->  00:07:27.340
anything blue at all but if I come back
202

202

00:07:27.340  -->  00:07:28.719
there and click on that line it shows
203

203

00:07:28.719  -->  00:07:31.180
those blue lines again and also it shows
204

204

00:07:31.180  -->  00:07:34.300
the semicolon that's different in red so
205

205

00:07:34.300  -->  00:07:35.830
as you can see diffmerge can be very
206

206

00:07:35.830  -->  00:07:38.409
helpful when you make typing mistakes or
207

207

00:07:38.409  -->  00:07:40.419
if there's some logical error as the if
208

208

00:07:40.419  -->  00:07:42.550
statement is at the moment. So let's move
209

209

00:07:42.550  -->  00:07:44.979
back to IntelliJ and change one more
210

210

00:07:44.979  -->  00:07:46.900
line I want to show you what
211

211

00:07:46.900  -->  00:07:48.039
will happen when we do that, so we'll go
212

212

00:07:48.039  -->  00:07:51.219
back into IntelliJ and what I'm going to
213

213

00:07:51.219  -->  00:07:53.080
do is we're going to go to the display a
214

214

00:07:53.080  -->  00:07:55.479
high score position method we're going
215

215

00:07:55.479  -->  00:07:57.069
to delete this part here this player
216

216

00:07:57.069  -->  00:08:02.080
name so I'm going to delete that so it
217

217

00:08:02.080  -->  00:08:03.580
doesn't display the play name and I'm
218

218

00:08:03.580  -->  00:08:05.529
just going to run it to confirm that we
219

219

00:08:05.529  -->  00:08:07.449
no longer see the player name and you
220

220

00:08:07.449  -->  00:08:08.680
can see we haven't got a player
221

221

00:08:08.680  -->  00:08:10.270
showing there so we've made another
222

222

00:08:10.270  -->  00:08:12.250
change that's now going to be different
223

223

00:08:12.250  -->  00:08:14.349
to the other code so let's go back to
224

224

00:08:14.349  -->  00:08:17.349
diffmerge to see what's happened I'm
225

225

00:08:17.349  -->  00:08:19.689
selecting diffmerge and notice what
226

226

00:08:19.689  -->  00:08:20.860
happened that when I went back to diff
227

227

00:08:20.860  -->  00:08:22.029
merge we've got this little pop-up
228

228

00:08:22.029  -->  00:08:24.159
window and I'll just center that in size
229

229

00:08:24.159  -->  00:08:26.379
it up so we can see it, so notice what
230

230

00:08:26.379  -->  00:08:28.150
it's saying there files changed on disk
231

231

00:08:28.150  -->  00:08:30.069
the following file files have been
232

232

00:08:30.069  -->  00:08:32.169
changed by another application, would you
233

233

00:08:32.169  -->  00:08:34.269
like to reload? So in other words diff
234

234

00:08:34.269  -->  00:08:36.190
merge noticed that there's been a change
235

235

00:08:36.190  -->  00:08:38.589
made in this case see the file on the
236

236

00:08:38.589  -->  00:08:40.690
right hand side because we made that
237

237

00:08:40.690  -->  00:08:43.750
change within IntelliJ and it's asking
238

238

00:08:43.750  -->  00:08:45.640
us do we want to reload that file, so
239

239

00:08:45.640  -->  00:08:46.899
that it can go through the process of
240

240

00:08:46.899  -->  00:08:49.510
checking again. Now sometimes it won't
241

241

00:08:49.510  -->  00:08:51.040
always get this right and automatically
242

242

00:08:51.040  -->  00:08:53.170
detect that so if it doesn't detect it
243

243

00:08:53.170  -->  00:08:55.120
for you you don't get this message you
244

244

00:08:55.120  -->  00:08:56.380
can just close down
245

245

00:08:56.380  -->  00:08:58.720
diffmergeand open it again and it'll find
246

246

00:08:58.720  -->  00:08:59.810
the file the next time
247

247

00:08:59.810  -->  00:09:01.370
but in my case you can see it has come
248

248

00:09:01.370  -->  00:09:03.200
up would you like to reload I'm gonna
249

249

00:09:03.200  -->  00:09:06.140
click on yes and notice what's happened
250

250

00:09:06.140  -->  00:09:08.150
now is we've also got an arrow nail
251

251

00:09:08.150  -->  00:09:11.090
showing up here on line 61 we can see
252

252

00:09:11.090  -->  00:09:13.700
that player name exists on the left hand
253

253

00:09:13.700  -->  00:09:16.160
side, however it doesn't exist on the
254

254

00:09:16.160  -->  00:09:18.350
right hand side, so we've now got two
255

255

00:09:18.350  -->  00:09:20.900
lines that have differences and then no
256

256

00:09:20.900  -->  00:09:23.450
generally no on the stiffs they were
257

257

00:09:23.450  -->  00:09:25.190
called a diff in other words so we can
258

258

00:09:25.190  -->  00:09:27.170
easily navigate between diffs on the left
259

259

00:09:27.170  -->  00:09:29.570
hand side this is white bar down here
260

260

00:09:29.570  -->  00:09:32.210
and what we can actually do is click
261

261

00:09:32.210  -->  00:09:34.670
these red icons and you'll have a red
262

262

00:09:34.670  -->  00:09:37.370
icon usually for each line that's
263

263

00:09:37.370  -->  00:09:39.170
different between the two files so you
264

264

00:09:39.170  -->  00:09:41.030
can click on one of these lines and
265

265

00:09:41.030  -->  00:09:42.860
notice that that brings that up on
266

266

00:09:42.860  -->  00:09:44.990
screen you can select either one to go
267

267

00:09:44.990  -->  00:09:47.060
up and down two errors and if we click
268

268

00:09:47.060  -->  00:09:48.290
on that line again we'll see the blue
269

269

00:09:48.290  -->  00:09:49.880
bars indicating that there's a
270

270

00:09:49.880  -->  00:09:51.890
difference and if you'll notice
271

271

00:09:51.890  -->  00:09:53.180
carefully you can't really say that
272

272

00:09:53.180  -->  00:09:55.130
perhaps too good in the video but the
273

273

00:09:55.130  -->  00:09:57.200
lines that are different have a slightly
274

274

00:09:57.200  -->  00:09:59.690
light red background and the parts that
275

275

00:09:59.690  -->  00:10:01.310
are different they've got this much
276

276

00:10:01.310  -->  00:10:04.010
heavier red background so you can see
277

277

00:10:04.010  -->  00:10:06.080
that the diff mode tool is trying to
278

278

00:10:06.080  -->  00:10:08.060
make it obvious to you where the errors
279

279

00:10:08.060  -->  00:10:10.640
are and again as I showed you if I click
280

280

00:10:10.640  -->  00:10:13.670
on the actual line it brings those blue
281

281

00:10:13.670  -->  00:10:15.170
out blue lines just to make it clear
282

282

00:10:15.170  -->  00:10:18.380
that that's a line that is that's in
283

283

00:10:18.380  -->  00:10:20.240
kneading that is different between the
284

284

00:10:20.240  -->  00:10:23.570
two files now you can also jump between
285

285

00:10:23.570  -->  00:10:25.340
different lines using the icons in the
286

286

00:10:25.340  -->  00:10:27.410
toolbar and notice these three icons
287

287

00:10:27.410  -->  00:10:28.940
that are to the right-hand side of the
288

288

00:10:28.940  -->  00:10:31.340
toolbar so when I con with the arrow is
289

289

00:10:31.340  -->  00:10:33.380
pointing to the right then the next one
290

290

00:10:33.380  -->  00:10:35.510
has the arrow pointing down and the one
291

291

00:10:35.510  -->  00:10:37.550
after that has got the arrow pointing up
292

292

00:10:37.550  -->  00:10:39.860
so I can choose either the up or down
293

293

00:10:39.860  -->  00:10:42.170
one to jump to the previous or to the
294

294

00:10:42.170  -->  00:10:43.910
next change instead of clicking on those
295

295

00:10:43.910  -->  00:10:46.670
red icons and come up there and choose
296

296

00:10:46.670  -->  00:10:48.020
and click down there to go to rid of
297

297

00:10:48.020  -->  00:10:50.420
them so it's an easy way for you to
298

298

00:10:50.420  -->  00:10:51.860
navigate you don't have to scroll
299

299

00:10:51.860  -->  00:10:53.900
yourself manually you would generally
300

300

00:10:53.900  -->  00:10:55.490
not want to do that you want to specify
301

301

00:10:55.490  -->  00:10:58.100
and you'd want to click on the red icon
302

302

00:10:58.100  -->  00:11:00.380
or use this navigation to go to the
303

303

00:11:00.380  -->  00:11:02.090
specific errors that tell you want to
304

304

00:11:02.090  -->  00:11:04.040
change alright so now that we've
305

305

00:11:04.040  -->  00:11:06.710
identified the errors how do we go about
306

306

00:11:06.710  -->  00:11:09.410
fixing them so what we can do is we can
307

307

00:11:09.410  -->  00:11:13.160
choose to copy the changes from the left
308

308

00:11:13.160  -->  00:11:15.069
and window to the right hand window
309

309

00:11:15.069  -->  00:11:16.910
generally that's what you'd want to do
310

310

00:11:16.910  -->  00:11:18.949
and that's because we've identified that
311

311

00:11:18.949  -->  00:11:20.899
the code on the left-hand side is the
312

312

00:11:20.899  -->  00:11:23.269
original code from the course and that
313

313

00:11:23.269  -->  00:11:24.560
would generally be the code that is
314

314

00:11:24.560  -->  00:11:26.509
correct so what we want to do here is we
315

315

00:11:26.509  -->  00:11:28.129
want to actually copy the code changes
316

316

00:11:28.129  -->  00:11:29.750
that are different from the original
317

317

00:11:29.750  -->  00:11:32.389
code back into our source code which
318

318

00:11:32.389  -->  00:11:34.310
ultimately will go back into IntelliJ
319

319

00:11:34.310  -->  00:11:36.920
and all we need to do there is once we
320

320

00:11:36.920  -->  00:11:39.199
select the line we come up over here and
321

321

00:11:39.199  -->  00:11:40.519
there's an option there and it says
322

322

00:11:40.519  -->  00:11:42.889
apply change from left, so I click on
323

323

00:11:42.889  -->  00:11:45.949
that you can see what's happened
324

324

00:11:45.949  -->  00:11:48.709
automatically we've got the changes now
325

325

00:11:48.709  -->  00:11:50.000
being applied over here we've got this
326

326

00:11:50.000  -->  00:11:51.019
black underlined
327

327

00:11:51.019  -->  00:11:52.490
telling us that there's been a change
328

328

00:11:52.490  -->  00:11:54.079
that's been made in there and it's also
329

329

00:11:54.079  -->  00:11:56.810
showing bold as well we've now got plain
330

330

00:11:56.810  -->  00:11:58.250
I'm showing as it was on the left hand
331

331

00:11:58.250  -->  00:12:00.259
side and the other thing that if you
332

332

00:12:00.259  -->  00:12:02.240
look carefully at line 61 and 62 there's
333

333

00:12:02.240  -->  00:12:04.850
two stars the a or asterixis which is
334

334

00:12:04.850  -->  00:12:06.199
telling you that there's been a change
335

335

00:12:06.199  -->  00:12:09.110
made to that line because obviously
336

336

00:12:09.110  -->  00:12:11.269
that's a continuation line there so you
337

337

00:12:11.269  -->  00:12:12.649
can see there at a glance that that has
338

338

00:12:12.649  -->  00:12:14.930
a code that has been changed by the
339

339

00:12:14.930  -->  00:12:17.089
process we'll be going through here and
340

340

00:12:17.089  -->  00:12:19.160
we can apply the next change in this
341

341

00:12:19.160  -->  00:12:20.540
case what we want to do again you get is
342

342

00:12:20.540  -->  00:12:22.310
go from left to right by coming up here
343

343

00:12:22.310  -->  00:12:24.680
because we know that we're on that next
344

344

00:12:24.680  -->  00:12:26.209
line now because that happened after we
345

345

00:12:26.209  -->  00:12:28.870
fixed the first one to change this time
346

346

00:12:28.870  -->  00:12:31.220
you can see we've done that and it
347

347

00:12:31.220  -->  00:12:33.319
actually removed the code that was
348

348

00:12:33.319  -->  00:12:35.209
incorrect on the right hand side for us
349

349

00:12:35.209  -->  00:12:36.380
and again we've got the Asterix is
350

350

00:12:36.380  -->  00:12:38.569
they're indicating that the line has
351

351

00:12:38.569  -->  00:12:40.430
been modified and we can see the code is
352

352

00:12:40.430  -->  00:12:42.709
now underlined and in bold once you've
353

353

00:12:42.709  -->  00:12:44.779
done that at this point in time the code
354

354

00:12:44.779  -->  00:12:47.750
changes haven't been saved so what we
355

355

00:12:47.750  -->  00:12:50.000
need to do to save those changes is we
356

356

00:12:50.000  -->  00:12:51.290
need to come up here and click on the
357

357

00:12:51.290  -->  00:12:53.089
Save icon this little picture of a
358

358

00:12:53.089  -->  00:12:55.699
floppy disk and at that point the
359

359

00:12:55.699  -->  00:12:57.889
changes have now been made and we should
360

360

00:12:57.889  -->  00:12:59.980
be able to go back into IntelliJ and
361

361

00:12:59.980  -->  00:13:02.509
notice I went back the players player
362

362

00:13:02.509  -->  00:13:04.550
name was put back and also down here in
363

363

00:13:04.550  -->  00:13:07.850
line 82 that semicolons been removed so
364

364

00:13:07.850  -->  00:13:09.290
I can actually run this code again now
365

365

00:13:09.290  -->  00:13:12.139
and notice that we've now got the code
366

366

00:13:12.139  -->  00:13:13.939
working the positions are now working
367

367

00:13:13.939  -->  00:13:16.129
correctly and also the names have been
368

368

00:13:16.129  -->  00:13:18.079
returned again so you can see that's
369

369

00:13:18.079  -->  00:13:18.860
pretty cool
370

370

00:13:18.860  -->  00:13:21.470
diffmerge will actually help you a lot
371

371

00:13:21.470  -->  00:13:23.720
in your code in this case in this course
372

372

00:13:23.720  -->  00:13:26.480
checking to see what changes have been
373

373

00:13:26.480  -->  00:13:27.170
made you know
374

374

00:13:27.170  -->  00:13:28.399
what's different between the two files
375

375

00:13:28.399  -->  00:13:30.260
but yes you become a more experienced
376

376

00:13:30.260  -->  00:13:31.940
programmer you find you'll be able to
377

377

00:13:31.940  -->  00:13:34.480
use that in other situations for example
378

378

00:13:34.480  -->  00:13:37.070
it can give you a quick way to know what
379

379

00:13:37.070  -->  00:13:39.320
has been changed in this coding session
380

380

00:13:39.320  -->  00:13:40.490
in other words if you've been working on
381

381

00:13:40.490  -->  00:13:42.740
some code perhaps for 30 minutes or 60
382

382

00:13:42.740  -->  00:13:44.630
minutes you can use a diff tool like
383

383

00:13:44.630  -->  00:13:46.699
this stiff merge and see what has been
384

384

00:13:46.699  -->  00:13:48.560
changed from when you started coding
385

385

00:13:48.560  -->  00:13:50.269
very very useful indeed.
386

386

00:13:50.269  -->  00:13:52.990
Alright, so going back to diffmerge in
387

387

00:13:52.990  -->  00:13:55.940
I'm going to close down this file change
388

388

00:13:55.940  -->  00:13:57.260
the outcomes we've established that
389

389

00:13:57.260  -->  00:14:00.709
that's okay and notice now that well if
390

390

00:14:00.709  -->  00:14:06.670
I go back through now, new file reload
391

391

00:14:06.670  -->  00:14:08.570
notice what happened when I did that
392

392

00:14:08.570  -->  00:14:10.610
some other files are disappeared so
393

393

00:14:10.610  -->  00:14:12.170
what's happened now is those other parts
394

394

00:14:12.170  -->  00:14:14.180
of a move that had been removed from the
395

395

00:14:14.180  -->  00:14:16.070
display because they're effectively
396

396

00:14:16.070  -->  00:14:17.329
identical because we've now confirmed
397

397

00:14:17.329  -->  00:14:19.730
that both sides the left and right that
398

398

00:14:19.730  -->  00:14:21.920
both versions of the files have now been
399

399

00:14:21.920  -->  00:14:24.620
updated to the same thing but if you
400

400

00:14:24.620  -->  00:14:26.089
recall at the start of the video we had
401

401

00:14:26.089  -->  00:14:28.459
those dot class files showing and they
402

402

00:14:28.459  -->  00:14:30.139
were in a file type that we wanted to
403

403

00:14:30.139  -->  00:14:32.180
wherever check on I'm going to show you
404

404

00:14:32.180  -->  00:14:34.399
how to go about changing that now if
405

405

00:14:34.399  -->  00:14:36.709
you're on a Windows platform you need to
406

406

00:14:36.709  -->  00:14:38.720
go to the tools option menu to do this
407

407

00:14:38.720  -->  00:14:41.029
options and I think that's the same for
408

408

00:14:41.029  -->  00:14:43.010
Linux but on a Mac I'm going to go up to
409

409

00:14:43.010  -->  00:14:45.290
the top left hand corner differ and
410

410

00:14:45.290  -->  00:14:47.750
preferences and what we want to do is
411

411

00:14:47.750  -->  00:14:50.390
come down here into folder fuels as you
412

412

00:14:50.390  -->  00:14:53.029
can see so another folder windows menu
413

413

00:14:53.029  -->  00:14:55.339
now what we want to do is set this up to
414

414

00:14:55.339  -->  00:14:57.920
ignore some common file types that we
415

415

00:14:57.920  -->  00:15:00.589
won't be never needing to compare now a
416

416

00:15:00.589  -->  00:15:03.170
class file is a compiled version of a
417

417

00:15:03.170  -->  00:15:05.360
Java source file so that's not something
418

418

00:15:05.360  -->  00:15:07.100
we'd ever want to check so what we can
419

419

00:15:07.100  -->  00:15:08.390
do is we can come out under here under
420

420

00:15:08.390  -->  00:15:10.819
using file name filters making sure the
421

421

00:15:10.819  -->  00:15:12.829
check box is on which it is by default
422

422

00:15:12.829  -->  00:15:15.380
and can put a space and put star dot
423

423

00:15:15.380  -->  00:15:19.569
class so that actually tells diff emerge
424

424

00:15:19.569  -->  00:15:23.360
and ever check differences between files
425

425

00:15:23.360  -->  00:15:26.389
of top class start up these all files
426

426

00:15:26.389  -->  00:15:29.480
than any in class but the other thing we
427

427

00:15:29.480  -->  00:15:30.860
can also do here is come down here to
428

428

00:15:30.860  -->  00:15:33.410
file filters and these are sub folders
429

429

00:15:33.410  -->  00:15:35.060
and you may find that there's a number
430

430

00:15:35.060  -->  00:15:36.560
of sub folders that you don't want to
431

431

00:15:36.560  -->  00:15:38.540
ever check against and you can add them
432

432

00:15:38.540  -->  00:15:39.860
here and you can come back and do this
433

433

00:15:39.860  -->  00:15:41.139
at any time,
434

434

00:15:41.139  -->  00:15:42.670
so in our case if you can see on the
435

435

00:15:42.670  -->  00:15:44.379
left hand side there we've got a dot
436

436

00:15:44.379  -->  00:15:47.529
idea folder and that's the IntelliJ is
437

437

00:15:47.529  -->  00:15:49.779
folder that it uses to track changes to
438

438

00:15:49.779  -->  00:15:51.970
code so we wouldn't usually everyone
439

439

00:15:51.970  -->  00:15:54.189
have a need to check whether those files
440

440

00:15:54.189  -->  00:15:55.809
are the same or different so
441

441

00:15:55.809  -->  00:15:57.759
consequently and the boulder filters
442

442

00:15:57.759  -->  00:15:59.739
making sure that check box is on for you
443

443

00:15:59.739  -->  00:16:01.809
subfolder filters I'm gonna put a space
444

444

00:16:01.809  -->  00:16:05.980
and the name of the folder dot ID if you
445

445

00:16:05.980  -->  00:16:07.119
had any other folders you could do the
446

446

00:16:07.119  -->  00:16:09.100
similar thing to that as well then if
447

447

00:16:09.100  -->  00:16:12.399
you click ok to that notice how the dot
448

448

00:16:12.399  -->  00:16:14.739
idea forward I disappeared and if your
449

449

00:16:14.739  -->  00:16:17.410
diff merge was showing class files you'd
450

450

00:16:17.410  -->  00:16:18.970
see that they would have been removed as
451

451

00:16:18.970  -->  00:16:21.579
well. Alright so that's basically it,
452

452

00:16:21.579  -->  00:16:22.959
that's what I wanted to do to show you
453

453

00:16:22.959  -->  00:16:24.669
this diff emerge tool I think it's a
454

454

00:16:24.669  -->  00:16:27.160
really useful tool to use so if you are
455

455

00:16:27.160  -->  00:16:28.899
getting stuck in front of your codes not
456

456

00:16:28.899  -->  00:16:30.879
working compared to the code that I've
457

457

00:16:30.879  -->  00:16:32.679
written in a particular video, go through
458

458

00:16:32.679  -->  00:16:33.999
the steps that I've outlined in this
459

459

00:16:33.999  -->  00:16:36.519
video and to help you find where the
460

460

00:16:36.519  -->  00:16:39.100
actual error is, diffmerge is a very
461

461

00:16:39.100  -->  00:16:40.959
useful tool as you can hopefully see now
462

462

00:16:40.959  -->  00:16:42.639
and it can be very helpful when you've
463

463

00:16:42.639  -->  00:16:44.290
got to compare folders as I mentioned
464

464

00:16:44.290  -->  00:16:46.269
and also you can actually use it to
465

465

00:16:46.269  -->  00:16:48.459
check individual files if you don't want
466

466

00:16:48.459  -->  00:16:49.689
to go through and check out at folder
467

467

00:16:49.689  -->  00:16:51.369
level, but I think it's a good habit to
468

468

00:16:51.369  -->  00:16:54.040
get into to check by folder and that's
469

469

00:16:54.040  -->  00:16:56.529
so that when you start checking against
470

470

00:16:56.529  -->  00:16:58.360
larger projects it's automatically set
471

471

00:16:58.360  -->  00:17:00.790
up for you to check all the Java code or
472

472

00:17:00.790  -->  00:17:02.829
any other type of file that you specify
473

473

00:17:02.829  -->  00:17:06.039
and not just an individual file, so use
474

474

00:17:06.039  -->  00:17:07.480
it again if you're typing code from one
475

475

00:17:07.480  -->  00:17:10.209
of the videos in this course and you
476

476

00:17:10.209  -->  00:17:12.370
found that you can't get it to work or
477

477

00:17:12.370  -->  00:17:14.409
it's not working the same doing it that
478

478

00:17:14.409  -->  00:17:15.819
way you can quickly spot what the
479

479

00:17:15.819  -->  00:17:17.559
differences in the code are then you can
480

480

00:17:17.559  -->  00:17:19.329
even get diff merge to make the changes
481

481

00:17:19.329  -->  00:17:21.220
for you if you want to do that as well,
482

482

00:17:21.220  -->  00:17:23.019
so it's a great comparison tool.
483

483

00:17:23.019  -->  00:17:24.850
Alright, so at this point now I'm going to finish
484

484

00:17:24.850  -->  00:17:25.360
the video,
485

485

00:17:25.360  -->  00:17:26.949
I hope you've got a lot out of it and
486

486

00:17:26.949  -->  00:17:30.449
I'll see you in the next one.
