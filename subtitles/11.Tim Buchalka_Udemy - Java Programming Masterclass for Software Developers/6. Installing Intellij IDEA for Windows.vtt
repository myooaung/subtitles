00:00:04.920  -->  00:00:05.753
<v Tim>In this video,</v>
2

2

00:00:05.753  -->  00:00:08.850
we're gonna download and instal IntelliJ IDEA
3

3

00:00:08.850  -->  00:00:10.800
which is the editor or IDE,
4

4

00:00:10.800  -->  00:00:12.530
Integrated Development Environment,
5

5

00:00:12.530  -->  00:00:15.860
we're gonna be using to create programmes in this course.
6

6

00:00:15.860  -->  00:00:18.860
So what we need to do is start out by going to jetbrains.com
7

7

00:00:19.830  -->  00:00:23.940
and JetBrains is the creator of the IntelliJ IDEA product.
8

8

00:00:23.940  -->  00:00:25.630
We'll go to their website.
9

9

00:00:25.630  -->  00:00:28.120
I'm gonna come down to the tools menu, hover over that,
10

10

00:00:28.120  -->  00:00:30.133
move on down to IntelliJ IDEA.
11

11

00:00:32.270  -->  00:00:33.540
I'm gonna click over here to yes I agree
12

12

00:00:33.540  -->  00:00:35.900
just to remove that little popup.
13

13

00:00:35.900  -->  00:00:37.393
I'm gonna select download.
14

14

00:00:39.480  -->  00:00:41.040
Now when we do that, there's two options here.
15

15

00:00:41.040  -->  00:00:42.840
We've got the Ultimate edition,
16

16

00:00:42.840  -->  00:00:46.770
noting that it's also available for macOS and Linux as well.
17

17

00:00:46.770  -->  00:00:49.440
So we've got the Ultimate edition and the Community edition.
18

18

00:00:49.440  -->  00:00:51.790
So we can use the Community edition in this course
19

19

00:00:51.790  -->  00:00:53.760
and that's completely free and open source.
20

20

00:00:53.760  -->  00:00:54.790
There's no cost.
21

21

00:00:54.790  -->  00:00:55.900
There's never gonna be a cost to use it.
22

22

00:00:55.900  -->  00:00:57.150
It's completely free.
23

23

00:00:57.150  -->  00:00:59.170
The Ultimate edition, out of interest, is available
24

24

00:00:59.170  -->  00:01:01.220
if you're looking at some extra tools.
25

25

00:01:01.220  -->  00:01:02.770
It's more for professional developers,
26

26

00:01:02.770  -->  00:01:04.400
things like Java Enterprise Edition
27

27

00:01:04.400  -->  00:01:06.680
and Spring and so on and so forth.
28

28

00:01:06.680  -->  00:01:08.680
But we're gonna be using the Community edition
29

29

00:01:08.680  -->  00:01:10.873
so I'm gonna click on over here to download it.
30

30

00:01:12.210  -->  00:01:13.170
Now I'm gonna select run,
31

31

00:01:13.170  -->  00:01:16.000
noting that you may have to save this to a folder somewhere
32

32

00:01:16.000  -->  00:01:18.120
and double click it once it's downloaded
33

33

00:01:18.120  -->  00:01:21.260
if your browser doesn't allow you to do what I've just done.
34

34

00:01:21.260  -->  00:01:22.380
So we'll give that a moment to complete.
35

35

00:01:22.380  -->  00:01:24.330
Now we'll just fast forward this a bit.
36

36

00:01:25.370  -->  00:01:27.603
All right, you can see we're just about done now.
37

37

00:01:30.290  -->  00:01:31.500
Okay, when this popup comes up,
38

38

00:01:31.500  -->  00:01:32.500
I'm gonna click on yes,
39

39

00:01:32.500  -->  00:01:35.460
that we're gonna allow this app to make changes.
40

40

00:01:35.460  -->  00:01:36.980
I'm gonna close the browser at this point
41

41

00:01:36.980  -->  00:01:38.930
because we're finished with that.
42

42

00:01:38.930  -->  00:01:40.700
We're gonna go through the installation setup.
43

43

00:01:40.700  -->  00:01:42.540
I'm gonna click on next.
44

44

00:01:42.540  -->  00:01:44.043
I'm gonna click on next again.
45

45

00:01:45.857  -->  00:01:47.290
All right, so in this little popup,
46

46

00:01:47.290  -->  00:01:49.310
you need to specify whether you're a 32-bit
47

47

00:01:49.310  -->  00:01:51.170
or a 64-bit user.
48

48

00:01:51.170  -->  00:01:54.400
Now nine times out of 10, you will select 64-bit.
49

49

00:01:54.400  -->  00:01:56.860
But if you know that your operating system is 32-bit,
50

50

00:01:56.860  -->  00:01:59.330
then that would be the box you would check.
51

51

00:01:59.330  -->  00:02:01.560
You can optionally update the context menu
52

52

00:02:01.560  -->  00:02:03.770
to add an option to open folder as project.
53

53

00:02:03.770  -->  00:02:06.240
I don't actually use that so I'm gonna leave that unchecked.
54

54

00:02:06.240  -->  00:02:08.440
And I'm gonna create these associations,
55

55

00:02:08.440  -->  00:02:12.710
the .java, the .groovy, and .kt which is for Kotlin
56

56

00:02:13.950  -->  00:02:15.450
because that's so useful
57

57

00:02:15.450  -->  00:02:17.440
if you want to edit those particular files
58

58

00:02:17.440  -->  00:02:20.240
in this IntelliJ IDEA product as well.
59

59

00:02:20.240  -->  00:02:21.320
So generally I would suggest
60

60

00:02:21.320  -->  00:02:22.840
you just click those options anyway
61

61

00:02:22.840  -->  00:02:24.810
even if you don't think you're gonna use them at the moment.
62

62

00:02:24.810  -->  00:02:27.560
I'll click on next, instal.
63

63

00:02:27.560  -->  00:02:30.340
And this is now installing IntelliJ IDEA.
64

64

00:02:30.340  -->  00:02:31.440
Once this is completed,
65

65

00:02:31.440  -->  00:02:34.130
there's a few little minor installation configurations
66

66

00:02:34.130  -->  00:02:36.183
we need to set before we end the video.
67

67

00:02:41.575  -->  00:02:46.094
All right, just about finished as we can see now.
68

68

00:02:46.094  -->  00:02:47.780
All right, the next thing I suggest you do
69

69

00:02:47.780  -->  00:02:50.640
is check the run IntelliJ IDEA Community edition
70

70

00:02:50.640  -->  00:02:52.470
because there's a few things we need to set up.
71

71

00:02:52.470  -->  00:02:53.393
Click on finish.
72

72

00:02:54.400  -->  00:02:55.940
Eventually this little popup will come up.
73

73

00:02:55.940  -->  00:02:57.460
We have the option to select a config
74

74

00:02:57.460  -->  00:03:00.290
or installation folder or do not import settings.
75

75

00:03:00.290  -->  00:03:01.260
Do not import settings
76

76

00:03:01.260  -->  00:03:04.810
if this is the first time you've used IntelliJ IDEA.
77

77

00:03:04.810  -->  00:03:06.630
The config or installation folder is there
78

78

00:03:06.630  -->  00:03:09.480
if you wanna import settings from a previous installation.
79

79

00:03:09.480  -->  00:03:10.710
In that case we're not gonna do that
80

80

00:03:10.710  -->  00:03:12.160
so I'm gonna click on OK
81

81

00:03:12.160  -->  00:03:13.380
after selecting or making sure
82

82

00:03:13.380  -->  00:03:15.380
that do not import settings is selected.
83

83

00:03:16.890  -->  00:03:19.830
We're gonna accept JetBrains' privacy policy
84

84

00:03:19.830  -->  00:03:22.230
by clicking the check box and clicking continue.
85

85

00:03:23.240  -->  00:03:24.920
You got the options to send JetBrains
86

86

00:03:24.920  -->  00:03:26.800
usage anonymous statistics.
87

87

00:03:26.800  -->  00:03:27.960
I'm gonna click on don't send
88

88

00:03:27.960  -->  00:03:29.450
but you're free to select
89

89

00:03:29.450  -->  00:03:32.453
and choose to send those statistics if you wish.
90

90

00:03:33.900  -->  00:03:36.110
Next, we're prompted as to whether we want a dark background
91

91

00:03:36.110  -->  00:03:38.580
which is generally easy on the eyes when you're programming
92

92

00:03:38.580  -->  00:03:39.920
or a light background.
93

93

00:03:39.920  -->  00:03:40.820
Now I'm gonna choose light
94

94

00:03:40.820  -->  00:03:42.780
because that tends to come out better in the videos
95

95

00:03:42.780  -->  00:03:45.430
but if you wanna choose the darker theme,
96

96

00:03:45.430  -->  00:03:47.070
the darker one then do that,
97

97

00:03:47.070  -->  00:03:49.220
noting that you can always go back into settings later
98

98

00:03:49.220  -->  00:03:50.053
and change this.
99

99

00:03:50.053  -->  00:03:51.950
So I'm gonna click on next.
100

100

00:03:51.950  -->  00:03:53.170
I'm gonna leave this screen alone,
101

101

00:03:53.170  -->  00:03:55.050
noting that the screen will be different
102

102

00:03:55.050  -->  00:03:57.830
if you've chosen the Ultimate edition of IntelliJ.
103

103

00:03:57.830  -->  00:03:59.220
We don't need to make any changes there.
104

104

00:03:59.220  -->  00:04:01.050
We can just leave everything as it is.
105

105

00:04:01.050  -->  00:04:01.993
Click on next.
106

106

00:04:02.860  -->  00:04:04.500
Same thing here, I'm not gonna change anything.
107

107

00:04:04.500  -->  00:04:06.800
You can always come back and instal these things later
108

108

00:04:06.800  -->  00:04:08.430
if that's something that you wanna do.
109

109

00:04:08.430  -->  00:04:10.530
We won't be using any of those in the course.
110

110

00:04:10.530  -->  00:04:12.933
Click on start using IntelliJ IDEA.
111

111

00:04:15.678  -->  00:04:17.090
All right, so at this point, we're now done.
112

112

00:04:17.090  -->  00:04:20.560
We've now successfully installed IntelliJ IDEA.
113

113

00:04:20.560  -->  00:04:21.393
So now that we've done that,
114

114

00:04:21.393  -->  00:04:23.220
we do have a few minor configurations
115

115

00:04:23.220  -->  00:04:24.690
that we need to finish off,
116

116

00:04:24.690  -->  00:04:26.860
specifically what we need to do is configure it
117

117

00:04:26.860  -->  00:04:28.370
for the software development kit
118

118

00:04:28.370  -->  00:04:31.280
so that we can start creating programmes in this course,
119

119

00:04:31.280  -->  00:04:33.000
but we're gonna do that in a separate video.
120

120

00:04:33.000  -->  00:04:35.310
I will end the video now and we'll see you in the next video
121

121

00:04:35.310  -->  00:04:36.870
where we start making a few other changes
122

122

00:04:36.870  -->  00:04:39.020
to configure IntelliJ IDEA.
123

123

00:04:39.020  -->  00:04:40.563
So see you in that next video.
