1

00:00:05,400  -->  00:00:09,770
so right now the user can add to do
items but they can't edit or delete them
2

2

00:00:09,770  -->  00:00:13,400
as I mentioned in the last video and in
addition to what I said in the last
3

3

00:00:13,400  -->  00:00:18,220
video coding the edit case is really
similar to the add case and will even be
4

4

00:00:18,220  -->  00:00:21,990
using the same UI if we did that
and because of that I'm gonna leave the
5

5

00:00:21,990  -->  00:00:26,260
edit case as an exercise for you to do
what I'm gonna do is show you the Delete
6

6

00:00:26,260  -->  00:00:30,520
case now so we are gonna add the
ability to be able to delete a to-do
7

7

00:00:30,520  -->  00:00:35,910
item from our list in terms of
implementing that we could add a delete item
8

8

00:00:35,910  -->  00:00:40,670
to our file menu in much the same way
that we did for the new item for the new to
9

9

00:00:40,670  -->  00:00:44,980
do item but in the case for delete item it's probably not the ideal place
10

10

00:00:44,980  -->  00:00:51,300
to add it there no it was ok for the add new
to-do item case in that case because we
11

11

00:00:51,300  -->  00:00:55,480
don't need any other information from
the user in order to add a new item
12

12

00:00:55,480  -->  00:00:59,510
because of course all that does is opens
the add new to do item dialogue and from
13

13

00:00:59,510  -->  00:01:04,170
there they enter the details when the
user deletes an item it's different in
14

14

00:01:04,170  -->  00:01:07,170
that we need to know which item that we want to delete
15

15

00:01:08,000  -->  00:01:12,050
now we could assume the user wants to delete the
selected item and that's probably what
16

16

00:01:12,050  -->  00:01:17,260
do the user will expect but what we should do is
make it crystal clear to the user that
17

17

00:01:17,260  -->  00:01:22,730
we are going to be deleting that selected item so
let's have a menu popup when the user
18

18

00:01:22,730  -->  00:01:27,330
right clicks on an item in a list now this type of menu is different to the menu
19

19

00:01:27,330  -->  00:01:31,270
that we already implemented in our
program and this new type is called a context
20

20

00:01:31,270  -->  00:01:35,800
menu and the reason this called that is when the is because the menu
21

21

00:01:35,800  -->  00:01:40,190
that appears depends on the item that's
been right clicked on and let's have a
22

22

00:01:40,190  -->  00:01:45,440
look at IntelliJ sat context menu just to see what I mean so if you come over here to a
23

23

00:01:45,440  -->  00:01:51,770
project in the top left window right click
that you can see that is a menu that is the context
24

24

00:01:51,770  -->  00:01:54,470
menu that's been brought up by
IntelliJ and you can see there's quite a
25

25

00:01:54,470  -->  00:01:58,440
few options their a significant amount of
options but if you come down to say
26

26

00:01:58,440  -->  00:02:02,950
external libraries right click that you can see
we've clearly got a different set of
27

27

00:02:02,950  -->  00:02:07,520
options so that is what a context menu is the
options that come up are relative to
28

28

00:02:07,520  -->  00:02:11,610
what you've selected or what you have right clicked so we are gonna do
29

29

00:02:11,610  -->  00:02:16,840
something similar in this application so what you need to
do is go to our controller.java
30

30

00:02:17,430  -->  00:02:20,900
and that's because we're adding the
context to our main window
31

31

00:02:20,900  -->  00:02:26,490
let's go ahead and do that so we need to
create a field first and I've already added it here
32

32

00:02:26,490  -->  00:02:31,980
private context menu list context menu
so you need to add that to the java file
33

33

00:02:31,980  -->  00:02:36,850
so we added it their as a field and we also in the initialize method we
34

34

00:02:36,850  -->  00:02:42,880
want to initialize it as well we are going to initialize that by typing...
35

35

00:02:42,880  -->  00:02:49,090
....to initialize it when
the initialize method is executed
36

36

00:02:50,060  -->  00:02:54,170
so now we've done that we need to create the delete
menu item that's going to be part
37

37

00:02:54,170  -->  00:02:58,920
of this context menu and associated an event handler so to do that we are going to type...
38

38

00:02:58,920  -->  00:03:16,490
....
39

39

00:03:16,490  -->  00:03:21,410
....and next
40

40

00:03:21,410  -->  00:03:27,270
we need to add the code the event handler
that is going to be processed when we exit when the right
41

41

00:03:27,270  -->  00:03:35,690
click happens so to do that we do....
42

42

00:03:35,690  -->  00:03:41,470
....
43

43

00:03:41,470  -->  00:03:47,240
.....and you can see its overridden the handle
44

44

00:03:47,240  -->  00:03:52,780
method which were gonna be using and in
there that's where we going to choose
45

45

00:03:52,780  -->  00:03:58,300
what to delete to add the code its quite easy we do...
46

46

00:03:58,300  -->  00:04:15,690
....
47

47

00:04:15,690  -->  00:04:17,540
...
48

48

00:04:17,540  -->  00:04:22,240
...and that's all we need to add for our
49

49

00:04:22,240  -->  00:04:25,920
context menu and we will implement that delete item method
50

50

00:04:25,920  -->  00:04:30,990
but before you do that what we need to
do is add to delete item menu item
51

51

00:04:30,990  -->  00:04:36,390
itself to our context menu and we do that
by calling get items in our context
52

52

00:04:36,390  -->  00:04:42,880
menu and we add the delete item using the add all
method so here we can do that so...
53

53

00:04:42,880  -->  00:04:52,270
....
54

54

00:04:52,270  -->  00:04:58,320
...so that has now
added that option to that context menu so
55

55

00:04:58,320  -->  00:05:02,280
next let's go and add this delete item method so come down here
56

56

00:05:02,280  -->  00:05:08,290
in a bit further actually I'll just put it down the bottom jsut to
be in order of what we've done before so we
57

57

00:05:08,290  -->  00:05:14,240
gonna create that method so...
58

58

00:05:14,240  -->  00:05:17,240
....
59

59

00:05:21,110  -->  00:05:24,210
now we could just go ahead and delete the
selected item as soon as the user
60

60

00:05:24,210  -->  00:05:28,540
clicks the delete menu item but it will
be nice here because it's a deletion to
61

61

00:05:28,540  -->  00:05:32,610
confirm that deletion before we go ahead
and delete it you know because sometimes
62

62

00:05:32,610  -->  00:05:36,270
users click to wrong item or click on
something and then sort of reconsider the
63

63

00:05:36,270  -->  00:05:41,390
action so we learn earlier that JavaFX
provides us with a few canned dialogues
64

64

00:05:41,390  -->  00:05:46,610
for common use cases and we are gonna use what's
called a confirmation dialog to confirm
65

65

00:05:46,610  -->  00:05:49,880
that the user really was to go ahead and
to in this case delete an item
66

66

00:05:50,930  -->  00:05:54,670
now the alert class which has only been
available since Java 8u40 is the
67

67

00:05:54,670  -->  00:05:57,740
class that we gonna use here to create
one of those javafx
68

68

00:05:57,740  -->  00:06:03,460
canned sort of pre created dialogues now
when we create an instance of alert what
69

69

00:06:03,460  -->  00:06:07,550
we have to do is pass in the type of
dialogues that we want to create and this
70

70

00:06:07,550  -->  00:06:11,930
five choices that they give us a
confirmation error information warning and
71

71

00:06:11,930  -->  00:06:15,390
none and then based on the type that we
choose the alert constructor will
72

72

00:06:15,390  -->  00:06:19,110
initialize some of those instances
properties for us based on obviously
73

73

00:06:19,110  -->  00:06:24,520
the type dialogue we choosing and you might be wondering why
would you want to pass a none
74

74

00:06:24,520  -->  00:06:29,920
well the none case just means that there's no properties
that get initialized and in other words
75

75

00:06:29,920  -->  00:06:34,040
you be wanting to set each property yourself
manually so in this case we want the user to
76

76

00:06:34,040  -->  00:06:37,900
confirm the deletion so what we want is
a confirmation dialog sort of are you sure sort of
77

77

00:06:37,900  -->  00:06:44,760
thing so in that case we are gonna code that in that matter so start here in the delete item method and
78

78

00:06:44,760  -->  00:06:58,820
type...so confirmation is the
79

79

00:06:58,820  -->  00:07:02,200
one that is going to come up automatically for us and ask the user for confirmation
80

80

00:07:02,200  -->  00:07:07,230
before we delete so next we want to set properties that
determine what the dialogue will
81

81

00:07:07,230  -->  00:07:11,260
is gonna display on the
screen so we need to set the title header
82

82

00:07:11,260  -->  00:07:15,980
text and content text properties so what
we'll do is we'll set the title to
83

83

00:07:15,980  -->  00:07:21,320
deleted to do items so its comes up really
literally at the top and we want our header
84

84

00:07:21,320  -->  00:07:25,210
text to provide information about the
selected to do item sort of as a
85

85

00:07:25,210  -->  00:07:28,400
recap for the User so the know what they are deleting in other words so the user
86

86

00:07:28,400  -->  00:07:32,400
can see which item their ultimate
gonna delete if they go ahead and will set the
87

87

00:07:32,400  -->  00:07:37,490
header texts to delete item followed by
the selected items short description
88

88

00:07:37,490  -->  00:07:41,180
and then in the content area what we'll
do is we'll ask the user if they
89

89

00:07:41,180  -->  00:07:46,290
are sure they want to delete the item and that way there is no
ambiguity and the user will hopefully
90

90

00:07:46,290  -->  00:07:49,880
know exactly what's happening here so to
go ahead and do that so...
91

91

00:07:49,880  -->  00:07:55,760
....
92

92

00:07:59,640  -->  00:08:13,460
.....
93

93

00:08:13,460  -->  00:08:19,040
...remembering that items was pass to this method so we can get the details directly from that and that's obviously the current selected
94

94

00:08:19,040  -->  00:08:24,600
item and let's set the content text as well so....
95

95

00:08:24,600  -->  00:08:34,480
....
96

96

00:08:34,480  -->  00:08:41,150
now in terms of buttons we don't
have to set which buttons we want here and
97

97

00:08:41,150  -->  00:08:44,140
that's because the alert class will
provide those buttons automatically
98

98

00:08:44,140  -->  00:08:48,460
based on the type that we
passed with the alert type in this case
99

99

00:08:48,460  -->  00:08:54,510
confirmation in the case for
confirmation I'm sure you've seen a dialogue before many times
100

100

00:08:54,510  -->  00:08:59,190
applications that you run on your computer
theirs an OK and Cancel button so all that's
101

101

00:08:59,190  -->  00:09:03,320
left to do now is really show the
dialogue so we get
102

102

00:09:03,320  -->  00:09:11,540
that working by putting...
103

103

00:09:12,100  -->  00:09:17,200
....
104

104

00:09:17,200  -->  00:09:22,740
....so when
the user clicks on one of the buttons in the
105

105

00:09:22,740  -->  00:09:26,290
dialogue closes then we need to obviously
at that point check which button they
106

106

00:09:26,290  -->  00:09:29,810
pressed and if they pressed ok we need to
delete the selected item and
107

107

00:09:29,810  -->  00:09:35,030
in the case of canceled we don't do
anything so do that test here we put....
108

108

00:09:35,030  -->  00:09:39,490
.....
109

109

00:09:40,640  -->  00:10:10,850
....
110

110

00:10:10,850  -->  00:10:16,330
and that should be it so that's all the code we need
to handle the menu to process that menu
111

111

00:10:16,330  -->  00:10:21,130
selection when right click is selected and
show the confirmation dialog box so then
112

112

00:10:21,130  -->  00:10:27,100
we need to go back to our to do data
class we need to add that deletion
113

113

00:10:27,100  -->  00:10:41,380
the delete to do items so we do that with....
114

114

00:10:43,060  -->  00:10:52,540
....so that's all that
115

115

00:10:52,540  -->  00:10:59,160
we need for that method and going back to our controller class the delete to do items is now valid
116

116

00:10:59,160  -->  00:11:02,970
so we are pretty close to being done there but theirs
actually one more step to do so
117

117

00:11:03,710  -->  00:11:08,670
if you think about it we created the context menu we associated
handler to it and we've written the
118

118

00:11:08,670  -->  00:11:13,580
handlers code but what we haven't done is we
haven't associated the menu with the list view
119

119

00:11:13,580  -->  00:11:16,900
in any way now since this is a
context menu
120

120

00:11:16,900  -->  00:11:21,220
meaning its going to appear when the user right clicks on a
particular item or cell in this case it
121

121

00:11:21,220  -->  00:11:26,540
makes sense to associate the menu in our
cell factory now in a cell factory class
122

122

00:11:26,540  -->  00:11:32,070
we will add the code that associates the
context menu after we've created the cell
123

123

00:11:32,070  -->  00:11:37,630
now we only want non empty cells to have a
context menu in this case so let's go ahead
124

124

00:11:37,630  -->  00:11:42,470
and associated the context menu to our cell factory so we need to come up to our initialize
125

125

00:11:42,470  -->  00:11:48,470
method in our controller and we need to add
some code down here just
126

126

00:11:48,470  -->  00:11:51,530
below the returns cell so we need to actually
add
127

127

00:11:51,530  -->  00:11:59,410
this code to do that association we are gonna
add it down here
128

128

00:11:59,410  -->  00:12:01,760
I'm gonna type in...
129

129

00:12:01,760  -->  00:12:09,280
..and what I'm going to
here is I'm going to do something we haven't done before on the
130

130

00:12:09,280  -->  00:12:14,650
course and their is a separate
section of the course dealing with this
131

131

00:12:14,650  -->  00:12:19,410
I'm going to use an anonymous function
also known as a lambda expression and
132

132

00:12:19,410  -->  00:12:24,600
i'm not going to looking into to much detail about this but keep in mind there is a complete section in the
133

133

00:12:24,600  -->  00:12:27,790
course about lambda expressions or their
will be by the time you watching
134

134

00:12:27,790  -->  00:12:32,540
that section may or may not already exist
but this is just an alternative way to write a
135

135

00:12:32,540  -->  00:12:39,030
function so I want to show you first part of that
anyway so the parameters for that is we
136

136

00:12:39,030  -->  00:12:54,650
need to specify them first so....
137

137

00:12:54,650  -->  00:13:24,950
....
138

138

00:13:24,950  -->  00:13:28,360
...
139

139

00:13:28,360  -->  00:13:45,610
....
140

140

00:13:45,610  -->  00:13:51,400
...so its an alternative
way of adding a list of class adding
141

141

00:13:51,400  -->  00:13:54,800
a listener method by using an anonymous
method but again we'll talk about the
142

142

00:13:54,800  -->  00:13:57,190
lambda expressions in a separate section
143

143

00:13:57,190  -->  00:14:00,990
of the course the bottom line is now that we've
added a listener for the cells empty
144

144

00:14:00,990  -->  00:14:05,360
property where the cell becomes non empty
the context menu is gonna be associated
145

145

00:14:05,360  -->  00:14:09,460
with it the one that we've created in this
video and it does become empty we then
146

146

00:14:09,460  -->  00:14:15,720
remove the association by setting the cells context menu to null so lets now run this and see if it works
147

147

00:14:19,380  -->  00:14:23,130
we should be able to select something like
doctors appointment right click that
148

148

00:14:23,130  -->  00:14:30,990
we now get our context menu showing so click on delete now we can see we got our confirmation dialogue
149

149

00:14:30,990  -->  00:14:35,810
propping up and you can see the item short
description is displaying....
150

150

00:14:35,810  -->  00:14:40,060
....question marks has come
automatically from the the type that we
151

151

00:14:40,060  -->  00:14:46,300
specified and also the cancel and ok buttons have been
added other than that we got our title and the other text
152

152

00:14:46,300  -->  00:14:51,720
we've added showing up on the screen so
its all seemingly working ok and click on
153

153

00:14:51,720  -->  00:14:55,590
cancel just to confirm or cancel it and
try it again right click it delete
154

154

00:14:56,170  -->  00:15:01,960
this time click ok we can see to the left
the to do item did get deleted and the list
155

155

00:15:01,960  -->  00:15:03,710
got refreshed
156

156

00:15:03,710  -->  00:15:08,710
now notice we didn't write any code to remove the item from the
list and that's because we're using data
157

157

00:15:08,710  -->  00:15:11,910
binding and the list  view notice that the
item was deleted from the collection
158

158

00:15:11,910  -->  00:15:14,950
then updated itself accordingly
159

159

00:15:14,950  -->  00:15:18,030
now another way we could let the user to delete item is to listen for the delete key
160

160

00:15:18,030  -->  00:15:22,710
so when the user selects an item and
presses the delete key we could do
161

161

00:15:22,710  -->  00:15:26,770
exactly what we did when the right click
is activated and select delete from the
162

162

00:15:26,770  -->  00:15:32,780
context menu so we'll look at adding that functionality so adding the delete functionality so when you press delete
163

163

00:15:32,780  -->  00:15:36,770
on the keyboard it basically pops up the
context menu will do that in the next
164

164

00:15:36,770  -->  00:15:36,980
video
