00:00:05.600  -->  00:00:07.360
ok so now that we've integrated scene
2

2

00:00:07.360  -->  00:00:09.810
builder into intellij let's go ahead
ok so now that we've integrated scene
3

3

00:00:09.810  -->  00:00:12.370
and create a new javafx project and
builder into intellij let's go ahead
4

4

00:00:12.370  -->  00:00:14.800
see it working and click on create new
and create a new javafx project and
5

5

00:00:14.800  -->  00:00:18.040
project I'm going to select javafx
see it working and click on create new
6

6

00:00:18.040  -->  00:00:20.280
making sure javafx supplication is
project I'm going to select javafx
7

7

00:00:20.280  -->  00:00:22.080
selected and for this one we're just
making sure javafx supplication is
8

8

00:00:22.080  -->  00:00:23.760
going to call this scene builder the
selected and for this one we're just
9

9

00:00:23.760  -->  00:00:30.690
project click on finish making a space
going to call this scene builder the
10

10

00:00:30.690  -->  00:00:33.330
here let's expand this out so we can see our
project click on finish making a space
11

11

00:00:33.330  -->  00:00:35.520
files i'm going to double-click the
here let's expand this out so we can see our
12

12

00:00:35.520  -->  00:00:38.710
sample . fXML and the first thing you
files i'm going to double-click the
13

13

00:00:38.710  -->  00:00:39.790
should notice down here at the bottom
sample . fXML and the first thing you
14

14

00:00:39.790  -->  00:00:41.920
now is that we've got this new
should notice down here at the bottom
15

15

00:00:41.920  -->  00:00:43.720
scene builder tab in the past we've only
now is that we've got this new
16

16

00:00:43.720  -->  00:00:46.120
had text but with now got a scene
scene builder tab in the past we've only
17

17

00:00:46.120  -->  00:00:48.430
builder tab as well if we click on the
had text but with now got a scene
18

18

00:00:48.430  -->  00:00:52.600
scene builder you notice that it's
builder tab as well if we click on the
19

19

00:00:52.600  -->  00:00:53.890
actually popped up
scene builder you notice that it's
20

20

00:00:53.890  -->  00:00:55.750
we've scene builder now within IntelliJ
actually popped up
21

21

00:00:55.750  -->  00:00:58.300
that's almost the same user interface
we've scene builder now within IntelliJ
22

22

00:00:58.300  -->  00:01:00.100
that we saw when we run this the
that's almost the same user interface
23

23

00:01:00.100  -->  00:01:03.100
standalone scene application but the
that we saw when we run this the
24

24

00:01:03.100  -->  00:01:04.930
good thing here now is that scene builder is
standalone scene application but the
25

25

00:01:04.930  -->  00:01:07.690
actually aware of our sample . fxml file
good thing here now is that scene builder is
26

26

00:01:07.690  -->  00:01:09.550
that's actually already loaded the
actually aware of our sample . fxml file
27

27

00:01:09.550  -->  00:01:12.160
contents of that file and any changes we
that's actually already loaded the
28

28

00:01:12.160  -->  00:01:13.960
make within the scene builder will be
contents of that file and any changes we
29

29

00:01:13.960  -->  00:01:16.780
saved to the sample fxml file and also
make within the scene builder will be
30

30

00:01:16.780  -->  00:01:18.040
vice versa
saved to the sample fxml file and also
31

31

00:01:18.040  -->  00:01:19.360
now when running the application
vice versa
32

32

00:01:19.360  -->  00:01:21.940
standalone we also could have loaded the
now when running the application
33

33

00:01:21.940  -->  00:01:24.130
sample fxml file from our
standalone we also could have loaded the
34

34

00:01:24.130  -->  00:01:26.020
project and then any changes will be
sample fxml file from our
35

35

00:01:26.020  -->  00:01:28.420
saved to sample . fxml but I think
project and then any changes will be
36

36

00:01:28.420  -->  00:01:30.430
you'll agree it's far more convenient to
saved to sample . fxml but I think
37

37

00:01:30.430  -->  00:01:33.100
do it all with IntelliJ the ide makes
you'll agree it's far more convenient to
38

38

00:01:33.100  -->  00:01:35.560
the Association without us actually
do it all with IntelliJ the ide makes
39

39

00:01:35.560  -->  00:01:37.450
having to tell the scene builder which of
the Association without us actually
40

40

00:01:37.450  -->  00:01:39.630
fxml file we're working on and its pretty
having to tell the scene builder which of
41

41

00:01:39.630  -->  00:01:40.330
cool
fxml file we're working on and its pretty
42

42

00:01:40.330  -->  00:01:42.160
one thing to point out that with this
cool
43

43

00:01:42.160  -->  00:01:44.830
integration with IntelliJ is that can be
one thing to point out that with this
44

44

00:01:44.830  -->  00:01:47.200
a bit flaky sometimes for example
integration with IntelliJ is that can be
45

45

00:01:47.200  -->  00:01:49.380
sometimes we can change the property and
a bit flaky sometimes for example
46

46

00:01:49.380  -->  00:01:50.920
sometimes we can't and we've got to go to
sometimes we can change the property and
47

47

00:01:50.920  -->  00:01:53.490
the fxml file to do it but fortunately its
sometimes we can't and we've got to go to
48

48

00:01:53.490  -->  00:01:55.240
really easy to flip between the scene
the fxml file to do it but fortunately its
49

49

00:01:55.240  -->  00:01:57.060
builds and the fxml file in
really easy to flip between the scene
50

50

00:01:57.060  -->  00:01:59.230
IntelliJ and just by matter of clicking
builds and the fxml file in
51

51

00:01:59.230  -->  00:02:02.050
on text in scene builder so it's pretty
IntelliJ and just by matter of clicking
52

52

00:02:02.050  -->  00:02:04.450
quick anyway and the two tabs are kept
on text in scene builder so it's pretty
53

53

00:02:04.450  -->  00:02:07.090
in sync and again as a backup you can
quick anyway and the two tabs are kept
54

54

00:02:07.090  -->  00:02:08.740
also use the scene builder stand alone
in sync and again as a backup you can
55

55

00:02:08.740  -->  00:02:11.490
executable if your prefer outside of IntelliJ
also use the scene builder stand alone
56

56

00:02:11.490  -->  00:02:14.260
now if you've got a window open down the
executable if your prefer outside of IntelliJ
57

57

00:02:14.260  -->  00:02:15.820
bottom which you shouldn't have
now if you've got a window open down the
58

58

00:02:15.820  -->  00:02:18.550
make sure you close it to give the scene
bottom which you shouldn't have
59

59

00:02:18.550  -->  00:02:20.200
builder as much room as possible within
make sure you close it to give the scene
60

60

00:02:20.200  -->  00:02:23.110
the ide let's start taking a bit of a
builder as much room as possible within
61

61

00:02:23.110  -->  00:02:24.940
look at the scene builder user interface
the ide let's start taking a bit of a
62

62

00:02:24.940  -->  00:02:26.920
now can click on the scene builder tab
look at the scene builder user interface
63

63

00:02:26.920  -->  00:02:30.790
again obviously the largest area is this
now can click on the scene builder tab
64

64

00:02:30.790  -->  00:02:33.160
middle content area that's the area we
again obviously the largest area is this
65

65

00:02:33.160  -->  00:02:35.770
used to build our user interface on the
middle content area that's the area we
66

66

00:02:35.770  -->  00:02:37.450
left-hand side up here to the top left
used to build our user interface on the
67

67

00:02:37.450  -->  00:02:39.850
we can see all the controls and elements
left-hand side up here to the top left
68

68

00:02:39.850  -->  00:02:41.920
that we can actually use in the user
we can see all the controls and elements
69

69

00:02:41.920  -->  00:02:43.690
interface now some of this should be
that we can actually use in the user
70

70

00:02:43.690  -->  00:02:44.890
familiar if we scroll down the list
interface now some of this should be
71

71

00:02:44.890  -->  00:02:46.930
there because we actually use those in
familiar if we scroll down the list
72

72

00:02:46.930  -->  00:02:49.780
various videos in this section
there because we actually use those in
73

73

00:02:49.780  -->  00:02:52.540
containers which we currently got open lists
various videos in this section
74

74

00:02:52.540  -->  00:02:54.790
the you know all the layouts and
containers which we currently got open lists
75

75

00:02:54.790  -->  00:02:56.680
other classes that will contain ui
the you know all the layouts and
76

76

00:02:56.680  -->  00:02:59.230
controls such as scroll pane grid pane
other classes that will contain ui
77

77

00:02:59.230  -->  00:03:01.300
and h box and next to click on
controls such as scroll pane grid pane
78

78

00:03:01.300  -->  00:03:04.810
controls that contains the controls such
and h box and next to click on
79

79

00:03:04.810  -->  00:03:07.780
as button and label underneath going
controls that contains the controls such
80

80

00:03:07.780  -->  00:03:10.360
down menu that contains all the UI
as button and label underneath going
81

81

00:03:10.360  -->  00:03:12.940
classes we can use to build menus and
down menu that contains all the UI
82

82

00:03:12.940  -->  00:03:14.110
also got a miscellaneous section
classes we can use to build menus and
83

83

00:03:14.110  -->  00:03:16.840
there it's really containing items that
also got a miscellaneous section
84

84

00:03:16.840  -->  00:03:18.520
don't really fit anywhere else like the
there it's really containing items that
85

85

00:03:18.520  -->  00:03:20.920
tooltip class for example and obviously
don't really fit anywhere else like the
86

86

00:03:20.920  -->  00:03:23.770
we've got these other ones shapes charts
tooltip class for example and obviously
87

87

00:03:23.770  -->  00:03:27.070
and the 3d section and we haven't really
we've got these other ones shapes charts
88

88

00:03:27.070  -->  00:03:28.420
covered those in this section because
and the 3d section and we haven't really
89

89

00:03:28.420  -->  00:03:30.490
they're more advanced topics but they
covered those in this section because
90

90

00:03:30.490  -->  00:03:32.860
are there if you want to start using them at
they're more advanced topics but they
91

91

00:03:32.860  -->  00:03:35.410
the bottom of the left hand side you can
are there if you want to start using them at
92

92

00:03:35.410  -->  00:03:37.720
see this area here that's separate from
the bottom of the left hand side you can
93

93

00:03:37.720  -->  00:03:40.090
the list of UI elements right now
see this area here that's separate from
94

94

00:03:40.090  -->  00:03:41.830
you can see it contains a grid pane
the list of UI elements right now
95

95

00:03:41.830  -->  00:03:44.950
zero by zero so this area displays the
you can see it contains a grid pane
96

96

00:03:44.950  -->  00:03:47.680
scene graph for the user interface in
zero by zero so this area displays the
97

97

00:03:47.680  -->  00:03:50.260
the content area if we switch back to
scene graph for the user interface in
98

98

00:03:50.260  -->  00:03:52.630
the contents of the fxml file by clicking
the content area if we switch back to
99

99

00:03:52.630  -->  00:03:54.640
on the text tab down here at the bottom
the contents of the fxml file by clicking
100

100

00:03:54.640  -->  00:03:57.250
we can see that we can see the grid pane
on the text tab down here at the bottom
101

101

00:03:57.250  -->  00:03:59.290
and IntelliJ always generates by
we can see that we can see the grid pane
102

102

00:03:59.290  -->  00:04:01.840
default now since the scene builder is
and IntelliJ always generates by
103

103

00:04:01.840  -->  00:04:04.210
displaying the contents of this file it
default now since the scene builder is
104

104

00:04:04.210  -->  00:04:06.700
of this fxml file it knows
displaying the contents of this file it
105

105

00:04:06.700  -->  00:04:08.770
about the grid pane so just to confirm
of this fxml file it knows
106

106

00:04:08.770  -->  00:04:10.570
that lets actually change the grid pane
about the grid pane so just to confirm
107

107

00:04:10.570  -->  00:04:13.510
to a border pane in the file in the fxml
that lets actually change the grid pane
108

108

00:04:13.510  -->  00:04:14.800
file so make that a border pane
to a border pane in the file in the fxml
109

109

00:04:14.800  -->  00:04:20.710
like so now we switch
file so make that a border pane
110

110

00:04:20.710  -->  00:04:22.300
back to the scene builder tab at this
like so now we switch
111

111

00:04:22.300  -->  00:04:25.720
point will actually get this error and
back to the scene builder tab at this
112

112

00:04:25.720  -->  00:04:27.400
sometimes this will work and display the
point will actually get this error and
113

113

00:04:27.400  -->  00:04:29.350
border pane in the scene graph area with
sometimes this will work and display the
114

114

00:04:29.350  -->  00:04:31.450
a warning icon but other times you'll
border pane in the scene graph area with
115

115

00:04:31.450  -->  00:04:32.200
see what
a warning icon but other times you'll
116

116

00:04:32.200  -->  00:04:34.180
happen here the actual exception the
see what
117

117

00:04:34.180  -->  00:04:36.400
stack trace for an exception and if you
happen here the actual exception the
118

118

00:04:36.400  -->  00:04:37.960
think about it you'll recall that the
stack trace for an exception and if you
119

119

00:04:37.960  -->  00:04:39.970
border pane doesn't support the h gap
think about it you'll recall that the
120

120

00:04:39.970  -->  00:04:42.580
and V gap properties so when the scene
border pane doesn't support the h gap
121

121

00:04:42.580  -->  00:04:44.470
builder tries to load the changes we
and V gap properties so when the scene
122

122

00:04:44.470  -->  00:04:47.350
made to the fxml file its
builder tries to load the changes we
123

123

00:04:47.350  -->  00:04:49.090
actually failing and we are getting the exception
made to the fxml file its
124

124

00:04:49.090  -->  00:04:52.840
so we go back to the fxml file and if you
actually failing and we are getting the exception
125

125

00:04:52.840  -->  00:04:54.730
remove remove the h gap and the v gap
so we go back to the fxml file and if you
126

126

00:04:54.730  -->  00:04:57.250
properties from the border pane as
remove remove the h gap and the v gap
127

127

00:04:57.250  -->  00:04:59.500
well as the alignment delete those all
properties from the border pane as
128

128

00:04:59.500  -->  00:05:02.230
out because obviously those three aren't
well as the alignment delete those all
129

129

00:05:02.230  -->  00:05:04.540
supported by border pane and if in fact
out because obviously those three aren't
130

130

00:05:04.540  -->  00:05:05.710
intelliJ was telling us about
supported by border pane and if in fact
131

131

00:05:05.710  -->  00:05:07.240
highlighting them in red that was the case
intelliJ was telling us about
132

132

00:05:07.240  -->  00:05:08.980
but now that we've done if we switch
highlighting them in red that was the case
133

133

00:05:08.980  -->  00:05:11.260
back to the scene builder notice now
but now that we've done if we switch
134

134

00:05:11.260  -->  00:05:13.480
that we see the scene builder user
back to the scene builder notice now
135

135

interface and will see that the scene
that we see the scene builder user
136

136

00:05:15.250  -->  00:05:17.050
graph down here to the left hand bottom
interface and will see that the scene
137

137

00:05:17.050  -->  00:05:19.930
of the screen displays the border pane
graph down here to the left hand bottom
138

138

00:05:19.930  -->  00:05:22.150
and all its positions so let's actually
of the screen displays the border pane
139

139

00:05:22.150  -->  00:05:23.530
switch our layout back to the grid
and all its positions so let's actually
140

140

00:05:23.530  -->  00:05:25.480
pane back to text again I'm just going
switch our layout back to the grid
141

141

00:05:25.480  -->  00:05:28.540
to undo those changes go back to how it
pane back to text again I'm just going
142

142

00:05:28.540  -->  00:05:30.280
was by default before making those
to undo those changes go back to how it
143

143

00:05:30.280  -->  00:05:33.250
changes theirs our grid pane again and again
was by default before making those
144

144

00:05:33.250  -->  00:05:35.020
back to the scene builder again and you
changes theirs our grid pane again and again
145

145

00:05:35.020  -->  00:05:36.280
can see we can see the grid pane
back to the scene builder again and you
146

146

00:05:36.280  -->  00:05:38.410
showing again in the scene graph area
can see we can see the grid pane
147

147

00:05:38.410  -->  00:05:40.960
right at this point let's now a select
showing again in the scene graph area
148

148

00:05:40.960  -->  00:05:42.700
the grid pane in the scene graph the area
right at this point let's now a select
149

149

00:05:42.700  -->  00:05:46.120
by clicking on it now when we do so you
the grid pane in the scene graph the area
150

150

00:05:46.120  -->  00:05:47.620
probably saw that to the area on the
by clicking on it now when we do so you
151

151

00:05:47.620  -->  00:05:49.000
right hand side of the content area
probably saw that to the area on the
152

152

00:05:49.000  -->  00:05:51.010
displays the properties we can actually
right hand side of the content area
153

153

00:05:51.010  -->  00:05:54.100
set on the grid pane in my case and
displays the properties we can actually
154

154

00:05:54.100  -->  00:05:55.480
maybe in your case you might have to
set on the grid pane in my case and
155

155

00:05:55.480  -->  00:05:57.310
adjust the screen so you can actually
maybe in your case you might have to
156

156

00:05:57.310  -->  00:05:59.260
read all the various properties and their
adjust the screen so you can actually
157

157

00:05:59.260  -->  00:06:00.910
names i'm just going to expand it out so
read all the various properties and their
158

158

00:06:00.910  -->  00:06:02.080
I can read it all
names i'm just going to expand it out so
159

159

00:06:02.080  -->  00:06:03.850
that's probably enough to see what we
I can read it all
160

160

00:06:03.850  -->  00:06:07.390
need to see it in terms of the contents
that's probably enough to see what we
161

161

00:06:07.390  -->  00:06:10.300
on this right-hand pane which will call
need to see it in terms of the contents
162

162

00:06:10.300  -->  00:06:13.270
the settings pane we've got what's
on this right-hand pane which will call
163

163

00:06:13.270  -->  00:06:14.680
actually going to show up will depend on
the settings pane we've got what's
164

164

00:06:14.680  -->  00:06:17.770
whatever selected in the scene graph and
actually going to show up will depend on
165

165

00:06:17.770  -->  00:06:19.690
it's actually divided into three areas
whatever selected in the scene graph and
166

166

00:06:19.690  -->  00:06:22.060
under properties the first component
it's actually divided into three areas
167

167

00:06:22.060  -->  00:06:23.980
here will find the various properties
under properties the first component
168

168

00:06:23.980  -->  00:06:25.990
that don't actually affect how the
here will find the various properties
169

169

00:06:25.990  -->  00:06:28.300
controls are laid out within the pane
that don't actually affect how the
170

170

00:06:28.300  -->  00:06:30.430
for example you can see the gridlines
controls are laid out within the pane
171

171

00:06:30.430  -->  00:06:32.440
visible property doesn't alter the
for example you can see the gridlines
172

172

00:06:32.440  -->  00:06:34.120
positioning of the controls within the
visible property doesn't alter the
173

173

00:06:34.120  -->  00:06:36.790
grid pane now the layout section which

180

00:06:45.700  -->  00:06:48.810
h gap and the v gap properties and

181

181

00:06:48.810  -->  00:06:50.860
the final section down here which I click is the
h gap and the v gap properties and

187

00:07:01.180  -->  00:07:03.610
tour of the basics of scene builder
alright so that's a bit of a whirlwind

00:07:03.610  -->  00:07:06.150
going to finish the video here in the
tour of the basics of scene builder
189

189

00:07:06.150  -->  00:07:07.270
next video we're going to start actually
going to finish the video here in the
190

190

00:07:07.270  -->  00:07:09.840
generating something creating a bit of a
next video we're going to start actually
191

191

00:07:09.840  -->  00:07:12.300
layout just to see how the tools work so
generating something creating a bit of a
192

192

00:07:12.300  -->  00:07:13.770
let's start working on that in the next
layout just to see how the tools work so
193

193

00:07:13.770  -->  00:07:19.220
video
let's start working on that in the next
