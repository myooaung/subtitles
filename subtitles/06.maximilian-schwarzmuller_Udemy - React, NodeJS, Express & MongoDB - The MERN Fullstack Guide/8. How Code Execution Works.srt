1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,390
This is basically it for this note express refresher.

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,480
Now obviously there is more to note and more to express.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,310
We'll learn about a lot of our features throughout our course project.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,730
I don't want to explain everything about note Express here in this refresher.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,610
Instead of we'll all learn more things later.

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,310
But as I also already mentioned earlier this course doesn't replace a complete note.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,010
EXPRESS course I do have a dedicated course for that.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,910
So if you want to learn everything about note express then definitely have a look at that course as

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,780
well.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,300
One final thing which I want to do here.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,050
Is I really want to make sure that we all understand how this code executes and when what executes because

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:50,660
that can be confusing at times when we start Node 1 with NPM start or we run our file with node app

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,280
s which does the same.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,560
If we ignore the life reloading functionality then what happens.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,930
It's important to understand that when you execute this file with node the entire file is passed and

16
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,990
executed.

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,090
So this means these imports are passed and executed.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,960
So no chess goes into these packages runs their code and gives us back whatever they export we'll see

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,060
these export syntax and how we can use it on our own later by the way they're after this concern is

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,790
created and then all these you is post and get methods are called as well as the list method.

21
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:32,330
What's not being executed immediately when we execute this file are these middleware functions here

22
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,930
not because node has a special exception for them but because of the way javascript works.

23
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:47,010
These functions here are callback functions provided as arguments to post use and get and therefore

24
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,280
javascript registers them.

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,300
Stores a reference a pointer to that function in memory but only executes them once there are getting

26
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,050
called and we are never calling these functions.

27
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,240
Instead with post you isn't get.

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:11,480
We basically let express J s set up some logic which will execute these functions for us when a request

29
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,880
is reaching our server and that request meets our criteria here.

30
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:23,690
So it's a post request with this path or a get request with this path or in case of does where any request.

31
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,440
Only then these functions get executed it can all be confusing that here.

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,030
It doesn't look like we're actually passing a function instead I am executing a method here.

33
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,100
Well this actually returns a function though so here does all the registers.

34
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:47,030
Such a to be executed function and these functions really only run for incoming requests not when we

35
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,740
start our server and execute app chars with node no D middleware functions are executed for incoming

36
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,230
requests on these requests and that's it with the refresher.

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,140
I hope the basics are clear again check out further resources like the course or the official docs of

38
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,230
note and express if you want to learn more.

39
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,390
With that we can move on to the node express app for our actual course project and start working on

40
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,750
that.
