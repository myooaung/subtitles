To handle the form submission we need then you function in the new place component.

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.010
Name it plays ad or place submit handler NAME IS UP TO YOU.

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.360
AND THERE WE GET THE EVENT object and that is important because first of all I want to call event prevent

4
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.200
default.

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.940
Why.

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.720
Because I want to make sure that we don't have that browser default of submitting the form and sending

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.030
a request which effectively leads to a page reload and Dale for crashes where it ends our running single

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.460
page application.

9
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.850
Please submit handler is then bound here to the forum.

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.790
So on submit this year's set to place submit handler

11
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.770
and with that set here in the place submit handler.

12
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.050
We now can send our data to the server.

13
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.130
Now of course at the moment we have no logic to send it to a server we have no server yet we have no

14
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.300
back and yet.

15
00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:03.430
This will change later in the course for the moment let's simply console log our form state inputs data

16
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.090
here to find out whether we have all the data stored in form state correctly so devalue and the validity

17
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.010
for all our inputs.

18
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:21.470
So if now safety's and we enter something here and here and a click at place we don't reload the page

19
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.460
which is great.

20
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.870
And here indeed we have the output I want I'm logging this here we have the description with the title

21
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.950
and we're storing the values and the validity correctly here.

22
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.280
So this is working and later we will be able to send this to the back end.

23
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.150
So that is what will happen later and that is how easy form submission is our form is not finished.

24
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.410
Though of course we got the title and the description.

25
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.960
Now we need more inputs though so I'll copy this and add another input here because besides the description

26
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.190
and the title I also want to have an address for every place here.

27
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.800
The element will again be input not a text area.

28
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.650
And here I will say address now address does not have a mean length but it should not be empty so I

29
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:17.280
will again execute this required or function to configure it is required validator and the error text

30
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.940
here is Please enter a valid address will not check if the address exists will later do this on the

31
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:31.050
back and not here on the front end that should already be although that is the great advantage of having

32
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.230
this reusable input component and this reusable Input handler function we can add a new input as simple

33
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.940
as that and it should automatically be taken into account.

34
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.100
Yeah everything is only valid here if I enter at least one character into address and if I then invalidate

35
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.820
one of the other inputs we lose that again.

36
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.950
So this all works as it should.

37
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.530
We can submit this is all the part of our form state here of course the address was that we're finished

38
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.440
we will later also add image upload but we have a separate module for that and hence I'm happy with

39
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.280
that for we could send it to a server.

40
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.850
It's not the only form we have though.

41
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.360
What about editing places there.

42
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.650
We also need to be able to at least edit some of the aspects of a place.
