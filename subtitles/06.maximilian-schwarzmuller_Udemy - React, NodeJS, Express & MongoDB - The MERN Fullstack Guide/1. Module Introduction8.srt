1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:08,340
So we got a basic idea of how the Mertens stack works and how did different pieces work together.

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,330
As I mentioned throughout this course you will not only get refreshers about the individual building

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:21,710
blocks but most importantly will build an entire application where you can see all these pieces build

4
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:28,100
out individually and then come together when we connect all the different blocks with each other.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:34,940
Now this project which we're going to build is a project we of course have to plan before we dive into

6
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,600
it.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,800
So in this module I want to plan a reactive work specifically the entire merged project with you because

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:50,660
this hopefully also helps you approach your next project and get an idea of what you might want to keep

9
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:57,050
in mind what you have to think about before you get started and how you can create a plan for the thing

10
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,120
you're trying to build.

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,900
Now for that there are a couple of general planning steps for which will walk in this module so that

12
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:13,170
by the end of the module we have a clear plan of what we want to build and how we want to build it.

13
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:21,170
The first step for that of course is that you need an idea you want to solve some problem that off nor

14
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,840
typically will not be a step you have to think about and specifically dive into.

15
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:33,350
Because more often than not you will have an idea and then you want to start planning an app that solves

16
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,990
the problem or that works on that idea.

17
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,650
So this is only a rough first step which typically can already be checked off the list by the time we

18
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,540
were getting started.

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:52,730
So the next step the real first step after you have an idea you want to solve a problem is that you

20
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:59,970
create a sign you sketch out the application you want to build at least this is what I like to do.

21
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:06,740
If I'm building a front end and that by the way is really important the steps I'm giving you here are

22
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:13,190
not the objectively correct steps you have to go through whatever you're trying to build.

23
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,330
These are the steps that work for me for you.

24
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,060
Do you order might be different.

25
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,330
Maybe you have some other step maybe you don't need a specific step.

26
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,890
I'm just sharing my personal approach here with you.

27
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,350
So I got an idea and now I want to create a design I want to sketch out the application.

28
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:38,930
Now when I talk about creating the design year you could really work with the signed tools like frame

29
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,490
or X or a Sketch app or Photoshop and build your design there.

30
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,110
Now I'm not a designer and this is not a design course.

31
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,500
So we're not going to do that here often.

32
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,000
This is all a task you will probably outsource because chances are you want to focus on writing the

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,040
code and you also are not a designer.

34
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:06,220
Hence here in this module we'll just draw the general skeleton will sketch out the application will

35
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,460
not really set up a specific design for this application here.

36
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,770
Of course we want to make sure it looks nice but that's something we'll do when we implemented I already

37
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,360
prepared some nice styles and colors for you there.

38
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,370
So once we get the general skeleton we sketched out the general front end of this application.

39
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:32,150
We of course also have to think about the data we work with both in the front end but also more importantly

40
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,570
on the back end of our application.

41
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:42,890
So we want to plan our data models the data we or our app will work with which entities do we need and

42
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:48,770
which data do we need to send across the wire from front to back end and then all the from node expressed

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,730
to the database does of course is a crucial part because that is a part that will affect all building

44
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,100
blocks of your merged application.

45
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:05,000
Now once the data model is clear and we got our front and sketched out we of course have to plan our

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,150
back and end points and the page yes you could put that into quotes because we don't really have more

47
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,520
than one page but the different components you could say you want to have on the front and in your single

48
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:23,750
page application These are the steps I want to go through together with you we'll do it here in this

49
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,410
module.

50
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:31,490
And this is my rough planning process I go through whenever I approach a new project.

51
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,240
Now obviously you can do way more work on all these steps.

52
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,390
You can always come up with a complete to sign on your own.

53
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,300
But as I mentioned since this course is not primarily about the signing and so on I want to keep this

54
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,140
module short and just give you a general idea of how this works.
