00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.310
Enough of the fury.

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.660
Let's get started with Mongo DB You know in a good place to get started is here.

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.720
Mongo D.B. dot.com you have two options to work with Hmong would you be one option would be to go to

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.570
software and then select a community server this would allow you to download Hmong would you be locally

5
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.690
to a machine if you click onto this option here then you should select the community server select your

6
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.330
operating system that goes in my case and then you can simply download it by clicking onto this button.

7
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.890
This is one option so to install it on your machine will use a different solution down and you can find

8
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.640
the solution actually right here difficult to get started for free or you can go to cloud and Atlas

9
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.390
Mongolia TV Atlas is a fully managed cloud service hosting your Mongol TB database and the great thing

10
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.160
is that the basic version of it can be used for free and this version is totally sufficient for the

11
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.900
purpose of this course for largescale scale applications you might have to select the paid version No

12
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.980
but well that's of course depending on your application type you want to use but for the course this

13
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.550
is perfect.

14
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.530
So what you can do then is who can click right here and start free and now you should enter your email

15
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.530
first name last name and password and then you can click right here to sign into melody Atlas or as

16
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.790
I do have an account already.

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.190
Item please select log in right here or sign it right there.

18
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.100
So you have plenty of options actually.

19
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.800
And then you should see this starting screen right here.

20
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.080
You can create new projects this menu.

21
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.780
I'm here in this refresh a project.

22
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.480
But if you start Hmong would you be at least the first time.

23
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.130
This is what you can see here and the first thing you have to do is you have to create a so-called cluster.

24
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.010
The cluster is basically your server in the cloud.

25
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.810
Running your Mongol TB database.

26
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.570
It's called a cluster because it could contain multiple servers to allow horizontal scaling but this

27
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.520
is not part of the free version and also not required for the course.

28
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.870
Therefore we can click Build a cluster.

29
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.080
Now select those start to cluster.

30
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.410
You can see it's for free.

31
00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.840
That's the important thing.

32
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.640
You don't have some more advanced options but I guess it's totally fine.

33
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.740
So click on to create a cluster here and now you can select the cloud provider will go with a W S here

34
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.540
and then you only have to select well all services with the free tier available.

35
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.190
Hint here.

36
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.440
So we will use the server North American of Virginia.

37
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.000
You can select a cluster tier but all is important here free forever.

38
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.690
That doesn't sound too bad I would say we don't need a backup so this is also fine and you can find

39
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.280
a faster name we'll stick to cluster zero here and then we can click Create cluster.

40
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.590
And with that we are done with the first step.

41
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.220
As you can see this might take a few minutes but then this cluster is created.

42
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.570
And with that we can run our mortgage you beat database there are two more things you have to do though

43
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.000
because at the moment we only have the server but we need to access it and to get access to the server

44
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.160
we need to work on the security settings.

45
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.110
You can find these settings right here in the left part of the screen and let us first go to network

46
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.840
access here.

47
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.860
You have to whitelist an IP address.

48
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.690
This means you have to specify which machine which computer or which server in the end is allowed to

49
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.550
interact with the database.

50
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.980
Here I'm working with a local development environment.

51
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.170
Therefore I have to at my AP address here.

52
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.200
You have to add your IP address of course so click onto an IP address.

53
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.800
Now you can simply select at current IP address.

54
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.930
You can also allow access from anywhere.

55
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.210
That's not what I wanted.

56
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.230
I'd stick to my current IP address and very important the IP address might change from time to time.

57
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.660
Therefore in case you don't have data access.

58
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.460
After a while.

59
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.670
Make sure to check your IP address again and to update this IP whitelist here.

60
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.880
So now we can confirm this.

61
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.060
And also very important.

62
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.350
As I said at the moment this IP address is the IP from my local machine.

63
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.430
Once you deploy an application to a real server in the Internet you should provide the IP of the server.

64
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.500
Of course important is always that interaction between your back end and the database is set up correctly.

65
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.560
This can take a while but now my net access is active.

66
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.330
So my machine can interact with the database but there is another thing we have to configure and this

67
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.430
is database access meaning that we need to create a user which corresponding user credentials which

68
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.320
is then allowed to access the database.

69
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.950
So we go to database access and now create a new user here for the off indication will use password

70
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.340
and you should select a user with either the admin privileges or in our case we didn't write to any

71
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.680
database is also sufficient.

72
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.710
So we go with this one.

73
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.260
Let's give the user name and menu.

74
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.290
So that's my name and you can now either manually create the password or generate a secure password.

75
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.650
I can show you this one right here.

76
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.760
Of course these credentials are no longer valid at the time that you're watching this course of doesn't

77
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.600
make sense to copy paste these.

78
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.630
And now we can add user and with that we are actually done.

79
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.010
It just takes a few more seconds.

80
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.430
As you can see some changes that are still deployed.

81
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.030
But if you go back to our cluster.

82
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.500
Yeah.

83
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.630
As you can see it still takes a few seconds.

84
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.790
So let's wait until this process is finished and now it's done.

85
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.170
So with that we have of working Mongo TB cluster with the right access and a configured user.

86
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.720
What's missing of course is well a back in which allows us to interact with that database.

87
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.430
This will also help us to understand this cluster database collections and document structure.

88
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.130
I was referring to earlier in this module therefore in the next lecture it's time to set up a really

89
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.940
basic backend which would then allow us to connect with this database.
