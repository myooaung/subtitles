No one ever or I just sport that indie application we built is that I forgot to change something and

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:15,850
NAV links here where I load my places I always pointed you one and as a result when being logged in

3
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:20,600
if I click my places I always get this error here.

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:30,030
Now therefore we should change this of course this year should be bound dynamically to a string where

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:36,600
we say something that Nemec and then slash places and the dynamic thing here is coming from the off

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,200
contexts and should be our user I.D. so that we use the real user I.D. here and not that dummy user

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,070
I.D..

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,520
So with that if we are logging in here and I go to my places I might not find any places for this specific

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,010
user if he hasn't created any.

10
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,860
But if we have a place like here a dummy place I created behind the scenes then we do succeed.

11
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,110
So that is an adjustment I should make fixed that Annapolis to ensure that your navigation app works

12
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,650
correctly.
