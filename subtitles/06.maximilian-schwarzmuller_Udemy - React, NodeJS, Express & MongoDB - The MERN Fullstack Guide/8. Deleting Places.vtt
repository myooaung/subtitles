00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.560
So let's now delete the place.

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.000
The great thing is that we can apply all the previously learned knowledge here because India and Indian

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.060
deleting a place simply means to find a place by specific idea and then to delete it.

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.360
That's the main thing have to do right here for that.

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:24.840
Here in narrow delete place constant we can get rid of all our dummy code that we have in here and let

6
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.460
us now again create let place because it will be the same logic that before we need a try catch block

7
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.520
once again and inside this try catch block we need to find our place so place should again be equal

8
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.040
to place dot find by I.D. because again the place I.D. is what you're looking for right here.

9
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.700
So let's at police I.D..

10
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.400
And once again finding a place is of course an asynchronous task.

11
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.520
Therefore we should add a sink right here and a wait ahead of place.

12
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.650
So that's the logic to find the place.

13
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:11.040
Once again we catch our error um and we store stored in a constant should be equal to new HDP era.

14
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.610
And let us say this.

15
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.100
Something went wrong.

16
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.160
Could not delete place and Arrow Code Five hundred.

17
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.690
Let's return next.

18
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.430
Error.

19
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.160
All these steps we did before basically.

20
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.770
So this is finding the place.

21
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.600
The first step.

22
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.370
Now we have to delete it from our database of course for that.

23
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.240
As for saving the data in the end we again use.

24
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.460
Catch and insert our try catch block we use plays that remove this time.

25
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.550
So for we had the safe method.

26
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.950
Now we have to remove method by the way before all that repetition of the code here.

27
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.500
I am aware of the fact that we could refactor the code to save this partially duplicate code for redacted

28
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.990
reasons.

29
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.020
I won't refactor record at this stage so that we can repeat this logic one less time here.

30
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.260
So with that we can remove our replace also an asynchronous task.

31
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.530
Therefore we should add a weight right here to make sure this works correctly in case of an error.

32
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.210
I'll just copy this code up here.

33
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.500
Same error code and we also have to return our next error.

34
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.220
One less time here and with that we are actually done already because you're changing our response doesn't

35
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.880
make a lot of sense because we won't get back any document.

36
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.450
Well as remove it and with that if we save this now and go back and create one last request here this

37
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.940
time this should be a delete request.

38
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.770
And again the idea of the place that we created right here in our post requests this idea right here.

39
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.470
If we do so we don't have to add any additional information here.

40
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.660
And if in our present we get the message delete it place and if everything work correctly here if we

41
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.900
go back to our database and reloaded

42
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.990
or we can see our query results shows zero.

43
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.960
So we don't have any more places in our database.

44
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.190
And with that we finished our CRUD operations here at least for the places.

45
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.310
But what is missing at the stage of course are our users because we only work in our places controller

46
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.510
so far but we actually also get the user's controller here.

47
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.760
Here we still have our dummy users so it's time to change that.

48
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.420
Now in the next lectures.
