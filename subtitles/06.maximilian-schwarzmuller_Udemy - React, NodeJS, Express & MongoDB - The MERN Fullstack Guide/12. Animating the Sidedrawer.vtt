00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:08.420
To add an animation to the sidebar I'll install a new third party library with npm install dash dash

2
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.090
safe and the name of that library is react dash transition dash group.

3
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.900
I explain it in more details in my react A Complete Guide course.

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.900
It is simply a library that makes it easy for us to play a little animation if we add an item to the

5
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.520
DOM so to say if we render item for the first time or if we then remove it.

6
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.720
That is where this library helps us.

7
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.000
So let's wait for it to finish installing and now that it is installed.

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.750
We can restart our development server with NPM start and use that library here inside draw for that

9
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.190
import something from react transition group and that something is to see us s transition component

10
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.400
so that's a component provided by this third party library.

11
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.290
It's a component you should wrap around this a site element here so see SS transition can be used as

12
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.910
a component in JS X and is wrapped around a site.

13
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.680
Now here we need to configure it.

14
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.700
We need to tell this library when exactly this sidebar becomes visible.

15
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.730
We do this with the M prop on CSX transition and I want to bind this to props show.

16
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.840
So I expect to get a show prop on the side drawer which we don't get at the moment but which we have

17
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.860
to add which in the end is true.

18
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.450
If the sidebar should be visible and false if it should be invisible.

19
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.080
If it should be removed I'll add a timeout which is the duration of the animation and you're all set

20
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.650
up to 200 milliseconds and a class names property important class names not class name class names it's

21
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.050
a special prop except that by this component and this should be slide dash in slash left.

22
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.140
Which in the end is a CSI as animation to find an index C as as you can see it there.

23
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.220
It's a couple of C as is classes with Dash enter dash interactive and so on at the end and these are

24
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.700
special class names which this third party library knows how to use and which it applies in sequence

25
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.440
when it animates the element in or animates it out allows but the least i'll add mount on enter an unmanned

26
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.430
on exit to tell that component at the third party library that the aside component which is inside of

27
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.400
the CEOs s transition component should really be added to the DOM or be removed from the DOM when it

28
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.110
should become visible or invisible.

29
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.320
Otherwise it's just animated out or in and not really removed.

30
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.440
Here I want to have it removed or added depending on its state so now we just have to make sure we use

31
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.890
this show prop properly so to side draw.

32
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.860
We should pass a show prop so back in May navigation all changed to logic when How does side draw is

33
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.780
rendered.

34
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.530
It's not always part of J is X but it's not always visible because now we set that show prop and set

35
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.180
this to draw is open which is true or false and then ends of side draw.

36
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.650
We have the logic to control whether to draw is visible or not.

37
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.240
So if we now safeties and that recompile now we can click this button.

38
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.630
And now you see you have a nice little in and out animation.

39
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.020
When you opened a drawer on desktop mode of course this has no effect.

40
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.550
Dear everything worked before but now we always have a nice working mobile.

41
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.490
You and with that out of the way I'd say this doesn't look too bad.

42
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:37.280
Now we can go back to more logic related to our core application for example show to places for a chosen

43
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.610
user.

44
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.800
Now one thing I noticed of course that's missing on our sidebar is at the moment when we click on one

45
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.710
of the links it stays open it navigates to the new page but we manually have to close it by clicking

46
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.130
on the background which is not ideal.

47
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.530
Fixing it is easy though in a sidebar or a component on the site we can add on click listener so to

48
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.300
say so does on click prop which is basically supported on any default H html element and then for word

49
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.380
days events so to say or the function we want to call to props on click or put in other words.

50
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.810
We expect that on the sidebar component we get a function passed to the on click prop off the sidebar

51
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.480
component and we then pass that function we get there on to the on click problem the aside element.

52
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.350
So in the place where we use the side door which is the main navigation we now also have to add does

53
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:42.060
on click prop we're expecting there and there we can point at close draw just like this and I will also

54
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:50.310
rename my functions here to on draw handler and close draw handler while some added just to be consistent

55
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.890
with the naming I use in the other places of the app where I always named the functions that are called

56
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.840
upon events with a handler at the end.

57
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.780
So with that if we now as safeties and we go back you will see if you click on a drawer it closes but

58
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.690
there for all when we click on one of the links we get navigated there but we also close to draw which

59
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.650
of course is to go.
