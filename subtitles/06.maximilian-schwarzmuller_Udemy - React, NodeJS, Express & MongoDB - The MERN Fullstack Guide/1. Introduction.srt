It's amazing to have you on board as a student now in this course.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,640
You will learn all about the merge stack.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:14,010
You will learn how to build amazing full stack web applications with longer TB express reactions yes

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,160
and no chance and you will learn all of that not just in theory but actually applied in practice to

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,190
a real course project which we will build from scratch a project that shows you how these pieces work

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:32,520
together and which will all include important topics like file upload and user authentication so that

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,390
by the end of the course you will be able to build your own full stack.

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,850
Web applications with these technologies.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,820
Now that's the course.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,620
But who am I.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,120
My name is Max and I will be one of your instructors in this course.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,620
I will be responsible for the parts about react note expressing how we combine all these things including

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,850
authentication.

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,820
But in this course I'm joined by manual among Would you be expert who will be your instructor and guide

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,040
in the database related sections.

17
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,610
Hi EMMANUEL I'm a data scientist and Mongo TB expert.

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,620
Now you know what this course is all about.

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,380
But what are your course requirements.

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,830
What do you have to bring to the table to succeed in this course.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,530
In this course you will learn how to connect node express Hmong would you be and react and the connection

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,750
is the core focus of this course.

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,610
Therefore this course does not dive deeply into each of these technologies.

24
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,920
The course comes with refreshers on react.

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,060
Hmong would be a note but the refreshers are well refreshers.

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,810
If you really want to dive deep in her make sure to check out dedicated courses on these topics but

27
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,810
for discourse basic react Chase.

28
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,810
Knowledge is highly recommended and also basic knowledge of no chase helps a lot to succeed here.

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,970
These are the core requirements of this course.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,700
And with that it's now time to dive into the course.
