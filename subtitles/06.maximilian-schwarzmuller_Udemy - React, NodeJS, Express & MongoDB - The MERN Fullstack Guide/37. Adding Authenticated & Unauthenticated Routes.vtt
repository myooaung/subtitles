00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:08.410
So let's make sure that when we click log in in the off page we do actually log in or at least we fake

2
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.240
it.

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.500
So India off J.S. file in user pages I will import use context.

4
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:22.750
And of course I will also import my off context here from the shared folder the context folder and the

5
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.950
off context file and then here in the off page we can also get access to this off object by calling

6
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:39.310
use context on the off context we can use this off object and the log and method we have there inside

7
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.080
of our submit handler there besides logging what the user entered.

8
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:52.620
I would call off log in like this and this should already update the context and that data manage there

9
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.260
and therefore also the user interface.

10
00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.320
So if I enter some valid data here so that the log in button gets enabled you see that changed here

11
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.030
in the navigation.

12
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.290
Now of course it would also be nice to then redirect the user though it would be nice to then leave

13
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.440
this page at a very elegant way of doing that is that we go to the app J as file where we set up all

14
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.500
the routes and we simply set up different routes for you locked in and not locked in state and we set

15
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.720
up different re directions as well which makes sure that when the state switches we get redirected so

16
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:35.630
for that here in app trace I will add a new variable routes and now we can check if is logged in which

17
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.720
is a state we're managing an app yes if data is true if it is true I'll set rules to a specific set

18
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.600
of routes if it is not true.

19
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.660
So in the Ellis case routes will be a different set of routes so let's maybe start with the routes that

20
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.060
are relevant if we're not logged in.

21
00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:05.670
And so in the else block there I want to bring my route route so let's copy that here

22
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:18.510
and I also want to bring my user I.D. places route because we can view places of a user even if we are

23
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.210
not logged in and we're already getting an error here multiple route level JSA X elements next to each

24
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.520
other.

25
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.820
Never a great ideas let's use a react fragment to wrap them and let's continue adding routes now.

26
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.070
So we have the route route we have user edgy places.

27
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.670
I don't want to have the new place route.

28
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.600
I don't want to have to update placed road.

29
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.690
I absolutely want the off route so I will add that as well because we should be able to reach the off

30
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.800
page if we are not authenticated and I will also add a redirection here where we should always be redirected

31
00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.750
to slash off actually as a default maybe so that if we are on any route which is not handled before

32
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.690
we are redirected to slash off.

33
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.760
Now let's copy that set up here and use it and be logged in case here.

34
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.630
Here to routes will be different.

35
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.200
I do have that users and the user places route.

36
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.160
I don't have the.

37
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.870
Off route though we shouldn't be able to go to the off page.

38
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:28.090
Instead we need to routes for a new place and for updating a place so let's copy that and for redirecting

39
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.650
we also need a different logic if we are authenticated.

40
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.430
I want to redirect to the starting page.

41
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.350
Let's say for invalid routes we are on

42
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:49.200
now with that we can go down and here in switch we can replace the routes we have there with the value

43
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.190
in our routes variable.

44
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.000
Now let's see if that works if we save that this reloads.

45
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.450
I'm on the off page I can go to all users and to the places of users for click here on edit.

46
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.830
I don't go to the OP that route though because we haven't to find this in the unsophisticated state

47
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.620
which is good.

48
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.740
We'll of course make sure that this button doesn't even exist in a second.

49
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.580
So on authenticate if I now do log in I am redirected thereafter and I can go to ad place could not

50
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.170
find place.

51
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.900
That's interesting.

52
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.540
We should take care about that and I can go to my places and to the update placed page and that's all

53
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.890
working.

54
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.860
Now what's causing this could not find place thing here.

55
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:39.160
Let's have a look and the problem probably is that I have this route here where I look for a place idea

56
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.280
and as I said new is interpreted as such and actually the switch statement is not working correctly

57
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.770
here.

58
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.800
I do enter it all into a switch statement but the react fragment in between seems to destroy things.

59
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.280
It's not a problem though we can just replace react fragment with switch here

60
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.920
in both route setups and then down there where I enter my routes I just get rid of the switch statement

61
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.980
because it's now part of the routes variable already was that does reloads and we should be able to

62
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.500
now go to new place to at place without that warning.

63
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.100
Yeah so that is all working does all those still works here.

64
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.060
And now let's make sure we also render a logout button which allows us to log out and we don't render

65
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.410
these two buttons if we are not locked in here I am logged in.

66
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.480
But if we're not locked in I don't want to render them side note later will also make sure that we only

67
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.860
see them if we are the user who created this for the moment we can ignore that.

68
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.140
So as before I definitely feel free to add that logout button on your own and to make sure that you

69
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.940
also get rid of these buttons here if we're not locked in in the next lecture we'll again do it together.
