00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.550
So this is the big picture.

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.690
But what's inside this course now.

3
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.850
We are almost done getting started.

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.010
And in the next module we'll dive into the moon in theory.

5
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.640
So we'll have a look at all the four core components of the stack.

6
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.150
To be express react and know chairs.

7
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.080
We'll see how this work and how they are connected to both finally build the moon stack with that theoretical

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.240
part out of the way.

9
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.830
It's time to dive into our course project then we will start with the react front end for this.

10
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.980
We'll use futures like components hawks routing and we'll also add front end user input validation.

11
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.780
And with that towards the end of this module we will have a nice looking and from a front and perspective

12
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.710
working application.

13
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.880
What's missing here of course is the back and then he will focus onto note and express.

14
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.720
We create our own REST API implement our own roads use controllers and models and as we did it for the

15
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.370
front end.

16
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.900
Now it's time for the back end user input validation presets that will also learn how we can connect

17
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.070
our back end to a real database.

18
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.480
Mom would you be in our case here with that the back and we'll be finished.

19
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.680
What's missing here of course now is the connection of these two ends.

20
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.120
And that's what's going to happen in the next module.

21
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.370
With that we will have our first draft of the working Marine application here.

22
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.170
Few things are missing though at this stage one thing is file upload covered in the next module.

23
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.220
Here we will learn how we can store files images in our case on our own server following the file upload

24
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.560
the broken authentication the authentication module will mainly cover the user sign up and the user

25
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.440
log in logic so that only if you are locked in for example you can access certain parts of our application.

26
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.770
And with that our application will be built.

27
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.800
We will have a full moon stack application at this stage.

28
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.880
There is only one last thing missing and this is the last module which concludes the course the deployment

29
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.390
module because up to this point we were working in a local development environment.

30
00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.020
Here we will learn how we can deploy our app to a real server in the Internet.

31
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.900
So as you can see lots of topics to cover in this course.

32
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.710
Lots of things to learn and to explore.

33
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.180
And before we dive into the course now let's have a look at how you can get the most out of this course.
