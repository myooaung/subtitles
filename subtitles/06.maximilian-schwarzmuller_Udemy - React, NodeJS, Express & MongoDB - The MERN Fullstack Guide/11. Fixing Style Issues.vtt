Now before we deploy everything has one app lets just fixed as little styling issue in the end we're

2
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.930
getting this here from this div where we have the card which is getting rendered here for our user item

3
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.990
here which applies its own card style and where we don't have user item content which should overwrite

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.720
that is style.

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.940
Now the problem here is that the president's CEOs s use this here is such that our card style overrides

6
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.280
are a user item style here which should reset the padding to zero.

7
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.620
And the reason for that simply is related to the order of styles in which they're imported here into

8
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.120
our H.M. file.

9
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.590
Now a quick work around around that is that in user item here on padding we add to good old important

10
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.100
flag or.

11
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.570
This allows us to ensure that this definitely gets added.

12
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.860
Alternatively since we know that this will be applied on our card we could also make our rule here a

13
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.940
bit more specific and say this applies when you have a card style combined with that which would override

14
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.770
the raw card style.

15
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.830
So the pure card C is S class being added.

16
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.780
This is how you could adjust as to make sure that the styling looks the way it should.

17
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.030
That however was just a minor thing.

18
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.810
Still I wanted to share my thoughts on that here.

19
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.470
The main thing I'm interested here is of course how we can now make sure that we serve both react front

20
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.760
and note Express back and from the same server because thus far we were of course using two servers.
