00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.120
React is all about components.

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.500
Now what does this mean this year.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.980
This function here is of course a regular jobs could function but it's also a react component.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.180
What makes up a react component a react component can be one of two things.

5
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:27.050
It can be a function which returns J as X or returns react create element calls or it can be a javascript

6
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.760
class that has a render method.

7
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:38.420
So this year if I changed this would all be a react component class app extends react out component

8
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.190
that's important.

9
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.960
You have to extend Ria component and then you have to add a render method and in that render method

10
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.060
you return J OS X.

11
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.810
This is a regular react component as well and if I saved as you did for C the same output as before

12
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.250
it works in basically the same way.

13
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.160
There are some technical differences which I discuss in detail in my reactor complete guide course here.

14
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:09.320
It doesn't really matter in modern react you can use functional components only so function based components

15
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.920
and that's therefore what we'll do in this course will write every component as a function.

16
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.950
It's not a must do and as I mentioned in my react The Complete Guide You'll learn about both types and

17
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.530
how they differ but using function components only definitely is a modern way of using react and it

18
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.750
is therefore the way we will use but always keep in mind that this is just a regular jobs function.

19
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:39.380
What makes it a react component is that it returns this j as X or does react create element logic in

20
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.500
the end here.

21
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.810
If we return let's say an object instead does what not be a react component and hence you get an error

22
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.860
if you this.

23
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.310
It really has to be J has X code something which can be interpreted as J as X like this here.

24
00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.790
This is how react works and therefore here I am exporting my own component because this is treated as

25
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.570
a component and your own components can be used in J as X as well.

26
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.910
The only important thing there is that they should start with a capital character in the file where

27
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.770
you used them in J as X because this tells react that it's not a built in H to male tag app wouldn't

28
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.500
be a built in tag but that it's a custom component and this information is important to react and therefore

29
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.570
start with an opera case character.

30
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.530
But then you can use any custom component in JS X and the cool thing now is that we can build up our

31
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.360
application from small reusable components and compose our user interface with the help of such components

32
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.570
and was that why don't we do that why don't we build a simple first react application and see how things

33
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.850
work together there.
