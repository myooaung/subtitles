1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,200
So we finished the places for the moment.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,560
That's a great first step but there is more to come because in addition to places we also want to add

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:18,300
users to our app users means that we want to be able to sign up so to create a new user account.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,240
We also want to be able to log in so to log into this account and then we want to be able to create

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,480
a new place for this specific user.

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,580
And this actually shows the two things that are missing.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,450
First thing is the implementation of this user sign up and log in logic.

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,860
And the second thing is the relation between the users and the places.

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:47,490
Because if you think about our application data then we have these users and these places and each user

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,480
has different properties for example the named email the password and the user image.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,480
And we have the places with the title description the address location and the image.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,730
This is what we build already.

13
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,620
Once we built the user standard which will be the next step then we also have to make sure to create

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,080
a relation between these two entities.

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:14,370
You could say because in the end we want to make sure that one user can create multiple places and that

16
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,870
one place can only belong to exactly one user.

17
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,900
So that's the second important step in the rest of this module to establish the connection between the

18
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,330
users and the places.

19
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,250
Therefore let us not continue with step 1 creating our users logic.
