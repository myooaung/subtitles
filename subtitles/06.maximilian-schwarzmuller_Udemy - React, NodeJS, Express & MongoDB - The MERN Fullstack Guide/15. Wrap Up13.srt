1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:07,640
So for all this module we learned how we can connect our backend our node Express back and in our case

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,040
to among would be database.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,860
We learned what Hmong would be actual is we had to look at no secret about the simple databases and

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,010
build around how we can set up Hmong TB with Mullah TB Atlas.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,970
We then use the default Mongol TB tribe of firsts.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,730
You connect to the server and to create and get products.

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,640
This was the code we wrote here in our Mongo J S file.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,730
We soon saw that using the Mogadishu driver is fine but a bit cumbersome.

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:41,390
Therefore we then added Mongoose to our project mongoose is the third party library which kind of manages

10
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:47,180
the interaction between our backend and Mongo would be in a very efficient way and allows us to focus

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,910
on real business logic.

12
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:55,730
Also because Mongoose comes with this concept of schemas and models which allows us to create blueprints

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:03,200
for documents stored in our database with Mongoose we can make interacting with the database a lot easier.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,690
We saw it here in our Mongoose Che s file when we simply use the model in the end and we also saw that

15
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:15,470
besides managing the connection we saw it up here with the connect method or saving documents easily

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,430
or finding documents easily Mongoose also helps to convert the ideas so the object idea that gets created

17
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,810
automatically among would be to a string.

18
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,800
Again another nice little helper function.

19
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,710
And with that we hopefully refreshed our knowledge on one would b and mongoose in the next module.

20
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,460
We can now implement this knowledge into our course project.

21
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,630
Really looking forward to this.

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,890
So let's continue.
