1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,870
And with that we're done.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:10,800
You'll learned how to deploy your application both separated on cue hosts but also combined on one host

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,920
on one machine and you'll learn not just how to get it there but you also learn about environment variables.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,680
The difference between development and production mode how to control your api keys and that you might

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,090
want to locked them down.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,240
And in general you hopefully now have a good understanding of how you build a burn application but then

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,080
also how you can take that build application prepare it for production and then also upload it to a

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,980
server.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,050
And with that you're well-prepared to dive deeper and build your own Marine applications.
