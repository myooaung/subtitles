1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,270
So now did we worked on the back end and we're able to send requests to our REST API there.

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,520
And with no express and Mongo it be we are able to store data and database as well.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,750
It's now part to connect the front end.

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:23,930
We all worked on with the back end so to connect react with our back and API data for in this module

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,180
we will work on this connection.

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,370
You could say does stand for a kind of is the heart of this course at least if we have a look at the

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:36,200
title of the course because now we're going to bring Merlin together.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:44,000
Now we are going to connect react to mongo TB Express and notorious therefore in this module we'll have

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,620
a look at how we send HP requests to the back end to the API from inside our ReACT app and how we use

10
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:58,790
to respond stay that we get back will have a look at how we can handle our raws if something goes wrong

11
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,820
if we're sending invalid data or something like that and also how we can handle a loading state and

12
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:12,290
show a loading spinner to our users whilst we are waiting for an action to complete or for data to load

13
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:19,160
and of course we'll all make sure that we appropriately update the user interface.

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:25,590
One state I was loaded or won some action completed so plenty of work to do.

15
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,790
Let's not waste any time and instead dive right in.
