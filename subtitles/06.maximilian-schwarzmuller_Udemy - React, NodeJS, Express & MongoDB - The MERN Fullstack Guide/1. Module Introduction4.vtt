00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.290
What's missing in this application we built thus far.

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.740
Of course authentication and authorization.

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:14.080
We had some dummy authentication implemented in the react part of the app already.

4
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.750
But if we're honest we're not really AUTHENTICATING USERS there.

5
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.100
We're just switching between different UI states and that is all.

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.710
We also got a dummy log in route on the back end.

7
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.430
But again this route isn't doing anything useful thus far.

8
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.520
Therefore in this module we will change this and we will all and not just work on authentication which

9
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.510
means logging users in but will also work on authorization which means that even if a user is logged

10
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.690
in.

11
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.240
We don't allow everything for the user.

12
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.930
For example you can't edit or delete places you didn't create.

13
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.400
Therefore in this module we'll do one very simple thing.

14
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.020
Will at all sent occasion logic on both ends at that for me.

15
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.540
Then also includes that we add authorization logic so that we control whether a specific user is allowed

16
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.860
to do something or not.

17
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.410
But let's start with authentication.
