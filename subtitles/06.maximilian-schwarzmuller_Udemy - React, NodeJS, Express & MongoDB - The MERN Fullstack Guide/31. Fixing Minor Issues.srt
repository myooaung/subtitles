1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,860
We made a lot of progress.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:11,520
Now let's fine tune some smaller things or one smaller thing which I noticed or which we still have

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,790
outstanding and that is in the end when we load our list of places here.

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:23,940
So when the place list component gets rendered you might remember that dear we also have to share place

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,160
button which we show if we find no places we can simulate this.

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:35,920
If I temporarily comment out the two places we added here two dummy places if I saved at and I go to

7
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:41,900
my places here that button I want to fine tune this I want to use my own custom button here.

8
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:51,120
So let's import button from and then gets let's move to shared components form elements.

9
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:57,440
Button to use our custom button we used a lot for all it Apple ready whips that was the wrong component

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,950
though let's do that in place list component of course that is where we need the button and in there

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,540
let's replace this button here with our custom button.

12
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,520
Now dear I also want to add a to prop now because the button is configured to work with such a two prop

13
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,930
and then renders a link in the end.

14
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,960
And of course here I want to point at places slash new.

15
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,320
Do you have a proper button there.

16
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,470
This looks way better and we're taken to ad places when we click it.

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,180
Now with that I also want to test something else.

18
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:36,230
Let's go back to user places and comment these places back in and there let's make sure that when we

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,130
added a place right the U or L is place p 1 for example if I use P P2 we load at our place and to see

20
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:49,670
that we really loaded a different place here all named as EMP dot state building so that we have a tiny

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,870
difference.

22
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,910
And now when does reloads here.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,080
Of course I need to rename it and update place as well because it just copied my array and did not exported.

24
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,890
So let's replace as an update place J us as well so we have different places in the end and indeed it

25
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,240
loads that different place.

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:15,860
Now if a load p 1 we should see Empire State Building and if we load P free we get an error so good

27
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,820
that we tested this.

28
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,260
We should fix this as well.

29
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:26,780
And the error we're getting is here in update plays that I call set for data and identified place title

30
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,910
is what I want to access.

31
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,740
The problem is if we find no identified place this is undefined and you can't access properties like

32
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,750
title and description on undefined.

33
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,960
So we should actually check here and use effect if we do have an identified place.

34
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:49,760
So if this is not on the find and only if we do have it I will call set form data.

35
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,520
I will always call set is loading their offer and set this back to false.

36
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,850
But I want to only set for data if I identified places not undefined so if dad now we see could not

37
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,710
find a place.

38
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,150
If we have a invalid place but we don't get an error and we can also make this could not find place

39
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:14,390
thing a little bit more more pretty by simply importing card from shared components.

40
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,470
UI elements card.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,540
So the good old card we used before.

42
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,700
And then wrap this in a card.

43
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,080
So down there where a render could not find place.

44
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,380
How about wrapping this year into a card.

45
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,700
Let's see how that looks like if we do that.

46
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:30,980
Yeah.

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,760
I think that looks a bit nicer.

48
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,050
With that we made some changes which I found quite important to make.

49
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:42,670
Now we have a nice flow here where we can added a place where we can view it on a map of course where

50
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,270
we can also add a new place.

51
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,880
Of course all not really doing something because the back and dismissing but the general functionality

52
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,300
is there and once we do add a back end we can then connect react to it send requests had loading states

53
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,980
and of course then also send our data and get our data from the back end.

54
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,860
Not a one missing thing I want to add now is the delete button it still won't work because again we're

55
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:14,880
not talking to a back end yet but at least I want to make it do something and on authenticate I actually

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,730
want to go to a separate page where we can enter some credentials where we also have a forum they are

57
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,400
for.

58
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,930
So that this is also already prepared for later when we then will add real authentication.

59
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,150
Now let's start with deleting though.
