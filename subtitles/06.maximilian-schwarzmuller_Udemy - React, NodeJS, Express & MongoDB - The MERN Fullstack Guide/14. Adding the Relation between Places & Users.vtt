00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.620
We are coming towards the end of this module.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.920
What is missing now is the relation between our places and our users to bring this back to your mind

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.300
again.

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.010
We have the structure and also we have users and places and now in the end the goal is to make sure

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.550
one user can create multiple places and one place belongs to exactly one user only.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.690
But what does this mean for us still.

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.310
Well as we have our sign up logic now this means we can create the new user.

8
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.350
Well we also will create an I.D. for this user.

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.490
And this means if we now create a new place we want to make sure that if we create this new place this

10
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:49.680
place will contain the user I.D. So the d of the user ID belongs to and at the same time the place idea

11
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250
will also be added to the user documents.

12
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.040
So to the user data now adding de Place I.D. to the user and the user I.D. to the place.

13
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.920
So on both documents is not required here as we're using a new secret database for secret databases.

14
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.980
This would be required but for no sequel we structure and define our queries for demonstration purposes.

15
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.870
We will follow this approach.

16
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.850
So to add the ideas in users and then places another important side note the sign up logic at the moment.

17
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.770
So creating a new user will return an idea.

18
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.300
And when we create the new plays we will copy and paste this idea in the end.

19
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.440
This approach will of course be changed in the authentication module of this course.

20
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.210
There you can log into a user and then the idea will automatically be added the place for the moment.

21
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.550
This is just a dummy code we use but the important thing now is if we create a user now we get the idea

22
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.500
and if we then create the place and provide this creator idea this creator idea will be stored in the

23
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.270
place and at the same time in the user document will store the corresponding place ideas.

24
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.140
Now this sounds very theoretical here.

25
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.690
Therefore let's dive into the code and let's start with creating the relation between places and users

26
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.710
and to establish this relation or this connection we have to change two things in the place.

27
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.930
J.S. and in the user test file let's start with plays chess here.

28
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.330
Here we have the creator of which so far was a dummy I.D. provided by us.

29
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.340
This should change now because now we want this creator to become a real creator I.D. a mongo D.B. I.D..

30
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.260
In the end and to tell Mongol TB that this is a real Hmong would be idea in the end.

31
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.500
We simply enter type Mongoose types object idea.

32
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.920
That's what you have to change here.

33
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.640
So with that the creator will be a real idea that has to be provided here and required can again be

34
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.570
set to true of course.

35
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.170
So we have to provide this idea but we have to add one additional thing here and this additional thing

36
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.280
is the ref property which finally allows us to establish a connection between our current play schema

37
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.800
and another schema.

38
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.370
And what is this other schema here.

39
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.380
Well our user schema.

40
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.140
So we have to add the model name here.

41
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.600
So user and place it right here as you reference this will become important later also been to use the

42
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.650
populate method.

43
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.170
But more about that in a few minutes.

44
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.850
With that we established de connection from a creative perspective.

45
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.610
Now we have to do the same thing for our places.

46
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.160
For that we can actually copy and paste this object and go to our users J S file and now we can paste

47
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.910
this code but one important difference of course here we now have to use the name of our police model

48
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.320
which was place

49
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.920
finders right here.

50
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.110
So that's the name I'm referring to.

51
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.420
And another important thing we said that one place can only belong to one user.

52
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.700
So here we have just the object this is fine.

53
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.060
But we said that one user can have multiple places.

54
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.260
Therefore we have to add an error here.

55
00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.750
This is how we tell Mongoose that in documents based on the schema we have multiple places entries instead

56
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.360
of just one value with that the relation is almost established there is one additional thing that we

57
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.180
have to change though and this additional thing has to be changed in the user's controller because if

58
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:20.810
we go up here to our sign up we still have these places here assessing the property here.

59
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.480
We have to change our places because the starting value for the places will be an empty area.

60
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.070
Now once we add a new place this will automatically be added.

61
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.330
Therefore we also have to make sure to remove places up here from our constant like this so this was

62
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.900
step one we created the relation between places and users.

63
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.420
And we also defined the schema for each single place that gets added right here for our places property.

64
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.590
So this object defines each single place that gets added.

65
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.650
Let's now continue by creating a new place and make sure that the Creator I.D. is added to this place

66
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.670
and at the same time that place added is added to the creator.
