00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.480
So let's continue our work on this application.

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:13.250
But before we do so I want to dive in to some important concepts or some theory about react which you

3
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.350
also have to understand.

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.880
We have two main types of components in react.

5
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.820
We have presentational components and we have state full components you could say or put in other words

6
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.500
we have some components which are relatively dumb which just outputs some content.

7
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.100
Apply some styling some structure and then we have components which also are smarter and manage some

8
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.170
state and orchestrate Dad.

9
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.020
Their child components received new data adds on the card component which I've provided to you for example

10
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.180
is a good example for a presentational for a dump component.

11
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.400
It just renders a div.

12
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.640
It applies some styles and adjust outputs content it receives from outside through props.

13
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.360
The same for the Avatar also very simple user item.

14
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.430
It's the same it's really really dumb.

15
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.040
It has more H HTML elements in there but it only outputs content it gets data from outside and render

16
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.200
instead it has this link which has some built in logic to block interaction and to block navigation

17
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.380
but that's handled by a third party library by another component actually by the link component the

18
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.050
user item component therefore is pretty straightforward.

19
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.340
Only a presentational component.

20
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.250
Same for the users list it has the logic to decide what it renders.

21
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.900
So it's maybe a bit smarter but in the end it still only outputs something on the screen the users component

22
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.760
also is pretty dumb at this point though theoretically the list of users here would be fetched from

23
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.780
a backend so whilst this component is dumb because we have to work with some dummy data this would actually

24
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.330
not be a pure presentational component instead of later in discourse course this will be a component

25
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.590
that does more than just percent.

26
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.140
It will be a component that will actively also fetch the data it wants to show.

27
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.320
Here again we just don't have any backend from which we could fetch at this point.

28
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.570
But this will later be not a dumb presentational component instead later this will be a state full component

29
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.570
which indeed does fetch data.

30
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.520
Now what does this difference mean for you.

31
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.060
How does this impact the way you build your components.

32
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.420
Well it's not really impacting the way you build your components.

33
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.200
It's just important to be aware that there are these two types of components in react smart and dumb

34
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.970
ones state full and presentational ones.

35
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.850
And it shouldn't impact how you build your components but you should be aware of the fact that it's

36
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.350
totally normal to have way more presentational components dump components than state full components.

37
00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.530
Typically you have a few components where you manage your data where you fetch data and so on and then

38
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.310
you have way more components that simply control how things are presented and how things are laid out.

39
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.790
That's just some theory about react about components that you can keep in your mind can be helpful in

40
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.400
job interviews and even if you're not looking for those it's helpful knowledge you have if you are a

41
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.360
reactive helper.
