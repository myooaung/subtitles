00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:08.890
So let's dive into the first step which is the idea which we need now as I mentioned often this is a

2
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.770
step you can skip or which is skipped automatically because you already have a pretty clear idea of

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.050
what you want to build and which problem you want to solve in this course.

4
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.950
I want to build an app with you where users can share places their favorite places or any places they

5
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.480
feel like are where if sharing where each place has a magical location and the title ends on with our

6
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:42.370
users so they can share it with our users or put in other words if you're a user a visitor in this application

7
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.320
you can view a list of users you can click on a user and then you will see the places this user shared.

8
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.210
The great thing about this app is that it's not too complex and yet it has all the important pieces.

9
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.410
You want to have in such a demo app which you will probably also need in the apps you are trying to

10
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.050
build after this course.

11
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.830
Specifically we have all the core CRUD operations in there so create read updating and deleting will

12
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.850
cover all of that.

13
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.400
We'll be able to create users create places get users and get places which is basically reading the

14
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.220
data update places and delete places.

15
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.630
So that's all in there which is super important.

16
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.210
In addition we have more than one data model.

17
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.170
We have users in places and that helps us work with relationships as well.

18
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.590
We all do work with images and hence will cover image upload which is also a very important topic.

19
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.200
And of course we'll also validate user input to make sure that only valid data ends up in our database

20
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.650
and on our back and in general.

21
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.930
And last but not least we'll have authentication and authorization in this course.

22
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.810
The difference is that authentication means stead users need to sign up or log in to work with some

23
00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.740
parts of our app.

24
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.720
In this example new places should only be treatable by locked in users and offer ization means that

25
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.440
even if you are a logged in user you're still not able to do everything for example and is app updating

26
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.660
or deleting places should not be possible for all authenticated users but only for the users who created

27
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.860
that place.

28
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.470
So we got a lot of core important things in this app which is why this makes for a great demo application

29
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.910
for discourse and which is why this is my idea for the course project.
