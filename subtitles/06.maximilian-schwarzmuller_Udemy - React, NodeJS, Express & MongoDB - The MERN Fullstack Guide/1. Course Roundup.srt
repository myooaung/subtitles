00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,580
Congratulations.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,280
You complete this course and you'll learn a lot about the marine stack.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,380
You'll learned how to combine all these individual technologies and build a complete application with

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,010
debt including important features like file upload or a user authentication.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,020
Now the obvious question is where should you go next.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,810
What are the next steps that makes sense.

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,550
Well as always it's all about practicing.

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,390
You need to practice practice and practice build more dummy Learn apps.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:38,270
You saw one example in this course and you learned how things generally work together how to implement

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,200
certain key features like upload and what to watch out for.

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,710
But of course there is an infinite amount of apps you could build.

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,700
There are so many features you could implement so build your own dummy apps build an online shop build

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:59,240
something that utilizes some other feature build a different front end user to knowledge you have about

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:07,590
react note and so on and build apps that come to your mind build simplified clones of popular Web applications.

15
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,660
That's a great idea as well.

16
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,600
So did you encounter many different scenarios and also challenges.

17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,230
You will definitely face some problems whilst building those apps and overcoming those issues on your

18
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,390
own with help of Google and stack overflow and so on.

19
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:32,090
That is how you grow as a developer so it's really an important point but also of course explored the

20
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,940
individual topics covered in this course.

21
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:41,150
Now having some basic react knowledge was a course requirement but maybe you can still dive deeper deeper

22
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,040
and or you want to learn more about node express or about Mongo D.B..

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,680
These are the building blocks after all.

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,040
And in order to be able to build any kind of web application you need to know as much as possible about

25
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,610
these technologies.

26
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:04,040
So diving into dedicated courses or tutorials or official documentation of these resources is really

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,200
something I also recommend.

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,710
Now I got courses on all these topics in case you were interested but of course any resource will do.

29
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:19,310
It's just important that besides practicing you also expand your knowledge on these topics so that you

30
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:26,840
really are able to build anything you want in the end and also keep in mind that the way we set up this

31
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,050
Marine stack here is just one alternative.

32
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:37,100
Arguably the most popular and common one but you could for example also build a graph que el API instead

33
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:45,470
of a rest api or you have a back end where you render views on the service side based on some templating

34
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,620
engine and you only use react and parts of your pages.

35
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:56,700
So explorers such alternative combinations as well it could be interesting to build your own graph QoL

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:05,120
API and by the way attached you also find a link to a tutorial I created where we do build basically

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,770
a merged application with a graph que el API so that could be interesting as well.

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,060
And if you follow these steps if you dive into these areas you will grow a lot and you will be able

39
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:23,480
to build anything you want with does extremely useful tech stack of longer to be expressed react and

40
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,470
know J.S..
