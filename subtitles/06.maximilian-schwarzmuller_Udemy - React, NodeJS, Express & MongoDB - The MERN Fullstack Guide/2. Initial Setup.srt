1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:08,020
Now in this module I will switch between the backend code set up which you can recognize by the word

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:14,550
back and here in the top left corner and the front end the react project with well front end here so

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,170
that you can always quickly see where we're working on back end and front.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,770
And now for the back end I will start with one tiny adjustment in app J.S. where we have our connection

5
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,180
string to the database there.

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,250
I will now connect to a new database so that we basically start from scratch and we kind of clear all

7
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:42,460
the data we created in the previous modules so that we don't have in the old data lying around in the

8
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,360
database.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,470
So here I will connect let's say Merlin in my connection strings so that all data gets written to collections

10
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:58,000
in that database and other than that I'm fine with the current state though and we can dive right in

11
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,140
and get started.
