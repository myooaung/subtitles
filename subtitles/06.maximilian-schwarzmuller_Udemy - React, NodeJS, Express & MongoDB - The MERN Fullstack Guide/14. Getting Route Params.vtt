00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.980
Now to filter out places by IED.

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.590
We need to find out which I.D. is encoded in the EU URL.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.070
And for that we can use a tool react router Dom offers to us we import it from react router Dom and

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.290
there we have a hook.

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.200
They use parents hook which we can use and functional components like all hooks.

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.210
They're only usable in functional components but since I only work with functional components in his

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.040
app we can use them in every component.

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.730
Now you as parents is simply executed as a function and it gives us access to the parameters as it's

9
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.140
called.

10
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.380
So the dynamic segments react router is aware of dynamic segments R.D. things you add in code with a

11
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.870
colon in your root configuration.

12
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.780
So in this case we can get the user idea and you as parents will return an object which has your dynamic

13
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.980
segments you set up in their old config as properties.

14
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.920
So for the user places component there will be an object with a user I.D. property which then in turn

15
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.540
holds the concrete value that's entered into you are L as a value so here I can access user I.D. and

16
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.690
stored it in let's say the user I.D. constant.

17
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.500
This gives us access to the user I.D. that's encoded in the U are L.

18
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.660
And with that we can get our places we could call it loaded places here by using our dummy places and

19
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.750
then we can use the built in filter method to run a filter on every element in dummy places and have

20
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.690
a look at every element and only keep it in the newly returned array filter will return a new array.

21
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:48.270
If the creator of that place we're looking at is equal to user I.D. and then we want to forward load

22
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.560
it places year to place list as a consequence if I reload.

23
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.960
We not only see one place here if I visit you free eyes you know places because we have no place for

24
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.370
a user you free.

25
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.620
And for a YouTube I also see one place.

26
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.820
So this works and we are now filtering this successfully.

27
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.070
Now why don't you work on the map next.

28
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.640
However before we do so let's make sure the buttons look a bit more pretty.
