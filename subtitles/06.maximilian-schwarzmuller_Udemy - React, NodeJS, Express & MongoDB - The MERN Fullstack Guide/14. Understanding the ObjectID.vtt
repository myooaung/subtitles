00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.860
So what is this idea.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.490
We can also see it in our database.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.670
And if you remember back to Mogadishu be part of this refresher.

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.120
We also had this idea.

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.620
Well the I.D. gets added to the document each time we store a new document in the database.

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.720
This is a unique I.D. for each document.

7
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.260
So if the idea we can identify a specific document and it gets added automatically no matter if we use

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.990
to Mongo DB driver or mongoose.

9
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.640
The thing about this idea is that well you can sit here actually it has a special type.

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.780
It's not a string.

11
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.170
It is a so-called object that you saw a mongo D.B. specific data type you could say and typically you

12
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.400
might want to work with these ideas for example as part of if tracks or things like that.

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.870
And with JavaScript you cannot work with this object I.D. data types for that you need to convert these

14
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.430
ideas into a string and Mongoose again has a convenient way to do so.

15
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.530
I can show you this.

16
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.510
Back in the project here in you Mongoose J S file here to create product.

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.360
And now here we can console log the type of our created product.

18
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.070
But interestingly we can now access the I.D. already.

19
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.490
I come back to that in a few seconds but we can access the I.D. in two different ways.

20
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.960
And our goal is to convert the object this object deep into a string.

21
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.250
And again Mongoose got a nice little help before that dad for that we use a so-called virtual getter

22
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.650
which is added by Mongoose and we can refer to it with I.D. here.

23
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:43.480
If we do so save it and now again create the banana go back you'll see now we turn it into a string

24
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.310
so if this virtual geta this is working by the way if you would refer to the I.D. property so with the

25
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.000
underscore.

26
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.470
So as you can see here we have the underscore front of idea if you would do this and create the product.

27
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.310
You see we get back an object.

28
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.220
So here this conversion doesn't work.

29
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.260
So again Mongoose got us covered.

30
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.510
And with that we can convert the object here into a string.

31
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.280
So this virtual getter helps us to convert the object into a string.

32
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.570
But why can we actually access our I.D. property here because neither in our model nor appear in our

33
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.710
javascript object.

34
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.330
We have to I.D. property.

35
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.980
Let me comment out.

36
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.030
This console log quickly and let's now lock our created product up here.

37
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.550
So before we actually save it to the database saving this and creating a new product we can see that

38
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.230
now although we didn't store the document to the database this happens afterwards you will fail safe

39
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.950
method.

40
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.600
The idea is added already to our object and that's really interesting right.

41
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.560
Although we didn't define it in our model nor here in our object we get this idea property here in our

42
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.780
object and in our document Indian.

43
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.240
That's also the reason why once we store the document this idea is edit and this is in the end a default

44
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.610
feature provided by Mongo D.B..

45
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.990
Now let me delete that console lock your door and let me comment this back in.

46
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.270
And as we talked about this idea now I think it makes sense to have a bit of a closer look here before

47
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.350
we conclude that module.
