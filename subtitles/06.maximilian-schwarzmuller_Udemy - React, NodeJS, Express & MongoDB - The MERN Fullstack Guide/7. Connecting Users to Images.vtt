00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.860
So controller time let's work on the sign up controller and make sure we do something with the file

2
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.570
and do something with the file actually means two things it means linked the file to our user in the

3
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.230
database.

4
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.610
So create a real image.

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.150
You are L but also roll back the creation of the file.

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.410
If we have validation error for example null let's maybe start with the rollback mode.

7
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.480
If we do have a validation error.

8
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.750
So if we're in here then I don't want to continue I instead one to delete the file.

9
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.710
The same of course is actually the case for any error I have here anywhere.

10
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.200
So if I have an error here or anywhere else this does not matter.

11
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.280
So you could argue that it makes sense to integrate does roll back logic into our general error handler

12
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.210
maybe so an app.

13
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.640
Yes we have this general error handling logic here and there we can check if we do have a file and if

14
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.330
we do we want to roll back because we had an error.

15
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.850
We certainly don't want to keep it.

16
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.590
No the cool thing is Malta adds a new property to the request object of file property.

17
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.950
If we do have a file so we can check if this is set and if this is set we know there is a file as part

18
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.030
of the request.

19
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
So the request where is something failed had a file.

20
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.350
We now want to delete that file that was stored on the disk to delete that we can import a notorious

21
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.840
core module and that is the F S the file system module here like this does allows us to interact with

22
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.240
files in our file system and it allows us to for example delete files.

23
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.580
So with this imported in our error handler here we can call unlink.

24
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.220
While this doesn't sound like delete but does this end what it does it deletes this file.

25
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.840
So here we then just have to point at the file.

26
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.340
We can do so with request file path path is a property that exists on this file object which Malta adds

27
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.940
to the request and just points to the file and this will delete it.

28
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.490
Now on unlink provide a callback here which will be triggered when the deletion is done you get an error

29
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.700
which might be thrown if something goes wrong.

30
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.960
But here I'll just log it.

31
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.830
I don't care about an error here.

32
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.200
If file deletion failed at this point it is what it is but we can always manually clean it up it's not

33
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.990
horrible if we still have the file around with that delete the file which is currently stored in images

34
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.370
and save everything and try that submission again.

35
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.810
So let's take on sign up here and I get user exists already please log in instead.

36
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.090
But if we now go back we see nothing is in images and that is great.

37
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.610
So we correctly roll back this image upload so that's one thing.

38
00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.100
Back to the user's controller.

39
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.460
We can also use the file for something more useful because rolling it back of course is nice but more

40
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.350
importantly we want to store it on our user which we create.

41
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.140
We are extracting our data here and Malta will give us this body property on the request with all the

42
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.010
text fields it found on the incoming request body.

43
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.900
So we will still get that thanks to Malta but in addition we have this request file thing I showed you

44
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.300
and with all that information provided we can add it all to our user.

45
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.980
So now here on the user we create down there.

46
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:44.570
I want to replace this image field here with age to the p locally hosted 5000 slash plus request filed

47
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.530
a path which should be uploads slash images slash file name.

48
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.310
This is the image you are L I want to construct here no storing the full.

49
00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.670
You are L here certainly is one thing we can do but we could also argue that we want to prevent this

50
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:10.370
thing here on the front end actually so we could just store the file path here in our image field not

51
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:18.920
the full you are l just the path on our server and with that new users should have that path included.

52
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.170
Now to see that in action.

53
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.470
I'll go back to mongo to be Atlas and actually delete all my users.

54
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.390
I got here so that I can start from scratch again and I don't have any existing users in the database

55
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.450
so let's delete all the users we created in any year step by step.

56
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.010
Every one of them and while is still leading.

57
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.790
I'll also go to places and also delete all the places I created in the past.

58
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.710
In my case that's one place so let's delete this as well.

59
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.130
And with that we should have no more places and no more users.

60
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:04.420
We got two empty collections year and we can now go back to the reactor up and leave the credentials

61
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.070
here as we have them and click sign up and this doesn't look too bad.

62
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.170
Now this image is not displayed here yet because we're storing just a path on the server not the full

63
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.410
U.R.L. but if we have a look at our users collection here again we see our user and we see the image

64
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:30.170
path here and now we just need to tweak the front and a little bit and on the user's page or to be precise

65
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:38.910
instead of the users list on a single user item here on the avatar of what I pass here to image should

66
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.040
of course include props image.

67
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:48.630
But since this is just a path I'll wrap this here into back ticks and instead point at age to the local

68
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.100
host 5000 Slash.

69
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.920
And then here dynamically inject props stored image.

70
00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.160
And if we do so and save this and go back to the reactive it still doesn't work.

71
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:08.890
And you see we got a not found error notice you are l actually is correct though it's low blows 5000

72
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.240
slash upload slash images and then the image name.

73
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.940
So why is it not shown here.

74
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.230
Because we need to change more on the back and.
