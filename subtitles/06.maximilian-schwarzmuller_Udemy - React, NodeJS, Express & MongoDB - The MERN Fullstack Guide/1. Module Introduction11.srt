1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:09,530
When we talk about the Mearns stack we of course have to understand the E and the N part expressed jazz.

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,000
And no jazz.

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:17,290
Of course we'll build the entire back and off this application with these two technologies working together.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,180
And therefore there you will learn a lot about them but in case you're really new to know jazz and express

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,980
I a recommend that you check out dedicated resources like my note J asked to complete guide but be here

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:38,690
in this module you'll also get a brief refresher will quickly dive into know jazz and express understand

7
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:44,510
what it is all about how it basically works and therefore hopefully by the end of this module we're

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,200
all roughly on the same page.

9
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:53,770
Now again this module is not there to replace a complete node or express scores.

10
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:00,440
There is a reason why that course has more than 30 hours on its own but it's there to make sure that

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,900
if it's been some time since you worked with node or express or you haven't worked with it but you're

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:13,430
learning it simultaneously to this course we all can get started with it quickly and it's not all brand

13
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:13,930
new.

14
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,720
What you're going to learn in the next course modules thereafter.

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:24,350
So in this module specifically we'll have a look at what exactly node J.S. is again and how it roughly

16
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,090
works.

17
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:32,070
And of course we'll all explore the E express J.S. what is expressed about and how does it work and

18
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,440
why do we use it.

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,890
Why do we need it when we build a back and with node.

20
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,510
So let's dive in.
