00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.880
Now there is a tiny fix or a tiny improvement.

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:12.120
When I apply if we check our off page we can see that in the end in on the validation rules for the

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.950
password we expect a minimum length of five characters.

4
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.790
Now on the back end on the user routes you see I expect a minimum length of six characters.

5
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.730
Now I like six better.

6
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.180
So we'll actually all to tweak this on the front end to be six so that this is equal just a little thing

7
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.970
so that we don't allow access on the front end if we treat something as valid which would then deem

8
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.160
as treat valid on the back end to prove the problem we would have had if I set this back to five on

9
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.110
the front end if I switch to sign up and I create a new user manual with test for at test dot com which

10
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.520
is take an email address.

11
00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.740
Now here if I enter a valid password on the front and with five characters I would get an invalid inputs

12
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.020
past error which of course is a super bad user experience because it seemed valid.

13
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.460
Now if I switched is to six here on the front end as well this changes.

14
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.220
Now if I go to sign up and I tried to create manual as a user

15
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.800
I have to add at least six characters for this to be valid.

16
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.610
And then I can indeed sign up and surprisingly manual looks like me.

17
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.060
Awesome.

18
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.490
So this now works.

19
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.870
One other issue we see however is of course that after logging in I can also edit and delete here even

20
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.480
though I'm now logged in with manual.

21
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.320
And in general if I do log in let's say with test to a test that com which all is an arbitrary user

22
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.850
I can also click added and delete and these buttons all the will work.

23
00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.050
Now the reason for Dad simply is that if we check out the place item J.S. component there I do render

24
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.000
these buttons whenever I am logged in.

25
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.200
Now I actually we can improve does as well.

26
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.050
Now we are storing the user I.D. in the off context as well.

27
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.340
Keep in mind if we are logging in an app G.S. I do set my user I.D. and I do pass that back into off

28
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:25.000
context so since we have to user I.D. stored there on a place item we can actually refine this and not

29
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.890
check whether we're locked in.

30
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.780
But instead check whether the user I.D. is the same I.D. as the creator of this place because when I

31
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:45.550
create my place item I forward the creator I.D. here so on place item here I actually can say check

32
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:56.150
if user I.D. is equal to props creator I.D. and only if that's equal I want to show these buttons.

33
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.750
So if I save that and it reloads when I'm not authenticated I don't see them.

34
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.440
Now if a log in with the wrong user who did not create these places I also don't see them and only if

35
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.540
I log in with the correct user here I do see them.

36
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.140
So that is an improvement here both here on place item as well as the off page with the authentication

37
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.940
to make sure we provide the correct user experience.

38
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.580
Oh and here on the off page of course I also want to tweak my error message here to reflect the new

39
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.180
requirement of six characters for the password.

40
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.680
This is it though with that we're having a good state here and we can certainly continue.
