1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,800
Now last but not least I want to make sure that when we delete a place which I'll not to hear about

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,700
in a second that we also clean up the file that belongs to the place.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,200
And at the moment we're not doing this.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,440
If we have a look at our places controller in the lead place we of course get rid of the place.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,550
We of course get rid of the connection to our user but we're not getting rid of the image that belongs

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,600
to the place.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,820
Now we don't necessarily have to.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:37,410
We could also write a script which cleans up every month or we do a manual cleanup or we want to keep

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:44,430
all the images because we're using them for us machine learning algorithms or anything like that anyways.

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,020
But if you do want to clean up it's not too hard to do.

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,630
Before we get rid of our place here I'll get the image path here.

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,280
Out of the place in the place document we can simply access this image key right.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,220
Because that is where we do store our image path.

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,560
So we get access to this image path.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,500
Then I delete everything in a database which is the important thing because if deleting the image should

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,570
fail for whatever reason it's not that bad it's ok we can do a manual cleanup.

17
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,980
So after all this database cleanup I want to delete the place.

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:28,320
Now for that I will again import the file system package no dress offers because this gives us this

19
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,180
unlink method.

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:38,310
And with this imported at the end here at the end of delete place we can call FS unlink and use our

21
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,440
image path here which I extracted from the document up there.

22
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:49,330
So now this is what I wanted to lead on link takes a second argument a callback function which might

23
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,340
hold an error if things go wrong here I will just log it to the console.

24
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,890
You could do more with it.

25
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,370
I certainly don't want to wait for this to complete.

26
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,130
Though we could send the response in here to wait for this to complete.

27
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,190
But I don't care.

28
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,890
This deletion process is started and as I said if it should fail for whatever reason or something like

29
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,710
that it's not the end of the world.

30
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:18,910
So if this added If we now save this and we go here to the front end and I click delete and confirm

31
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,590
this it deletes it here does looks good.

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,770
We got no error here.

33
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:32,980
And now if we go back to the back and we see only one image and that's our user image the place image

34
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,350
indeed is gone.

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:42,600
If we quickly have a look at Atlas we should also see that there to places collection is empty and if

36
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,090
we have a look at our users we got the user but the place Key was deleted from its places array.

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,790
So this is now the cleanup finished and this ensures that when we delete something when we delete the

38
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,300
place we also delete the image that belongs to the place.
