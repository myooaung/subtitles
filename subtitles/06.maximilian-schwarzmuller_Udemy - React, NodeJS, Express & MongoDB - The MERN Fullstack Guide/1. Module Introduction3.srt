00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:10,000
We connected our ReACT front and to the back and obviously connect really just meant sending H to the

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,540
p requests from inside.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,410
Do you react up to the back end.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,320
But this is what it's all about before when we worked just on the back end.

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,100
We only used postman there.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,590
Now we're doing this from inside our reactor.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,410
But one thing was missing.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,760
Image upload thus far.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,230
We worked with some dummy image you are ls for both the users as well as are places it would be much

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,330
nicer if the visitors off our page could instead bring their own images.

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:45,020
If we had file pictures in our forums where users could choose images to use well and that's exactly

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,660
what we'll do in this module in detail you will learn how to accept and handle files or specifically

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:57,450
images on the back end of our applications or on the service site on Node express side.

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,260
And of course we'll also cover the front end and see how we can add a file picture data in our form

15
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,250
and then get that file from the front end with an H to repeat request to the back end all these things

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,630
will be done in this module.
