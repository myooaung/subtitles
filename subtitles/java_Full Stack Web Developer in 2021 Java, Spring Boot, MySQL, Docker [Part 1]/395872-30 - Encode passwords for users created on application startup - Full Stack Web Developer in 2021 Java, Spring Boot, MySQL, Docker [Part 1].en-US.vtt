00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.110
Let's first fix the problem for password not being encoded on the application created that

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.580
application startup.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.750
So I navigated to the users model class,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.640
and we're not able to use the password in colder over there.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.800
Since user is not the component recognized by spring boot,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.130
it's an entity.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.520
So since we are on the load,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.750
users in DB Class that it's a component,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:52.670
we can use the password in colder here so we can filter on the user's list and basically

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:01.200
transform each user cortex wounding password to un encoded passwords and just returned the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.900
user.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.790
As you guys can see from this,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:17.490
we can collect the list off users and just regulate the list of users.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:26.850
And that's basically we need to start the application to see things in action.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:42.250
So Avery starting now will be ableto invoke the find all users a p I to see that the your I

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.680
D.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.650
Is actually in colder now.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.120
Okay,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.250
great table users.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.520
Good.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:11.280
Let's go to the final user Safety I and we can see that the password for each user has been

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.940
encoded.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.720
We don't see any more than you,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.310
i d.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:24.650
And now let's go to the user stable Cornick to the in memory aged with database,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.890
do a select to retrieve the list of users,

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.630
and we can see that the past words are encoded also into user stable.
