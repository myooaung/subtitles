00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
fourth is video.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.750
Let's modify our update AP operation.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.970
So once again,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.570
under user service,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.280
I am peel.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.830
We have this update operation that takes into a counter user splice.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.530
We don't want this anymore.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:27.890
We want to take into account a user depository and find on user bites corresponding i d.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:40.260
Now these operations were remained the same.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.890
In fact,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.360
since if we found on user,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:54.170
we want to updated based on which properties have been set up.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.580
We don't need toe.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:03.850
Add anything back in the user's list just to save the user.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.470
Save the updated user behind the scenes.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.490
You see that user reports story save operation.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:19.300
It's capable of figuring things out that the existing user has own I D on I D.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:29.100
That its present into our database and Spring Data GP a willow sort things out in terms off

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.960
finding which user has been updated.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.650
Now that's your let's do an example for this.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.550
I started the application and let's add for stone Ah,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.690
on user.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.950
So,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.620
yeah,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.960
this user has been up.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.560
Us has been created.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.850
Let's,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.550
uh,

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.410
let's review that the user is present in the list,

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.750
okay?

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:18.420
And we need to copy paste and do an update on the user.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.250
Let's of date its force Maim toe,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.900
Alexandra instead.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.360
Off off,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.950
Alex.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.640
So do the send operation.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:39.220
The call the sender bottom here two or four content has been ah returned.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:47.440
And you can see here that that date has been made also in the console and also in the age

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.910
to corresponding.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.310
They will so select from users.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:07.650
You can see that the first name has been updated to Alexander so And if we do a find by a D

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.570
Previously it was Alex.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.550
Now we can see Alexander being present.
