00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
under this video,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.990
let's update the find user by the A p I.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.720
So let's go to the user service.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.850
I am peel and the instead off using this users this stream operation,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.920
we can use the user repository find by a d a b i.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.670
And that's basically it.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:34.260
We can now stop the corn server and,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.750
uh,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.950
started once again.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:53.590
Now the application it starts takes a few seconds for the table.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.850
Toby created students once again.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.180
It's ah in memory aged a database.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:12.510
And now let's go to find all you can see that on em.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.150
Tillis is our returned.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:30.130
We can use the add operation to create a new user and find by the we can use the ideal the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.450
user that is one.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:49.550
So go back and we have one set up here and invoke the A p I and the user has been extracted
