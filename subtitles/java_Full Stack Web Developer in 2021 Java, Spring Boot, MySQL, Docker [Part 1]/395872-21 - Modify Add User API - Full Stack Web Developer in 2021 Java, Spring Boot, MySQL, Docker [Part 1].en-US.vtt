00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
Hey guys.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.950
Under this video, we will update the add user API functionality.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.860
So under the public void at mentor for the user user parameter,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:24.195
we remove this and we'll use the user repository safe method.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:28.755
And we'll pass the USA as a parameter.

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:33.030
And we won't use the counter anymore.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.260
So now let's stop the server and start it again so that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.810
the newly added changes will be taken into effect.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.970
Wait for this to start.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.885
And let's go to Postman and forced invoked,

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:11.405
find all users method.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:14.810
You see that the array is empty.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.110
Now let's go on the other new user.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.050
And we should check the body. For this.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.910
We don't need the ID since the idea would be automatically generated as

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:43.800
format this a bit and invoke the single operation.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.639
So you see the status code is 201 Created.

00:01:52.639 --> 00:02:00.990
And for verifying this info dot find all law users metal.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.340
And also double check.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.490
We can invoke the H2 in memory database to do a select.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.520
And you will see that in the news or has been added.
