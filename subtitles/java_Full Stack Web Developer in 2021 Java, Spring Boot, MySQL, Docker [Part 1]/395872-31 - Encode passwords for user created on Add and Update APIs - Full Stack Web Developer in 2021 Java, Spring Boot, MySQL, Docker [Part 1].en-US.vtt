00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.550
The add user a P I and Abdic user A P I,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.200
such as the passwords,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.150
will be also encoded since currently,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.300
if we add in user or our data news or the password are not encoded,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.000
so forcing force on the ad operation before saving the user.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.260
We need toe set.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:42.650
It's password as the password in colder in code with the user cordant password that was

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.090
extracted from the user object.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.210
It's important.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.070
Also,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.590
inject the password in colder Under the user service,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.050
I am peel using the OTA Ward annotation.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:10.050
Now the at method has been fixed and also on the update method.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.890
We need to first thing first ad.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.600
Also the user name and password Toby stored into our daughter basins way.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.370
Omit this so we will fix the this now.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.130
So if user get user name,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.250
it's not known.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:48.650
Existing user set user name will bay usar get user and the same thing for password.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:02:15.470
Now let's also say the past work as password in colder in cold use or get password.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.650
Okay,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:28.160
so and now saved the password for nearly grated user and updated users is in the encoded

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.840
version off this password.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.750
Now let's restore the application.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:48.300
Okay?

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.020
The process is starting with the embedded Tomcat server Fourth,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.550
the 80 80.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:07.650
Let's now go to adding going user,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.450
we know that the password is in clear text now.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.860
Oh,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:25.780
we need to also update our headers since postman It's out off sync.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:36.840
So on the authorization Basic What at me not mean Previ request has been updated.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:45.360
Send once again the request toe one status.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.380
Cody turn.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:57.050
Now let's go on the final users And we should have the newly created user next to the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:05.590
existing list and you can see that the password is updated in the encoded version.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.450
It's not in clear text anymore.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.050
Now let's go toe the update process and set up.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:20.340
I don't know another password in clear text such as thirst,

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.050
new password in corruption.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.150
We involved the request.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:39.120
So for no content and if we do the find all,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.290
we'll see that the password has been updated and also encoded.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.050
