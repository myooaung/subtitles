00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
let's start by configuring our environment.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:14.390
So the first step is to download Install Java gvk one that date so we can navigate toe our

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.550
browser and type in download Oracle J D K.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:34.960
We can say look the first course link and were directed toe oracle dot com Scroll down a

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.250
bit.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:44.250
You can see that we'll choose J d k worsen eight.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.460
So between Windows 64 86 version,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.090
I'm Oh,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.950
no Windows environment with the 64 bit.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.750
So our choose this version,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:14.660
I don't know the gvk you will be redirected toe oracle type in your user name and the yes

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.050
sort.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:25.750
So this is an oracle account that you should have now the genetic aids don't loading.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.580
You should open off,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.990
then the find it in the folder.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.450
Okay,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.530
so you can double,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.790
click and or just follow the steps to install it.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.950
Once you finish this process,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.560
the J T.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.250
K will be installed under sea folder.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.850
I'll quickly show you this.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.990
So see,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.070
program files java,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.950
and you can see it here.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:21.310
Now you need toe copy this path and city pondered the environment variables or your windows

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.950
environment.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.210
So on the path variable.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.450
You can edit it and right at the end,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.550
based on content here.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:44.310
Okay.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.850
Looks good.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:56.750
And now you can taste that Gervais properly configured double minus version.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.750
And you can see that job I set up.
