00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
for this video as you guys.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.250
My No,

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.000
We're currently returning on empty leased off users,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.280
so I would like to set up our random least off years or somehow So let's go under user

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.910
service.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:36.560
I am pl And could he ate the new list so public least fusar users list equal your A list.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.240
So currently,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:49.150
dis list this empty and that's also at the static keyword for this list.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:01:00.600
Since I want this list to be populated once this class is initialized and over here I would

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.110
like to sit up early.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.850
Um,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.810
a list of users.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:11.850
So let's also add the private integer i D.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:20.970
Since this will be used to identify each user that's had the integer idea.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.320
Under our argument,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.200
Constructor set up a value for it.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:38.050
I was so Oneto generate getters and sitters for the new field.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.950
Okay,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.940
and it's also important toe update hash code equals and to string methods to include this

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.750
new field,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.580
so source generate hash code,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.690
any quarrels.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.040
Basically,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.650
this will override the existing methods.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:12.750
Think real door so di di go back to source jury to string and also overwrite the existing

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.450
toasting method to include also this Newfield.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.150
Okay,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.040
the string equals equals sent hash code.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.200
Okay,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.890
They have the in your field.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.410
That's great.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.710
Let's go back to the user service.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:50.650
Same pl and I also want to control the I de toe basically increment it on each user.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:03:04.250
So I would I want to add a counter that will start from one and under the static block.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.970
We should basically create the list off users Armento,

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:11.410
chrome,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.860
end type,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.470
juried,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.420
random name,

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.450
since outright to use specific service that will generate some random names from for me

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.760
that I can use for force name,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.650
Last name.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.810
We can use some think like,

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.600
OK name,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.650
generator that will work.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:46.790
Let's go with the character name except that therms.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.500
Honestly,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.400
I'm not very interested in this field,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.350
so let's just generate some character names.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.750
I accept.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:08.100
And you see that this website journey that some names for us that we can use to create our

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.790
users.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:20.900
So let's do something like user users.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:36.850
Least that ad on user and we need to create this user such as user user equals news are

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:45.680
will set up the counter and also increment it automatically for the next user.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.270
We see the first name,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.040
last name,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.250
age and country are required.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:05:01.050
So let's take some names from this website such as I don't know.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.350
Yeah,

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.890
we'll go to Yeah,

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.750
we can use Georgiana Orgun Ortega,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.210
24 from Brazil.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:34.750
Let's say let's also create another user at the counter Plus plus over here.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:42.110
Let's go back toe chrome or osas sparks.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.590
Okay,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.090
Does this Rosa Sparks?

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.290
Ah,

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.400
no,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.690
No.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.780
34.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.780
It will go.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:01.210
I'm just adding some random countries and the random ages.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.360
But for the first name and last name,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.890
I just wanted to use a specific service from from Chrome that I found that's at the user

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.170
toe.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.950
The list.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.050
Escape the new user.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:27.410
We'll go it or la McCoy counter plus plus or,

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.850
uh,

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.250
Goi.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:40.750
Let's add 19 and she's from USC.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.760
It's Formato beat the coast.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:52.450
So we currently have three users and maybe a final user.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:07:00.650
Here's our new usar counter plus plus.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:12.400
So let's go big down and use.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.760
Yeah,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.650
this should work,

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:19.460
jury and,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:19.770
uh,

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.850
yeah,

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:31.650
that's the name 42 and she's from Canada.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.850
Let's add the final user under the users list.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.620
Okay,

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.450
so currently under the users least will have four users.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.660
Each one will have ah,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.850
different I d.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.430
So on the find.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.320
All mentored.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.520
Let's use the users list that we just created.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.890
They remove this list.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.350
Okay,

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:06.850
so find all returned The users list that we had created on the static block.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:16.050
Let's start the application once again.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:21.550
Spring with publication is starting.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.550
Okay,

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.950
so the service has started.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.650
We can go to Chrome.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:37.450
And now if we select a P I users,

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:43.000
we'll see that we were able to retrieve the list of users.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.160
How?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.550
Four years or so over here.
