notation for a field called past sword.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.460
Okay,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.990
we need to update our constructors to take into account these new fields.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.800
So string,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.700
user name,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.350
string,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.070
password.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.650
That's also add values to them.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:01:02.040
This past ward equals password was generate the get our sense setters for our user name and

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.900

Also was generate.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.100
Surround them random string.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:47.300

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.210

I just tried to see more later user name and password here,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.400
So Okay.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:14.250
And the last one verone e ma on and let's at sea were here.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:22.280
Elio idea Random Your i d to think so all 10 users were updated.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.210
That's great.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:38.150
And now let's stop the application.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:50.340
We're started and they could look into postman to see how the final users AP I will will

00:05:50.340 --> 00:06:03.610
take into account also the user name and password for each Each user server is starting.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.650
Okay,

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.350
good.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.170
So I went now toe,

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:28.950
find all users invoking the request and we're going to see that you fields were added for

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:29.850
each user.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.650
Good.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:41.050
Each off the 10 users have Ah has ah,

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.300
user name and password.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.020
Now,

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.950
if you try to add a user,

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:56.600
it would fail with 400 bad requests that isco due to the fact that we did not set ah user

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:03.580
name and the password for our user that now this feels are mandatory This recall that we

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:13.700
sit not know And also we have the valid annotation in our arrested point for the ad

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.450
operation.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:23.450
Let's go it I don't know something like this.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:34.270
Even if the the user name does not match,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.250
let's play a bit.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.280
Okay,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:46.030
that said that of the two John of the Toe Martine H.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.990
22.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:57.090
And also let's update the country to your say and we'll have a new user created and on the

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.450
final users,

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:05.210
we have the password.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.160
He's shown as it is,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.310
it's not encrypted,

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.870
so we need to fix this
