00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.870
under this video will not rely anymore on the default spring.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.110
Both security,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.010
but create our cost.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.610
The mall security from scratch.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.130
So we'll set up when you package name called Com.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:29.010
That configuration and the over here we can create a new class on.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.640
Let's call it security config.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.210
Okay,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.450
that should be good to go.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.960
This Ah,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.250
this closeness to be annotated with the enable Web security,

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.090
this is ah,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.400
spring stereotype that will tell spring this that this class will handle the main business

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.050
logic for our security Can see that this is ah,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.510
annotated.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:15.640
The configuration enabled global authentication and other security specific away concepts

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.240
such as in memory security,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.750
different authorisation requests that can be implemented and so on.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.790
You can see that this class is,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.320
uh is ah,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.150
spin security related at the as the comments suggest.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.040
And now,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.960
since we created this security conflict,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.920
conflict less,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.640
we need to extend the web security config,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.250
configure a doctor,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:07.590
and we have some some methods that we need toe set up in place,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.780
such as,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.350
ah,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:20.340
configure public void configure that takes http security as an argument under this method,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.200
will set up different permissions for our,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.350
um,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.400
requests such as age two requests and also our a p i user request.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.750
So we can take the http security para matter and evoke the authorize requests.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.780
And based on this,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:53.570
we need toe have on and match er for H two in memory console.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:05.710
These two symbols will will allow every requests that come after h to Toby permitted since

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.330
we ah,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:15.380
we added that permit all also another and match er can be set up for a B I users.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.140
Same thing for a p I users.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.680
Ah,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:34.720
match er that will allow ah will allow Whoa other formatted girls still Toby Toby set and

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.550
accessible.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.790
Um,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:48.330
I had to create ah role such as Admiral and the A CTB basic as on ah authentication method

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:56.380
will will show you how this would work and the next try in orderto toe properly.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.000
Access are este p I for this demo,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.050
I disabled the Croce iris request forgery.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.850
Okay,

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.120
so can see that this requires to throw some specific exception.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.750
So I will throw the exception from this method.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.370
So once again,

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.110
this is ah,

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.360
minimum configuration,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.940
me mom.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:35.300
Custom configuration that can be set on extra point is toe allow age,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.850
too.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.240
Council Toby accessed.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.970
So I had to ah,

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.290
get the headers,

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.020
the frame options and also to the disable operation,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:55.290
since this will allow me to access the each to console Enbrel.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:07.700
So once again now let's do something like adding the configure global method and also dis

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.780
acquires to be off the wire using gun authentication Manager builder.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:26.130
This will basically set up the user name and password Toby in memory and have the ad

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.100
minerals role configured with it.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:39.020
You can see that I created the ought in memory authentication with user add mean password.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.830
Let's use the same password.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:56.140
And let's also set up a role such as admin that will match the role I added on the previous

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.750
method.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.850
Okay,

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.220
and this also requires some exceptional handling.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.050
So I just throwing the exception here,

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.790
and that's basically it.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.300
Okay,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.950
looks good.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:30.170
Now let's go back to toe our application and restarted this will,

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.750
ah,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.150
take a few more months or the application to start.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.110
So once again,

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.530
I set up the minimum custom.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.960
Ah,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.450
secretly configuration.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:54.190
You can see that that password is not present any more scenes with Have admit that mean

00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:07.270
configured and let's go to our A p I and just invoke invoke it with the user and old

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.900
password.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.190
We don't have access since we changed what may not mean.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.880
Let's use at mean for user.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.230
I mean,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.340
for password.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.710
That's update our requests and the invoke it.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:29.020
You can see that we received the 500 internal error coat that will be fixed in the next

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.660
paedo.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:37.070
This is how this happens due toa password in colder that is not present in tow.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.150
Our application Basically we need toe in code.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.500
Ah,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:47.050
the in memory user password that we created for that mean unmin
