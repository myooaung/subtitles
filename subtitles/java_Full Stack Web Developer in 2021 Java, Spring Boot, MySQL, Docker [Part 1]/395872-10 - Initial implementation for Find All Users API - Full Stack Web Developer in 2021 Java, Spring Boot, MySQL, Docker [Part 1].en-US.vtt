00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750
let's create together the basic implementation fourth or final users a p I.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:15.470
So let's create an interface from Com that service package and let's call it user service.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.850
Okay,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.800
under user service,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.050
I would like to set up a new method called Final.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.110
Ah,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.000
that's great.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.250
Let's actually return a list off users since we need to return multiple users.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.250
Okay,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:57.640
now we need to import the You have a list and also the user model class from conduct model

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.550
that user.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.750
That's great.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.980
And since we have an interface,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.270
we also need the implementation for this soil create on additional package called Comb.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:25.560
That service that I m pl and under this package will set up a new class called User Service

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.560
.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.650
I am peel.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.650
Okay,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:39.950
so this user service I am peel needs to implement the user service.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:48.480
Let's import user service.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.100
And also let's implement the fine door business logic.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.200
So far,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.080
I don't want toe return.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.650
Nool.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.410
Uh,

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.750
just let's creator new least off users on empty,

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.070
leased off users.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.480
And let's return it,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.790
at least for the moment,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.790
okay or a list.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.750
I import it.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:31.780
Palestina released and just returned or users list now we need to tell spring that this

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.420
will be a service class.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.830
It's,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.370
ah,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:42.080
spring specific stereotype that will tell spring that under this class will have business

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.750
logic.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.340
Now,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.160
since you have the interface in the service willing to implement and basically create a new

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.340
class for the user controller okay,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.990
under combat control,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.600
you see that I created this class less till spring that this will be,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.030
ah,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:20.570
arrest controller will be on entry point from our client toe our application and then two

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:34.650
point will be local host 80 80 And let's set up AP I got a B I slash users over here.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.950
Okay,

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:48.980
Something like this should go now.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.950
We need to implement the find all method.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:05.120
We're eternally stuff users under this final method will involve the user service to

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.850
extract that empty leased off users when he poured Java Util list.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.150
But before actually using the user service,

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:27.550
we need toe injected under our control across using the auto wired connotation.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.610
Basically,

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.140
spring will know that behind the scenes were want to use the user service.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:47.240
I am peel corresponding class and let's invoke user service that find all and also return

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.380
this and the list.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.440
Now it's important to tell spring that.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.850
Well,

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.070
executor,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.140
get a request for this mental.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:09.050
I think we are in a good state now.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.370
Okay,

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.720
So once again,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:23.330
we have this fund or method in our controller that use his user service injected.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.750
Using auto wired is user service interface has find all method.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.800
And under our user service,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.720
I am peel.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.270
We have on implementation for this method and user service.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.080
I am peel.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.850
It's a service class.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:48.790
I just started the application once again since I want to see the final metal in action,

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.550
even if this method does not actually return any users.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.250
And let's invoke local host 80 80 AP I users.
