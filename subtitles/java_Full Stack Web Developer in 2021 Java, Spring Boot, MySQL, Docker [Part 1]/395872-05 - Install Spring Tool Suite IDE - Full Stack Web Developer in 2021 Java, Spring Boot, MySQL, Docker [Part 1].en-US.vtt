00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.150
So let's type,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.800

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.450

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.770
We can keep this.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.170
So jar file showing folder and double click on it.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.250

Okay.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.210

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.920
Quit the Sprinkles.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.430

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.200
Great sold ideas open.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.700
But to be honest,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.030
I'm not quite happy with this white screen.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:04.240
I will choose a specific template so we can go with the eclipse marketplace and search here

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.350
for wait a few seconds for this to load and we can search for dark esteem.

So now I'm restarting the i d.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:31.650
