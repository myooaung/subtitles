00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.550
That's more four guys and implement on add user a p I.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.420
So under our user service were greater.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.550
Add method.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.750
Use a user Okay,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.510
on there are user service.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.330
I am peel.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.490
Let's import okay,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.750
that mattered and implement it.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:38.250
So for the users least will just need toe ad at user toe the users list.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.810
Okay,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:53.800
And we also need to take care off the i d and used this camper in good.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.070
So let's move under user controller and use the post mapping.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.890
Since this AP,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.950
I will be invoked using post method.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.050
So post matting post mapping slash AB.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.750
We're also return a really response entity for this method.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.190
Let's call it ad.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.040
We'll set up the user user over here,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:34.330
so this method will be invoked using on user as body will invoke user service,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.290
not add user and just returned.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.650
Ah,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:49.450
new response entity void http Status and use created that status schooled,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.700
so created will map toe,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.060
toe,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.350
one start scope.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:03.250
So next we need to set up some specific at Riboud's.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.220
So for the user,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:15.510
we need to set the request body so that spring will be able to interpret the user and we

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.810
can also add some validation toe This user,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.050
such as we will expect the first name last name,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:31.770
age and country being being set for for the user as mandatory fields.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:40.160
We're not interested in the i D and let's use the valid a notation toe.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.650
Verify this user so spring will be ableto verify this user on the request.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.710
We're now ready.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:03:00.550
Let's start the application so the application is starting.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.250
Okay,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.000
let's move back Toe Postman.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.050
And over here we can create a new request.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.450
Let's call it.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.350
Had the new user save it or collection.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:41.050
We need to change the get the post and use local host 80 80 AP I users add Let's save it.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.690
What?

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:51.710
We also need the body toe This ad ap I so we can just copy paste this as a reference goto

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.280
body for a DP.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:03.810
I select Jerry son and we can remove this idea since this will be automatically set up for

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.430
from our application.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:13.120
Let's add the new user her use my name age in country.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.340
Just one example.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.890
Guys,

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:26.800
we need to invoke the send operation and you can see that the one status code is the return

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.800
,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.770
and basically the new user has been added to the list.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.810
You can see it here with the I D five now.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.690
If we go back and don't add country for a user,

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:54.330
you can see that the validation process kicks in and we have 400 about bad request.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:01.740
This happens due to this validation being added,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.570
not more.
