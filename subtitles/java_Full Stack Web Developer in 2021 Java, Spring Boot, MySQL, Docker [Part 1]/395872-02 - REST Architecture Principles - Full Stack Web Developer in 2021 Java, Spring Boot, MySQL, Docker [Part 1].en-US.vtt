00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
before diving in and start to implement coat that would correspond for STP I.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:13.450
We should have a quick overview off the main principles behind caressed http Status cold

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.450
and so on.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.290
So what is a Web service?

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.590
As a simple definition,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.770
this can be represented as a service component made available to users over the Internet.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.390
The multitude off protocols and standards available created since the end of the last

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.720
century in the Internet fear have made it possible to communicate between applications on

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.750
long distance systems with Internet access.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:52.640
Classic examples of Web services exposed on the Internet are fighting out the quarters

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.950
stock price off a particle or stock,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.900
or finding out the weather conditions in a certain part off the world.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.190
What defines the rest are hit picture.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.600
It is an architectural style that defines a set off recommendations for designing

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.450
applications that use the hypertext transfer protocol for data transmission.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:27.350
The reporters transfer protocol http represents is the foundation off the World Wide Web

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.100
and can be seen as a protocol used for distributed collaborative hyper media information

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.850
systems.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.380
In the following,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.300
we will analyze the main components that underlined the writing off rest based Web services

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.300
.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:53.430
Those are http methods and steak Those coats Standard coat returned by the server based on

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.940
a specific client request http Methods under arrest.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:07.860
Architecture http defines a set off request methods to indicate the desire action Toby

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.110
performed for a particulary source.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.890
Although they can also be knowns,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.570
these methods off requests are sometimes referred to us.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:26.060
Http words The get method is used to withdraw data from a resource.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.800
The post method is used to create the resource.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.150
The put method is used toe update a resource.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.980
The deal it method can be used to delete a specific resource.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:51.390
The head method withdraws meta data from the server and the options well,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.450
we drove all possible words methods exposed by a resource.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:07.280
Http Status codes Status codes are issued by the server in response to a client request to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.950
the server.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.880
We will now present the main list off status codes.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:23.400
One x x information 100 stands for continue and was designed to send input toe.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.180
The Server two expects success 200 OK.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.890
The request was executed successfully and for 21 created,

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.000
the request was fulfilled,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.630
resulting in the creation off the new result free X x or direction 301 Permanently

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.250
mortified or moved.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:57.610
The request has been assigned when you and a permanent war I and subsequent requests should

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.510
use one off the return your eyes for resources.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.490
Four.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.740
Expects client er 400.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.860
Wrong request.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.280
The request could not be understood.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.050
Perceived by the server.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.810
Do toe wrong or incomplete syntax for a one or notarized.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.260
The application requires user authentication for over a forbidden.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.090
The server understood that the request but refuses to fulfill it.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.770
User authorization doesn't have permission.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.420
Talks is the resource Final four not found.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.850
The server did not find anything matching the your I request.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.490
Five.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.650
X x server Error.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.500
500 Internal server error.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:01.340
The server encounter on unexpected condition first incrementally applies five mandatory

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:09.440
constraints and the optional one on the elements that make up the architecture client

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.960
server.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:17.960
Separating the aspects off the user interface from the data storage stateless.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:25.410
Keeping session details strictly to the client does freeing the server from the burden off

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.420
session management to bring scalability,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.180
security and visibility.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.940
The disadvantage is that each request will have to contain enough information.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.250
Toby Ableto proceed correctly.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:48.610
Cash the data that makes up our response must be labeled as cash usable or known,

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.080
cash usable uniform interfaces between components.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:02.250
It simplifies nd couples the architecture along each party to evolve independently.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:11.450
Layer system the component can see and interact only with the layers in its immediate

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.250
vicinity.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.790
For example,

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:21.670
customers cannot assume that they are interacting directly with the data source because

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:30.010
they can communicate with a cash level optional on demand code.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:38.580
Servers can temporarily extend or customize a client's functionality by transferring

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.930
executable code,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.160
for example,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:48.410
compile components such as Java applets or client scripts such as JavaScript.
