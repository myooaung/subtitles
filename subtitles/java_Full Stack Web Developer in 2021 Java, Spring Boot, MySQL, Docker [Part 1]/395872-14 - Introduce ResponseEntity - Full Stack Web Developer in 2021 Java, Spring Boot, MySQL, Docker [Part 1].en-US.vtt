00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.890
I would like to introduce the concept off response entity under our controller in order

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.200
through have more control over the http status coats.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.450
So for the fine by user method,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:26.250
our returner response entity with the question mark adjourning ST month and instead off

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.950
returning user optional that get we can create a new response entity.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:47.150
And we can sit the body as use the optional that yet tohave some content to display.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.310
And also we can use http status as okay,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.580
This will map HDTV status.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:08.050
Go toe 200 instead of a question mark we can use And the user here less fix the state month

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.550
Okay?

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.050
.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.750
And instead,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.090
off returning No,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:25.330
we can t turn on your response entity with no content and we can set avoid here with http.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.550
Status not found.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.950
Okay,

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.490
So if we're able toe extracting user 200 start to school.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.340
If not 44 now,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:53.450
we can also go to the find or method return Also hero response entity,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:08.260
Question mark and create the new response entity where we will set the user service,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.380
find all response under it,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:21.360
use their service find all okay and hash TTP that state owes that.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.850
Okay,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.450
so this will map also toe 200.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.250
Good.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.950
So both methods were outdated,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.750
not start the application.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:43.190
Okay,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.350
lets wait for this to start.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.960
Great.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.850
It started.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:03:02.560
Now let's go to Postman and use the free for the find user by d We can see that this was

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.400
returned.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400
Since we have four users,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.450
the second user okay,

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.070
and you zone I d.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.550
That does not exist.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:24.380
We can see that four or four has bean returned and the find all mattered returns the list

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.720
with 200 as status scope.
