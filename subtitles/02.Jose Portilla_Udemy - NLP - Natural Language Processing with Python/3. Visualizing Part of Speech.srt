00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,350
Welcome back to this lecture on visualizing parts of speech.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,930
We just saw how to extract parts of speech tax from tokens and obtain information about those parts

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,150
of speech tags.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,930
Let's quickly review how to visualize parts of speech structure with the Speccy we've already seen this

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,410
before.

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,420
So this is really just a review lecture.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,890
Let's head over to the notebook to begin.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,750
You should import Spacey and also load the space English language dictionary.

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,330
Then we're going to do is create our document.

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:41,500
So let's go ahead and just say something like The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,680
lazy thought.

12
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,960
There we go.

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:56,350
Now in order to display when you say from Spacey import this Blazey and then off this display See object

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,790
we can call render we pass in the document we want to display and then we have to choose a style.

15
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,030
And for visualizing parts of speech probably the best style to choose is DGP which is going to this

16
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,730
place syntactic dependency but also show you the part of speech tags.

17
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,110
And then since I'm using Jupiter I'm going to say Jupiter is true.

18
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,470
And if you just run this inside of Jupiter You should see the visualization occur.

19
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,310
So here you can see the speech tag.

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,400
So Fox is a noun and we can also see the syntactic dependency so we can see a proposition and so on.

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,960
OK.

22
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:37,980
Now there's definitely options that you can actually use as modifiers for this rendering and what you

23
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:45,600
do is you create an options dictionary will say options and the various options you can choose are the

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,710
distance.

25
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,170
So one of them as I mentioned is distance and you can edit that to create more distance between these

26
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,470
words or less distance between them.

27
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:01,380
You can also describe if you want it to be compact or not so spacey will attempt to make this as compact

28
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,940
as possible depending on what distance you chose.

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,130
So you can say compact and here you actually pass in a string.

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,120
True.

31
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:16,830
You can decide on a color for the actual text so you can say color and this can take in basic strings

32
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,490
or hex codes for color.

33
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,900
So you can say something like I want to text the color yellow.

34
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,490
You can also say B.G. for the background color.

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,950
So again you can take in a string code here like red or you can actually passen your own hex code.

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,780
So if you do a hex code picker you should be able to kind of mix and match and choose whatever hex code

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,270
you want.

38
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,580
I'm going to put one in here that we have in the notes and then you can also choose the fonts.

39
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,780
Keep in mind that every single font is going to be available.

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,300
It should just be the ones that are available from the space documentation essentially General fonts

41
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,870
that are available in your browser.

42
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,030
So for example at times new roman and it provide times.

43
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:00,200
So you can run that and then essentially it lets go ahead and copy and paste this render.

44
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,740
And if you do shift tab here you should notice that there is an options parameter.

45
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:12,020
So we're going to do is say options is equal to options and when you run that night you'll see the various

46
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,290
options occur and Lotusphere we our distance but compact is going to compact down these curves to just

47
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,290
be flat.

48
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,050
So previously we had this kind of larger curves compact flattens them out hopefully make it a little

49
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,210
more compact along that vertical axis.

50
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:32,180
We can see the colors now yellow for the words we chose our own custom background color and then we

51
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,210
also went with times new roman font.

52
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,830
So that's how you can customize the appearance.

53
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:44,030
Keep in mind if you're doing really large tax display see serve is meant to accept a single document

54
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,490
or a list of documents since large texts are difficult to view and online.

55
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,530
You may want to pass a list of span's.

56
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,980
Instead let me show you what I mean by that.

57
00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm going to say doc to is equal to an LP I will say this is a sentence this is another sentence.

58
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,320
And then let's actually make this one longer.

59
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,930
This is another sentence possibly longer than the other.

60
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:23,590
And what we can do is we can create a list of spans so I can say span's is equal to and then casting

61
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,900
as a list I'll take doc to call S E N T S.

62
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:35,320
So I remember that actually GRABBE sentences automatically and then we're going to say the C and what

63
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:43,820
we can do is we can say instead of render serve and then pass and the span's will again choose the style

64
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,250
to be syntactic dependency style.

65
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,500
And if you want you can pass an options or not.

66
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,410
Now you don't need to pass and all the options you can do something simple like a distance parameter

67
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,550
and so on.

68
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,330
Keep in mind when we say serve it's actually going to serve and render this outside of the Jupiter note

69
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,560
but since we're not saying Jupiter is equal to true so we're going to run this.

70
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,070
They should see something like running on port 5000.

71
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:16,630
So what you need to do is inside your browser you need to go to 6:59 point zero point zero point 1 and

72
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,900
then say Colan 5000.

73
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,290
So we're going to go ahead and copy this and then open up a new tab and paste that in.

74
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,680
Hit enter and now you should see the various spans so you can say this is a sentence.

75
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,510
And if you scroll down you'll see another spand right there.

76
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,460
OK.

77
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,590
So we just saw how to visualize inside the Jupiter notebook using this Blaikie render.

78
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,950
And we also saw how to visualize outside the notebook using serve.

79
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,450
And again the serving is going to serve on a port depending on how many times you're serving.

80
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,300
This port might be slightly different in which case if it's serving on port five thousand one you would

81
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,120
just do something like 5000 on here.

82
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:55,800
OK.

83
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:01,280
That's it for creating visualizations and the unable to visualize the parts of speech.

84
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,140
Coming up next we're going to talk about names and city recognition.

85
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,850
We'll see it there.
