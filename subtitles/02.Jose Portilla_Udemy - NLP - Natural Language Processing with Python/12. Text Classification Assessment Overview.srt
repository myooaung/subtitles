00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,930
Welcome back to make sure you've understood all the topics discussed in this section of the course.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,350
We designed an assessment that mimics what we just did in the previous code along lecture.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,880
Let's go ahead and take a look at the text classification assessment.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,880
And in the next lecture we'll go ahead and go through solutions.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,120
Let's walk through the notebook.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,620
All right here I am at the tech's classification assessment notebook.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,300
So this is going to be really similar to the code along project you're going to perform your inputs

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,350
load dataset independence data frame.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,550
Just keep in mind we're now working with movie reviews to ts V.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,500
So it's a very similar data set and you're just going to complete the tasks below performing imports

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,120
loading the dataset check for missing values removing those values taking a look at the label columns

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,250
using things like value accounts splitting the data into a training and test set building a pipeline

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,410
to vectorize the data then trying to fit the model run predictions and analyze the results using it

14
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,420
confusion matrix A classification report and then printing out the overall accuracy.

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,140
All right.

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,200
Coming up next we're going to work through solutions.

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,140
I'll see you there.
