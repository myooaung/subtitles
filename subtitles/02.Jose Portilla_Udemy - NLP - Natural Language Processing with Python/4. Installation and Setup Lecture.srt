1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,900
Hello everyone and welcome to the course installation and set up lecture in this lecture room.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,350
The three main things.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,080
The first one is to show you how to download and install Anaconda.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,100
The second one is how to create a virtual environment using an environment file that we give you.

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,010
And the third one is opening up that Jupiter notebook system as a quick note.

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,970
If you're an advanced user and you're already familiar with some other development environment or I.T.

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,870
please feel free to use it.

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,760
There's no restriction on what ease you need to use all the Python code that we show in this course

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,960
will work on any ID that can run regular Python.

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,860
We do however recommend using our suggested environment including a Jupiter notebook and tools to avoid

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,930
issues along the way as well as being able to directly interact with the code.

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,480
Juber No because a great system.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,120
And if you haven't tried it out first I would encourage you to try it.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,280
But again please feel free to use any development environment you prefer.

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,400
Also keep in mind this lecture has resource links.

16
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,490
Make sure to download that.

17
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,930
Why a mail file before starting this lecture.

18
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,100
OK we're going to start off by showing you how to download and install Anaconda.

19
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,570
Anaconda is a distribution of Python that includes a bunch of scientific libraries that is really useful

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,910
especially for natural language processing.

21
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,770
Go ahead and either google search Anaconda download or go to the link here.

22
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,290
I'm going to head over to my browser and go to that link now.

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,450
OK here I am.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,910
Anaconda dot com slash download.

25
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,460
Keep in mind this web site does change its appearance from time to time so if it looks slightly different

26
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,710
for you don't worry that's totally OK.

27
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,950
Somewhere along this page you should see three download options one for Windows one for Mac OS and one

28
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,910
for Linux.

29
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,290
So right now I'm filming this on a Windows computer so you simply click on your operating system.

30
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,970
You'll scroll down and it should give you two options one for Python 3 and one for Python to.

31
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,790
Go ahead and download the graphical installer and the pending on what kind of Windows machine you have.

32
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,510
You may need to download 32 bit instead of 64 bit.

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,000
But if you're on a more or less modern machine it's more likely that you have a 64 bit.

34
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,460
So go ahead and download that installer.

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,260
If you're on Mac OS simply click Macalester and then download that installer.

36
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,350
And if you're on Linux you're going to also have installer that you can download.

37
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,540
Keep in mind once you've downloaded that file if you scroll down there is a link telling you how to

38
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,820
install in a condo.

39
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,250
I would highly recommend you check out that link.

40
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,800
It changes the pending operating system you choose.

41
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,110
Basically if you click on that link it'll take you to the documentation on how to install and there

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,130
are specific step by step instructions for installing on Windows installing on Mac OS and installing

43
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,180
on Linux.

44
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,470
So essentially if you have any questions during the installation process there's written instructions

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,790
detailing step by step how to install in a condo in Windows on your computer.

46
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:52,840
Ok so I'm going to go ahead and download this file and then keep in mind locate where ever you actually

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,540
have the graphical installer on your computer.

48
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:02,230
Let's jump to me double clicking on that graphical installer Once you've installed that or once you've

49
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,560
downloaded an installer it's time to actually install Anaconda.

50
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,410
So a click open here this executable file that downloaded for me and then you'll have the Anaconda set

51
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,360
up guy.

52
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,670
You'll go ahead and click next agree to the license agreement.

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,170
I would recommend just installing it for just me.

54
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,270
Then hit next.

55
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,770
Go ahead and select the default hit next.

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,570
Then eventually you'll have the advanced installation options.

57
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,160
There's two advanced options here.

58
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,020
You'll notice that one of them says at Anaconda to my path environment variable.

59
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:41,060
If you've already installed Python previously maybe you've already installed Python from Python or than

60
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,220
actually highly recommend clicking and adding anaconda to my path environment variable.

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,520
I know it says here that it's not recommended.

62
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,930
But if you have previous versions of Python what ends up happening is when you download or install certain

63
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,990
files your computer gets confused.

64
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,730
As far as what's Python version it should use your previously installed Python or your anaconda one.

65
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,410
So if you've already installed python in the past from Python the org then I highly recommend adding

66
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,760
anaconda to your path environment variable.

67
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,040
If this is your first installation of Annacone then python ever then it's actually not really necessary

68
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,310
to do that.

69
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,070
OK so once you're all done with that go ahead and click install.

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,190
Alright once you then installing.

71
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,390
We now need to download the libraries you use for this course.

72
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,530
The Anaconda's installation has also installed the Anaconda prompt command line tool.

73
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,740
We're going to be using the command line for the next few steps.

74
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,000
Keep in mind if you're on Mac OS or Linux you can also use your terminal as the command line or if you're

75
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,130
on Windows you should also be able to use your command prompt.

76
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:39,870
All right.

77
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,380
So for this next step we're going to do is we're going to both create and activate the virtual environment

78
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,760
we provided for you.

79
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,720
This virtual environment is essentially a simple text file of a bunch of libraries that download along

80
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,710
with a specific version of the libraries.

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,380
That way you're going to be using the same libraries we use when creating this course.

82
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,800
So you shouldn't have any issues with typos or small syntax changes and this environment does this all

83
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,080
for you automatically check out the resource links for this particular lecture and download the Y.M.

84
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,110
file.

85
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,990
Upon clicking that resource link you should see something that looks like this.

86
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,180
It's essentially a Google rivaling with an p underscore course underscore envied that why M-L is a simple

87
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,140
I.M. file.

88
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,880
It's not going to preview you simply just need to click here on this download button.

89
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:30,890
Ok so once you've downloaded that you must keep track of the location of the dot why a mail file you're

90
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,510
going to need to know its location in order to use it.

91
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,620
Let's now go to the command line search for Anaconda prompt on your computer and then get started with

92
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,680
creating an activity in the environment.

93
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,430
Jump over to my command line now.

94
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:50,060
OK here I am and I'm going to search for Anaconda prompt on my computer and you should see the Anaconda

95
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,410
prompt.

96
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,700
Show up again if you're on Mac OS or Linux and you don't find the Anaconda prompt through a spotlight

97
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,210
search.

98
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,190
We can do is also use Terminal.

99
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,200
If you're on Windows and you still don't see Anaconda prompt We should also be able to Taipan is CMT

100
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,490
and just use the normal command prompt for our use case though.

101
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,070
I'm going to use the annica the Anaconda prompt.

102
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,860
So let's click on that and open it.

103
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:18,080
OK so I opened up my anaconda prompt and right now I'm located under-sea users and then my username.

104
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,970
Keep in mind that I must know the location of my thought why M-L file that I just downloaded from the

105
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,450
link.

106
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:30,380
So right behind that here we can see that underneath my downloads folder I have the LP underscore course

107
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,870
underscore NVI that y m l.

108
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,270
So I need a change directory and make sure I'm in the same directory as wherever this why all file.

109
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,070
So you have two options.

110
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,440
You can either change directory at the command line or simply move that y M-L file to wherever you're

111
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,180
located in the command prompt.

112
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:54,290
So I can either move that folder to under user of my username or I can see using the words or letters

113
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:00,920
CD and then type out the file path that my mail file is and you should be able to have autocomplete

114
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,310
so only to change directory or CD into Downloads.

115
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:11,990
And then if I'm on Windows I can type Diyar and I should be able to confirm that my M-L file is there.

116
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:18,230
If you are on Mac OS or Linux the command for listening everything is simply L S for list.

117
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,790
All right now it's time to take that.

118
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,550
Y m l file and then restore the environment from the dot.

119
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:32,350
Why M-L file the command for doing this is simply Konda eat NVI space.

120
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:41,720
Create space single dash F and then the name of the file which is an LP underscore course.

121
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,680
Underscore E and V thought y and L.

122
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,640
Now before I hit enter I want to show you two really common errors.

123
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,980
The first error is to accidentally have a typo.

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,770
So for example let's say I forgot one of these underscores and I tried running this.

125
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,190
If you have a typo somewhere you're going to get this error.

126
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,500
Can't process without a name.

127
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,640
If you have the error please triple check that you do not have a typo.

128
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,420
If you've confirmed that you don't have a typo then you may be in the wrong directory.

129
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,280
So for example if I actually go back up the directory notice now I'm in the wrong directory.

130
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:28,140
I'm no longer in downloads so if I were to try to run the command Konda ENVI create dashed F and even

131
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,170
with the correct filename if I hit Enter I'm going to get the same error.

132
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,410
This is a really common error and there's only two possibilities.

133
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:42,750
Either you spelled the file name wrong or you are in the incorrect location and you're not in the same

134
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,750
location as that.

135
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,190
Y.M. file please.

136
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,560
Triple check that in case you get this can't process without a name error.

137
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,200
Again it's an easy fix.

138
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,870
You simply need to be in the correct directory so will say CD to download.

139
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,140
All right now that we've confirmed or in the same directory as it that why M-L file simply type out

140
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:09,360
the command Konda space E and V space create space dasht F and then the name of the y m l file.

141
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,990
If you're in the correct directory you should either be able to tab autocomplete.

142
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,150
This last part if you're not able to tab autocomplete that then it's a good indication they are in the

143
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,190
wrong directory.

144
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,140
OK so I'm in the right directory.

145
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,930
I haven't committed any typos so I'm going to hit enter and then you should see something pop up that

146
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,060
it's solving the environment and getting the packages ready for you.

147
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,250
So once you do that it's going to eventually hit you with the list of packages to be installed.

148
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,280
It's going to be a pretty long list and that's going to ask you for a yes or no and you're going to

149
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,130
type out why.

150
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,140
Yes.

151
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,630
All right.

152
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,540
After you've installed everything you should see the actual commands to activate the environment.

153
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,060
So you'll see something like activates it use this and then to deactivate the environment.

154
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,720
Use that.

155
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:58,100
So here are the commands conduct of a and b course Conda deactivate the commands may be slightly different

156
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,160
depending on operating system we are using.

157
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,050
If you are a Mac OS or Linux you may have the same source activate anyways.

158
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,150
The command will tell you what to type out.

159
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,500
So any time you want to run the environment you're going to have to activate it.

160
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:16,380
So we're simply going to say Konda activates an old P underscore course.

161
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,440
Enter any notice here on the left.

162
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,590
Now it's telling you you are operating in the virtual environment and again you have to activate this

163
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,990
before typing out the following.

164
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,230
Jupiter space notebook and what this is going to do is going to start to put a notebook in whatever

165
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,900
directory at the command line.

166
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,840
And then from here you can work with our files that we've given you.

167
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,740
So I'm going to enter

168
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:48,660
and once you hit enter you should see a pop up with a token and your browser should actually automatically

169
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,600
open to the Jupiter notebook page.

170
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,360
So let's go ahead and go to that now.

171
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,000
OK so here I am at Jupiter notebook.

172
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,110
You notice I have that y M-L file because I ran this in the same folder under Downloads and then I see

173
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,430
other downloads.

174
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:09,370
So all you need to do is simply click new notebook and then you have a new notebook ready to go.

175
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,130
So this is the environment we're going to be using.

176
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,500
It's essentially just Python written in cells so you can say something like prints hello do shift enter

177
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,810
together and then you get to see the actual output directly below.

178
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,530
So I do encourage you to do is download the zip file that contains all the coarse notebooks and then

179
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:30,230
simply unzip it to wherever you're going to be running Juber notebook.

180
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,200
In this case I have have it in the actual downloads folder.

181
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:34,720
All right.

182
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,340
If you have any questions please search the Q&amp;A forums in case someone has posted a similar question.

183
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,900
And check out the ific Q lecture.

184
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,520
If you still can't find an answer post the question answer forums your question with as much detail

185
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,180
and screenshots as possible and I will be happy to get you up and running.

186
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,830
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
