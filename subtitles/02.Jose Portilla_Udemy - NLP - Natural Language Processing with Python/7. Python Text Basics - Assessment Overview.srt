00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,790
Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,320
We're going to have an overview of your assessment for this section of the course.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,110
Let's go ahead and show you what is expected of you for the python assessment by opening up the notebook.

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:17,380
All right.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:23,200
So underneath the python text basics folder you should see a note book called Python text basics assessment

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,950
and you should see another one called solutions which we're going to go over in the very next lecture.

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,130
If you open up Python text basic assessment you should see a couple of questions here.

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,750
Essentially your tasks are just lined up in bold blue.

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,710
So first one is to print the string that displays an LP stands for natural language processing.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,610
So maybe it's a little hard to tell from the front.

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:50,130
But basically we have two variables in LP in natural language processing and use of strings to print

12
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,230
out this one single string.

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,730
So that's just as string literals.

14
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,260
Little reminder how to do that then files who wants to create a file in the current working directory

15
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:05,620
called contacts thought Trixi by either doing it manually or running the Sellery here that open the

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,630
file and use that read to save the contents of the file to a string called fields and make sure the

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,250
file is close at the end.

18
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,160
So fields just be a single string that looks like this.

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,420
Then using pi PTF to open the file called business underscore proposal that PTF and extract the text

20
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,610
of page 2.

21
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:29,350
So underneath Python text basics there is a PDA here called business underscore proposal.

22
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:35,270
Go ahead and use typedef to open it and extract the text from page to and it should look something like

23
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,340
this.

24
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,160
Next.

25
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:42,740
Open the file called contacts text me and append mode and add the text page to from above.

26
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,370
Context RTX T.

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,710
And there's a challenge here.

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:52,040
See if you can remove the word author's So then we have two solutions one for the normal assignment

29
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,740
and then one for the challenge assignment and then we have the expressions task which is using the page

30
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,820
to text variable created above extract any email addresses that were contained in the file biz's proposal.

31
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,700
So remember we showed you how to extract phone numbers.

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,530
See if you can figure out the basic pattern of an email address which should be some sequence of characters

33
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,880
and then the key thing here to realize is the symbol and then an other sequence of characters.

34
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:18,880
OK.

35
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,150
Best of luck on the assessment coming up next we're going to go over the solutions.

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,720
We'll see there.
