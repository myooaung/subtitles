Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.330
So far we've learned how to work with text files of Python.

3
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.170
Do some things like regular expressions as well as work of PDA files.

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.620
But I wouldn't say that those processes that we've learned are really natural language processing.

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.640
So what is an LP or natural language processing for a formal definition.

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.960
According to Wikipedia.

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.230
Natural Language Processing or an LP for short is an area of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence

8
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.690
concern of the interactions between computers and human.

9
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.890
That is natural languages in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts

10
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.620
of natural language data.

11
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.230
Now to put this in more simple terms.

12
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.390
Often when performing some sort of analysis usually have lots of data that's numerical and that's really

13
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.870
convenient.

14
00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.540
Things like sales numbers physical measurements quantifiable categories and computers are already very

15
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.830
good at handling direct numerical information.

16
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.260
However what do we do with computers about actual natural language data that is text data as humans.

17
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.410
It's really easy for us to tell that there is a plethora of information inside of a text document like

18
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.200
a PDA file an e-mail a book there's lots of information that we can easily access because we're humans

19
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.720
and we understand how to read that natural language but a computer needs specialized processing techniques

20
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.410
in order to understand raw text data text data is highly unstructured and can also be in multiple languages

21
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.610
not just English.

22
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.930
However we'll only be dealing with English language in this course.

23
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.440
Natural Language Processing attempts to use a variety of techniques in order to create some sort of

24
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.950
structure out of raw text data.

25
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.760
In this section of the course we're going to start actually discussing some of these basic techniques

26
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.930
which is why we didn't really introduce this lecture of what is an LP until now.

27
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.340
So these techniques are built into libraries such as spacey and LTE.

28
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.930
K. some example use cases of natural language processing is taking a raw text email and classifying

29
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:15.310
it as spam versus a legitimate email or taking a raw text movie review and actually grabbing the sentiment

30
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.080
Alliss being able to tell if the review is positive or negative.

31
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.770
And these are things we're actually going to do during the course and we can also do things like analyze

32
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.260
trends from Britain customer feedback forums or even understand text commands such as when you're talking

33
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.740
to your phone.

34
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.050
You say something like Hey Google play this song or Hey Siri or hey Alexa that needs natural language

35
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.030
processing in order to convert that text information to something the computer can understand.

36
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.540
So natural language processing is constantly evolving.

37
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.540
And great strides are made even every month here.

38
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.620
We're going to focus on fundamental ideas that all state of the art techniques are based off of.

39
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.370
So let's begin by learning about the basics of using the spacey library.

40
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.820
Coming up next we'll talk about space basics.

41
00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.590
I'll see you there.
