00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.780
Welcome everyone to this lecture on setting up Spacey before we set up Spacey and download the language

2
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.560
library.

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.050
Let's quickly discuss what Spacey actually is.

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.310
Spacey is an open source natural language processing library for Python.

5
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.740
It's designed to effectively handle an LP tasks with the most efficient implementation of common tasks

6
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.080
and algorithms.

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.990
That means for many natural language processing tasks Spacey only has one implemented a method choosing

8
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.390
the most efficient algorithm currently available.

9
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.360
Usually that means state of the art.

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.100
This means you often don't actually have the option to choose between algorithms for a particular task.

11
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:49.660
Spacey only has one option which is the most efficient currently available now and LDK is another library

12
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.350
we're going to be using throughout this course and this one's more common so you may have already heard

13
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.730
of it and LDK stands for the natural language toolkit and it's a very popular open source library.

14
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:06.110
It was initially released in 2001 so that means it's much older and spacey which was released in 2015.

15
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.320
It also provides many functionalities that includes less efficient implementations and that's probably

16
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.190
one of the main differences between Speccy and LDK.

17
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.880
So let's quickly compare that to for many comment and LP tasks.

18
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.020
Speccy is much faster and more efficient at the cost of the user not being able to choose a specific

19
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.170
algorithmic implementation for most use cases.

20
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.760
That really doesn't matter because you care about the end result not using a particular form of the

21
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.750
algorithm.

22
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.780
So for that reason space is much faster than an LDK because until Teekay has a variety of implementations

23
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.060
for a lot of common tasks when Spacey just defaults to the most efficient currently available and it's

24
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.590
also much newer keep in mind space.

25
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.490
This includes some pre-created models for some applications that caters such as sentiment analysis which

26
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.640
is typically easier to perform with an altercation.

27
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.740
That means in this course due to spaces state our approach and efficiency we're going to focus on using

28
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.330
space where it really matters but will also introduce and use an altercation when it's easier to use

29
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.650
for certain tasks.

30
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.880
By the end of the course you should feel comfortable utilizing both libraries when they are best suited

31
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.210
for a particular task.

32
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.900
Now there is some processing data as far as efficiency of LDK versus Spacey.

33
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.450
And here we can see a table comparing Spacey to a bunch of other libraries including analytics.

34
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.670
They're at the bottom.

35
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.770
And we have the absolute millisecond per documents on the same hardware being run.

36
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.230
And we also have relative to space which is probably the more important part.

37
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.330
So Lotusphere that spacey can tokenize tag and parse documents and if you compare it speed to an LTE

38
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:52.880
K and old C K takes 20 times longer to actually tokenize in a document reading and it takes 443 times

39
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.520
longer to tag and it actually doesn't even perform parsing.

40
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.530
So you can already tell here that space is much more efficient than an LTE k up to 400 times more efficient

41
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.440
or more.

42
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.400
So that's really where we're focusing on spacing throughout this course.

43
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.000
If you want to get more facts and figures of performance metrics of spacey versus other libraries you

44
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.990
can check out this link above Spacey at the IO slash usage slash facts figures and Ill compare the capabilities

45
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.320
a Speccy versus other libraries.

46
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.990
Keep in mind we're focused on Python.

47
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.410
So really should we focus on speccy versus And LDK and you can see here it has a lot more models implemented

48
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.990
things like neural network model spaces built ready to perform state of the art neural network analysis

49
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.920
and LDK really isn't suited for that.

50
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.620
But there are a few cases where we're going to use analytics throughout the course so keep mine look

51
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.680
at that link if you want.

52
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.340
Spacey compare it to other libraries.

53
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.610
For now let's quickly walk through setting up Spacey and downloading the language library for this I'm

54
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.700
going to open up my command prompt.

55
00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.670
So if you're on Mac OS or Linux Open your terminal and if you're on Windows open up your either Anaconda

56
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.220
prompt or your command prompt.

57
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.540
Let's head over to that now.

58
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.190
So depending on how you actually downloaded and installed Python in a anaconda you should be opening

59
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.430
up either the Anaconda prompt or the command prompt.

60
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.240
And if you're on a Windows computer you want to make sure you run this as an administrator.

61
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.660
You also want to make sure you don't have a firewall because we're going to be downloading the language

62
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.120
library from the Internet.

63
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.160
So from a command prompt and willing to run this as an administrator and now I have my command prompt.

64
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.440
Keep in mind sometimes when you run this as an administrator they'll automatically open the system 32.

65
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.960
You probably just want to be located in your C folder.

66
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.990
So the first thing in the Taipan is if you're located in kind of a strange folder with some permissions

67
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.870
issues type See CD space dot dot and then see the space dot dot.

68
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.410
And now we're in the C-Drive.

69
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.210
That should make sure that we don't have any permission issues as well as the fact that we're running

70
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.060
this as an administrator.

71
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.480
The first thing to do is make sure you've activated our virtual environment that we provide.

72
00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.900
Or if you're not using our virtual environment make sure you actually have installed Spacey.

73
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.280
Now there's several ways to do this.

74
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:16.060
If you're using anaconda you can say Khanda install space dash see Conda dash forge Spacey and we actually

75
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.840
have all of this in the Speccy basics notebook.

76
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.140
You can go ahead and check that out.

77
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.520
We have a two step process written now and you can enter here and that should install Spacey for you

78
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.030
from the Anaconda packaging system.

79
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.590
So let's go ahead and fast forward in time until that's done installing.

80
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.420
Once that's done installing the thing you should see a bunch stuff that looks like this.

81
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.540
Again if you're using our environment file there should have been installed for you already.

82
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.110
The next thing however you're going to have to do even if you are using our environment file and that

83
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.720
is from the command line we need to download the language library that spacey needs and that language

84
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.170
library is a big reason about why space it can operate so efficiently.

85
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.020
So to do this you're going to need to double check that you have full administrative capabilities to

86
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.430
download stuff onto a computer.

87
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.410
If you're on a work computer you may need to ask for those permissions.

88
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.150
You may also need to check that make sure you don't have a firewall blocking your ability to download

89
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.260
stuff from the Internet.

90
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:23.410
So the next thing from the command line is you're going to type python space dash em space Spacey space

91
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:30.380
download space e m which stands for English and you're going to do this once you've installed.

92
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.760
Spacey go ahead and hit enter.

93
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.510
Now what this is going to do is it's going to automatically download from the command line.

94
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.580
The English language library now can see here.

95
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.140
I've actually already performed this download.

96
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.110
If you haven't yet it may take a while.

97
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.430
But unsuccess you should see something that says something like linking successful.

98
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.400
So it says you can now load the model using this command speccy that load.

99
00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:00.090
And so that's what we're going to be using in the next lecture to actually load up our English model

100
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.310
and there's various versions of the English model.

101
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.420
You can check out the Speccy documentation for more details and we'll explore as we go along for the

102
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.060
course.

103
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.950
But those are essentially the main two steps that we need to do.

104
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.520
We need to make sure we had spacier installed and also make sure that we set up the spacey language

105
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.330
library.

106
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.520
Coming up next we're going to have a quick discussion on natural language processing basics.

107
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.980
Before we jump into space basics we'll see at the next lecture.
