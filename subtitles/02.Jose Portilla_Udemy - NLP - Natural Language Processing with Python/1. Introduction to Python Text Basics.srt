00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,980
Welcome everyone to the first section of the course we're going to be talking about on text basics.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,660
So the goals for the section is to understand how to open a normal text and PDA files with just a few

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,850
basic Python libraries including built in functionality where we have no external libraries.

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,060
Then we'll learn some very basic regular expressions.

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,000
Being able to find patterns in text and then will test your skills assessment exercise.

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,270
Again this is really just to get you comfortable with reading and text plans with just normal Python

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,270
libraries.

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,330
Let's get started at the next lecture.
