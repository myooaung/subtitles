00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.100
are to set up Spacey and the language library that you need to download for Spacey.

And we're going to understand some basic and OLP topics.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.490
We're going to have a few introductory lectures that discuss common libraries such as Teekay versus

6
