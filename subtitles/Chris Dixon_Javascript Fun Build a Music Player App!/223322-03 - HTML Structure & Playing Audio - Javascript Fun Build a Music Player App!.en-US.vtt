00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
You should now have a song's folder ready with

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.360
some music which you want to play inside this application.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.530
To get started, this is going to be the project which we are going to be building.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.885
It's going to be a music player application,

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:16.065
which will allow us to add some audio files to our project,

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:18.540
and then play them inside of this app.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.365
We're going to loop through all of the songs inside of our project folder,

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:24.405
which is displayed at down at the bottom.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:26.940
We can then click on any of these songs.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.360
We're going to see a little pulse animation with the header,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.835
and our song is now playing.

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:35.490
We also have some custom audio controls,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.530
we have the "Play" button.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.235
We have the "Pause" button,

00:00:38.235 --> 00:00:42.160
and we can also control the volume down at the bottom.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.545
This is going to have a audio progress bar too,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.950
so we can see how far through this song we actually are.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.145
I'm sure you're eager to get started with this project.

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:54.995
Let's create a new folder on the desktop.

00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:57.840
We're going to call this the music player.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.290
Drag over our song folder.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.190
Then we can open this up in Visual Studio Code.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.580
The first thing as ever we need to do is to create

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.820
a index page inside of our music player.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.980
Let's click on a new file,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.230
and this is the index.html.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.590
You also have the option to use the same headphones image I've used here.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.770
Or you can also download your own too.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.750
If you do want to use the exact same one head over to

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.230
the same GitHub repository that we've used throughout this course,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.780
go into the music player application,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.855
and then we'll see a headphones.svg.

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:43.490
If we click on this,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.635
we can then click on the "Code" icon,

00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:49.970
which then will give us all of the SVG code we need to add to our project.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.590
Let's grab all this code,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.790
and then create a new file inside the sidebar.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.035
I want to call my new headphones.svg.

00:02:00.035 --> 00:02:03.680
Paste our contents and save this file.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.030
We'll come back to this in a just a moment when we get to that stage in our HTML.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.290
But for now, we need to create our HTML structure with the Emmet shortcut,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.420
which is HTML5. Hit "Enter".

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.440
Then we can change our document title to be "Music Player."

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.530
The user interface for this project is relatively straightforward.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.720
We're just going to begin by creating our image over the very top,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.735
inside of a main container.

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:34.415
Then below this will have our audio player. I will list the songs.

00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:37.460
We'll also use the default audio controls just for now,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.880
and then we'll override these in the upcoming video.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.550
First of all, inside of the body section,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.615
we're going to create a div,

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:48.140
which is the wrapper for our full project.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.710
This div is going to have the class of player.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.655
This is just so we can add some CSS styling in a upcoming video.

00:02:57.655 --> 00:03:01.715
The image is going to be the image which you just downloaded from GitHub,

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.965
or you can use your own if you prefer.

00:03:03.965 --> 00:03:12.430
At the source, mine is the "headphones.svg," only alt text too.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.125
Let us check this is work in by opening up our index page

00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:22.590
inside of the browser. Copy the path.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.990
Paste this in and there's our SVG on the screen.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.780
The next thing to do is still inside of this main div section,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.090
is to actually create our audio player,

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.500
which is going to play our songs.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.555
HTML has a audio elements.

00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:44.545
Let's add this in. This has the opening and the closing tag.

00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:49.390
Give us an idea of players so we can use this inside of JavaScript later on.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.770
Then we need to provide a audio source which the audio player is going to work with.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.435
We use this with the source element.

00:03:57.435 --> 00:03:59.260
This is a self-closing element,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.600
so we don't need to have a closing tag.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.570
Also for the purposes of JavaScript, later on,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.485
we'll give us an idea of source,

00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:09.455
so we can set this dynamically from our script.

00:04:09.455 --> 00:04:12.050
This also needs a source attributes.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.390
From here we can pass in any of our songs,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.705
which is inside of our songs folder.

00:04:16.705 --> 00:04:19.500
We can select any one of these.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.650
It doesn't really matter for now this just for our testing purposes.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.570
We've got our audio player and also a source.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.400
Then it just after this, we're going to add some text,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.800
which is going to be audio not supported.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.440
Now, the audio player has been around for a little while now, but if they use it,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.375
it's using a really old browser or a browser which does not support audio.

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:47.120
This text will be displayed on the screen in place.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.510
After the audio player, we can then get to work with creating

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.840
our song list with a level two heading of my songs.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.225
Our songs list is going to be wrapped inside of a div,

00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:02.280
with an ID of song list.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.450
For now, we're going to display an older list which has gone to output.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.960
The names of all the songs inside of our songs folder.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.110
Our first list item is going to be the first song which is

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.465
inside of our song folder. Let's open this.

00:05:19.465 --> 00:05:24.110
Then we need to type in a song exactly as it appears inside of here.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:33.185
The first one is from "bensounds-clapandyell.mp3" extension.

00:05:33.185 --> 00:05:35.360
I'm using six different songs here,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.060
which all start with Bensound.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.885
I'm going to duplicate this five more times.

00:05:40.885 --> 00:05:44.290
The second one is "Dance."

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:52.270
The third one, "Funky Element." Then "Happiness."

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.710
"Happy Rock." Then last one is "The Lounge."

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.270
We can either refresh the browser or we can also make use of the live server.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.975
I'm going to go up to the "View" command and enter the Command Pallete,

00:06:08.975 --> 00:06:11.735
and then do a search for the live server.

00:06:11.735 --> 00:06:15.240
Then open this up with the live server.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.060
Now inside the browser, we have our headphones image.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.235
We also have our list of songs,

00:06:22.235 --> 00:06:26.270
but currently, we don't see anything related to our audio player.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.700
This is because to make this appear on the screen,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.470
we also need to add the controls.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.230
This is an attribute and this will make sure our audio player displays in

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.090
the browser and includes all of the necessary controls we need to control our songs,

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.520
which is play, a volume slider,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.970
and also the time duration of the song.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.770
Since we've already set the source to be one of our songs,

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.415
we can now press "Play" inside the browser.

00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:56.040
Our song will now start the play.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:03.160
This is the basics of our HTML and also a standard default HTML 5 audio player.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.800
However, though we're not going to use this audio player for our project.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.970
We're going to move on now to the next video,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.450
where we're going to create a custom audio player.
