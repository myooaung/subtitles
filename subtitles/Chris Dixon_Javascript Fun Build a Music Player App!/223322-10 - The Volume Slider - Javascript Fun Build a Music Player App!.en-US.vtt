00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
We're now going to create the functionality to control

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.015
the volume inside of our audio player.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:10.845
This is being created inside of our index page as a range slider.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:14.715
Therefore, we need to access this element with our ID.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.730
At our script and at the very bottom we can create a

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.950
constant which is going to store a reference to our slider.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.075
We can select this with get element by ID.

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:34.590
The ID which we've just seen is the volume slider, access our constants.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.510
Then we can add the on input event handler which is going to trigger

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.070
a function each on the value of our range slider has changed.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.595
This is also going to take in the event information.

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:52.030
Let's do a console log and see what information is stored in this event.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.965
Into the developer tools we'd right-click and inspect, click on the console.

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:00.365
Then if we adjust our range slider,

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:03.260
we see that each time the slider has changed,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.665
this will trigger a new event.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:07.650
Let's expand this.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.310
Just like we looked at earlier to access our element,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.130
we select the target property.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.275
If we scroll down, we can find the value of our element.

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:24.545
Our slider has the range from 0-1 and currently we have a setting or a value of 0.43.

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:26.255
We can now use this value,

00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:28.220
store this inside of a constant,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.730
and then set our play volume.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.340
First of all, we'll create our constant to store this value

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.985
called volume and set this equal to our event

00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:40.730
which is stored in e. We'll select

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.415
our target and then the value just like we've seen inside the console.

00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:48.075
Access our play variable.

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:53.910
Now we can set the player.volume to be equal to our volume variable.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.990
Let's try this out over inside of the browser.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.980
Choose any song. It should start playing.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.360
Let's test out our slider by going right back down to zero and the audio has gone,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.050
push this right up to the full volume.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.990
We can now here our audio at its loudest setting.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.360
With our controls all now taken care of,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.920
now let's move on to the next video and we'll create our progress bar.
