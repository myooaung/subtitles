00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
Before we get started with our music player application,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.010
we also need to find some songs to be able to play inside of our app.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.405
So if you have some MP3 files or some audio files you want to use,

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:18.390
you can of course, use these existing ones and place these in a folder called songs.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.940
Here I've got six songs ready,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.530
which I'm going to use this app.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.150
All you need to do is to drag over

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.650
any existing music files you may have and place them in a songs folder.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.080
Alternatively, if you don't have any songs available,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.955
there is many sites available to download some files.

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:38.225
I'm going to be using the audio files from bensound.com,

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:43.480
and bensound.com is a way to download some royalty-free music to use in our app.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.765
We can select the music by different genres. We can select all.

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:50.705
We also have all the different labels above the top here,

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:52.464
we can scroll through the pages.

00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:55.455
Then once you find some songs which we like,

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.780
we can click on the download.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.780
We see we have some options for downloading.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.720
We can use this with a free license if we provide some attributions to the offer.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.320
All we need to do is to write a link in our project to the site.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.230
If you do like any audio which is on this site,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.430
go ahead and download some of these and place them in the songs folder.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.750
There is also a Pro license available to purchase too.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.720
This is if we don't want to provide any attribution.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.030
Go ahead and download some music which you would like to use.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.635
Put them in the songs folder,

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:31.170
and we'll begin creating this in the next video.
