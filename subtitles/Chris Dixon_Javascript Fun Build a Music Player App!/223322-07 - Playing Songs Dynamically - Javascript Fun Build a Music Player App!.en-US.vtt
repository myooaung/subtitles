00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.215
Good, so we now have our songs listed inside of the browser,

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:07.695
and the next thing we're going to do is to enable the user to click on

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:11.730
any of these song titles and then load this into the player.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.920
The way we're going to do this is, again,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.930
making use of our song list,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.230
and then we're going to trigger a function each time and this is clicked on.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.485
Rather than duplicating this section here,

00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:29.310
we're going to solve this reference inside of a constant called songList.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.125
We can then grab our appendChild section which we created in the last video,

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.955
remove this, and then we can add this directly to our constant.

00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:44.075
Now we'll have the song list stored inside of a constant.

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:48.560
We can also make use of this and listen for any clicks to the section.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.860
We can do this with a property called onclick,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.755
and this is going to trigger a function.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:58.475
This function is going to take in the event information,

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.400
and we'll take a look at exactly what information is included

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.040
with this event by logging this to the console.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.630
Now we head over to our console inside the browser.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.610
Click on any of these songs,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.505
and then we'll see lots of information is displayed inside the console.

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:21.320
We see this is a mouse event,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.210
since this is been clicked on with the mouse.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.930
In particular, the piece of information we're interested in is this target just here.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.865
Inside of the target, we need to scroll down and take a look for our innerText.

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:38.600
We can see the innerText contains the name of our song.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.555
If we also try to click on any different element, such as number 4,

00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:46.960
we can then go back to the console,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.100
open this up, and inside of our targets and again down to our innerText.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.465
We see we have access to our song title once again,

00:01:55.465 --> 00:02:00.800
so what we need to do if we go to our index page and scroll up to our audio player,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.780
remember from the source elements,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.940
we've moved this source attribute early on.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.895
What now we need to do is to grab

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:12.380
our inner text and then replace this as our new attribute.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.020
The way to do this: first of all,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.360
if we grab a reference to our source,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.370
and we can do this with a document.getElementById.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.370
The ID for this element is also source,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.915
and now we can access our source variable,

00:02:33.915 --> 00:02:36.554
set the source attribute,

00:02:36.554 --> 00:02:40.235
and the attribute is going to be the file path to our song,

00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:43.820
so all of our songs are stored inside this songs folder.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.410
We need to add songs,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.750
forward slash, and then,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.010
just like we've seen in the Console,

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.275
to get the value of our song name,

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:54.035
we need to access our event variable,

00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:58.710
the target, and then also the innerText.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.060
Then, there are two more small things which we need to do.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.125
These two things is to actually load the audio and then the call to play function.

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:11.460
To do this, we need a reference to our player.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.274
If we go back to our HTML,

00:03:13.274 --> 00:03:16.590
our audio element houses ID of player.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.425
Let's grab our reference, store this inside of a constant, Here const player.

00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:28.980
This const is equal to document.getElementById, the ID is player.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.080
Then we can use this player variable to,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.600
first of all, call load,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.300
which is going to preload the audio which we set just

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.830
above without actually playing it inside the browser.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.670
It will also remove or reset any previously loaded songs.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.225
After this, we once again access our player variable.

00:03:47.225 --> 00:03:49.430
But this time, we call play,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.195
which is going to begin playing our audio track. Let's try this out.

00:03:54.195 --> 00:03:55.675
If we go over to the browser,

00:03:55.675 --> 00:03:57.865
click on any of our songs,

00:03:57.865 --> 00:04:00.870
you should now see that the songs are immediately playing.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.140
Good, so now this is in place.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.225
I'm just going to go back to our index.html.

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:08.080
If you're also using some audio tracks,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.340
just like I am, which needs some attribution,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.340
you can sort this inside of the HTML,

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.410
and what's on mine just below the song list.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.000
I want to add this as text,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.210
so music, mine is bensound.com.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.750
We'll nest it inside, I'm going to add a link with the a element.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.295
The link was https, this was bensound.com.

00:04:31.295 --> 00:04:36.380
We can also grab this link and paste this in as the link text.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.050
The link text is a little difficult to see,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.140
so we can make a small change to our CSS.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.285
Right at the very bottom,

00:04:44.285 --> 00:04:46.430
grab our a element.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:54.935
We can also set a matching color to be white smoke leaving our link much more visible.

00:04:54.935 --> 00:04:56.600
With our songs now playing,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.930
the next thing we're going to do in the upcoming video is to also grab

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.920
the song title and also display this just above our icons.
