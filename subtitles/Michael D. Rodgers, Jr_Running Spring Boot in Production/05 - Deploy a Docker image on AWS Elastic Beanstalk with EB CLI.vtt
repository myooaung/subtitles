00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.000
- [Instructor] Okay, with the AWS EBCLI installed

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.007
let's now add the necessary configurations

3
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:13.003
to deploy our Docker image to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

4
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:16.001
If you have not logged in yet to Vagrant,

5
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:17.009
ensure that it is started up,

6
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:25.007
and then type Vagrant, ssh, and hit enter.

7
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.005
Next, I have discovered that the system time

8
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.000
can get out of sync.

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.009
So we're going to run the following update

10
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.006
on our system time.

11
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:40.006
We'll type sudo yum install

12
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:49.004
ntp ntpdate -y.

13
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:51.008
Then to ensure that our system time is synced,

14
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:55.008
we'll type sudo nptdate

15
00:00:55.008 --> 00:01:02.004
space, pool.ntp.org.

16
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:03.009
Okay. Now we need to ensure

17
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.009
that our SpringBootProduction zip is unzipped.

18
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.009
And I believe we did that in our last video.

19
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.002
Yes, here it is.

20
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:15.009
So what we're going to do is we need to ensure

21
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.000
that the SpringBootProduction zip is unzipped.

22
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.006
We did this in our last video.

23
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:26.005
So type CD SpringBootProduction, and hit enter.

24
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:30.008
I'm going to clear the screen and type LS.

25
00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:34.000
At this point the next step is to configure our project

26
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.003
folder for Elastic Beanstalk

27
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:40.002
and to add the AWS credentials.

28
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:46.006
Now to do this we'll type EB, space, init, and hit enter.

29
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:50.004
This then will ask us to select the default region.

30
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:52.007
And you can find this region

31
00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:55.001
by looking in to the AWS console.

32
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.006
If you haven't logged into your AWS console,

33
00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:59.005
please do that now.

34
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:02.006
In the AWS console, if we click on Ohio

35
00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:05.004
we can see that it says US east 2.

36
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:06.008
That is my region.

37
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:08.007
I'm going to go back to the terminal

38
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:15.007
and I will select us east 2, which is number 14.

39
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:17.007
Hit enter.

40
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:20.003
The next question the EBCLI ask

41
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:24.002
is to provide an AWS access ID.

42
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.002
Now, again, we're going to have to go back

43
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:29.006
to our AWS console.

44
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:31.000
We're going to click over

45
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.008
on our name and then go to security credentials.

46
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:43.004
This will take us to a screen and we need to scroll down

47
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:47.009
to the access keys, click on that,

48
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:51.005
and we need to create a new access key.

49
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:54.001
We'll show the access key.

50
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm going to copy this information

51
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.001
and I recommend you do the same

52
00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:03.009
and I'm going to paste it somewhere safe on my system.

53
00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:07.007
We'll click download key file as well.

54
00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:09.008
And we'll close.

55
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:13.001
And we're going to go ahead and go back to our console again.

56
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:18.008
We're going to copy the access key ID

57
00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:21.007
and we're going to paste this in.

58
00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:23.001
Hit enter.

59
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:27.003
Then we're going to copy the other key

60
00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:30.004
which is the secret access key.

61
00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:34.003
And I'm going to paste it in and hit enter.

62
00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:35.009
Now, for those of you who are concerned

63
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:40.003
that my access key and my secret key are exposed,

64
00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:43.008
this account is created under my name

65
00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:47.002
and after this video it will be taken down.

66
00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:50.003
So good luck, if you try to.

67
00:03:50.003 --> 00:03:55.000
The next prompt is asking for an application to use.

68
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.008
My prompt gives me a default

69
00:03:56.008 --> 00:04:00.008
of the directory that we've CD into: SpringBootProduction.

70
00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:03.006
So for me, I'll hit enter.

71
00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:09.003
Otherwise choose 3 for a new application.

72
00:04:09.003 --> 00:04:12.007
And now it recognizes that a Docker file is in use.

73
00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:16.008
So say yes to that one. Hit enter.

74
00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:19.005
Remember that this whole process is for Docker,

75
00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:23.002
so we're going to select one and hit enter.

76
00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:27.007
And the next question is asking us for an SSH instance.

77
00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:31.003
Now I'm going to say no to this.

78
00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:33.008
You might be tempted to say, yes, that's up to you

79
00:04:33.008 --> 00:04:36.005
but I'm going to say no.

80
00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:43.001
Okay. So our application is initialized for AWS.

81
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:46.006
And if we type ls -la

82
00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:51.001
we can see that there is an Elastic Beanstalk file

83
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:53.007
hidden file that's created.

84
00:04:53.007 --> 00:05:00.000
So next we'll type eb create and hit enter.

85
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.001
We're going to hit enter for the default deployment.

86
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:09.000
We're going to accept the DNS and CNAME prefix.

87
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.004
And we're going to select 2 for load balancer

88
00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:19.004
and select N if we would like spot fleet request.

89
00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:23.007
After this you'll see the EBCLI

90
00:05:23.007 --> 00:05:27.005
outputting details about the current status

91
00:05:27.005 --> 00:05:31.007
of uploading the source and the Docker image.

92
00:05:31.007 --> 00:05:37.005
This may take some time depending on your broadband speeds.

93
00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:41.000
Now, what I'm going to do is switch back

94
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.008
to the Chrome browser.

95
00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:45.004
I'm going to go to the AWS home link

96
00:05:45.004 --> 00:05:47.005
and then I'm going to minimize this

97
00:05:47.005 --> 00:05:50.007
down a little bit so I can see what's happening

98
00:05:50.007 --> 00:05:57.002
between the terminal window and the AWS console.

99
00:05:57.002 --> 00:06:02.005
We'll click on Elastic Beanstalk.

100
00:06:02.005 --> 00:06:07.006
We'll click on SpringBootProduction dev

101
00:06:07.006 --> 00:06:10.009
and what you'll notice, what is being logged

102
00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:15.002
in these statements is also being reflected here

103
00:06:15.002 --> 00:06:17.008
in the terminal window.

104
00:06:17.008 --> 00:06:20.002
Again, this will take a few minutes

105
00:06:20.002 --> 00:06:23.009
but I want to encourage you to read the logging statements

106
00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.007
and get an idea of what Elastic Beanstalk

107
00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:30.009
is creating behind the scenes.

108
00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.006
Okay, now this is done.

109
00:06:32.006 --> 00:06:36.002
We can see that there are health issues again.

110
00:06:36.002 --> 00:06:40.004
If we click on causes and we can see that certain requests

111
00:06:40.004 --> 00:06:41.006
are ending in 500

112
00:06:41.006 --> 00:06:44.005
and that certain processes are not healthy.

113
00:06:44.005 --> 00:06:50.007
What I want to do is go back to our link at the top,

114
00:06:50.007 --> 00:06:54.000
we're going to click on the environment

115
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.007
and we can see that we get a bad gateway.

116
00:06:56.007 --> 00:06:58.001
So let's go back to the console

117
00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:01.007
and add the appropriate environment variable.

118
00:07:01.007 --> 00:07:04.008
First let's clear the screen.

119
00:07:04.008 --> 00:07:13.000
We'll type eb set env space

120
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:22.003
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev,beanstalk

121
00:07:22.003 --> 00:07:24.000
and hit enter.

122
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.005
After typing this and hitting enter,

123
00:07:26.005 --> 00:07:28.008
you'll see the console telling us

124
00:07:28.008 --> 00:07:31.000
that it's updating the environment

125
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.004
and configuration settings.

126
00:07:33.004 --> 00:07:41.006
If we go back to the AWS console and click refresh,

127
00:07:41.006 --> 00:07:47.006
we can see that the health spinner is again processing.

128
00:07:47.006 --> 00:07:50.009
The final step that we need to do is go

129
00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:58.009
to configuration, edit, scroll to the bottom,

130
00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:04.007
and we're going to add a serve report of 5,000.

131
00:08:04.007 --> 00:08:08.009
We'll click apply.

132
00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:13.001
And finally, if we click on, go to environment

133
00:08:13.001 --> 00:08:15.000
we'll see our application.
