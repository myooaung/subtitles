00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] Over the next couple of videos,

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:05.003
we're going to be deploying a JAR, a WAR,

3
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:09.000
and a Docker image on AWS and Azure.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.006
In order to do this, we'll first need to create

5
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.008
and sign up for an account in AWS.

6
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:17.006
In a later video, we'll focus on Azure.

7
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:18.007
With all of this said,

8
00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:22.006
let's jump into creating an AWS account.

9
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:27.004
Please navigate in your browsers over to aws.amazon.com.

10
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:28.009
And when the page loads,

11
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.008
you should see a button that says Create AWS Account.

12
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:36.002
Mine says complete Sign Up.

13
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:40.000
Go ahead and click the button.

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.002
Ensure that you're creating a new AWS account.

15
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.004
And hopefully, we'll all now be here

16
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.001
on the same sign up page.

17
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.000
Keep in mind that this account

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.007
is good for 12 months for free

19
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:58.001
and remains free for the trial period based, of course,

20
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:01.001
on the types of products you use.

21
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.006
Throughout the next several tutorials,

22
00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:06.007
we'll ensure to tear down our deployments after each use

23
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:11.003
so as not to get into any usage charges.

24
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.004
Now, this page requires that we provide

25
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.009
a valid email address.

26
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.006
I'm going to type,

27
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:26.000
cwm.simply.coding@gmail.com.

28
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.002
I'll provide a password.

29
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:32.000
I'll have to provide the confirm password.

30
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.002
And then we'll need to choose an AWS account name.

31
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:42.002
Click Continue.

32
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:46.003
Next, we're asked to enter the CAPTCHA text.

33
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:48.006
We'll do that now.

34
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:50.008
Click Continue.

35
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:51.009
Now, at this point,

36
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.001
we're asked to supply some contact information.

37
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.003
I'm going to choose personal for my own projects.

38
00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:01.006
I'll supply my full name.

39
00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:03.005
I'll enter my phone number.

40
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:04.006
For security reasons,

41
00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:09.000
you won't be able to see this in the video.

42
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.003
Apply my region

43
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.006
and my address.

44
00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:18.007
And don't forget to click,

45
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:20.009
I have read and agree to the terms

46
00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:25.002
of the AWS customers service agreement.

47
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:26.002
Now, on this screen,

48
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:29.004
you're going to be prompted for a credit card information.

49
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:31.005
They won't charge for usage fees

50
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:35.007
as long as we stay below the AWS Free Tier limits,

51
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:38.009
but there will be a $1 hold fee

52
00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.005
which will last for about three to five days.

53
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:46.005
This is to verify your identity.

54
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:49.009
Click Verify and Continue.

55
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.007
Okay, on the last screen,

56
00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:56.004
please make sure your country code matches the country code

57
00:02:56.004 --> 00:03:01.004
for the region that you give for a valid phone number.

58
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:04.000
It's up to you if you want to receive a voice call

59
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.009
or a text message

60
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.007
keep in mind that text message rates apply,

61
00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:14.000
and well, please don't bill me if you choose that option.

62
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.004
Now, pay attention to this weird CAPTCHA code at the bottom.

63
00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:23.007
I seem to always mess these up when I'm typing them in.

64
00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:25.006
Okay, if you did everything correct,

65
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:29.005
you should get a text message or a voice call.

66
00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:34.001
Go ahead and enter in the code that you received.

67
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:36.003
Click Continue.

68
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:37.002
And on this screen,

69
00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:42.004
we're going to select Basic support, Free,

70
00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:46.001
and click Complete to sign up.

71
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:47.005
Okay, that's it.

72
00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:49.000
Congratulations.

73
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.009
You have successfully created an AWS Amazon account.

74
00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:58.002
We'll click Go to AWS Management Console.

75
00:03:58.002 --> 00:04:01.002
We'll enter our credentials.

76
00:04:01.002 --> 00:04:07.005
Click Next, enter the CAPTCHA code

77
00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:10.008
and the password.

78
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:11.008
Okay.

79
00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:13.003
If you are successful,

80
00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:17.000
you should land here on the AWS Management Console.
