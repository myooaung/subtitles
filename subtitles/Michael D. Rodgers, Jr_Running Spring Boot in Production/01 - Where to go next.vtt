00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Michael] After looking through all of these various

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:06.005
package types and steps, utilizing Spring Profiles,

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:10.004
tapping into metrics, deploying our web application

4
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.003
to both AWS and Azure,

5
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:16.000
including taking advantage of GitHub actions,

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.004
you might be wondering what's next?

7
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:20.007
Well, there's quite a bit.

8
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.004
Honestly, we've only just scratched the surface.

9
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.006
For example, you could take a deep dive

10
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.005
into GitHub's competitor GitLab

11
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:31.000
and learn how to build CI/CD pipelines

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.007
through GitLab's unique but similar way

13
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.008
for automating, and testing, and building,

14
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:39.007
and deploying of your applications to production.

15
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:43.000
Another widely used application server deployment stack

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.009
is the combination of Git with Jenkins.

17
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.003
Many organizations are still tooled to use Jenkins

18
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:51.007
for testing, building, and deploying of code

19
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:53.007
to various environments.

20
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:57.008
Jenkins, as well, is a very mature application platform

21
00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:01.008
for handling these types of CI/CD pipelines.

22
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:05.004
Similarly, both AWS and Azure include something called

23
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:08.006
CodePipelines, which listen for push events

24
00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:11.006
on repositories, and feature functionality

25
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:14.000
for pushing all sorts of package types

26
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.001
through the deployment in production.

27
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.001
And while we're speaking of AWS and Azure,

28
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.005
we've only scratched the surface in using

29
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:26.004
the various CLI facilities of these cloud server stacks.

30
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.007
For example, although we've used the EB CLI,

31
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:34.000
we've never even touched the AWS CLI, which is different,

32
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.001
and has a distinct purpose outside of the EB CLI,

33
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.001
which is for Elastic Beanstalk.

34
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.007
Likewise, with Azure, although we've used the Azure CLI

35
00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:46.009
to perform some installs and configurations,

36
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.006
we could have used these also for cleaning up resources

37
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:53.006
and undeploying resource groups, applications,

38
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:55.007
containers, Docker images,

39
00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:59.003
and a host of other server resources.

40
00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:01.001
Both of these cloud platforms offer

41
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:03.003
so many other incredible useful tools

42
00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:06.000
like functions and serverless code,

43
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.008
DNS management, load balancing,

44
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:12.006
storage, and authentication, and much more.

45
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:15.002
I want to encourage you to continue learning

46
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.008
about what these cloud services can offer

47
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:21.001
and how you might innovate using them.

48
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.001
Lastly, we've not even talked about

49
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:24.007
other cloud service providers

50
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:27.007
like Google Cloud services, Oracle Cloud,

51
00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:31.001
or even Alibaba Cloud services.

52
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:35.000
All of these deserve some research and exploration.

53
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.008
You may never know which one is the best

54
00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:39.002
for you and your organization.

55
00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:41.008
Teaching this material has been a wonderful experience

56
00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:44.008
for me, and I want to thank you for joining me

57
00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:47.005
and learning so much about packaging and deploying

58
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:51.001
a Spring Boot application to AWS and Azure.

59
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:56.000
I hope to see you again for future courses, thank you.
