00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] For this course,

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.008
we're going to need a few tools installed in advance.

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:06.008
You may already have Java installed,

4
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.005
but we're going to install SDKMAN

5
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:12.004
because it makes it so easy to manage the installation

6
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:16.001
of GraalVM and other various JDK versions.

7
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.006
To do this, first go ahead and open the SDKMAN webpage

8
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:25.007
at sdkman.io/install on a Mac or a Linux machine.

9
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:26.008
It's pretty painless.

10
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:28.006
We'll just open up a terminal window

11
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:34.002
and we're going to copy the curl command listed here.

12
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:38.005
And in the terminal window, we'll paste it and hit Enter.

13
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:43.002
Next, we need to copy this source command here.

14
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:46.006
We'll copy that and paste, hit Enter.

15
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:49.004
Let's clear the screen.

16
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:52.001
And the last thing we need to do is check the version.

17
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:56.007
So we'll type SDK version and hit Enter.

18
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.002
This will tell us, of course the version

19
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:01.003
of SDK that's installed.

20
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:05.000
To install a JDK, we need to first see what is available

21
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.008
and we can do that by typing SDK list Java.

22
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:11.005
This will also tell us which one

23
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:13.009
we're already using if it's installed.

24
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.001
So there are many various JDKs

25
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.001
that we can use as we see here.

26
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:22.004
GraalVM is listed as well as several other options.

27
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.001
We only want to copy from the identifier column

28
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.000
for the JDK we're interested in.

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So I'm going to select Amazon Corretto version 8.312.07.1.

30
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.008
So I'll copy this text and I'd queue to exit.

31
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:45.005
And to install this version, we'll type SDK install Java

32
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:48.004
and paste in the identifier, hit Enter.

33
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:51.001
This is going to download that version.

34
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.002
And when it's done, it may prompt you

35
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:57.009
to type Y to set this as the default.

36
00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.008
Okay.

37
00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:06.000
Now we'll type Java-version to verify the version installed

38
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.007
and we can see our Corretto version OpenJDK is installed.

39
00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:12.007
Let's go ahead and clear the screen.

40
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.003
Now we're going to install Brew.

41
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.006
And if you've not used Brew before on a Mac,

42
00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:18.006
Brew is basically a package manager

43
00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:22.002
like what we find for Linux, but is for a Mac.

44
00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:23.008
And we're going to be using Brew

45
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:28.007
to install both Docker, Vagrant, and VirtualBox.

46
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:30.001
Now I want to forewarn you

47
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.005
that Brew will take quite a while to install.

48
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:36.007
Let's go ahead and open our browser windows back up,

49
00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:42.005
locate in your URL type Brew.sh.

50
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:48.001
And we're going to copy the bin command here

51
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:52.000
or you can click the clipboard icon to copy as well.

52
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.008
Go back to your terminal window,

53
00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:58.001
we'll paste that in, and hit Enter.

54
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:02.005
This will prompt you for your system password

55
00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:05.007
and accept the defaults.

56
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:07.005
Now, this is going to take a few minutes,

57
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:11.006
so just sit back and watch.

58
00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:13.004
Okay, that did take a little bit of time,

59
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:20.001
but once this is done, you can type Brew help

60
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.006
to validate that it's installed

61
00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:26.003
and also see all of the available commands and directives.

62
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:28.005
Okay, next, we're going to install Docker.

63
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:30.000
Let's clear the screen.

64
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.008
To do this, we're going to type Brew install --ask Docker

65
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.008
and hit Enter.

66
00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:41.007
Once it's done, let's go ahead

67
00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:44.008
and hit the Command + Spacebar.

68
00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:48.004
We'll type Docker, hit Enter.

69
00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:54.000
And the first time you're going to need to confirm to open

70
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.008
and it's going to ask you about downloading from the web.

71
00:03:56.008 --> 00:04:00.004
And so for that alert, we'll say open.

72
00:04:00.004 --> 00:04:01.003
Okay.

73
00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:04.004
So once Docker is fully installed and available,

74
00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:07.003
you should see this message saying

75
00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:10.000
that the Docker engine is starting.

76
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.001
Once this is complete, we're going to go back

77
00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:15.007
to the terminal and run one final test.

78
00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:18.001
Okay, let's go back to the command line.

79
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:19.006
We're going to run the final test

80
00:04:19.006 --> 00:04:27.009
and this will be typing Docker run hello world.

81
00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.004
This is going to download a Docker image called hello world

82
00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:34.007
and it will run it in the terminal.

83
00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:37.000
And as you can see here, this message shows you

84
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.001
that your installation appears to be working correctly.

85
00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:44.004
Okay, let's clear the screen.

86
00:04:44.004 --> 00:04:46.003
And for the last installation,

87
00:04:46.003 --> 00:04:49.002
we're going to install VirtualBox and Vagrant.

88
00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:50.004
Now later on in the course,

89
00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:52.007
we will be using VirtualBox with Vagrant.

90
00:04:52.007 --> 00:04:56.003
So we need to ensure that these are installed

91
00:04:56.003 --> 00:05:04.008
and to do this we'll type Brew install VirtualBox.

92
00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:07.006
Cancel out of that.

93
00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:08.005
I mistyped that.

94
00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:15.007
Let's do that again, Brew install VirtualBox.

95
00:05:15.007 --> 00:05:17.001
If you're prompted for your password,

96
00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:20.003
go ahead and enter your password now.

97
00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:21.003
And then this will be followed

98
00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:32.001
by Brew install VirtualBox extension-pack.

99
00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:35.001
And with those installed, we lastly need to install Vagrant.

100
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:40.003
We'll do this by typing Brew install Vagrant.

101
00:05:40.003 --> 00:05:43.000
Now, of course, we have one last step to install

102
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.002
and that is Git and Brew makes this easy.

103
00:05:45.002 --> 00:05:51.005
So we'll type Brew install Git and hit Enter.

104
00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:55.008
That wraps up the tools that'll be using except for an IDE.

105
00:05:55.008 --> 00:05:59.004
I'm going to be using IntelliJ Community Edition

106
00:05:59.004 --> 00:06:01.004
that we saw from our last video.

107
00:06:01.004 --> 00:06:12.002
You can find this at https://www.jetbrains.com/idea.

108
00:06:12.002 --> 00:06:14.005
I'm not going to run through the install

109
00:06:14.005 --> 00:06:18.005
because any capable IDE will do for this course.

110
00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:20.001
But if you want to use it,

111
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:23.000
I think you'll be delighted with it.
