00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] I think you'll find this course

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.002
more valuable and memorable,

3
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.001
if you use the exercise files that are available to you

4
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.003
so that you can follow along and work with me.

5
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:10.006
Once you've downloaded the files

6
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:14.003
be prepared to open each project directory in IntelliJ.

7
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:15.003
As you can see here,

8
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:18.005
I've downloaded them to my desktop and unzipped them.

9
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:20.009
Let's take a look at the layout.

10
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.006
The exercise files are broken down into chapters.

11
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.004
Each chapter has a number of directories

12
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:28.002
that either say begin or end.

13
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:32.001
For example, 01_02_begin is the beginning state

14
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.007
of the code we'll be using for that lesson.

15
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:39.008
Whereas 01_02_end represents the ending state

16
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:43.001
with all the changes that will been made for that lesson.

17
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.001
This should provide an easy way of comparing

18
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.006
the state of your code against an expected state

19
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:50.005
as the video lesson comes to an end.

20
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.008
To load the source code in IntelliJ,

21
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:56.002
I will be using IntelliJ Community Edition.

22
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.008
First click the Open button,

23
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:03.006
then drill down into Exercise_Files, Chapter_01,

24
00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:08.002
01_02_begin, and then select SpringBootProduction

25
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:11.009
with the folder selected and click Open.

26
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.008
You may be prompted with a dialogue that says,

27
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:17.000
"Trust project" and click to confirm that.

28
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.002
Additionally, you may notice

29
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:21.001
that there seem to be some type of error messages

30
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:25.005
displayed concerning invalid Gradle JVM configurations.

31
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:28.007
We'll be addressing those in the next video.

32
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:29.009
Now, there are a couple things

33
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.003
I want to show you at this point

34
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:33.005
that we'll be doing quite often.

35
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:36.004
First, the terminal window is at the bottom.

36
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:38.005
on a Mac or a Linux instance.

37
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:41.000
this will give you access to the terminal command line

38
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.005
or the Bash prompt.

39
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:45.006
On Microsoft Windows instances this terminal menu option

40
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.006
will give view access to the PowerShell command line.

41
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:50.004
We'll be doing the majority of our builds

42
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:53.007
with Gradle in this built in terminal.

43
00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:55.000
The second thing I want to show you

44
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.005
is how to navigate your project code.

45
00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:01.005
On the left side of the screen you'll see a button,

46
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.006
that if you click on, will expand and contract

47
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:06.001
the project menu items.

48
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:09.008
From here you can see the source code SpringBootProduction,

49
00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:12.002
and inside of that our source.

50
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:13.008
For most folks taking this course,

51
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.006
I'm assuming you already know all this.

52
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:17.009
So thank you for your patience.

53
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:19.007
For everyone else, if you get lost,

54
00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:20.006
or feel that you need to

55
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:24.002
re-download the exercise files again and start over,

56
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.000
you most certainly can do this.
