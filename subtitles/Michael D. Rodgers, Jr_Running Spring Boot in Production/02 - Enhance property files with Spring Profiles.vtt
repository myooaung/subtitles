00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] Property files are the bread and butter

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.003
of Spring Boot applications.

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.004
Learning how to enhance your property files

4
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.002
by using Spring Boot profiles

5
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.002
is an absolute necessity

6
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:13.009
when staging your projects for various environments.

7
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.002
We'll be using the source code

8
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:22.007
in Chapter_01, 01_02_begin, SpringBootProduction.

9
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:26.005
When you're ready, click Open.

10
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.007
Next, in the terminal window at the bottom,

11
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.008
we'll go ahead and clean and build the project.

12
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:37.007
We'll do this by typing ./gradlew clean build.

13
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:40.007
And hit Enter.

14
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.004
This may take a few minutes

15
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:46.002
the first time you build the project.

16
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.005
Next, in the same terminal window,

17
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:55.003
we'll run it by typing java -jar build/libs

18
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:58.004
and then tab over for the application name .jar.

19
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.005
Hit Enter.

20
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:01.007
With the project running,

21
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.007
let's go ahead and open a Chrome tab.

22
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:09.000
And type in localhost:8080 and hit Enter.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.002
As you can see here,

24
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:11.009
we have a basic web application

25
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:17.007
that greets us with a message Wisdom Pet Medicines default.

26
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:19.005
We're going to alter this in a moment

27
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:20.004
and I'm going to show you

28
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:23.006
how to access the environment profile that's set.

29
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:26.009
Keep in mind, this is for demonstration purposes only

30
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.002
to see the environment profile.

31
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:32.006
We would not want to display this in production.

32
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.003
Now, if we go back to our terminal window,

33
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:36.009
scroll to the top,

34
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.006
we'll notice that the default profile set is listed here.

35
00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:45.003
What this means is Spring cannot detect an environment

36
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:46.009
that you may have set

37
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.005
and so if no profile is active,

38
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.008
a default profile is enabled.

39
00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:55.008
The name of the default profile is default.

40
00:01:55.008 --> 00:02:00.009
And it can be set using spring.profiles.active

41
00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.000
with the environment property of the application at startup.

42
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.008
Currently, this project does not have

43
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:09.006
an environment-specific configuration.

44
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.007
Keeping in mind that our applications

45
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.007
must be environment configurable

46
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.004
for lifecycle development processes

47
00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:21.006
in development, user testing and production deployment.

48
00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:25.005
Let's go ahead and apply some environment-specific profiles.

49
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:29.009
Going over to the MainController,

50
00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:34.000
we'll type @Autowired.

51
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.002
Hit Enter.

52
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:38.005
Private Environment.

53
00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:39.008
Hit Enter.

54
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.008
Env.

55
00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:44.009
The Environment object represents the environment

56
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.003
in which the current application is running

57
00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:48.009
and will allow us to track

58
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.003
what environment profile we have set.

59
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:54.005
Now, you'll notice that we've defaulted the model attribute

60
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:58.006
to a key-value pair of env and default.

61
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:03.008
We'll change the env to environments

62
00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:11.002
and the attributeValue to env.getActiveProfiles.

63
00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:13.007
This method returns an array,

64
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:18.000
so let's go to our index.html

65
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.006
and you'll notice that we've already pre-populated the code

66
00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:25.004
for iterating over that array object of environments.

67
00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.002
What we want to do though is go ahead

68
00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:31.001
and delete this line right here.

69
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:32.006
I'll save that.

70
00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:34.001
Let's go down to the command line.

71
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:44.000
Control + C, we'll type gradlew clean build again.

72
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.007
Now we'll follow this with the appropriate Spring profile.

73
00:03:48.007 --> 00:04:00.005
So we have java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active equals dev.

74
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:03.006
We'll give the location of our application, build/libs.

75
00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:06.007
We'll tab over to get the full name, .jar.

76
00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:08.005
Hit Enter.

77
00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:11.006
We'll go ahead and go back to our Chrome tab

78
00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:15.000
and we'll refresh.

79
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.009
And as you can tell, it now says Wisdom Pet Medicines dev.

80
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.001
We'll go back again

81
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:24.005
and this time we'll change it

82
00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:30.002
to spring.profiles.active equals prod.

83
00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:35.004
Hit Enter.

84
00:04:35.004 --> 00:04:39.003
We'll go back and refresh again.

85
00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:41.005
And now it's changed to prod.

86
00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:43.009
Okay, let's make another change

87
00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.008
because we can load different sets of property files based

88
00:04:47.008 --> 00:04:50.006
on the name appended to the property file.

89
00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:54.007
So going back to our application source code,

90
00:04:54.007 --> 00:04:57.004
we'll go to application.properties

91
00:04:57.004 --> 00:05:00.006
and we're going to enter a new property.

92
00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:08.003
We'll type corporate.name equals Wisdom.

93
00:05:08.003 --> 00:05:09.006
We'll save that

94
00:05:09.006 --> 00:05:13.007
and then we're going to copy our property file

95
00:05:13.007 --> 00:05:14.009
and add it again.

96
00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.008
We'll paste this.

97
00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:19.005
And for the next one, we'll type dev.

98
00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:21.006
We'll click OK.

99
00:05:21.006 --> 00:05:23.006
We'll say here in this properties file,

100
00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:26.007
it's Wisdom Dev.

101
00:05:26.007 --> 00:05:29.000
We'll add another one.

102
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.001
Paste it and call this one -qa.

103
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:35.009
Click OK.

104
00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:39.001
Change the file here to QA.

105
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:42.006
And we'll paste one more time for production.

106
00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:48.000
Application-prod.properties.

107
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And we'll change this to Prod.

108
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.006
Again, this is for demonstration purposes only.

109
00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:59.001
Next, let's go back to our index.html.

110
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.000
Go to the Wisdom inside of the h1

111
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.006
and we'll wrap this with a span tag

112
00:06:05.006 --> 00:06:09.007
using a Thymeleaf text attribute.

113
00:06:09.007 --> 00:06:11.009
Dollar sign, curly bracket,

114
00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:17.000
and we're going to give this corporateName in camel case.

115
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.001
We'll finish wrapping it with span.

116
00:06:19.001 --> 00:06:20.004
Save that.

117
00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:23.009
And then go to our MainController.

118
00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.004
And this time, we'll add an @Value

119
00:06:27.004 --> 00:06:30.008
and reference the particular properties file.

120
00:06:30.008 --> 00:06:34.004
Corporate.name.

121
00:06:34.004 --> 00:06:42.008
We'll give this a private String corporateName.

122
00:06:42.008 --> 00:06:46.004
Scroll down to our model attribute.

123
00:06:46.004 --> 00:06:49.005
Model.addAttribute.

124
00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:55.006
Specify the attribute name of corporateName.

125
00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:59.000
And then referencing the string value of corporateName.

126
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.006
Don't forget to add your semicolon.

127
00:07:02.006 --> 00:07:08.005
With that done, let's clean and build.

128
00:07:08.005 --> 00:07:12.004
And we'll rerun the project using the dev profile.

129
00:07:12.004 --> 00:07:14.009
Hit Enter.

130
00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:17.008
We'll go back to our Tomcat instance.

131
00:07:17.008 --> 00:07:21.003
We will refresh again.

132
00:07:21.003 --> 00:07:23.006
Now as you can tell, we have Wisdom Dev,

133
00:07:23.006 --> 00:07:26.004
Pet Medicines dev.

134
00:07:26.004 --> 00:07:29.003
Let's try it again with one other profile.

135
00:07:29.003 --> 00:07:31.001
Control + C.

136
00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:37.005
This time we'll change it to qa.

137
00:07:37.005 --> 00:07:39.006
Hit Enter.

138
00:07:39.006 --> 00:07:40.008
Allow it to run.

139
00:07:40.008 --> 00:07:44.003
Go back, we'll refresh it again.

140
00:07:44.003 --> 00:07:46.005
And now it's changed to QA.

141
00:07:46.005 --> 00:07:49.005
Okay, so this gives environment properties

142
00:07:49.005 --> 00:07:52.002
that are externalized, testable

143
00:07:52.002 --> 00:07:56.002
and environment-specific by running the application JAR

144
00:07:56.002 --> 00:08:00.002
with the spring.profiles.active environment variable.

145
00:08:00.002 --> 00:08:01.009
The other nice feature here

146
00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:06.007
is that we only have to put environment-specific variables

147
00:08:06.007 --> 00:08:09.005
in property files that matter.

148
00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:11.001
The default property files,

149
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:14.005
which is the application.properties,

150
00:08:14.005 --> 00:08:19.006
should carry non-environment specific features

151
00:08:19.006 --> 00:08:22.002
that affect all environments.

152
00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:26.000
For example, if we're looking at the application.properties,

153
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.002
we could add a logo.title

154
00:08:30.002 --> 00:08:38.003
and give this the name Wisdom Pet Medical Clinic.

155
00:08:38.003 --> 00:08:39.007
We could save it.

156
00:08:39.007 --> 00:08:43.000
We'll go to our MainController.

157
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
We'll add another @value statement.

158
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.001
Inside of it, we'll specify curly brackets for logo.title.

159
00:08:54.001 --> 00:09:00.008
We'll give it a private String logoTitle in camel case.

160
00:09:00.008 --> 00:09:05.008
And then we'll add this to the model attribute.

161
00:09:05.008 --> 00:09:14.007
logoTitle referencing the string object logoTitle.

162
00:09:14.007 --> 00:09:17.004
If we go back to our index.html,

163
00:09:17.004 --> 00:09:21.009
this time let's change the title tag.

164
00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:26.003
We'll use the Thymeleaf text attribute.

165
00:09:26.003 --> 00:09:32.000
And we'll specify this to use

166
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.007
logoTitle.

167
00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:35.008
We'll save it.

168
00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:38.001
We'll come down.

169
00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:40.000
Hit Control + C.

170
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.004
We'll build the application.

171
00:09:42.004 --> 00:09:45.005
And when it's done building,

172
00:09:45.005 --> 00:09:51.004
we'll execute it with the QA profile and hit Enter.

173
00:09:51.004 --> 00:09:53.001
With the QA profile selected,

174
00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:57.008
it should be using the application-qa properties.

175
00:09:57.008 --> 00:10:01.007
However, because we put this in the default properties,

176
00:10:01.007 --> 00:10:05.003
it will affect all profiles.

177
00:10:05.003 --> 00:10:08.000
Wisdom Pet Medical Clinic.
