00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] Microsoft Azure has become

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.004
quite a popular alternative in Cloud solutions.

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:08.003
With Azure ranking and usage right behind AWS,

4
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.004
you can expect that having the right knowledge

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.000
and skills for your organization

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
will be important especially among software developers.

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.009
For this video,

8
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.002
you'll need to create a Microsoft Azure account

9
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.007
and will also install the Azure CLI

10
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:27.001
in our Vagrant instances that we set up back in 0304.

11
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:32.000
From the Microsoft Azure website, click on the free account.

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.006
Now, in order to use this, you're going to need two things.

13
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.002
A credit card and a GitHub account.

14
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.006
Don't worry about the credit card you won't be charged

15
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:44.001
but this will be used to validate and set up your account.

16
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.004
As for GitHub, we just finished setting up

17
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.007
our GitHub accounts in chapter four.

18
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.001
Now I must also warn some of our learners

19
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.003
that Microsoft does not support account creation,

20
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:55.007
as of this video,

21
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:59.005
if you happen to reside in one of the unsupported regions.

22
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:03.008
So some of you may run into issues with account creation

23
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:06.000
and unfortunately this could affect learners

24
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.004
in following along with the labs for this tutorial.

25
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.000
If this does affect you,

26
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I encourage you to contact Microsoft

27
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.004
and inquire when access to your region will be available.

28
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:19.003
And also please watch the videos anyways

29
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:21.000
so that you can absorb the content

30
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.008
and learn what resources are out there with Microsoft Azure.

31
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:27.008
Once you're done with account creation

32
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.005
please open up a different URL,

33
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:34.004
navigate to portal.azure.com.

34
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.000
Once you finish logging in

35
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.004
this will be the screen that we'll use

36
00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:42.006
to manage all of our resources in Cloud services.

37
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:46.000
And we'll come back to the site in the next video.

38
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.001
With that complete let's open up a terminal window

39
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.001
so we can start up our Vagrant instance

40
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.009
that we created back in 0304,

41
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.003
and we're going to prep it for running Azure CLI.

42
00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:01.006
If you have not already, please type Vagrant up

43
00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:06.004
and once it's done starting up you'll type vagrant ssh.

44
00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:11.005
As you can see here, I've already started and logged in.

45
00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:13.004
Once you're logged into the Vagrant instance

46
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:17.005
we're going to update or reinstall sdkman.

47
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.003
You should have installed sdkman

48
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:21.002
back in the introduction chapter

49
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:23.007
but I'm going to run through it again.

50
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:30.002
So first of all, we're going to type curl -s

51
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:44.003
"https:// get.sdkman.io" pipe space bash, and hit enter.

52
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:48.001
This install will take place pretty quickly.

53
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.009
Now, once it's done, it's going to request

54
00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:55.007
that you open a new terminal or in the existing one,

55
00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:57.005
we'll run this command

56
00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:03.000
going to copy this and we'll paste it in it.

57
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.004
Hit enter.

58
00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:10.002
Now we'll type sdk version to see the version of sdk

59
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:11.006
we have installed.

60
00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:17.003
Next, let's go ahead and type sdk list Java

61
00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:22.005
and we're going to search for an Amazon Corretto version 11.

62
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:26.003
Here is the latest Corretto version 11 of Java.

63
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:30.001
We'll copy that type Q to exit.

64
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:34.009
Then we'll type sdk install Java

65
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:45.000
paste in that Corretto 11 version and hit enter.

66
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.008
Okay, with that done we'll type Java -v-version.

67
00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:51.009
Let's do that again.

68
00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:55.003
Java --version to verify.

69
00:03:55.003 --> 00:03:57.003
There we go.

70
00:03:57.003 --> 00:04:01.005
Next, we're going to install the Azure CLI on this instance.

71
00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:03.003
I recommend taking the opportunity

72
00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:06.008
to visit the official documentation and take a look around.

73
00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:10.009
You can find this at docs.microsoft.com

74
00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:18.005
EN-US CLI Azure install -Azure-CLI.

75
00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:22.009
If we click on install for any script

76
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.005
and click on install script any,

77
00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:28.004
scroll down the page.

78
00:04:28.004 --> 00:04:32.003
We're going to navigate to the curl command located here.

79
00:04:32.003 --> 00:04:33.009
We'll copy this.

80
00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.005
We're going to go back to our terminal instance

81
00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:40.003
and let's clear the screen

82
00:04:40.003 --> 00:04:46.007
and we'll paste a curl command here and hit enter.

83
00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:50.003
Along the way, we're going to accept defaults.

84
00:04:50.003 --> 00:04:52.008
In this instance, for me, this is a reinstall,

85
00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:59.002
but for you, you're going to choose defaults.

86
00:04:59.002 --> 00:05:02.000
We'll accept the defaults again

87
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.004
and then the download will kick off.

88
00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:09.004
Now this will take a fair amount of time.

89
00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:12.002
So please be patient with the install

90
00:05:12.002 --> 00:05:18.006
and pause the video if you need to wait.

91
00:05:18.006 --> 00:05:19.007
Okay, so here at the end

92
00:05:19.007 --> 00:05:23.001
it's going to ask a few more questions like path

93
00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:24.007
and our C file.

94
00:05:24.007 --> 00:05:28.002
We'll accept both of those and hit enter

95
00:05:28.002 --> 00:05:30.009
and our installation is done.

96
00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.001
Let's clear the screen.

97
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:39.001
We're going to type az version verify.

98
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:42.005
Okay, we have done a great deal of work so far

99
00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:45.000
but we have one final install to set up

100
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.004
our Vagrant Linux instance for use

101
00:05:47.004 --> 00:05:50.009
and running Azure CLI and spring boot deploys.

102
00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.008
And this is Docker.

103
00:05:53.008 --> 00:05:56.008
The final details for installing the Docker binaries

104
00:05:56.008 --> 00:05:58.009
on this Linux instance can be found

105
00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:04.005
over here docs.docker.com

106
00:06:04.005 --> 00:06:11.006
engine/install/binaries#install-daemon-and-client

107
00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:14.006
- binaries-on-linux.

108
00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:16.001
I know that was a mouthful

109
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:19.005
but please make sure you review this site.

110
00:06:19.005 --> 00:06:24.001
Okay, we're going go ahead and navigate down on the screen

111
00:06:24.001 --> 00:06:28.005
until we come to the installation instructions.

112
00:06:28.005 --> 00:06:30.007
And we're going to come back to this page

113
00:06:30.007 --> 00:06:32.009
and copy and paste a few things,

114
00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:36.004
but first go ahead and right click on download Docker,

115
00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:37.009
Linux/static/stable.

116
00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.005
We'll open this in a new tab

117
00:06:41.005 --> 00:06:45.008
and we're going to go to the X86_64.

118
00:06:45.008 --> 00:06:51.002
And we're going to go down here to the latest 20.19.

119
00:06:51.002 --> 00:06:54.002
We'll copy the link address.

120
00:06:54.002 --> 00:06:59.002
Then we're going to go back to our terminal instance.

121
00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.005
Let's clear the screen.

122
00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:04.003
Next we're going to type wget

123
00:07:04.003 --> 00:07:08.004
we'll paste in the link and hit enter.

124
00:07:08.004 --> 00:07:11.003
If we go back to the browser

125
00:07:11.003 --> 00:07:13.005
we have various install instructions

126
00:07:13.005 --> 00:07:16.001
for how to install Docker

127
00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:18.000
and I'm going to be stepping through these.

128
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.005
I encourage you to spend some time

129
00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:23.001
looking at these on your own.

130
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:25.009
Okay, let let's clear the screen.

131
00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:35.002
We're going to type tar xz vf docker hit enter.

132
00:07:35.002 --> 00:07:40.006
This will extract the tar to the various directories.

133
00:07:40.006 --> 00:07:41.006
Once that's done

134
00:07:41.006 --> 00:07:49.009
we're going to type sudo copy docker/*

135
00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:52.005
through the user bin.

136
00:07:52.005 --> 00:07:56.002
And with that done, let's clear the screen again.

137
00:07:56.002 --> 00:08:03.000
Let's type sudo dockerd & and hit enter.

138
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.009
This will start up Docker

139
00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:09.005
and it'll now run in the background we'll hit enter.

140
00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:12.006
And the final step is to test Docker installation

141
00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:20.002
we'll type sudo docker run hello-world and hit enter.

142
00:08:20.002 --> 00:08:24.008
This will verify that the Docker instance is running.

143
00:08:24.008 --> 00:08:28.007
Okay, so that validates that we have Docker installed

144
00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:30.004
and it's working correctly.

145
00:08:30.004 --> 00:08:31.002
Now, for some of you,

146
00:08:31.002 --> 00:08:33.005
you may receive this error message

147
00:08:33.005 --> 00:08:38.001
telling us that the /proc/self/fd/14 file is already closed.

148
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:41.003
This is a known issue with this version of Docker

149
00:08:41.003 --> 00:08:45.005
and sometimes occurs on updates and reinstalls.

150
00:08:45.005 --> 00:08:48.002
So this is it for the initial install.

151
00:08:48.002 --> 00:08:49.005
I know it's been a lot

152
00:08:49.005 --> 00:08:53.000
but this will pay off in the next several videos.
