00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Instructor] One of the highly sought-after skills today

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:03.006
in software development

3
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:05.005
is the integration of GitHub actions

4
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.006
with Microsoft Azure for Spring Boot.

5
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.005
This code recipe we're going to be looking at

6
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.003
will help you expand your repertoire

7
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:13.008
of cloud deployment services

8
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:17.009
with CI/CD, along with Azure and GitHub.

9
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.008
For this tutorial,

10
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:21.002
we're going to be using our GitHub project

11
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:22.008
as we've used in previous demos,

12
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.005
along with Microsoft Azure.

13
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:28.005
Before we get into the majority of this work, however,

14
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.009
we're going to do some cleanup in the Azure portal

15
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.009
by deleting some resource groups,

16
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.001
app services and apps.

17
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.000
Please open up the Azure portal

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.004
and click on all resources.

19
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:42.004
I'm going to demonstrate deleting a couple

20
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:43.009
of resources but please feel free

21
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.000
to delete all the resources you wish

22
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.005
as this will make what we do later much easier to identify.

23
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:54.004
I'm going to start with our spring-boot-app.

24
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:56.007
I'll click delete.

25
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.009
And this is going to ask for the name of the app.

26
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.007
Copy the name, paste it in

27
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:04.003
and click Delete.

28
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:08.001
I'll move over to our spring-boot-azure-container.

29
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.007
Again, I'll click delete.

30
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.000
Yes to confirm.

31
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.001
As you can tell, some resources require more

32
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.005
than just a simple button click.

33
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:20.007
This is meant to provide extra safety and security for you

34
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:24.001
so that you don't accidentally delete a resource.

35
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.007
Next, I'm going to go back to the home link.

36
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:30.003
I'll click resource groups.

37
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:34.000
I'll go to my SpringBoot-Azure-Group.

38
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.007
Then I'll click delete on this resource group.

39
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:39.006
Again, it's asking for confirmation.

40
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.009
I'll copy the name, paste in the resource group

41
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.001
and click delete.

42
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.007
If you're curious on the status,

43
00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:50.000
you can click the bell icon in the top right

44
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.005
and this will tell you the status

45
00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:53.009
of the actions you have performed.

46
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.008
With some of that done,

47
00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:58.007
let's turn our attention to IntelliJ.

48
00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:01.001
We're going to create and set up a branch we'll need

49
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.008
for our GitHub workflow.

50
00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:06.007
Let's switch to the main branch.

51
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:10.006
Git switch main.

52
00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:14.002
And from here, we're going to create a new branch.

53
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:23.004
We'll type git checkout -b jar_workflow_azure.

54
00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:25.002
As you remember, this will create

55
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.006
and switch to that new branch.

56
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.009
Next, let's push this branch

57
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.000
to our remote repository.

58
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.009
I'll type git push -u origin jar_workflow_azure.

59
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.003
With this complete, let's go ahead

60
00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:47.004
and go back to the Azure portal now.

61
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:53.007
Click home and then all resources.

62
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:57.001
From there we'll click create.

63
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.002
We'll select Web App, Create.

64
00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:03.003
In resource group, we'll click create new.

65
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:05.002
We'll call this resource group

66
00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:12.006
spring-boot-jar-workflow-group.

67
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:14.007
For the web app, we'll similarly call

68
00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:23.003
this spring-boot-jar-workflow-app.

69
00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:25.009
For the runtime, we'll select Java 11.

70
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.008
We'll leave the Java Web Server stack

71
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:30.001
as Embedded Web Server.

72
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.001
And everything else will remain the same

73
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:33.001
as the default.

74
00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:35.004
We'll click review and create.

75
00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:40.001
And then create.

76
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.002
When it's done, click on go to resource

77
00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:45.006
so we can see an overview of the web app.

78
00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:47.001
Let's go ahead and set our profile

79
00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:48.008
for the application to be deployed.

80
00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:53.003
We're going to click on the configuration menu option

81
00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:55.001
on the left side,

82
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.003
and when that finishes,

83
00:03:56.003 --> 00:04:03.000
we'll click on new application settings.

84
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.003
For the application settings,

85
00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:07.003
we're going to type SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE

86
00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:15.005
and for the value, I'm going to type dev,azure.

87
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.005
And click OK.

88
00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:20.004
Followed by clicking save and continue.

89
00:04:20.004 --> 00:04:24.007
Next, we'll click on Deployment Center.

90
00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:27.003
And then settings.

91
00:04:27.003 --> 00:04:31.009
We'll select our source to be GitHub.

92
00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.007
And we'll sign in.

93
00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:36.007
Mine is already signed in to cwm-coding

94
00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:40.004
but go ahead and click change account or sign in.

95
00:04:40.004 --> 00:04:42.002
This will generate a dialog

96
00:04:42.002 --> 00:04:46.009
and you'll need to sign in to your GitHub account.

97
00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.007
In my instance,

98
00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:52.000
this is sending a six-digit OTP to my cell phone.

99
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.003
If this happens to you, please do the same.

100
00:04:57.003 --> 00:05:00.004
Once you're signed in, select the organization.

101
00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:02.003
Mine is cwm-coding.

102
00:05:02.003 --> 00:05:05.007
Please make sure you select your organization.

103
00:05:05.007 --> 00:05:06.008
Followed by the repository,

104
00:05:06.008 --> 00:05:09.003
which will be SpringBootProduction.

105
00:05:09.003 --> 00:05:10.007
And then the branch we're going

106
00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:16.005
to select is jar_workflow_azure.

107
00:05:16.005 --> 00:05:18.005
We'll leave the radio button option set

108
00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:21.000
to add a workflow.

109
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.001
And then we'll click review file.

110
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:26.009
This will actually be the workflow

111
00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.002
that's added to our projects.

112
00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:32.006
There'll be a few changes we need to make here.

113
00:05:32.006 --> 00:05:35.000
One of them will be the name of our build,

114
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.004
which will not be with Maven

115
00:05:36.004 --> 00:05:37.007
but will be with Gradle.

116
00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:41.002
We'll change also the commands that are used.

117
00:05:41.002 --> 00:05:44.009
And then, of course, the location of the JAR file.

118
00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:51.002
Okay, click close and then save.

119
00:05:51.002 --> 00:05:53.003
As I said, this will automatically be put

120
00:05:53.003 --> 00:05:55.002
in our repository.

121
00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:59.001
So let's switch back to IntelliJ.

122
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:01.006
In the bottom, let's type clear,

123
00:06:01.006 --> 00:06:07.002
then git fetch origin.

124
00:06:07.002 --> 00:06:11.001
Git pull origin.

125
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:13.008
And if we click on workflows at the top,

126
00:06:13.008 --> 00:06:15.001
it will automatically show

127
00:06:15.001 --> 00:06:20.002
the new jar_workflow_azure_spring-boot-jar.

128
00:06:20.002 --> 00:06:24.001
Now, we're going to delete the build-package-deploy.

129
00:06:24.001 --> 00:06:27.004
We're not going to use this in our Azure builds.

130
00:06:27.004 --> 00:06:31.005
So we'll click delete.

131
00:06:31.005 --> 00:06:34.008
And then let's make a few changes

132
00:06:34.008 --> 00:06:36.004
to our new workflow.

133
00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:41.001
For branches, we're going to change this to main.

134
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:43.009
We'll go down to the build with Maven

135
00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.003
and we'll change the label name

136
00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:47.009
to build with Gradle.

137
00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:55.004
The run command is going to be ./gradle clean build.

138
00:06:55.004 --> 00:06:59.004
And our web app's target is going to be

139
00:06:59.004 --> 00:07:18.006
build/libs/SpringBootProdApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.

140
00:07:18.006 --> 00:07:20.008
We'll click Save.

141
00:07:20.008 --> 00:07:22.008
Go to the terminal window in IntelliJ

142
00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:24.008
and type git add.

143
00:07:24.008 --> 00:07:28.007
Let's type git status to see the changes.

144
00:07:28.007 --> 00:07:33.003
Then git commit -m.

145
00:07:33.003 --> 00:07:41.007
Changes needed for azure deployment workflow.

146
00:07:41.007 --> 00:07:43.001
And then we'll push our changes.

147
00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:51.006
Git push -u origin jar_workflow_azure.

148
00:07:51.006 --> 00:07:53.007
Next, let's go to GitHub.

149
00:07:53.007 --> 00:07:55.005
I'm automatically logged in.

150
00:07:55.005 --> 00:07:58.007
Click on our repository.

151
00:07:58.007 --> 00:08:01.000
And as you can see, there's already a compare

152
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.001
and pull request.

153
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:06.002
We'll click on this.

154
00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:11.008
We'll click on create pull request.

155
00:08:11.008 --> 00:08:17.000
We'll click on merge request and confirm.

156
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.004
Back under code,

157
00:08:19.004 --> 00:08:22.002
let's check our GitHub workflows,

158
00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:26.003
and as you can see, we only have the one workflow now.

159
00:08:26.003 --> 00:08:29.002
Let's click on actions.

160
00:08:29.002 --> 00:08:33.003
And we see a merge request has been sent.

161
00:08:33.003 --> 00:08:37.000
Under build,

162
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.008
Java has been set up

163
00:08:38.008 --> 00:08:46.007
and the Gradle task is running.

164
00:08:46.007 --> 00:08:56.003
Now the deploy job is available.

165
00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:59.009
And we're showing it's complete.

166
00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:02.005
If we click on the link,

167
00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:03.008
it takes us to the site

168
00:09:03.008 --> 00:09:06.006
that the application is being deployed.

169
00:09:06.006 --> 00:09:08.003
Now, this does take a moment

170
00:09:08.003 --> 00:09:12.000
for the application to be complete.

171
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.006
So we'll refresh and in a moment,

172
00:09:15.006 --> 00:09:18.000
the application will be available.
