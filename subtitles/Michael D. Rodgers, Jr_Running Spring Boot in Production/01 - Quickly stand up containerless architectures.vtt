00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Michael] Spring Boot has quickly become

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.005
for Java based projects the go-to framework

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.001
for quickly standing up containerless architectures.

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.003
It works out of the box with little to no configuration.

5
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.005
It additionally includes features that most projects need

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.008
like security, environment profiling, metrics,

7
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:19.005
and embedded containers.

8
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:22.002
In production environments, if you you're using Java,

9
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.004
Spring Boot is a no-brainer.

10
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.008
Getting to production however, raises a number

11
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:28.009
of questions that architects, engineers,

12
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.007
and system administrators need to figure out

13
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:33.002
and work together.

14
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:35.009
I'm going to show you how to leverage Spring Boot

15
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:39.000
for production, demonstrating several build techniques

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.001
that package your application as a JAR or RPM,

17
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:46.008
Docker image, and even a native distribution.

18
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:48.005
I'll also walk you through the process

19
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.002
of creating GitHub actions to automate your build processes

20
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:55.007
for both AWS and Microsoft Azure.

21
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:58.005
This video series will present these elements to you

22
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:03.002
as various recipes for accomplishing all of these tasks.

23
00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:04.006
I'm Michael Rodgers

24
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.002
and I've been programming professionally

25
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:09.000
as well as working as a system administrator now

26
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.007
for over 15 years.

27
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:13.003
If you're ready to take your software engineering skills

28
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:17.002
up a level, then come join me in my LinkedIn Learning course

29
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:20.000
on using Spring Boot in production.
