00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] To make the most of this course,

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.008
there are a few things that learners should know

3
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:06.009
like Java, Spring, and be somewhat familiar

4
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.009
with Linux and Git.

5
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.006
It's crucial that learners have a firm understanding

6
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.006
of Java and have used it for a couple of years.

7
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:19.000
We'll be using both Java 1.8 and Java 11.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.002
With that said, however, the code base presented

9
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.000
for this series will not require extensive knowledge,

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.007
but simply following the directions.

11
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.006
As long as you can download the code base

12
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.000
you should be able to follow along.

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.008
If you're unfamiliar with Java

14
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:35.003
or need to take some courses to brush up,

15
00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:36.006
then I recommend taking a look

16
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.009
at this course by Kathryn Hodge,

17
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.009
who will introduce to you the necessary

18
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.006
and fundamental skills to help you work

19
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:46.005
and program with Java.

20
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.002
The other technology that we'll be using

21
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:51.007
quite extensively is Spring and Spring Boot.

22
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:53.006
If you've not touched Spring before,

23
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.008
I recommend taking a look at this course by Frank Mosley

24
00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:59.007
to get a more fundamental understanding

25
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:02.008
of what we'll be doing with Spring and this course.

26
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:07.002
The Spring framework and Spring Boot are very powerful APIs

27
00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:10.005
to better equip you in programming with Java.

28
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:12.007
I recommend taking the time to learn them

29
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:15.002
as Spring is pretty much universally used

30
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.005
in Java programming shops.

31
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:21.003
The next technology will be using is Git.

32
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:23.000
You'll not need to know too much here,

33
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.004
as I'll be keeping all of the commands very basic,

34
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.002
but if you desire to learn more about Git,

35
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:32.001
then I recommend this course by Kevin Skoglund.

36
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:34.004
You might find that after we're done using Git

37
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:37.003
in this series of videos that you want to learn more

38
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:40.004
and rightly so, because Git is also one

39
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:42.002
of those fundamental technologies

40
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:45.002
that developers new need to know.

41
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:47.000
Lastly, we'll be using Linux

42
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.006
through VirtualBox via some Vagrant instances.

43
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:52.007
Again, we'll keep it pretty basic,

44
00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:55.000
but I recommend you take a deeper dive

45
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and learn Linux as much as you can in your careers.
