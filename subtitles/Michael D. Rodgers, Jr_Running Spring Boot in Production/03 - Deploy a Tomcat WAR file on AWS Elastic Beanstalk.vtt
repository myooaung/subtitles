00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Interviewer] For this video, we'll be using

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:07.000
source code found in 0303 begin spring boot production.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.003
Once you have it loaded in IntelliJ,

4
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:13.009
the source code for this video is already preset

5
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.002
for building a war.

6
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:22.001
So all we need to do is jump in and type the

7
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:29.009
gradle clean build command.

8
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.006
Let's check our build directory, type ls

9
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:36.008
build libs, hit enter,

10
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:37.006
and we can see that

11
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:41.004
the SpringBootProdApplication.war exists.

12
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:43.008
Now let's go ahead and switch back

13
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:48.007
to our AWS console, ensure that your logged in,

14
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:52.006
And if you look at the recently visited services

15
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:56.006
we have a quick link to follow back to Elastic Beanstalk.

16
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.008
Let's go ahead and click that.

17
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:03.007
On this screen, we'll click create application.

18
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.000
Again, we're going to enter the same name

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.001
SpringBoot Prod Application.

20
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.008
Application tags we'll leave the blank.

21
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.005
For the platform we're going to choose

22
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.004
instead of Java we'll scroll to the bottom

23
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:20.005
and choose Tomcat.

24
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:22.009
And this should automatically choose Tomcat 8

25
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.001
with Corretto 11.

26
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:29.003
We'll change this to 8.5 with Corretto 8.

27
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.008
We'll leave the platform version as is,

28
00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:36.008
and then click on upload code.

29
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:40.008
We'll click choose file.

30
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:49.007
We'll navigate to our exercise files.

31
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:54.000
Select the spring Boot Prod Application.war

32
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.002
and click open.

33
00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:58.000
When the upload is complete

34
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.004
you will again see the green check mark.

35
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:07.001
This can take some time depending on your broadband speed.

36
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:12.004
Next we're going to click create application.

37
00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:14.008
And again, this will take a few minutes

38
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:21.004
as the application server is provisioned and set up.

39
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:23.009
Okay, so when this finishes

40
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.002
we are going to start to see server errors again,

41
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:30.005
due most likely to the spring profile environment variable

42
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:32.002
not being set.

43
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:35.009
At any rate, we're going to do that now.

44
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:39.001
We'll click on configuration.

45
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:42.001
Then in the software edit area,

46
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:44.004
we'll click edit.

47
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:47.006
Then in the container options section,

48
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:51.002
and in the JVM options,

49
00:02:51.002 --> 00:03:03.000
we're going to type -bspring.profiles.active=dev.

50
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.001
Afterward, we'll click apply

51
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:12.005
and this will cause the health settings to reload.

52
00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:14.007
This is actually an interesting change

53
00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:19.001
in how to produce the need for a spring profile

54
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:20.008
because other documentation suggests

55
00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:24.006
that we need to put this as an environment property again,

56
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:27.005
and type in a key of all caps,

57
00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:30.002
Spring_profiles_active

58
00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:33.003
with a value of dev or QA or prod

59
00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:36.002
or whatever your environment might be.

60
00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:40.001
At any rate, once the server is refreshed

61
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.000
please click on the load environment link

62
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
above the configurations to load the new application

63
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.008
and voila.

64
00:03:47.008 --> 00:03:51.002
We see the app and also the dev label

65
00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:53.006
for the environment.

66
00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:56.005
Now the process for removing these resources

67
00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:58.005
is just the same as last time

68
00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:02.008
when we deployed the jar to AWS.

69
00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:06.000
We go to environments,

70
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.008
select the environment, click actions,

71
00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:12.003
terminate the environment,

72
00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:15.009
select springbootprod 2 environment,

73
00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:20.006
copy and paste, click terminate.

74
00:04:20.006 --> 00:04:23.000
The rest of this I'll let you do on your own.
