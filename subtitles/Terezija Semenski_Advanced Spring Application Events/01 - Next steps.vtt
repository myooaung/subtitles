I hope you enjoyed this course

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:09.008
and now have a solid understanding of Spring events.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:13.000
You've just experienced the benefits of events

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.004
and how they help you write modular decoupled code.

6
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:21.001
If you want to know more about event-based architectures,

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.007
