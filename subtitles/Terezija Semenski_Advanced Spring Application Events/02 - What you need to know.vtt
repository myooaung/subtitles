- [Instructor] Before starting this course,

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:06.001
let's explore what skills and knowledge you will need.

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.000
This course is targeted at intermediate

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.003
and advanced developers.

5
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.006
In order to truly be successful in this course,

6
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:17.002
you should have experience with Java

7
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:20.004
and solid understanding of Spring Framework

8
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:22.002
and Spring Boot.

9
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:26.005
Our focus will be on the latest versions of Java 15

10
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:30.003
and Spring Boot, current 2.5.

11
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:31.005
Throughout this course,

12
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.002
we will be using IntelliJID,

13
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:38.000
but any Java IDE is sufficient with this course.
