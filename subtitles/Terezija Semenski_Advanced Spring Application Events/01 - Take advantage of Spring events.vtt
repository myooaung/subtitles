00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Terezija] Writing clean and modular code

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.004
has never been more important.

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:10.006
Doing it the wrong way can lead to huge headaches later.

4
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:14.006
Spring events give developers an easy way

5
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:16.005
to implement flexible

6
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:20.005
and loosely coupled architectural design.

7
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:25.001
In this course, we'll cover key concepts of Spring events.

8
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.007
You will learn how to avoid bad design,

9
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:33.000
breaking solid principles, cycling dependencies,

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.003
and how easy it is to add new features

11
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.007
without refactoring existing code.

12
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.006
And most importantly,

13
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:45.001
I'll demonstrate some three key real world scenarios

14
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:49.000
of using events with resections, (mumbles) calls

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.009
and the long running services.

16
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.007
Hi, I'm Terezija Semenski.

17
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:57.007
I've been a software developer in Java and Spring

18
00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.008
for over a decade.

19
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.007
Join me in this course

20
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.008
to learn how Spring events work internally.

21
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:08.008
What are the benefits and how you can apply them

22
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:10.000
in your next project.
