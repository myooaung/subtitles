00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.002
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.008
- [Instructor] You saw the power of

3
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:09.009
Transaction EventListeners

4
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:14.009
and how we can narrow down when, and if they get triggered.

5
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.006
Let's use them to our advantage in this challenge.

6
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:23.004
Our order placement use case is almost complete.

7
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:28.006
We managed to send an email only on a successful commit.

8
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:32.006
In this challenge, we want you to inform our help desk

9
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:35.001
when the roll back has occurred

10
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.001
so they can follow up to check what is wrong

11
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.001
with that order.

12
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.005
To inform the help desk, you need to use

13
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:46.008
the ticketing service bin and its method create ticket,

14
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:50.001
which accepts an order object.

15
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.006
Once you are done with implementation,

16
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:55.001
you can run a ticket service test

17
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:57.007
to verify your implementation.

18
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.008
The test has two use cases that verify

19
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:05.007
when tickets should and should not get created.

20
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:09.007
This challenge should take about five to 10 minutes.

21
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:11.001
If you get stuck,

22
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.006
you can check out my solution video

23
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:16.000
to see how I solved the challenge.
