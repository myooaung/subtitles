00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.130
Hello and welcome back to the course on Parbat we've credo viz. our business intelligence and dashboard.

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.360
And today we're going to analyze it and to start off with.

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.180
Let's imagine that we are the CEO of the bank.

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.120
So the person in charge of the whole of the operations of the bank and what would we look for as the

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.660
CEO.

6
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.600
Well probably the CEO would be interested in finding some observations or some anomalies that would

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.380
help him or some trends even that would help him serve the customers of the bank better.

8
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.070
Right.

9
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.330
So let's have a look and see what we can find right away.

10
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.700
Well first of all we can see that the gender split is about 55 percent male to 46 percent female so

11
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.640
it's about nearly half half but a little bit more on the male side.

12
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:58.700
Then we've got an interesting thing here we've got the highest bin's for our population or for our age

13
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.970
groups is 30 to 35 years old or actually 30 to 35 and 35 to 40 years old just 30 to 40 years old that's

14
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.450
where predominantly all of our population on the bank is sitting.

15
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.340
And it's in total that is 40 percent of our population is there and that is interesting.

16
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.600
From my experiences a bit.

17
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.730
So it is kind of like normal but it's one there's a few options that could happen.

18
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.090
Like for instance you could have 25 to 35 so you'd have these two.

19
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.400
Right.

20
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.950
If you had a younger demographic you'd rarely have predominantly people in these age groups or predominately

21
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.170
in their more mature age groups you would likely have.

22
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.790
It usually is kind of like a normal distribution but can be a bit more skewed this way.

23
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.120
So a bit more skew to the right and then the top part would be more to the left and that would be 25

24
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.060
to 35.

25
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.080
Or it could be skewed the other way could be like 35 to 45 or even 40 and 40 to 50.

26
00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:04.100
But in our case so it is a bit over a younger age group and it like the people just imagine these people

27
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.060
these are people that are quite mature in their careers so they've already been in the workforce for

28
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.320
if it's 30 to 40 years old so they've been in the workforce for at least 10 years some up to 20 years.

29
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.010
And what are they thinking.

30
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.540
So this is what the CEO would be thinking he would be thinking what do these people want.

31
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:31.790
So they're starting to save up for you know people in this age group they're starting to like us.

32
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.840
They're just at the stage where they've just purchased their home or they are about to purchase their

33
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.090
home or move into a bigger home because people probably in this age group are still renting.

34
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.020
So what do these people need.

35
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.840
Well maybe they need loans to purchase homes or maybe they need insurance to insure their homes.

36
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.930
Some of these people have already probably started families and now they're looking to have children

37
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.740
and that means they're going to be spending money on school and so on.

38
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.990
So that's what the CEO would be thinking as opposed to people in these age groups who are already starting

39
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:13.100
to transition into retirement who are thinking about how to make create a secure future for themselves

40
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.140
and their less.

41
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.840
They've got other things on their mind.

42
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.810
And people in these age groups they've got things like student loans and rent and maybe getting a loan

43
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.530
for a car.

44
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.310
Those type of things.

45
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.630
Right.

46
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.770
So as a CEO would probably click on these two bars hold down control.

47
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.400
And what do we see here.

48
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.460
We see that the age the gender group has changed right so previously it was mostly male.

49
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.450
Now it's actually closer to 50 50 so.

50
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:47.450
But the fact of the matter is that it actually changed so that what does that tell us that tells us

51
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.640
that this skew in mostly male to female is actually happening elsewhere.

52
00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:01.010
And if the change here that means that this age group we should you know should create offers that are

53
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.660
tailored maybe some offers or tell to male customers and some offers tell to female customers.

54
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.410
Whereas now if we explore that other age groups right.

55
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.300
So if we call down control here you'll see an older demographic.

56
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:22.730
We've got predominantly male customers and that's also interesting because that's not a given right.

57
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.250
So in generally in the population of the UK you would expect that it's about a 50 50 split and that

58
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.160
means there's some sort of preference some sort of bias and who would be interested in why are our customers

59
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.360
predominately male are we not tapping in enough to the whole market of the country maybe our products

60
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.030
are not compelling enough for female customers to be interested in them and so that would be like a

61
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.680
red flag.

62
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.900
On one hand yes it might be a good thing maybe they are and they've come up with a product that is very

63
00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.300
appealing to men but at the same time they need to there's this other part of this market that they're

64
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.550
not leveraging and that maybe they need to change something about their operation so it could be both

65
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.900
a strength and a weakness and he would need to explore that further to find out.

66
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.650
As you can see as we go further even like in the 60s in this demographic it's a huge difference right.

67
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.160
So why would that be.

68
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.050
What else would he be interested in.

69
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.930
So he would probably look at other things like blue collar.

70
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.690
Well fair enough right so mostly male in the blue choral profession.

71
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.400
White collar interesting and the demographics so like you just click around and have a look.

72
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.600
So I'll leave that to use to explore these remaining shares as a CEO and see what you can find.

73
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.680
And we're going to move on to exploring the map and exploring the regional branches of the bank.

74
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.520
And all imagine now that we are the directors of the bank.

75
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.570
Each of the regions.

76
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.390
And so let's start with with England.

77
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.900
Let's say we are the director of the Bank of England.

78
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.770
What can we see here.

79
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:07.570
So an interesting way is to always kind of compare what we see in the overall region.

80
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.450
So you can see 30 to 40.

81
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.580
So that's an angle.

82
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:19.620
So in the overall region you can see 30 to 40 54 to 46 and here you can see is white color right away

83
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.470
is huge right.

84
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:29.910
So overall in the whole of the UK White Collar is about 50 percent or 40 48 percent if you click on

85
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:36.240
England white collar becomes 70 percent and probably that has something to do with the fact that you

86
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:43.410
know London is the main economical hub of Europe and there's a lot of white collar jobs there and probably

87
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.120
some like that.

88
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.680
Right.

89
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.440
So maybe that's not a surprise to the director.

90
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.270
Maybe it is.

91
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.040
Maybe they would be interested in something.

92
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.250
What else could they see here.

93
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:58.680
Well in the overall bank in the overall population of the bank you can see that the distribution of

94
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.890
ballots just drops off gradually.

95
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:09.270
Here they can see you can see that there's like a dip in the balances between $10000 to $20000.

96
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:16.980
So in this bucket and to $20000 in England there is a bit of a dip.

97
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.190
Right.

98
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.370
So it's either a dip here or it's a spike here.

99
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.990
And so that's something they would investigate.

100
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:28.320
They would try to understand is this a statistically significant result or is this maybe just a random

101
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:34.400
kind of like error or that you know it's just a fluctuation in their balances and that's totally normal

102
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.510
so it's it's not a representative finding.

103
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.290
But if it isn't represented in fighting then you start thinking how can we fix this.

104
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:47.070
Maybe people with these balances are for some reason going to other banks maybe there's a competitor

105
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:53.850
that is stealing their customers who are in that specific between 10 and $20000 maybe a competitor just

106
00:07:53.850 --> 00:08:01.080
recently had an offer saying that if you deposit $15000 into your first account we will give you you

107
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.880
know interest free loan for five years or something like that and they would explore that so that might

108
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.130
be a signal.

109
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:13.050
What about this 15 percent so why is it higher than the 14 percent is that just in is it how it's supposed

110
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.950
to be that the normal drop off.

111
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.860
What does it look like.

112
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.600
Because 15 percent of the next one is 12 and then 10.

113
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.430
So it looks a bit high so maybe they're doing something right for these people who have these balances

114
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.120
so why are they coming to this bank.

115
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.870
And you know continue doing that that thing that they're doing right and just understand what it is.

116
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.960
So then he would also look at the other things.

117
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:39.580
Let's have a look at some other places so Wales let's imagine where the director for Wales What is interesting

118
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.430
here.

119
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:48.270
Probably the most interesting thing here is we have also just keep in mind how many people we have.

120
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:54.880
So 520 people and that's why you kind of see a bit of a moral very randomness a bit more of noise in

121
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.510
here because it's not as smooth.

122
00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:03.940
And that's that's that is a signal that the fact that there's a few people here fewer That is probably

123
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:12.910
just some random fluctuations simply because this is not a statistically significant sample for that

124
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.740
number of bins that we have here.

125
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.340
So what he would look at is probably the gender split and you would see that.

126
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:27.870
So we probably were mostly servicing female not mostly but some more our portion of female customers

127
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.440
is more than in the rest of the bank and that's very interesting to see.

128
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:40.650
But then he'd look probably at the drop off for the older demographics so people from 50 years old plus

129
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:47.100
in the bank is about 8 percent so that is why we put it in percentages right because we can now just

130
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.860
compare the bank the whole bank to different regions so we know that overall in the bank is 8 percent

131
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:53.890
5 percent 2 percent.

132
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:58.060
And when we go to Wales we can see that there's a massive drop off.

133
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:05.010
They are definitely missing out on this demographic and you know even though it's 8 percent is only

134
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.760
like a few percentages you know total 15 percent.

135
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:15.630
But these are the people that if you click these are the people that actually normally have higher balances

136
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:21.480
because they've they've retired they've worked for a longer life than these other people and therefore

137
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.410
they have the higher balances.

138
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.360
And so this part of the bank is missing out on the older demographics and that's something that they

139
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.430
would probably need to look into.

140
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.150
And that is obvious from the data.

141
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:33.900
All right.

142
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:39.480
So then we're moving on to Northern Ireland Northern Ireland right away.

143
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.030
What pops to mind the demographic split.

144
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:49.050
So we've got to though the gender split we've got 26 percent only male and 74 percent female.

145
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.350
Right.

146
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.450
So a very interesting observation.

147
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:59.000
It's you know there's a couple of things that the director would do from here and that's why they're

148
00:10:59.010 --> 00:10:59.910
like at the top.

149
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:09.270
They can instruct or talk to their managers that are under them to investigate this and maybe one manager

150
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:17.730
would go and try to find out why they don't have such a good share of what they have with they don't

151
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.580
have a good share of the male part of the market.

152
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:26.400
Maybe another manager would go and investigate what how they can leverage this advantage that they have.

153
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:26.610
Right.

154
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:33.450
So maybe this is a good thing maybe they somehow some of their products are attractive to female customers

155
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:41.400
and now they need to keep building that momentum and leveraging it and releasing more products so you

156
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.600
know they would be able to find out more information there.

157
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:54.370
And looks like it's a younger demographic as well so it's so it's from about 25 to 35 years old so maybe.

158
00:11:54.450 --> 00:12:02.190
And given that it's mostly female customers maybe they would start creating products around insurance

159
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:09.660
for when you're buying a home because these people probably that are looking to start families about

160
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:18.780
products such as things for children and loans for buying homes and maybe getting cars and so on like

161
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:25.890
big cars for families and you know like different products that would be tailored to this demographic.

162
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.780
And finally Scotland.

163
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.720
So here we can see that a different picture.

164
00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.280
The distribution is very different.

165
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:40.530
We've got the older demographic We've got 45 to 55 mostly so that comprises about 50 percent of this

166
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:47.210
part of this region and mostly male and blue color so you can tell right away.

167
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.610
This is completely different playing field right.

168
00:12:51.610 --> 00:13:02.610
If if in Ireland we would be selling insurance's around buying a home and home loans and maybe cars

169
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:10.050
for families and like things that would be or different loans that would be relevant to people who are

170
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:16.740
starting a family here will be selling other things would be selling insurance.

171
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:21.290
We might be selling the same insurance but positioning in different view and might be saying that.

172
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:26.440
So we've got this insurance product that will help you and not start a family but look after your family.

173
00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:31.590
Right so we're assuming these people already have a family that they have a home that they want to protect

174
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:32.940
the people they love and so on.

175
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.710
So you would market it even even if you don't create a different product you'd market your existing

176
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:42.290
product differently to these people and a lot of the time.

177
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.910
It sounds like a bad thing right.

178
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:49.770
You might think of it as and as you know you take advantage of people you're you're selling to them

179
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:56.040
you're you know you're very you're being you know you're leveraging their demographic situation and

180
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.530
they know who they are to sell to them and make more money.

181
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:04.500
Well it's actually if you think about it's a good thing that if you've got a good product right if it's

182
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:11.460
a good insurance product and you want to convey it to people and explain what it is will it is better

183
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.110
if you talk their language right.

184
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:20.490
If a person is is in a life situation where they are thinking about starting a family then why would

185
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:26.450
you try to sell them an insurance product that is more tailored to the older demographic.

186
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:26.670
Right.

187
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.520
So it's it's actually.

188
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.380
As long as you have a good product and you have good intentions then it is in the customer's interest

189
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:41.370
as well for you to tailor that product or the way you present their product to their situation so it's

190
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.740
better for it so it's easier for them to understand what benefits they will get out of it.

191
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.260
So this is not this whole exercise is not just for the bank to make more money.

192
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.600
Yes it is a bank.

193
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:57.540
Yes they are in it for to make money but we live in a very competitive world and unless they have a

194
00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:03.900
very good product they're going to go out of business so at the end of the day it's it is a win win

195
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:09.600
situation where all this should be a win win situation where both the bank gets an opportunity to make

196
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:15.710
money and further invest into their research and development and their products and their services and

197
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.750
at the same time the people that are being marketed to they get the right products that are tailored

198
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:26.280
to them that give them exactly what they need at their stage of life.

199
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:26.820
So there we go.

200
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:34.740
That's how the director of Scotland would analyze probably would analyze this part of the dashboard.

201
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:39.160
So hopefully that gives a good overview of what we've created here.

202
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:45.180
As you can see it's quite a powerful visualization quite a powerful dashboard and a lot of executives

203
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:51.060
in a bank in this particular bank could get some valuable insights out of here and therefore come up

204
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:58.670
with certain actions to either fix problem areas or leverage those strengths that they have.

205
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.870
I hope in today's Tauriel and I look forward to seeing you next time.

206
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.420
Until then happy analyzing.
