00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.210
Hello and welcome back to the course on power be-I I hope you had a chance to try creating a small distribution

2
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.940
for balance and I wonder how you went with that.

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.590
And today we actually going to create in this trial together.

4
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:21.640
So let's go ahead and create a new page called balance and then showing it to right click into choose

5
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.510
group.

6
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:32.140
And for a balance been size we're going to select let's say ten thousand dollars because we're working

7
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.370
with the thousands.

8
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.280
So therefore we have to type in $10000 here.

9
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.940
We might might have chosen to 5000 or 20000.

10
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.560
It's not really a big deal what we choose because you can always change and adjust it as long as it's

11
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.520
someone in the thousands.

12
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.480
Right OK we've created our bins and drag them over here and the customer ID as well make sure it's on

13
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.740
count and there we go so there's a distribution.

14
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.400
You can see lots of people in this bank have lower balances up to 20 or up to $30000.

15
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.100
That's the predominant.

16
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.420
And those are the first three tabs and then it kind of drops off very quickly so very few people have

17
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.480
very large Ponce's.

18
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.590
And then what are we going to do is we're going to right away change this to a percentage of total.

19
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.040
Right now we will what will we do we can add the labels.

20
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.480
So put this to every single one.

21
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.060
So 50 percent that means like every second bar has a data label here we want every single bar to have

22
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.070
a label.

23
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.340
You increase the size to 12 zero decimal points so we can save some space.

24
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.740
And so you can see the zeros are here.

25
00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.880
That's because it's just rounding down and if you don't like that you might want to add like one decimal

26
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.360
point or maybe even two decimal points so that you can see the sun exactly zero.

27
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.340
I personally don't mind that so I'm just going to have 0 percent there.

28
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.880
What else would you like to do.

29
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.920
Well another thing that we can do is change the colors.

30
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.170
So this is for balance and balance is money.

31
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.200
Money is green so I actually think this green is fine.

32
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.360
You might want to change the type of green if you like but I'm going to keep it like this.

33
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.210
And so there are these are age distribution.

34
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.570
There's a balance distribution and that's pretty much it.

35
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.900
As you can see it's very very quick process.

36
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:47.050
Once you know how to do it you just create the bins and do the calculation do the table calculations

37
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.180
of the percentage of total.

38
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.790
And that's it.

39
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.530
Maybe I just said X and it's ready to go.

40
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.810
All right so that was our bins and distribution for balance.

41
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.410
And in the next tutorial we're going to create another element that's going to go into our final dashboards

42
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.760
so you can see it's already slowly adding up.

43
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.510
We've really got four really cool elements that we're going to put together.

44
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.630
All right.

45
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.340
I hope you enjoy this trial and look for you next time.

46
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.890
And so then happy analyzing.
