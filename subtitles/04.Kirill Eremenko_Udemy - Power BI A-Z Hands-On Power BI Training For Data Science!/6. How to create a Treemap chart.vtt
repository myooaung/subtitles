Hello and welcome back to the course on power be-I.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.860
In today's tutorial we're going to create another element that is going to go on to our final dashboard.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:16.560
Yes I know it's getting quite heavy is getting quite saturated or the dashboard is going to be quite

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.400
saturated with information and is going to be exciting.

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.830
So today we're creating a tree map.

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.460
So let's call this or we'll call this job classification.

7
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.510
So that's what we're portraying and the type of visualization we're going to be achieved.

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.550
And this is click tree map or here so Team-Up is kind of like a pie chart but it's just presented in

9
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.000
different ways.

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.680
So basically you can switch between tree map and pie chart very easily.

11
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.340
It's it's the same thing.

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.310
So we've got some categories and then a numeric value that tells you the size of each category is just

13
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.680
a different way of presenting information.

14
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.980
So let's go ahead and create our tree map.

15
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.140
We're going to use job classification as our category and we're going to use once again count of custom

16
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.420
ID as our value.

17
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.990
So there you go.

18
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.420
And as you can see as you resize the tree map it automatically adjusts and that's pretty much it.

19
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.120
So I'll show you that I can change to a pie chart very easily and seamlessly if I saw that I have a

20
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.210
pie chart so you can see right away that white collar workers are about 1/2 percent of our total.

21
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.410
In fact let's just change this to a quick calc right away will change just 2 percent of grand total.

22
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.880
And then here are actually we won't we won't go there there for now.

23
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.010
If you just look at the tool tip you'll see is forty eight point seven percent.

24
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.730
If I go back to the tree map it's less evident from here that it is about 50 percent and that is why

25
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.620
these two different types of resolutions exist so even though the pie chart can tell you something.

26
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.120
Some things like for instance that this is about 50 percent you can tell right away.

27
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.830
These are about a quarter each.

28
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.600
You can't really tell that from here as easily.

29
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.780
But at the same time a trauma carries either you know it has its own other advantages.

30
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.640
For example when you have more different categories a pie chart gets easily overwhelmed so after for

31
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.120
example four or five or six different categories a pie chart becomes very cluttered whereas a tree map

32
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:36.250
it maintains its consistency and it really helps you see those important elements those larger groups

33
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.410
and then you can tell.

34
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.600
Also the less significant group so probably a true up is better when you have more categories and a

35
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.910
pie chart is better when you have less categories.

36
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.280
That's just a rule of thumb it really depends on you and your personal preferences what you want to

37
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.910
show and which kind of this Alsatians you want to use.

38
00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.130
All right so here we've got the information all we need to do is go to our formatting.

39
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.210
And here you might want to change the colors a little bit so that see what data colors we've got.

40
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.990
So it's sort of white collar workers white collar workers you might want to make them sort of blue collar

41
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.630
workers blue collar workers it's pretty straightforward let's make them blue.

42
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.920
Right.

43
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.710
So maybe it's just a different blue so that we don't get confused with the blue that we're using for

44
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.170
gender right.

45
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.030
We actually that might be the same blue.

46
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.090
This is like a darker blue.

47
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.490
Only thing is I don't really marry a big fan of these neon colors so that should be OK.

48
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.520
White collar workers.

49
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.690
Maybe we can use some other color.

50
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.410
Let's see what happens if we use.

51
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.680
No that's too too white.

52
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.520
And plus you can already see the text.

53
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.780
So sometimes you could just do the opposite you could do.

54
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.050
You could do like a black and because the text is white people would understand.

55
00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.260
Or maybe you could use a light gray as as a kind of a dark or white option and then other.

56
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.180
I don't think red is a good option because we can get confused with the red that we are using for gender

57
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.700
and here what color could we use for other.

58
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:21.030
There are tricky ones so maybe something like a brown type of color that's an orange it's very hard

59
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.120
always picking here.

60
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.400
But the good news is if you have the hex code you can just enjoy it.

61
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.750
And that way you won't have to pick out the car.

62
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.010
So yeah I'll leave it like that but really that's not the best option that we have here.

63
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.770
OK.

64
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.710
Maybe something like that so why is it blue and other.

65
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.880
And finally in the colors

66
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:59.480
not the colors the categories and labels so going to switch the data labels on here and display.

67
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.310
So we want to keep it like that but zero decimal points and click OK.

68
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.280
So there we go so we've got a 49 and 26 and 25 percent.

69
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:17.180
And finally we can just keep it as it is and then we'll be ready to use it.

70
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:26.320
So what we can do is we can resize it and resize it you'll see that everything adjust accordingly.

71
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.040
So both not just the boxes but also the labels move around so everything is working fine.

72
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.330
All right.

73
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.050
So that was Outremer up and we are nearly ready.

74
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.840
We're actually ready to proceed to creating our final business intelligence report but we'll start doing

75
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.250
that in the next tutorial and look for you next time.

76
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.880
Until then happy analyzing.
