00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.960
Hello and welcome to the course on Parbat I'm super excited to have you on board.

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.580
And today we're going to learn how to install PBI on your computer.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.410
Now a quick caveat is that PBI at this stage is not available for Macs.

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.120
It is available for your Windows computer and that's where you'll be installing it and where it will

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.790
be working if it's at the same time you can also install it on your iPad or mobile device using the

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.100
associated application store whether it's Apple store or other stores.

7
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.020
But the development that we're going to be doing is going to be happening in power vi for Windows.

8
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.520
All right.

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.790
So in order to install Part B are we going to need a browser.

10
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.650
And then in Google.

11
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.290
Just go to download power be-I so search for that.

12
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.070
Now the link that you need is actually that you just click search there link that you need is possibly

13
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.230
Microsoft dot com slashy and slash downloads.

14
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.240
So let's go ahead and go to that link.

15
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.820
And here you can see that you've got a couple of options.

16
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.650
You've got Microsoft Powerglide desktop on premises gateway part.

17
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.010
Mikes are powered by for mobile so you can download for a mobile device.

18
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.910
But this is to look at your applications that you've created rather than actually create them.

19
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.960
And Microsoft PBI publisher for Excel so the one we want is much of our guide desktop.

20
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.550
Go ahead and click download.

21
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.030
All right so that's going to take a little bit of time to download.

22
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.460
It's about 100 megabytes.

23
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.510
All right so once the file has been downloaded just go ahead and launch it and that'll prompt you to

24
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.040
install Microsoft part.

25
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.990
So let's walk through this process together.

26
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.180
Check the software terms.

27
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.740
Agree if you agree like next select where you want to install it.

28
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.300
I usually leave the default path click Next create a shortcut.

29
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.380
Yes please.

30
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.290
And just go ahead and install.

31
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.920
So sometimes the security window will pop up if you have your firewall on or some security settings

32
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.570
on Microsoft Windows.

33
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.230
And so just click yes and go ahead and it shouldn't take long to install it's takes just a couple of

34
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.910
minutes at most.

35
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.120
So there we go.

36
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.290
It's finished.

37
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.350
And now you can just go ahead and launch Microsoft powered be-I.

38
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.690
All right.

39
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.270
Wonderful.

40
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.380
So there we go.

41
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.640
Microsoft power VI is installed and in the future tutorials we're going to learn how to use it.

42
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.710
We've got a very exciting journey ahead and I can't wait for you to find all the powerful features available

43
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.760
in Microsoft.

44
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.320
And I look forward to seeing them.

45
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.000
Until then happy analyzing.
