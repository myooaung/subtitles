00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.640
Hello welcome back to the course on Parvi I hope you had a chance to play around with the time series

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.700
data and really practice the two different approaches.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.760
And today we're going to talk about aggregation and real art.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.270
It's going to be quite important to Tauriel because this is something that governs everything that happens

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.150
in power be-I and you're going to be using this knowledge further down through all the sections of this

6
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.510
course.

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.050
And more importantly in your career as use power be-I.

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.460
All right.

9
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.610
So what are we talking about.

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.490
Well first of all I'm going to ask a question which might seem very rhetorical at the start but we're

11
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.040
going to actually take some time to really think about it and see what's going on.

12
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.250
So the question is how does power be I in this exhilaration that we've created how does Parvi I know

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.550
that we want to aggregate our data at the monthly level.

14
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.230
Right so it might be an obvious question you'll say.

15
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.150
Well that's the way we've created the position we've put in the month here.

16
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.650
We've put the period here then we drilled into the month we've got unemployed here.

17
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.850
But let's really think about this for a second.

18
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.630
If you look at the data here you'll see that we've got apart from the period and unemployed we've actually

19
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.330
got other quarters we've got men and women so we've got the gender column we've got age which has multiple

20
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.660
different age groups.

21
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.230
And how does power be I know that we want to completely disregard these columns or not disregard them

22
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:33.960
but we don't want to aggregate at their level so we want to for instance for let's say here we've got

23
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.750
a peek at 2010 April rites of 2010 and April we want to add up the unemployment for men and women and

24
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.710
also across all age groups.

25
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.180
How does part I know that.

26
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:53.720
WILL POWER be I knows to which level we want to get based on the level of granularity of our missiles.

27
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.240
So the way to think about it is there's two separate things.

28
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.410
There's obviously zation.

29
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:07.230
So the things that we specify for this specific chart the parameters or the restrictions or rules the

30
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.820
columns and differences hierarchies and different things that we specify for this chart.

31
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.950
And then there is what power be-I does with the data.

32
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.990
So those are two separate concepts.

33
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.550
We are dictating what happens on the chart.

34
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.710
And then part B is taking that information and it is using that to understand how to aggregate the data

35
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.760
how to mesh the data together how to sum up or average out or whatever other aggregation you apply on

36
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.600
the data.

37
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.270
And so Paul VI knows that from what you're doing on the resolution.

38
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.730
So here for example we've told pre-buy that we want this visualization to be at the Year Quarter and

39
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.750
month level so the numeric variable here is unemployed right.

40
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.980
It doesn't affect the level of granularity it is the item that is being aggregated right.

41
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.320
So it's the you have two types of columns you have numeric columns which get aggregated so they get

42
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.380
summed up were averaged out and so on and you have categorical columns or you have time series columns

43
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.090
which actually specify at which level of detail those aggregations need to occur.

44
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.250
So the only other column which is not here that we have in this election if you just look through through

45
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.880
this will basically through this part of your party dashboard you'll see that the only other column

46
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.370
we have is period.

47
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.650
And currently it's said or drilled down to the monthly level.

48
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:42.960
So that's how far be-I knows that it needs to take the data and aggregate it to the monthly level and

49
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:51.270
we can easily manipulate that we can change these things so that the level of granularity or aggregation

50
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.090
is higher or lower.

51
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.870
So for instance we know that in this line here in this one line there's actually two lines.

52
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.130
In reality there's the female line and there's a male line.

53
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.320
Right now they are being aggregate together because nowhere here are we specifying that we want gender

54
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:14.830
as a separate element or a separate level of detail in our aggregation in our.

55
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.440
So let's go ahead and fix that.

56
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.850
Let's see how we can change it if we take gender and put it into legend.

57
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.350
So basically color right.

58
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.830
What will happen is we'll actually get two lines.

59
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.170
Now we have a green line which is for all men and the blackline which is old for all women.

60
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:43.110
And we can see that power be-I is now aggregating our data at not only a year quarter or month level

61
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:50.190
but also at gender level and therefore it is twice the number of points on our viz..

62
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:58.770
So we've become We've increased the level of granularity and or we've decreased the level of aggregation.

63
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.680
So now basically guys going through these rows and it's not only just looking at the period but it's

64
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.260
also looking at the gender column and it's using those two columns to aggregate.

65
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.270
It's still not taking into account age.

66
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.070
But already we have more information on our chart.

67
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.090
And also you can you can change this you can say that you don't want to aggregate by gender you want

68
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.930
to aggregate age for example and you can drag this in here and now you have one two three four five

69
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.210
six seven different groups.

70
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.340
And bear in mind in this case age is not just a numeric variable it's actually a category so we have

71
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.860
different buckets 16 to 19 20 24 25.

72
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.940
Therefore it's like we have bins for our age which have been preconfigured for us in our data set.

73
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:52.290
And the bottom line is that what we're actually doing is we're summing up our position or adding up

74
00:05:52.290 --> 00:06:01.950
our unemployment values at the different age levels and therefore now we again once again increase the

75
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.430
level of granularity or decrease the level of aggregation.

76
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.610
The goal is to work hand-in-hand so granularity is the opposite of the level of granularity or level

77
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:19.440
of D-cells opposite of the level of aggregation so we're aggregating at a much lower level of aggregation

78
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.770
or we're aggregating at a higher level of granularity.

79
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:35.960
And that is a way how we can control the detail of our is very important to understand this and know

80
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.480
that you can control not only you just changing how the chart looks but you're actually changing what

81
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.690
party does in the background so when you've specified here period year quarter or month so we're saying

82
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:53.270
okay that's the level of detail I want to go in that column and then we also want to add the age column

83
00:06:53.390 --> 00:07:00.400
Parbat goes to data and then adds it up or does that aggregation that you selected at that level.

84
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:09.600
And finally so let's just change this back to sort of the sort of age strange as back to gender.

85
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.310
And finally here what we can do is we can sort of we can change the aggregation that we're performing

86
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.690
where we play around with this little bit.

87
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:22.900
So here you can say average the election didn't change much the access did change because you're just

88
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.060
moving from some to average.

89
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:30.490
But let's say for instance we take sort of average we can take median here you'll see that it does change

90
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.330
or you can take a minimum or maximum.

91
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.320
And again the resolution changes because we're performing a different aggregation.

92
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:47.860
So there we go there's a very important topic in data mining in visualisations and hopefully this is

93
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.860
now a bit more clear and this is something that will practice throughout our work with RBI so with time

94
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.440
you will become very very comfortable with these concepts of aggregation granularity and level of detail.

95
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.180
And I hope you to this tural I look forward to seeing you next time.

96
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.050
And until then happy analyzing.
