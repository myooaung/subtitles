00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:06,800
Hello and welcome back to the course and party in this Tauriel we're starting off the first main section

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,780
where we will learn a lot about Parbat.

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,410
We're going to learn the foundations of this tool and we're going to lay the groundwork for the rest

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,750
of this course.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,350
Answer.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,720
Well we are going to learn a lot of theory and learn how the tool works how to navigate it and how to

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,240
use it.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,900
At the same time it is going to be an exciting section because we're going to be solving a real world

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,450
business challenge.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,270
So let's go ahead and find out more about the challenge that we're going to be tasked to do.

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:36,890
All right.

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,260
So here is the challenge.

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,370
His end of financial year and that means it's time for annual bonuses.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,200
The store operates in three regions and only the top performing employees each region qualifies for

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,190
bonus.

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,520
Find out which three employees are eligible to get bonuses for this year.

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,970
Employees are measured on total sales in dollar terms and you can get the data set here.

18
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:05,000
So all of the data sets for this course are available at WDW super days designs that them slash power

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,590
be-I one word.

20
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,140
So let's go ahead and go to that page.

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,310
There is super data centers of course power be-I.

22
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,260
If you scroll down you'll see Section 2.

23
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,880
Your first bar chart in power be-I and this section will learn how to work with GSV files.

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,060
So go ahead and download this file.

25
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:32,450
And once the file has been downloaded this means the end for this tutorial because all we needed to

26
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,790
do is get familiar of the challenge and download the file and we're going to learn how to connect to

27
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,770
this file in the next tutorial.

28
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,690
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

29
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,310
Until then happy Analise.
