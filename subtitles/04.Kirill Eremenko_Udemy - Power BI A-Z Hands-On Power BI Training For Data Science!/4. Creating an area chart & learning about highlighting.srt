00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:06,100
Hello and welcome back to the course on par be-I imperious tutorial we talked about aggregation going

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,790
and granularity we created this wonderful chart.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:15,280
And today we're going to learn how to convert a chart a line chart into an area chart.

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:15,530
All right.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:23,990
So first things first let's replace a gender now with age because that's a parameter or a column that

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,240
we're going to be interested in more.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,430
So let's take a page and replace it over here and put it on top of the gender.

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:39,520
And now we've got all these lines so we've got the separate lines for the separate different categories.

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:48,290
In our age and now all we need to do to replace this chart with a chart is actually just select area

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,180
chart over here.

11
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,190
In fact the one we need is a stacked area.

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,470
And you'll notice that in both of these cases we get kind of like a bit of a jibberish visualisation

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,580
right now.

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:08,840
And I think that this is another bug of Parvi I might be wrong again but this software is really

15
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:17,060
being developed very rapidly these days so probably by the time you're watching this video you won't

16
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,950
have this problem it'll be working right away but if you still do it's not not a big deal we're going

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:31,710
to just restart oversouls and hopefully that will fix this problem of how the charge is being presented.

18
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,050
So forgive me for this.

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,210
We are doing a great job developing and great software and yes bugs happen sometimes so let's close

20
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,850
this week and save changes and let's go and find our position.

21
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,270
So here is Section 3.

22
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,360
And there we go.

23
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,520
So as we can see that didn't really fix the problem.

24
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,690
All right so what are we going to try.

25
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,790
We're going to try to recreate this top part.

26
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,490
We're going take period and drag it back into the access.

27
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,180
And as you can see it all is working OK.

28
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,940
So maybe you don't have to restart your resolution but something like that just replacing one of the

29
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,440
columns or recreating it was positioned while you've got the Richardo chart or sector which are selected

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,830
might fix the issue.

31
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:28,640
And again I think it's a bug might be mistaken there but hopefully that's something that will be looked

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,610
into in the future.

33
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,660
So now if we drill down there we go.

34
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,480
That's obvious.

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,640
It looks wonderful.

36
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,750
Now the difference between the two area chart and Richard is it's quite straightforward actually.

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,620
So here the area charts are behind each other and therefore it's there it looks cluttered right so when

38
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,220
I look at the y axis here it's up to 1.8 million.

39
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,850
If you do a stacked area chart the wax is now up to eight million.

40
00:02:52,880 --> 00:03:00,340
So this the at the top level is actually the total represents the total unemployment for all of these.

41
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,000
And this looks much much better.

42
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,730
There we go.

43
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,710
So that's our stacked area chart.

44
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:14,180
One other thing I wanted to show you is a way you can investigate your visualization and you can use

45
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,820
this come a legend to actually highlight things.

46
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,570
If you select on individual elements you'll see that they are highlighted.

47
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,800
So it's not probably as prominent but depending on the color you can actually see see better.

48
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,700
You can see the other ones fade outs a bit.

49
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,290
But this one stays the same.

50
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:38,900
And this can be useful in some physicians or even in this one to actually highlight and bring the users

51
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,630
of your attention to something so you might want to be you might be talking about just this age group

52
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,420
and you want to highlight it so you just click that.

53
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,320
And that way this age group is highlighted.

54
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,290
All right so there we go.

55
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:56,060
That's how we create an area chart in part B I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I'll look for see

56
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,800
you next time.

57
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,310
Until then happy analyzing.
