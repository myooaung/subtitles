00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.290
Hello and welcome back to the course on power VI in today's tutorial we're going to finally create our

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.710
business intelligence reports.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.180
In fact it's going to be an interactive business intelligence report.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.640
So we're going to put together these five elements that we've created in the previous tutorials we've

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.320
created a map with an indicator for card at the top.

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.030
We've created a pie chart for gender.

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:34.500
We've created a distribution for H distribution for balance and we've created a format for job classification.

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.350
So let's go ahead and create our b i report.

9
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.220
All right.

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.980
So how we're going to put them together.

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:55.670
So the beauty of power be-I is that we can just simply copy these weasels actions onto a new page.

12
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.410
So it's like this hold on controls like this.

13
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.160
Then Prince can see on my keyboard press control V and will be copied over and there are complete independence.

14
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.920
If I change this one this one on change another way around.

15
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.990
So basically if I want to make changes here I'm free to do so and I will always have this back up over

16
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.510
here.

17
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.000
And also don't forget to save your work by pressing control s here.

18
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.380
We've got gender going to copy that as well.

19
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.200
Put it here somewhere then we've got the age distribution.

20
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.470
Copy that as well.

21
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.800
Put it here.

22
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.800
Well just all of this in a second Google balance.

23
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.720
Copy it here.

24
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.490
So this is the beauty of preparing everything in advance.

25
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.140
There is minimal problems for the down and you just need to copy these things.

26
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.670
All right.

27
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.690
So all that has been copied.

28
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.680
Now it's about putting it all together so it looks very nice on one sheet.

29
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.850
And also take into account the size of the screens that you want to prepare for and if these reports

30
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.680
are going to be viewed on desktop or mobile or or if they're going to be viewed on desktops screens

31
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:14.350
or laptops or RBI is also available for iPads so maybe if people or executives are going to be viewing

32
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.980
this report on iPads you might want to make this kind of a little smaller or something.

33
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.610
So it's about experimentation and testing these things out.

34
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:30.840
But now at this stage of what we want to do is we want to actually first of all just use this kind of

35
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.530
stuff we're going to line up everything.

36
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.350
Now you'll notice that it's a bit hard to line things up because they're kind of like free flowing.

37
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.650
There's no there's no grid lines no guidelines here.

38
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.290
And also you may have noticed that throughout the section I have a new tab at the top which is called

39
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.240
view.

40
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.820
Now this is something new.

41
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.040
In one of the later versions of Barbie I may be in your version.

42
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.920
So if you're watching this video even later might be here by default but if you don't have it right

43
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:09.070
now then what you can do is you can click this dropdown go into options go into options here and here

44
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.210
just go down to updates not updates go into Preview features.

45
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.800
And here's a follow features are available for you to try in this release features might change or be

46
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.930
removed a future release.

47
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.880
So for now we have the ability to enable Kroy grid lines and snap to grid.

48
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.300
So go ahead and check this box click OK.

49
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.020
You might have to restart a power be-I to do that.

50
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.840
So just save your work restart and come back to this resolution and then you'll be able to show grid

51
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.640
lines so you can see these grid lines appear at the back of your canvas.

52
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.000
And also you can snap objects a grid that will allow you to have more control of.

53
00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:01.870
So less freedom but at the same time more control over how you're placing these dispositions so that

54
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.940
there are actually lined up very nicely.

55
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.830
All right so now it's very easy to tell the width that you want.

56
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.530
For example here you might want to snap it to that level and then to this one as well as level.

57
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.510
Same thing.

58
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.770
And then you can maybe increase it up to there.

59
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.210
All right.

60
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:26.680
And then this one goes in here and very nicely it's very easy to line them up like this.

61
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.440
When you have these grid lines over there.

62
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.470
So now again this line this one up scroll down

63
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.830
and see up to where maybe this one should be a bit higher I think.

64
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.850
That's good as you can see the percentage is lined up very nicely here.

65
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.490
Then let's take this and line it up over here.

66
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.830
It does take some work some manual editing but it's going to be worth it in the end.

67
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.280
So maybe this needs to go up to the same level as this.

68
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:20.240
And finally a final chart goes into one.

69
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.040
There we go.

70
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.650
All right so obviously this is pretty much ready.

71
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:32.840
The last things that we would like to probably change are these labels and the colors.

72
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:40.160
So let's start with region and region here so we go here we want to keep the legend.

73
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.050
We don't want to keep the title and the same thing here so here

74
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.480
we want to keep the title.

75
00:05:49.540 --> 00:06:02.330
We would do but we do want we want to change it so it's say distribution by age and then here also make

76
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.760
it a more intuitive title we'll call it distribution.

77
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.260
Why Vallence this one title.

78
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.920
Call that job classification

79
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:28.100
here here we'll call this one gender.

80
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.980
All right.

81
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.680
So that's our title.

82
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:37.890
And in terms of colors even though we worked on the colors as we were creating these individual pages

83
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:44.340
and they seem to be OK in this case it doesn't look like the colors work well together and you can tell

84
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.250
just by looking at that this is a bit that stands out that stands out.

85
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.320
Maybe some of the colors here are not ideal so I suggest the following approach.

86
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.770
I'm going to end this tutorial now and I'm going to play around with the colors on my side and then

87
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:05.220
you'll see the final result because I pick in the next tutorial whereas you can also do that.

88
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.080
You can also try to fix up your colors or you can just proceed to the next tutorial and see the ones

89
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.670
I used.

90
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:16.290
It just takes some time and usually it's quite a lengthy process picking up all the colors and I wouldn't

91
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.610
want to make you wait through this painful exercise.

92
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.810
So on that note I'm going to end this tutorial.

93
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.100
I look for the next time.

94
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.810
And until then happy analyzing.
