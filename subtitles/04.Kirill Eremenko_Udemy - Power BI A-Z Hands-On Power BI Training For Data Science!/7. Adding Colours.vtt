00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.500
Hello and welcome back to the course and Paul VI in the tutorial we talked about drilling in child data.

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.770
We talked about and drilling down and Choctaws drilling up what we talked about the show next level

3
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.330
and expand next and functionalities that are available to us.

4
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.300
And today we going to practice a little bit of that because we're actually going to need it to solve

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.580
our challenge and then we'll move on to adding calls to viz..

6
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.470
So let's get straight to it.

7
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:36.770
We integrate a new pager here and into this page we're going to drag drag representative and the units

8
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.520
the number of units sold and then we're going to change this into a barge.

9
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.820
Let's increase the size.

10
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.390
And so here we've got the representatives.

11
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.360
But at the same time we don't see from this election which representative works in which region we can

12
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.570
definitely check that by going into the data and looking at for instance read Richard rooks in East

13
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.000
in East region.

14
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.290
Bill works in the central region and so on.

15
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.630
But it is much better if we would have that information on the ocean.

16
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.460
So what we're going to do is we're going to take region and we're actually going to add it to the same

17
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.160
access so we've got the x axis are here and we're going to add Ridge region there but we're going to

18
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.630
add it above our present.

19
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.200
So she dragged in to the access and just put it in just above the representative you'll see this yellow

20
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.150
line up here.

21
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.020
This yellow solid line and then it'll pop over there.

22
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.130
And obviously the ocean changes because that region right now is the dominant column on this resolution.

23
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.590
But at the same time you can now see that this pattern is active These buttons are active show next

24
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.950
level and expand next.

25
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.620
So here you can see them as well.

26
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.320
And that means we can go into the next level of this hierarchy or synthetic Hartly there so you can

27
00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.180
see it's not an actual hurricane because as opposed to dates if I go back to page two you'll see that

28
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.820
we've got order data and then these are shifted to the right a little bit so that's showing us that

29
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.820
there is a hurricane here whereas this is just like a hurricane that was created just for this chart.

30
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.490
And but nevertheless we can still drill in through it and that's what we're going to do.

31
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.170
As we remember when overgraze use this Boran because go to the next hole the hierarchy will completely

32
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.040
disregard the region and therefore this exercise is pointless.

33
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.120
But what we're going to do instead is we're going to expand the next level so we're going to click this

34
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.710
button.

35
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.720
And as you can see now we've got central the central region here.

36
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.340
Alex and Bill then we've got the West region and then we've got again central central east central east

37
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.050
central east and west.

38
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.150
And so now the last thing we need to do is we need to order.

39
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.510
So the first thing that comes to mind is you click the buttons here and then you click sort of by region

40
00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.580
rep and then his reversal vertical order so click it again and ideally it should start properly right

41
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.090
so should be central than it should be East because a b c d e and then w.

42
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.220
But here you can see that it's still soaring by the name of the Representer So Alex Bill James Matthew

43
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.000
Morgan Nick.

44
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:27.430
So a B J M M and R R S S and T and I think this is something that might be not working properly and

45
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.450
partly I might be wrong but what's going to do now is we're going to take a region which just recreates

46
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.310
this resolution.

47
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.140
But we're going to drag the presenter and region in the in a different order onto this.

48
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.620
And so let's just take a representative out the sick region out.

49
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.210
And now this first put region in because remember we put in Representative before region.

50
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.840
So now we're going Prinergy that region and then representative in and expands to the next level.

51
00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.050
And now if we order if we sort if we sort these you'll see central central central central central east

52
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.490
east east and west west.

53
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.110
So that's how it's supposed to be that's the behavior that we want.

54
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.500
And so if you find that you're getting that same kind of bog that we just witnessed then just try try

55
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.540
doing that try putting in region first and then representative.

56
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:27.760
And hopefully that will fix it and maybe in future versions of Paul be-I this problem will be removed

57
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.300
and therefore maybe you'll be working right away.

58
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.940
All right.

59
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.100
So that's what we wanted.

60
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.200
And now for the final step now we're just going to add some color so that not only we can see by the

61
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.940
text where the different regions are but also by the color and there's a very quick way to add color

62
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.880
you've got two options here you've got the legend and you've got the concentration.

63
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.230
So if you let's say for instance a Guinness and put into concentration so it has a numeric value for

64
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.460
concentration.

65
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.990
It will tell you where you've got more Celso actually make it more prominent and easier to identify

66
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.990
where there's more cells where there's less.

67
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.480
At the same time what we're after is we want to call them by region.

68
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.180
So by categorical variable which is region here and we're going to drag it into legend instead and was

69
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.780
that again just straight into legend.

70
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:28.780
And there you go so you can see we've got the central region is green the blue the East region is black

71
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.390
and the West region is red.

72
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.820
And of course you can adjust the colors and you just need to go to the format over here.

73
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.580
There's lots of different formatting options.

74
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.720
We're just going to look at the colors for today.

75
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.970
If you look at the drop down here you can change the color.

76
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:54.420
So let's say Central will be yellow east or not let's say central believe central Green or make He's

77
00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:04.780
yellow as the rising sun and that's say red for the series like the red.

78
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.260
So there we go.

79
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:13.030
So we've got central east and west and they're very nice because you can tell right away who's sold

80
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.310
the most units in which region.

81
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:21.670
So Alex has sold the most in the central region Richard has sold the most units in the East region and

82
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.810
James has sold the most in the West.

83
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.530
But that doesn't actually answer a question because for us we need to find out for the shower to find

84
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.090
out who made the most sales in dollar terms.

85
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.190
And that's something that we're going to discuss in the next tutorial.

86
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.370
Ali first the next time and until then happy analyzing.
