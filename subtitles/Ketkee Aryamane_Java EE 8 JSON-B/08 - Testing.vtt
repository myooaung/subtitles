00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.080
- [Narrator] So now let's go ahead

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.050
and test out the deserializers,

3
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.040
so first let's go to object mapper,

4
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.030
and in order that the deserializer also takes effect,

5
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.040
we need to set it, okay,

6
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.070
and this time we need both of them together.

7
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.050
Config dot with deserializers, that's the method,

8
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.000
and you just instantiate your Person Deserializer.

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.010
Okay, so the config object is ready with us,

10
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.060
let's go back to test serializers.

11
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.030
We have already collected the jsonb instance

12
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.050
on line number 29, carefully.

13
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.090
We have taken the getObjectMapper call.

14
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.000
And made sure that the constant object is

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.030
definitely ready with us to create the default

16
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.000
jsonb engine instance. So that's ready with us.

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.030
We've will also see how to serialize it.

18
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.040
All of it is ready.

19
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.000
Now we need to make sure that this call becomes active.

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.020
So let me un comment to this now.

21
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.090
Let's format this call. Okay.

22
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.040
So now what we are doing as a part of deserialization

23
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.070
we just calling the fromjson api,

24
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.010
passing the serialized result, and

25
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.000
the type of course is this. Right?

26
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.020
So there is no need to write this again.

27
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.060
You already have it captured in the variable on line 28.

28
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.010
You can just pass it on line 34.

29
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.040
Okay, let's see this now.

30
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.080
Oh yeah. See how wonderful the result is?

31
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.080
That's the result of the serialization process. Right?

32
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.060
And now, when you have the list back after re-serialization,

33
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.010
under that list you have one object,

34
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.090
which is of the professor type,

35
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.050
and the other object which is

36
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.000
of the software development type,

37
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.010
along with their respective attributes.

38
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.070
Of course, please don't worry that you are not able to see

39
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.070
the name and the email, that is because

40
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.010
your professor being, let's take a look at that,

41
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.080
your professor two string method does not have

42
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.090
the name and email fields included.

43
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.010
Of course you can append those fields here.

44
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.050
And then you definitely get to see

45
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.060
even the name and the email. So let's quickly do that.

46
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.030
Let's also take the label.

47
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.070
So I'm going to say carry out this entire thing.

48
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.010
Copy. Paste.

49
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.010
That will be the name, and how do we get the name?

50
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.030
We have to say super dot getname. Okay.

51
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.010
And one more time, that will be for the email.

52
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.090
So this will be super dot getEmail. Okay.

53
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.020
The same thing we'll have to do for the

54
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.050
software development class as well, so,

55
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.080
let's go ahead and copy this on line 47.

56
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.080
Go to the software developer bean,

57
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.030
write in the two string method down there,

58
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.070
and just copy this. Alright.

59
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.030
So now let's go ahead and test out again,

60
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.050
in order to see everything in one single shot.

61
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.090
Okay, let's see the output. Yeah.

62
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.090
Very good. So, along with the other field you also have

63
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.030
the name and the respective email coming in for

64
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.020
both of the guys. So Chandler and Ross have finally met

65
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.020
at the meet up conference, and that was possible because

66
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.000
we used serializers and deserializers.
