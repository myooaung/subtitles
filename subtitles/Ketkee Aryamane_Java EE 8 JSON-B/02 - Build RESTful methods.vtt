00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.080
- [Instructor] Now, let's go ahead and add

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.010
a RESTful resource to the project.

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.010
So, let's come here and right click

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.030
on the com.app.rest package, say Java Class,

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.000
and say OrderResource.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.020
And it's a RESTful API that we are trying to

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.070
pull in the JAXRS application

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.070
So, now it is a RESTful class that we want to write,

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.090
so we'll annotate this with the path annotation,

10
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.060
which comes from the javax.ws.rs.Path.

11
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.080
And then we'll define the URI for this path.

12
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.080
So, let's say orders, okay?

13
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.020
So, whenever you want to access this RESTful application,

14
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.070
the first thing that you have to do is,

15
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.040
you have to enter the basic URI which is resources,

16
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.070
and after that if you want to access the OrderResource,

17
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.060
then you'll have to access the path for that respectively.

18
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.060
Okay?

19
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.040
Alright.

20
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.020
And what are we going to do here?

21
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.040
We're going to add RESTful methods to it.

22
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.030
So, let's go ahead and say one method to get the orders.

23
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.060
So basically, the point of this application is,

24
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.040
we have already created the order object

25
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.010
in the stand-alone application that we have built

26
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.000
so far as a part of this course.

27
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.060
This is a JAXRS web application.

28
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.030
But before that, the stand-alone application that we built,

29
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.050
has all the beans ready with us,

30
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.010
also has the data generator class which will create

31
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.040
all the mock data for us.

32
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.020
So we're going to contain all of that

33
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.040
in the web project as well.

34
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.060
And then we are going to hit the RESTful API

35
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.010
to get all the orders.

36
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.040
So first let's add a method here.

37
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.020
Let's say GET.

38
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.080
And what is this going to do?

39
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.090
It's going to return a list,

40
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.050
java.util.list of orders.

41
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.010
So, I'm going to say get orders, that's all.

42
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.090
This method is ready with me now.

43
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.040
Now the big step that I have to do is,

44
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.080
I have to get all the beans for order, order details,

45
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.030
products, customer; all of the beans that we have

46
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.060
created as a part of the demo, right here in this project.

47
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.070
So I'm just going to expand the earlier project that we had,

48
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.000
go to the source packages.

49
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So let's now take the folder.

50
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.060
We can the specific classes that we need.

51
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.070
So we definitely want address, customer, order,

52
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.060
order details, and product.

53
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.090
Those are the ones that we need.

54
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.090
So, right click, copy, go down,

55
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:38.060
and paste it to com.app.beans and the JsonbWeb project.

56
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.050
Okay, so there we are.

57
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.060
We have all the beans ready under the source packages.

58
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.000
Those are the ones that we are definitely

59
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.010
going to need for this application.

60
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.000
Alright, and then let's come to OrderResource

61
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.030
again, on line number 20.

62
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.010
Now I'm going to change the return type to list of order

63
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.070
instead of just an open collection.

64
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:12.010
Okay, let's import this com.app.beans.

65
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.000
Alright, and then, we are also going to do one more thing.

66
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.030
We are going to write a small method here which says public.

67
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.060
It will return your list of orders.

68
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:31.070
And let's call this get orders from database.

69
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.020
Now, we are not trying to make any kind of

70
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.000
database query during this application

71
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.020
because that's not really the focus right now.

72
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.060
We only need the data for that order object,

73
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.040
or maybe the list of orders that we may have.

74
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.070
So in order to do that let's go ahead

75
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.010
and back to the stand-alone application.

76
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.000
The com.app.utils folder has a data generator class.

77
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.040
Let's copy that, let's come down,

78
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.010
and we also have created a com.app.utils in the web project.

79
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.060
Let's just paste it there.

80
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.050
Alright, so the data generator class is in place

81
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.020
and that is basically going to give us

82
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.020
the data that we need for this RESTful application.

83
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.040
Alright, so I'm going to go back to OrderResource,

84
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.090
come to the get orders from database,

85
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:29.000
and just go ahead and make a return type of list of orders.

86
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.020
Say new ArrayList.

87
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.040
Let's first make the ArrayList,

88
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.030
and then we're going to say orders.dot.addDatagenerator.

89
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.080
Let's pick up the order from that class.

90
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.030
Likewise, you can add many order objects of different data

91
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.020
to this list of orders.

92
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.000
So, we'll look at the rest of this stuff

93
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
in the next video.
