- [Ketkee] Hi, my name is Ketkee

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.090
and I have been doing Java and Java Enterprise development

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.010
for the last 11 years, and I'm going to take you

4
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.070
through the JSON Binding API course.

5
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.080
Today, JavaScript Object Notation has become the

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.010
dominant format for data exchange,

7
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.020
works across all platforms, all languages.

8
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.010
Previously, XML was the preferred format.

9
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.050
But today, it is JSON all over the place.

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.000
Now when it comes to Java,

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.090
there are many third party libraries

12
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.020
that work very well when trying to deal with JSON,

13
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.040
but you would have to indicate them in your application.

14
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.030
But what if you get an API which comes bundled

15
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.060
with the Enterprise Edition platform

16
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.030
as a standard and offers you all the features

17
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.060
that the third parties do, out of the box?

18
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.050
Yes, that's possible, in this course we are going to talk

19
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.000
about why do you need JSON-B, what are the features

20
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that it provides you, and then

21
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.010
how do you plug it in in your application?

22
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.060
We will see the default settings,

23
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.080
the customize settings that it provides you.

24
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.030
And at the end of the course, we will a small JAX-RS,

25
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.010
which is a RESTful service application, and understand

26
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.070
how JSON Binding can be used along with it.

27
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.000
So let's get started.
