00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.050
- Okay we have looked at the rapports

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.010
Now we will look at JSON-B Custom

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.000
Serializers and Deserializers.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Okay, so this is the second level of

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.070
deep customization that JSON Binding API provides you

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.040
in case some kind of logic is not facilitated by the

7
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.000
complied time or the run time customizations

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.070
that it already provides you.

9
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.040
And do not worry, this is the last

10
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.090
bit where JSON Binding really tries to convince

11
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.090
us that yes you can do all sorts of customization

12
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.030
if you were not able to do it with the

13
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.050
additions or the JSON-B congfig option or even

14
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.090
with the adaptor.

15
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.060
Okay, so this is the lowest level of

16
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.020
Serialization/Deserialization

17
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.020
that you have and this is the place

18
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.080
where you have all kinds of access to the

19
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.070
JSON process and the generators from

20
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.030
the low level JSON processing API.

21
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.020
We already know that JSON Binding uses

22
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.050
JSON processing internally, and all

23
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.030
the JSON parsers and generators available there

24
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.040
will now be available to you.

25
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.050
While this option of Serializers and Deserializers

26
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.060
so that you can actually carry out the lowest

27
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
level of serialization and deserialization.

28
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.040
Now if you want to do that, then you have

29
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.050
to implement a couple of interfaces.

30
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.080
JSON-B Serializers and JSON-B Deserializers.

31
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.000
And, you will need to write the custom logic for

32
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.050
serialization and deserialization under

33
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.060
the respective methods of these classes

34
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.090
and once that's then done we can test it out on

35
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.030
any of the objects that you want to satisfy

36
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.000
this requirement for.

37
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So, we'll take a look at the demo in the next video.
