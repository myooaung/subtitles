00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.010
- [Instructor] Thank you so much for spending time

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.020
with me on this course, I really hope

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.090
that it was of great help to you.

4
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.010
There are many third party libraries that we have,

5
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.030
Google Gson, Jackson, and we saw JSON-B today.

6
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.020
JSON-B would definitely be preferred,

7
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.080
because it comes with the Enterprise edition platform

8
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.050
there as a standard now.

9
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.060
Now these data formats keep evolving.

10
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.040
It was XML first, then came JSON,

11
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.010
and now there's a new thing which is called

12
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.080
Protocol Buffers that Google has come up with.

13
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.070
That's the official page of Protocol Buffers,

14
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.010
and that's again a language neutral,

15
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.050
platform neutral, extensible mechanism

16
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.040
for serializing structured data.

17
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.060
It's really good to go through this documentation

18
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.080
and find out what more in this.

19
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.000
So, until we meet next time, enjoy coding.
