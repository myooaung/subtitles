00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.020
- [Instructor] Now that you've seen all the basic data types

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.000
and we've seen how civilization and decivilization happens

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.050
with JSON Binding API, let's look quickly

4
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.060
at the data types that are supported by JSON Binding API

5
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.040
during these two processes.

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.010
The first thing, it supports all the basic data types,

7
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.020
which means we are talking about primitives

8
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.040
and their associated upper classes.

9
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.080
When it comes to the basic types, let's understand,

10
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.000
that during civilization, the two string method

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.010
is called on the instance feel to produce a string value.

12
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.050
Then, when you have the Java standard edition types,

13
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.070
which means it includes big integer,

14
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.090
big decimal, the URI, the URL classes,

15
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.020
all of these are also supported by JSON Binding API.

16
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.040
Then the special data types, so for example,

17
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.030
any metadata types, then you have

18
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.060
your calendar classes, the time zone classes,

19
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.040
all the classes in the java.time package,

20
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.030
all of these will also be supported by JSON-B

21
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.060
during civilization and decivilization.

22
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.070
And more of you will have already

23
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.030
seen this in the previous video,

24
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.060
arrays and collection framework classes

25
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.060
of all kinds will exist under the Java platform,

26
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.000
they as well will be supported by the JSON-B API.
