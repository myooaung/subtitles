00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.060
- [Narrator] So now that we've created all the beans

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.060
as per the diagram that we saw before,

3
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.020
let's go ahead and create instances of all beans.

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.010
We will have to feed in data in all of them

5
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.020
and then link them together.

6
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.090
Now, I have already made utility that is

7
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.000
available in my project, which is data generated, or JAVA.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.010
This file will be available to

9
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.050
all of you in the exercise folders.

10
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.030
That is one class where I have just

11
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.020
tried to create a lot of mock data,

12
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.050
and then construct the order object.

13
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.070
So I have the address object and

14
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.090
I have given certain values to all its fields,

15
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.060
then I have a list of products I fed

16
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.040
in data to that products list, and

17
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.010
then there are all the details

18
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.010
the custom object and the auto object finally.

19
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.060
If you observe there is one of the

20
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.040
products in which the value for the

21
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.070
shipping company is set as null.

22
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.000
This is been done deliberately

23
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.090
to show the mapping of null values.

24
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.010
There is also one more thing that

25
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.030
I've added a null product to that list.

26
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.020
That's also on purpose.

27
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.030
Okay, and then we have all the details of course.

28
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.020
We have the customer details, and

29
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.000
then constructed the final order object through all of this.

30
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.010
Now, in a real application in the life project

31
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.090
in the industry all of this data

32
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.090
will be pulled in from the database.

33
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.020
But the database interaction is

34
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.080
not the focal point of this course,

35
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.070
which is why I created a class which

36
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.090
creates mock data and returns it to me.

37
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.000
You please feel free to go ahead

38
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.020
and call the database to get all this data.

39
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.060
You may also communicate with the restful webservice,

40
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.090
in case the data is being gotten through it.

41
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.060
So it's up to your choice and feel

42
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.040
free to use this file as well there

43
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.000
is absolutely no problem for this course.
