00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.010
- [Instructor] In order to get the most out of this course,

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.030
let's take a look at the skills that we need

3
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.080
in order to get on with this.

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.070
The first thing is,

5
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.090
you will of course require a basic understanding

6
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.050
of what JSON and XML formats look like,

7
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.040
how they're written out, et cetera.

8
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.030
A very good knowledge of the fundamentals

9
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.010
of Java Standard Edition APIs is necessary for this course.

10
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.000
You should be very comfortable working

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.040
with the NetBeans IDE or any other IDE of your choice.

12
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.080
Basically, an integrated development environment

13
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.090
for coding Java applications.

14
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.060
This knowledge is necessary.

15
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.050
And then lastly,

16
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.050
we're going to build a small RESTful web application

17
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.070
at the end of the course,

18
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.000
so a basic knowledge of that would be really helpful.
