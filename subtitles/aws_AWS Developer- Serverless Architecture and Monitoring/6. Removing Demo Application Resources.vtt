As tempted as you may be to skip this video,

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.850
I'd recommend watching it just to make sure you've removed all

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.320
the resources we created during this course.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.390
Some of them can get pretty pricey.

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.970
I'm looking at you, RDS.

6
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.440
So make sure you remove them all.

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.430
I've provided a script in the demo code to remove most of the resources,

8
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.970
but we do need to manually delete some that were created by us in this course.

9
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.440
First, go to the VPC dashboard and click on the Endpoints menu option.

10
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.660
Select the Kinesis VPC endpoint we created.

11
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.110
Then click the Actions drop‑down and select Delete Endpoint, then Yes, Delete.

12
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.260
Now go into CloudWatch and then Alarms and select

13
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.840
the lambda_error_alarm we created.

14
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.940
Then select Actions and Delete.

15
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.200
Now head over to the IAM dashboard and click on the Roles menu option.

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.110
Select the role that starts with trash‑panda‑buffet‑dev.

17
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.550
This is a role that was created by the Serverless Framework.

18
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.540
We need to detach the policies added for X‑Ray access. So, click the X icon

19
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.040
on the right for any policies that mention tracer access.

20
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.130
Once that's completed, the rest of our demo application will be ready to

21
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.570
delete. Pull up your command line, and at the root of our project, execute the

22
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.030
command npm run remove. This will take some time to finish. So, feel free to

23
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.760
get yourself some coffee or take a nap or watch a movie or something. If

24
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.340
you're wondering why we manually removed some of those resources, it's because

25
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.540
the Serverless Framework uses CloudFormation to create all the resources for

26
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.940
our application.

27
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.990
If things are manually created after the fact, it isn't able

28
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.420
to remove them when we delete the stack.

29
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.250
Also,

30
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.010
there are occasionally resources that must be removed in a

31
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.800
certain order or their dependency relationship with a resource

32
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.200
will cause it to be unremovable.

33
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.940
The VPC endpoint is a perfect example of that, and we wouldn't be able

34
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.650
to remove any of the subnets that we created since they are a

35
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.540
dependency of the endpoint. Once it completes, then everything has

36
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.860
been removed. You will still have the IAM role we manually created for

37
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.000
the processAction lambda, but those don't cost anything. So, you can remove it on your own if you want to.
