Hi there,

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.590
and welcome back to AWS Developers: Serverless Architecture and Monitoring.

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.450
In this module,

4
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.440
we're going to focus on monitoring and look at a few ways to

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.030
ensure your applications are working as expected.

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.420
Monitoring also helps when troubleshooting issues that may

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.850
crop up, and a newer AWS service called X窶然ay will help

8
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.940
troubleshoot issues with errors,

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.910
latency, or bottlenecks in both serverless applications

10
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.600
and distributed web applications.

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.440
Let's take a look at what we're covering in this module.

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.170
We'll start by looking at the X窶然ay service and

13
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.740
understand how it works from a high level.

14
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.100
Then we'll look specifically at tracing in X窶然ay and

15
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.540
understand the parts of a trace.

16
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.960
Next, we'll implement X窶然ay in our serverless application

17
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.740
and see what it looks like in action.

18
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.580
Then we'll create some CloudWatch alarms to bring

19
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.930
attention to any blind spots in our application and

20
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.900
ensure we're aware when things go awry.

21
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:08.000
Finally, we'll spin down our demo application resources once we're done with them. Let's get started.
