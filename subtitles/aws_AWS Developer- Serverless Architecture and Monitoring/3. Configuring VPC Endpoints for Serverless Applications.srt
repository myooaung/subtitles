1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,900
We only have one lambda in our demo application that

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,360
connects to a non‑VPC service.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,000
But let's use that as an example for setting up a

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,680
secure connection using VPC endpoints.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,830
As stated in the last module,

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,790
VPC endpoints are configured per service per region.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,950
So if you had resources in a VPC that was going to connect to a

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,910
lot of different services through VPC endpoints,

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,660
you will have to set up a lot of VPC endpoints.

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:34,310
One thing to be aware of, unlike most networking services such as VPC and AWS,

11
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,390
VPC endpoints do have a cost associated to them.

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,900
The cost depends on the region you're working in,

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,040
but the lowest is 1 cent an hour.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,740
This amounts to roughly $8 a month.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,240
That's not really that cheap.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,250
Pretty close to the cost of running a small EC2 instance.

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,170
So, make sure to be conservative with these connections.

18
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,870
They provide a lot of value in creating a secure

19
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,520
infrastructure for your resources, so use them as needed.

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,880
For our purposes,

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,260
we want to connect to a Kinesis Stream without going to the internet,

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,180
so let's get a VPC endpoint set up to connect to Kinesis.

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,510
In the AWS console, navigate to the VPC dashboard.

24
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,310
In the menu, select Endpoints.

25
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,970
Your endpoints will appear here, specific to the region you're working in.

26
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,480
Now is a good time to double check the Region drop‑down in

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,740
the upper right to make sure you're in the same region you

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,930
deployed the demo application to.

29
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,560
Now, click on the Create Endpoint button.

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,540
Leave the AWS services radio button selected in the Service category section.

31
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,700
In the Service Name list below, look for an entry

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,840
that ends with kinesis‑streams.

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,470
The exact service name will be different depending on your current region.

34
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,440
In the VPC drop‑down, select the VPC with the name trash‑panda‑buffet next to it.

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,530
It should then change the subnet options to the only

36
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,740
two that were created in that VPC.

37
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,040
Leave the checkbox for Enable DNS name checked.

38
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,100
This sets up a private DNS record for the VPC

39
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,440
endpoint that resolves for your VPC.

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,550
We can also leave the Security group option alone.

41
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,100
It's already got the default group ID for the VPC entered. This

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,980
policy section allows you more specific control over how this

43
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,500
endpoint can be accessed and what it accesses.

44
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,840
We'll leave this at full access. Now click the Create endpoint button.

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,760
The VPC endpoint will be created, and any calls to Kinesis will

46
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,180
automatically resolve to this endpoint and will go to Kinesis without going

47
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,340
through the outside internet. You can see this DNS names section has the

48
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,940
main Kinesis endpoint for whatever region you're in. This is how our lambda

49
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,500
will connect to Kinesis via a VPC endpoint. In the next video, let's look at

50
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:08,000
what kinds of events sources we can use to invoke lambda functions in a serverless application.
