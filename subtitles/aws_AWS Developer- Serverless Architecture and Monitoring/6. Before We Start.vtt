Before we start this course,

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.020
there are some prerequisites that you'll need to ensure that you've completed.

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.710
The first is to have the AWS CLI downloaded,

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.710
installed, and configured with a user.

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.800
The user should have permissions to do almost anything in AWS. If you have to

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.810
be more restrictive than that, I recommend taking a look at the services in

7
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.180
this course and giving yourself read/write permissions pretty much just for

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.720
those. We'll be working a lot with the SDK, and it generally requires you to

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.400
have your CLI‑level configuration already set up. Our demo project and any

10
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.800
other code that we run in this course is going to be for the Node JavaScript

11
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.410
platform. Make sure you have Node installed locally with at least this version

12
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.240
here.

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.030
The easiest way to check your version of Node is by running node ‑v in your

14
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.890
command line. That will show you the version that you have installed. Next, you

15
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.120
should have a good code editor installed, I'll be using Visual Studio Code, VS

16
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.430
Code, which is a free editor from Microsoft.

17
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.080
If you want to use something different, my only recommendation is to just

18
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.740
make sure that it has syntax highlighting and auto indent,

19
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.860
just to make your life a little easier. Then, make sure to download the demo

20
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.440
project code. You can get this code in the Exercise files section of this

21
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.670
course on Pluralsight, but I'm also making it available on GitHub if you

22
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.400
prefer to get it from there. I'd say the benefit of using the exercise files

23
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.760
is that any changes in the course are also present in that code. It has a

24
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.110
before and after.

25
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.630
It can be very beneficial to have that available in

26
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.140
case you make a typo during a lesson.

27
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.740
Don't say it's never happened to you.

28
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.090
Finally, if you don't already have one set up,

29
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.080
I highly recommend creating a billing alarm or an AWS

30
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.630
budget for this course for your account.

31
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.010
Even if you're on a free‑tier account,

32
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.220
some of the services that we're going to be working

33
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.320
with can get very expensive quickly.

34
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.760
The free tier is typically just the amount of time that you're running

35
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.580
a resource. And so if you leave these resources running, it can end up

36
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.740
charging you before you even know it.

37
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.820
I would recommend setting at least one alarm or budget at

38
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.760
about $5 to just let you know if you start getting charged for

39
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.540
anything. At the end of the course,

40
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.690
I'm going to walk you through tearing down all the

41
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.390
resources that we create in it.

42
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.660
So, hopefully, that will keep you from any ongoing charges after you've

43
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.000
completed the course. And that's all you'll need to get started. Now let's dive deeper into the world of serverless architecture and monitoring.
