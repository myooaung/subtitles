Hello there, and welcome to this course,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,540
AWS Developer: Serverless Architecture and Monitoring.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,820
My name is Ryan Lewis,

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,720
and I'm excited to introduce you to some of the most

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,540
cutting‑edge technologies on the web today.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,550
You've likely heard the buzzword serverless around the water cooler or

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,620
in the schedules of conferences around the world,

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,180
and I'm here to demystify much of the buzz around that term and guide you

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,160
through how to use serverless to your own ends in AWS.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,140
In addition to new architecture patterns,

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,840
AWS has been innovating in the world of cloud application monitoring,

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,840
and you'll also learn in this course how to use services like

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,190
X‑Ray and CloudWatch to monitor your application,

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,940
lifecycle and health.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,040
Let's take a look at how this course is structured.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,280
This first module will explain what serverless is

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,640
and some of the history around it.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,300
Then we'll cover some specifics of architecting a serverless application,

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,740
including what I call the four major pillars.

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,400
Finally,

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,630
we'll look at the demo project we'll be building in this course

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,340
and some of the tools you'll need to set up.

23
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,560
The next module will focus on using the compute side

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,040
of serverless with AWS Lambda.

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,730
There are some other courses on Pluralsight that go deep with Lambda,

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,960
so we're going to focus on security, stability,

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,570
and performance concerns.

28
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,400
The module after that will cover serverless event sources that

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,810
can trigger your lambda compute functions.

30
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,190
We'll look at using API Gateway for HTTP events and

31
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,740
Kinesis for messaging events.

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,290
In the last module, we'll go over how to monitor your applications in AWS.

33
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,920
We're going to configure X‑Ray to see how you can view the

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,720
entire serverless execution lifecycle,

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,850
and then we'll configure alarms in CloudWatch to alert you

36
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,340
if something happens to your application.

37
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,240
This is the last course in the AWS Certified Developer Associate path here,

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,440
at Pluralsight.

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,100
While this course can be watched on its own,

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,030
if you're planning to take the exam,

41
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,020
then I would recommend watching all the courses in order so

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,840
the knowledge you gain can build on itself.

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,000
This course is going to cover a lot of material in a pretty short time, so let's get started.
