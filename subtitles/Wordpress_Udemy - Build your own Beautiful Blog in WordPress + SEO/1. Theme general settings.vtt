All of these are separate.

01:07.360 --> 01:07.710
All right.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.180
These are not combined.

01:09.260 --> 01:11.120

01:11.140 --> 01:15.860
All you need to do is look don't box two in but we have all these combined.

OK.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.800
I have I have downloaded two pictures.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.710
We will use one for our logo.

01:55.710 --> 01:57.380
This is a follow up we didn't want it.

01:57.390 --> 01:59.190
We want our computer to be here.

01:59.190 --> 02:05.940
I have a picture that we use as a logo but you can create your own logo if you if you know how to work

02:05.940 --> 02:09.780
with photoshop or you can buy logo and if you want.

02:09.780 --> 02:12.270
So I have our logo that we would use here.

02:12.750 --> 02:19.860

03:01.740 --> 03:02.600
OK.

03:04.290 --> 03:05.660
So after every call.

03:05.820 --> 03:10.200
OK we're only doorstepping that we really need another team.

03:10.210 --> 03:12.820
I will not give her any extra setting because we don't need it.

03:12.830 --> 03:19.230
I record all those settings that are important for our blog the extras that only just waste our time

03:19.230 --> 03:21.100
because we don't need any added extra setting.

03:21.120 --> 03:28.390
So the general setting We're adults we have OK we have time for Formic forget all the setting we don't

03:28.410 --> 03:29.810
need them.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.960
The next important thing is this time format.

03:32.970 --> 03:34.560
We have three options here.

03:34.560 --> 03:40.190
One is traditional traditional time is like five or five.

03:40.330 --> 03:43.610
November 15 November 2015.

03:43.650 --> 03:50.010
That is traditional but time ago format is like 10 minutes ago or two days ago.

03:50.040 --> 03:54.010
Let me see here you see this post is three days ago.

03:54.070 --> 04:00.240
This board is all that two days ago said this is the time ago format but you can order it Jewish tradition

04:00.280 --> 04:03.870
if you want to see what it looks like.

04:05.870 --> 04:06.380
OK.

04:06.590 --> 04:07.680
And we're only fresh.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.850
And you will see the traditional name see November 15 2015.

04:12.040 --> 04:18.240
This is the traditional time GOLAZO disable it if you want but it will not be a good idea to keep it

04:18.520 --> 04:19.610
a go for me.

04:19.960 --> 04:23.350
OK so let's see if years ago it.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.590
Let me see what else we have in here to cover.

04:25.620 --> 04:26.400
OK.

04:26.580 --> 04:28.410
Next thing is bed.

04:28.510 --> 04:30.980
Let me tell you what bankruptcy is.

04:30.990 --> 04:37.970
So if I open this website it is a breadcrumb story Norbert grub's breadcrumbs.

04:37.980 --> 04:39.900
I always knew I was wrong.

04:39.980 --> 04:45.290
So this is breadcrumbs hoor had this boss who had to see the breadcrumbs.

04:45.340 --> 04:51.100
OK we are from the home page we are in the health category and in the health category we are on the

04:51.100 --> 04:51.520
post.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.440
This post you need to be held.

04:53.470 --> 04:59.190
This is the breadcrumbs so this little sign is the bright side and you can just decide if you will.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.610
Jane sign.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.750
All you need do is put design here whatever you want.

05:03.850 --> 05:05.480
Right now the sign is this.

05:05.650 --> 05:13.430
Let's get rid of them and let's see if changes hands you will see this will be just OK.

05:13.770 --> 05:17.050
Fresh a..

05:17.060 --> 05:19.240
No this site is changed.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.520
So this is what breadcrumbs do.

05:21.560 --> 05:30.180
OK you can either dissevered breadcrumb if you want but I recommend you do this on so we are done with

05:30.190 --> 05:31.660
General settings in the next.

05:31.660 --> 05:37.840
We have the header settings and headers setting with this heading right here to this area from this

05:38.410 --> 05:39.220
to this.

05:39.220 --> 05:41.050
All of this is in the header.

05:41.080 --> 05:46.120
We can do this in the header and we can apply our Or upload our logo we can get this menu.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.690
All of these will be covered in the header settings.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.710
So thank you guys for watching this video.

05:50.710 --> 05:53.640
