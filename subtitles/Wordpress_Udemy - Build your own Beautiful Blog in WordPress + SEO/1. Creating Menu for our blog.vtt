Hello gays welcome to this video in this you will work on our team to make it more awesome.

00:07.940 --> 00:10.580
The first thing that we're going to do is add the menu.

00:10.580 --> 00:17.320
We have Norman you can see here to and the menu go to your Edmon banner and hover over appearance at

00:17.310 --> 00:19.260
click on menus.

00:22.240 --> 00:22.720
OK.

00:22.860 --> 00:24.770
Now it's time to create the menu.

00:24.780 --> 00:29.130
I'm going to see it as the main menu.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.370
You can write whatever you want and click create menu

00:35.600 --> 00:40.630
the menus created but if you have nothing right now it has no button.

00:40.670 --> 00:47.090
Looking at some page use the demon you OK some buttons like you see on web sites.

00:47.090 --> 00:54.170
There is a home button there health button technology button and blah blah that is that all the buttons

00:54.600 --> 00:57.320
and buttons all over this main menu.

00:57.320 --> 00:57.980
OK.

00:58.340 --> 01:04.880
When we create what Brezhnev's said what best aeromedical he creates a page with the name simple page

01:04.920 --> 01:06.170
again.

01:06.410 --> 01:11.140
The first thing we do is delete this page but I'm not getting this page.

01:11.150 --> 01:17.800
I'm going to show you that how we can create a menu button with the name displayed will open this page

01:17.810 --> 01:18.290
OK.

01:18.470 --> 01:20.760
So all you need to do is click on simple bit.

01:20.780 --> 01:24.720
We have right now we have Newport's stumbling in the thing.

01:24.750 --> 01:29.810
We have only one page and that is simple pay someone to click on it and get a peek at the menu and this

01:29.840 --> 01:31.760
will be added to our menu.

01:31.760 --> 01:32.390
Here it is.

01:32.390 --> 01:38.160
Here comes one thing that is that you need to do here is select which menu it is.

01:38.180 --> 01:41.170
OK there are menus on this team.

01:41.180 --> 01:46.160
One is discarded but menu and this is the primary menu.

01:46.340 --> 01:51.530
The menu the button that appears here are primary and this is top menu.

01:51.680 --> 01:59.480
So when you select the menu menu we want added this page we want this page to primer Ouimet primary

01:59.720 --> 02:07.300
menu or Brumidi navigation Summerbee XXIV menu so it will be added here.

02:07.330 --> 02:08.120
But any fresh

02:11.610 --> 02:15.540
sea adding here simple page going can.

02:15.580 --> 02:19.530
This is the simple way that were created for us.

02:19.760 --> 02:20.760
OK.

02:22.050 --> 02:24.650
So this is how we create the menu.

02:24.720 --> 02:32.700
We can create more menu for them you want to create the you want to create a link to youtube or a link

02:32.700 --> 02:33.540
to Facebook.

02:33.540 --> 02:38.280
All you need to do is go to this custom links here.

02:38.340 --> 02:47.290
I'm going on right now Deborah to be with the Blue Dog Facebook and dot com so I'm going to see the

02:48.170 --> 02:51.140
book and add to the menu.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.670
See now I'm going to say the face book but will be here.

03:03.420 --> 03:08.460
It that when I click on it we will go to the Facebook see.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.700
I'm going to go back.

03:09.890 --> 03:17.050
So this is how we add buttons are links to other menus so we can add get a goodie.

03:17.090 --> 03:23.030
We really get a good deal in the next video and then we will add these to our menu.

03:23.120 --> 03:28.260
But right now and you can also add buttons to the Borst.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.240
So there is a pause.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.890
You weren't reading that linked to that post.

03:31.940 --> 03:33.330
So you can do that here.

03:33.440 --> 03:40.400
We have one boss that is Halvard disposed is by default HBO's Deadwood Presbrey it's OK when we set

03:40.400 --> 03:41.240
up our best.

03:41.240 --> 03:41.740
OK.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.370
So let's link this link to this post.

03:45.380 --> 03:45.740
OK.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.840
I'm going to click on it and I'm going to spit at the menu.

03:49.790 --> 03:58.580
This it eddied I'm going to save Benue in I do fish.

03:58.650 --> 04:03.590
This post is added.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.710
It can go to this post and there is a comment.

04:06.780 --> 04:10.290
This is the default comment that WordPress added.

04:10.390 --> 04:13.920
What best do some default things when we it creates are different.

04:14.080 --> 04:20.120
That is simple but it creates a different post that is available both clear to do for our command.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.180
That is this.

04:21.190 --> 04:21.810
OK.

04:21.820 --> 04:23.310
So we will delete all these.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.160
OK.

04:24.170 --> 04:26.300
So just do what I'm doing.

04:26.320 --> 04:26.810
OK.

04:26.830 --> 04:28.650
And we will clean all this up.

04:28.660 --> 04:29.080
OK.

04:29.110 --> 04:32.170
So don't worry we'll do everything again.

04:32.380 --> 04:39.800
So I hope you guys got the idea how we can add things to our menu when we will create categories we

04:39.800 --> 04:42.030
will add those categories here.

04:42.850 --> 04:49.340
So no one can get I'm going to do is I'm going to remove all these from our menu we don't need these.

04:49.360 --> 04:57.120
OK I just added to show you how we can add items to our menu of lead to these gluconate and every move.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.610
So it is removed.

04:58.640 --> 05:05.070
I'm going to move this to remove and when I remove this to remove.

05:05.340 --> 05:06.220

05:07.510 --> 05:12.050
So now I'm going to remove the D for commands pages and the board.

05:12.510 --> 05:14.380

See you

05:23.390 --> 05:27.420

05:27.420 --> 05:32.550
We're going to go to pages this is a simple page.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.450
I'm going to send it to Gresh

05:37.390 --> 05:42.170
and the trash can or open the trash and remove it permanently.

05:43.740 --> 05:44.830
OK.

05:45.300 --> 05:45.710
OK.

05:45.730 --> 05:46.280
Simple.

05:46.350 --> 05:47.480
It is gone.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.700
Don't we remove the simple Borst that Deadwood.

05:52.220 --> 05:53.030

05:59.570 --> 06:01.960
And I'm well removed permanently.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.150
We don't need this Borst.

06:05.410 --> 06:06.050
OK.

06:06.180 --> 06:07.260
And this is going to be deleted.

06:07.270 --> 06:08.880
Ok boss is gone.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.670
And simple pages go on.

06:10.750 --> 06:16.310
I would remove the symbolic comment that would be added automatically.

06:16.410 --> 06:20.110
Or is that a thing you do is remove already.

06:20.130 --> 06:20.740
OK.

06:20.770 --> 06:27.750
But if you see the command you can remove as I remove the pages and post.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.270
So I'm going to refresh and you will not see anything.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.730
See leting.

06:34.930 --> 06:37.800
Now we have complete and beb blog.

06:37.870 --> 06:38.730
OK.

06:38.740 --> 06:43.230
Or stumble fill it up with the content and I show you how to do that.

06:43.300 --> 06:48.300
And we will customize everything this side bar this menu.

06:48.310 --> 06:50.320
This is this breaking news.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.400
Everything is background and all that.

06:53.440 --> 06:54.410
OK.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.530
So I hope you guys know.

06:56.530 --> 06:59.990
Got the idea how we can add a menu in the next what do you have here.

07:00.030 --> 07:02.440
I will cover the cost of pages.

07:02.590 --> 07:08.400
Then I will add items to the menu and then you will get a better idea how to work with the menu.

07:08.500 --> 07:08.990
OK.

07:09.310 --> 07:10.940
