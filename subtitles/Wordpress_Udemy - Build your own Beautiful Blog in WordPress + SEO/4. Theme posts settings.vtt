00:00.360 --> 00:08.210
Hello guys in the studio we will work on pause settings both setting the settings to a pause.

00:08.320 --> 00:13.240
Father we call it this bit is the last page.

00:13.240 --> 00:13.660
OK.

00:13.690 --> 00:19.590
On the setting we will able to Jaydee settings like you can see we don't see the featured image here.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.150
OK.

00:20.260 --> 00:21.590
And this is not a good thing.

00:21.740 --> 00:27.850
All almost thirty nine percent blogs show the featured image or the detail page this is basically the

00:28.120 --> 00:29.020
page of The Post.

00:29.020 --> 00:29.820
OK.

00:29.920 --> 00:35.110
So we also want this widget image to appear on the detail page.

00:35.110 --> 00:35.400
OK.

00:35.410 --> 00:40.060
And we will need all the settings on both settings page.

00:40.200 --> 00:40.930
OK.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.590
So this is the settings.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.350
It's time to change the setting.

00:44.440 --> 00:50.560
First we have posted things but the first option we see here is show featured image by default.

00:50.580 --> 00:57.210
And you can see it just turn off early on and it will surely feature image on the detail page.

00:57.210 --> 00:58.160
That's what we want.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.030
So let's be efficient

01:02.020 --> 01:05.530
and see now we have featured image on this page.

01:05.530 --> 01:06.350
Amazing.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.980
So this is what we want.

01:08.020 --> 01:12.010
This is the caption read this because you can always change it when you upload the picture.

01:12.250 --> 01:12.800
OK.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.370
All right.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.000
So this is amazing.

01:16.120 --> 01:21.400
The next setting we have is the post otter box.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.280
This one this one right here.

01:24.290 --> 01:25.960
OK if you've got it or not.

01:25.990 --> 01:29.600
OK post author boss you can turn this off if you want.

01:29.610 --> 01:36.680
So I'm going to turn it off save changes fresh see.

01:36.690 --> 01:38.030
No it is gone.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.720
OK.

01:40.490 --> 01:40.940
All right.

01:40.940 --> 01:43.100
Let me see what other things move want.

01:43.100 --> 01:43.400
OK.

01:43.420 --> 01:44.560
The next is next.

01:44.560 --> 01:49.220
Preview articles you can see here we have previous article.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.430
We don't have any other next articles.

01:51.470 --> 01:53.170
We're not seeing any article.

01:53.180 --> 01:58.130
We have a previous article we can go to bailing on it so you can if you don't want to see this.

01:58.130 --> 02:01.390
You can turn this off but I recommend you to keep this on.

02:01.780 --> 02:02.230
OK.

02:02.390 --> 02:02.740
OK.

02:02.840 --> 02:06.920
Next is would you mind setting anything pollution indicators so I'd recommend you to keep these two

02:06.920 --> 02:07.890
settings as it is.

02:07.910 --> 02:08.270
OK.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.390
Don't bet them.

02:09.800 --> 02:10.140
OK.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.680
The next thing we have is about the matter.

02:12.680 --> 02:17.320
You guys know what matter is morays basically this is right here Arthur.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.150
I am groggery common views.

02:20.180 --> 02:21.990
These are the metals.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.950
So you can post later on of both.

02:26.030 --> 02:34.320
Basically this whole box this whole area if you were to disable this whole box this whole board rule

02:34.630 --> 02:36.120
just disable it.

02:36.150 --> 02:36.540
OK.

02:36.550 --> 02:43.550
So all of this will be gone but if I recommend you to keep this on and know you can then any feature

02:43.550 --> 02:48.160
you one on or off will give you a stack of comments on or off.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.210
You already know about these settings.

02:50.450 --> 02:50.740
OK.

02:50.750 --> 02:57.980
Next we have is sheer balls setting that you see here Facebook Twitter all these share icons.

02:57.980 --> 03:00.020
You can send this off if you want.

03:00.210 --> 03:01.050
OK.

03:01.710 --> 03:10.370
But you can see we have all a lot of other options here but I'd recommend you to keep this off because

03:11.090 --> 03:13.950
we will use an other plug in and we will.

03:14.010 --> 03:15.500
That is very amazing.

03:15.500 --> 03:19.890
A lot of other a lot of the blogs use that blogging.

03:19.910 --> 03:21.530
Again that product is amazing.

03:21.530 --> 03:27.600
And they're blogging tells us how many shares are on Facebook Twitter Google or all these.

03:27.620 --> 03:28.270
OK.

03:28.430 --> 03:31.460
And that is amazing.

03:31.970 --> 03:33.720
So let's turn this feature off

03:39.650 --> 03:49.610
it then both of these off if you want to have these on bottom and on the top then both of these on bottom

03:49.670 --> 03:57.900
and are but we don't want any We are just give both of these of Cubans or pages of like I said I have

03:57.900 --> 03:59.520
a whole view on this.

03:59.650 --> 04:02.670
Share OK and we'll cover everything about this year.

04:02.670 --> 04:11.150
So right now we're just in the setting of OK we don't need to do this on our own because we have just

04:11.150 --> 04:12.010
disabled it.

04:12.140 --> 04:12.720
OK.

04:14.540 --> 04:15.610
And these will be gone

04:21.990 --> 04:22.530
fish

04:25.710 --> 04:28.720
like you can see emeralds are going OK.

04:28.770 --> 04:37.040
The next thing we have is a little board settings post is basically the board that is in the same category.

04:37.410 --> 04:43.220
Right now we have only one pause in the health category that's why we are not seeing any deleted post.

04:43.230 --> 04:48.960
But when we have a lot that both literally has we will see that both between these content inside this

04:48.960 --> 04:51.240
content and that will not look good.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.920
We want the post to be sure on the bottom of this post.

04:54.930 --> 04:55.510
OK.

04:55.770 --> 04:58.830
So what can we do on the lady postering boss.

04:59.130 --> 04:59.850
Leave this on.

04:59.850 --> 05:04.560
OK Eric I want you to keep this on what we need in is disrelated postposition.

05:04.590 --> 05:09.880
We don't want it to be in the Boston area because it does not look good in there.

05:09.900 --> 05:13.270
Just give it blow the posterior and buckling area.

05:13.350 --> 05:17.400
We will have deep water below this post.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.460
OK.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.700
So keep this below the posterior.

05:20.820 --> 05:21.040
OK.

05:21.090 --> 05:25.780
How much do you want three or four or five whatever number you want.

05:25.780 --> 05:27.230
OK you can change it.

05:27.240 --> 05:27.640
OK.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.350
Next we have a number of or to show in full with you keep it for it.

05:31.360 --> 05:32.490
It looks good.

05:32.490 --> 05:33.280
OK.

05:33.630 --> 05:34.380
All right.

05:34.550 --> 05:41.580
Great job where you want to get the Post reports both in the same category or posting the same text

05:41.640 --> 05:43.830
or both by the same author.

05:44.180 --> 05:48.190
OK what kind of labels you are by same author or category or.

05:48.210 --> 05:53.960
But I recommend you to give the same category for the person is on this health board.

05:54.030 --> 05:57.390
Definitely want to see riposted letter to the health.

05:57.390 --> 06:03.380
You don't want the world you don't want to see the technology on the health page.

06:03.390 --> 06:03.660
OK.

06:03.670 --> 06:06.060
So keep it in the related category.

06:06.090 --> 06:06.830
OK.

06:07.140 --> 06:14.190
Next thing we have is flight check also box flight deck Alt-A box is when you scroll down the bottom

06:14.230 --> 06:21.200
you will see a box right here on this area that will see our little boys to get Edwin see see also.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.450
And there be a box here and we'll see when you will be on the bottom.

06:24.450 --> 06:25.360
OK.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.710
Then you will be on the bottom then there will be a box.

06:27.750 --> 06:33.300
That box is called the flight check box or get the flight check box and you can also join the queue

06:33.410 --> 06:36.590
to type seemed dosimeter.

06:36.690 --> 06:38.730
But like I said always keep safe.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.000
That is OK.

06:40.050 --> 06:42.220
Next thing we have is very common settings.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.430
Keep it off.

06:43.440 --> 06:43.960
OK.

06:44.010 --> 06:47.150
We don't want to create any settings and Inkerman settings.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.520
So we're done with the settings.

06:49.860 --> 06:52.050
There are very few settings left.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.320
OK.

06:53.410 --> 06:57.470
And cover the dust of the settings in the next video OK.

06:57.600 --> 07:03.840
We don't want to read all of the settings all of the important settings are almost convert to the our

07:03.840 --> 07:09.010
team so the rest of this area will be covered in the next what saying he was watching this video.

07:09.030 --> 07:10.480
