00:00.810 --> 00:02.330
Hello Guys welcome come to the studio.

00:02.340 --> 00:04.750
We're almost done with her blog.

00:04.970 --> 00:10.190
So it's time to work on some as we all so those you guys who are totally new.

00:10.190 --> 00:14.170
So let me tell you about what it is.

00:14.310 --> 00:23.250
SB stands for Search Engine Optimization and what it does it tells the search engines how good our website

00:23.330 --> 00:23.730
is.

00:23.760 --> 00:30.840
OK For example if we have a nice post and we have a great blog a lot of good content to be called Don't

00:30.840 --> 00:36.730
notably get content then it will be good in the eyes of the search engines like Google being disingenuous.

00:36.750 --> 00:42.740
So let me tell you some tips that what you can do for your boss to make them look better.

00:42.750 --> 00:43.290
OK.

00:43.590 --> 00:49.140
And I will also cover a lot of things related as in the upcoming videos.

00:49.200 --> 00:54.230
And in this video and some upcoming weddings are all about as equal.

00:54.330 --> 00:55.120
OK.

00:55.530 --> 01:01.060
So the first thing that you need to be careful about is duplicate content.

01:01.100 --> 01:09.460
OK never copy some someone else's blogs down and pasted on your blog because when you do it hit the

01:09.520 --> 01:10.130
deck.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.610
And it will be analyzed your blog.

01:12.630 --> 01:13.270
OK.

01:13.420 --> 01:17.630
Analyze me and it will completely remove your bra or it will not wreck your blog.

01:17.790 --> 01:21.780
So if you don't know what rank is rank is basically very very good.

01:21.780 --> 01:23.340
It appears in searches there.

01:23.370 --> 01:23.780
OK.

01:23.790 --> 01:24.900
That is the risk.

01:25.080 --> 01:31.110
If you or your attorney is getting in the first page that means your rag is good or get farther you

01:31.110 --> 01:31.920
are searching.

01:32.010 --> 01:38.060
This post does not really help us with this title and your post is on the first page.

01:38.060 --> 01:42.510
That means you're your let's say trag is great.

01:42.780 --> 01:51.570
So make sure you don't have any of the good content or copied content OK on your blog and don't ever

01:51.570 --> 01:53.780
copy someone else's garden.

01:53.910 --> 01:57.960
Always write your own content OK and it's fun.

01:58.560 --> 02:03.340
You have to put some effort and do a lot of hard work.

02:03.400 --> 02:03.680
OK.

02:03.690 --> 02:04.810
That's what it gets.

02:05.010 --> 02:05.580
OK.

02:05.750 --> 02:09.640
So now for the blog post.

02:09.820 --> 02:11.340
Don't write only text.

02:11.350 --> 02:11.940
OK.

02:12.020 --> 02:14.780
Add some good images if it is possible.

02:14.810 --> 02:15.800
Some videos in it.

02:15.810 --> 02:16.340
OK.

02:16.350 --> 02:22.920
Because Dad Dad you guys go on when there was only text in the posts and people like that.

02:23.200 --> 02:23.980
No.

02:24.180 --> 02:30.210
What happens now is people add some images and videos in their boss and that boss really go up.

02:30.210 --> 02:30.940
OK.

02:31.080 --> 02:36.330
So a search engine also like this when you have a little bit of a little pause there and very little

02:36.330 --> 02:37.440
content in them.

02:37.470 --> 02:43.340
And Google will not like it make a big board as some pictures and videos and it will be a great game

02:43.350 --> 02:45.630
going viral all over the internet.

02:45.650 --> 02:47.160
If you're really amazing.

02:47.210 --> 02:47.700
OK.

02:47.810 --> 02:53.310
So make sure you put some YOUR some of your effort and time to make a great blog post.

02:53.330 --> 02:59.450
Ok so first thing don't ever get someone's content.

02:59.480 --> 03:03.880
And second thing add some videos on your post.

03:03.890 --> 03:06.200
No I have not should do that.

03:06.210 --> 03:12.740
How you can add you you indeed to be able to do that how you can add YouTube videos to your post get

03:12.890 --> 03:19.130
not directly upload your blog always upload to your book because when you upload your to your blog there

03:19.470 --> 03:25.760
it will also make your server heavy and it will not look good.

03:25.770 --> 03:29.840
OK Alvez upload on YouTube and copied embed code.

03:29.910 --> 03:30.270
Your

03:32.940 --> 03:34.650
blog or your post.

03:34.650 --> 03:35.240
OK.

03:35.270 --> 03:41.460
Always update a video on YouTube or get what you need to do first for the video on this board that we

03:41.460 --> 03:42.330
just created.

03:42.450 --> 03:47.050

You want to go right here OK.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.190

04:49.190 --> 04:51.130
This is basically the call.

04:51.170 --> 04:51.590
OK.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.550
All of our posts are kept in context.

04:55.550 --> 04:59.540
Now go to the end of the real world where in the end you can add anywhere you want.

04:59.540 --> 05:00.970
OK here here.

05:00.980 --> 05:04.960
Anywhere you want but now I'm going to add at the end we get basic content.

05:04.970 --> 05:08.400
Here is the code that we just copied.

05:09.340 --> 05:10.440
Good with you.

05:10.740 --> 05:13.620
And see here is our video of when we update our post.

05:13.610 --> 05:15.940

05:16.510 --> 05:17.650
So no not it

05:23.920 --> 05:25.420
OK.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.540
The face thief What do you up yours.

05:33.540 --> 05:34.180
OK.

05:34.180 --> 05:35.750
Here is the video.

05:35.950 --> 05:36.480
OK.

05:36.580 --> 05:39.330
So that's how we add YouTube videos to our blog.

05:39.410 --> 05:48.510
Well get the main point that I want to tell you guys is use some videos use some pictures and writer

05:48.560 --> 05:54.630
and go and pick up big blog posts more than or greater than 500 words.

05:54.700 --> 05:55.560
OK.

05:55.630 --> 05:57.330
And make it look pretty amazing.

05:57.370 --> 05:58.230
OK.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.540
And do share with your friends.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.110
And one of the other important things.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.660
Add some back links to your blog.

06:05.800 --> 06:12.530
So what are the back things back links are basically then some other websites link to your blog for

06:12.540 --> 06:14.140
them like on Facebook.

06:14.140 --> 06:14.850
OK.

06:15.020 --> 06:23.610
You create a page on your Facebook to create your page on Facebook and write the name of your blog as

06:23.620 --> 06:27.280
ever your as your page name your reps are on your page and share your thoughts.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.130
When you write a post on your blog or cheerleader post on your Facebook.

06:31.210 --> 06:33.180
And same with twitter.

06:33.380 --> 06:39.070

06:41.200 --> 06:44.360
And ask your friend to share your thoughts.

06:44.380 --> 06:44.700
OK.

06:44.730 --> 06:48.880
That's the your of rank in Google and really be good for the s e or.

06:48.890 --> 06:54.880
But if you are having only two or three posts on your blog and move on the search engine to read your

06:55.000 --> 06:57.010
blog that's not going to happen buddy.

06:57.140 --> 06:59.510
What you need to do is feed your pla OK.

06:59.650 --> 07:00.040
Right.

07:00.060 --> 07:04.120
Boston more than 30 or 40 or more than 50.

07:04.120 --> 07:09.370
Then Google reconsider consider your ruptured either drag or NORDO get right and just keep on writing

07:09.370 --> 07:11.550
the content for one or two months.

07:11.550 --> 07:13.760
OK then you will see the results in the search engine.

07:13.930 --> 07:17.690
Don't copy the content rather than images.

07:17.890 --> 07:21.370
If there is no video there is an overlay to the post.

07:21.370 --> 07:22.250
It's not.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.740
It's not imposed on you that you have to a video game.

07:25.890 --> 07:28.070
If possible you can add a new yorker.
