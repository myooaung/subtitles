02:28.300 --> 02:33.960
Nobla with these boxes is a thing that we have not said anything about this.

02:33.990 --> 02:35.930
You would go into all everything.

02:35.950 --> 02:36.530
OK.

02:36.820 --> 02:37.580

This is the general we're going to do the you're in for TAB OK.

02:55.130 --> 02:55.670
OK.

02:55.680 --> 02:58.810
Here is the information about our website.

02:58.840 --> 03:05.230
It is the name you remember what we do the name part of it we wrote how it is for the example.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.590
So same thing I'm going to write.

03:08.110 --> 03:09.930
And here is the native name.

03:09.930 --> 03:14.100
What is the name about your website.

03:14.100 --> 03:14.980
What could be the Internet.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.720
Maybe you can think of if there is an name.

03:18.030 --> 03:23.380
Where is the company what kind of company is it a company or a person's blog.

03:23.400 --> 03:23.960

03:24.090 --> 03:26.310
So choose whatever you choose.

03:26.430 --> 03:30.640
Ok for that your blog is working for the company and you can choose the company.

03:30.750 --> 03:38.580
And if it is your personal blog and you're writing the information about just about yourself or about

03:38.580 --> 03:43.320
your personality you can understand what I'm saying OK you can do whatever you want here but I'm going

03:43.320 --> 03:46.500
to use here.

03:46.590 --> 03:49.460
You can write the code name.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.280
You can write to the company.

03:51.340 --> 03:53.130
Upload a company logo.

03:53.530 --> 03:54.030
OK.

03:54.120 --> 03:58.200
So it will tell Google that this is the company's blog or your company's website.

03:58.200 --> 03:58.840
OK.

03:58.950 --> 04:02.280
So fill these two information if this is the company OK.

04:02.430 --> 04:06.990
The next thing is Mr. Dalwood we're not going to do anything about this right now.

04:06.990 --> 04:07.690
OK.

04:07.950 --> 04:11.350
And security again we are done with the general setting.

04:11.370 --> 04:17.310
It's time to work on the most important thing that we're going to do in displaying and that is titles

04:17.400 --> 04:18.470
and metals.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.810
This is the most important thing.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.420
OK.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.810
OK.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.380
Here it is.

04:25.460 --> 04:31.590
No Google you have seen you must have seen that there is when we say something there's a time and there

04:31.590 --> 04:34.700
is a creator and then the name of the website.

04:34.710 --> 04:35.790
This is the separator.

04:35.790 --> 04:36.370
OK.

04:36.420 --> 04:37.320
These are just opinions.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.620
Let me show you what it is.

04:38.740 --> 04:42.550
Fordable we are going to search about for Facebook.

04:42.620 --> 04:46.930
We're going to touch Facebook on google and see what it appears.

04:46.980 --> 04:47.610
Here it is.

04:47.630 --> 04:50.570
This is the separator game the name of the Facebook.

04:50.580 --> 04:59.780
And then there is the article you can see and here in the center there is a separate and similar here.

04:59.970 --> 05:04.710
This is a separator you can see and this is a a hyphen.

05:04.710 --> 05:06.000
This is a printer.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.340
This is this one.

05:07.350 --> 05:10.860
These are pictures do you use totally unique spiritlessly.

05:10.900 --> 05:11.770
Awesome.

05:12.470 --> 05:13.000
OK.

05:13.070 --> 05:15.550
The Disappeared results are available that today is using.

05:15.750 --> 05:16.750
OK.

05:17.340 --> 05:18.380
So these are his supporters.

05:18.420 --> 05:20.850
But I recommend you to keep the first one.

05:20.880 --> 05:21.480
OK.

05:21.540 --> 05:22.770
What are you going to use whatever you want.

05:22.770 --> 05:23.460
It's not.

05:23.460 --> 05:25.720
It doesn't hurt the ear.

05:25.740 --> 05:26.780
OK.

05:26.850 --> 05:28.590
You can choose any way you want.

05:28.800 --> 05:29.140
OK.

05:29.160 --> 05:37.320
The next thing we're going to do good sitting as it is now because her home home page and here is the

05:37.320 --> 05:39.330
important part.

05:39.330 --> 05:46.340
This is the dietary template of our website that how our rights really appear in the search engine how

05:46.350 --> 05:49.510
about our ups appear there will be the site name.

05:49.510 --> 05:55.900
So let me get a body and show you how it will work for us.

05:56.010 --> 06:00.430
For example first is this site name our site appear at.

06:00.580 --> 06:05.030
At first you can see a difference and it's starting off the data.

06:05.080 --> 06:05.690
OK.

06:06.090 --> 06:07.680
You can see the same thing here.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.840
This is the title.

06:08.840 --> 06:09.250
OK.

06:09.300 --> 06:09.870
Facebook.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.530
Facebook is basically the title of this Facebook website.

06:12.900 --> 06:16.000
And this is does and what will be ours will be helped.

06:16.030 --> 06:16.730
OK.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.430
And then what will be what will be there.

06:19.430 --> 06:20.560
There is the page name.

06:20.580 --> 06:21.120
OK.

06:21.330 --> 06:24.030
And I want you to remove this page name.

06:24.120 --> 06:29.850
This is basically if it will it will show the pages of our website.

06:29.870 --> 06:30.770
We have ANY page.

06:30.780 --> 06:31.230
OK.

06:31.380 --> 06:34.230
But I recommend you remove this again.

06:34.320 --> 06:37.470
Then we will have our separate.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.660
OK.

06:38.970 --> 06:40.050
Wait a second.

06:40.410 --> 06:41.310
OK.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.150
OK.

06:42.180 --> 06:46.410
Then we had other then we will have our separate just like this.

06:46.410 --> 06:49.100
First we will get held just like Facebook.

06:49.200 --> 06:56.130
Then we will get a separator as SBP means the preacher then we get to disputer and then we will get

06:56.130 --> 06:57.300
the site description.

06:57.320 --> 06:57.700
OK.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.930
So description this is the site description for the Facebook app.

07:01.950 --> 07:08.220
This is not actually the description Facebook crowd is on intentionally but for us there will be the

07:08.220 --> 07:14.720
site description but it will be description description for our health website that this could be welcome

07:14.730 --> 07:20.520
to our website or it could be let me see what else we have faced let live.

07:20.520 --> 07:24.560
This is a description not accurate description that you see in here.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.900
It is a drug that in this description is Biscardi.

07:27.900 --> 07:36.510
The title of you can say at the absurd our blog just like does Wikipedia define nobody.

07:36.530 --> 07:37.480
This is the description.

07:37.510 --> 07:38.020
OK.

07:38.180 --> 07:40.700
We're talking about distribution not description.

07:40.700 --> 07:41.750
OK.

07:41.830 --> 07:42.680
OK.

07:42.770 --> 07:43.940
Then we will see the description.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.180
So this is no better description template.

07:47.180 --> 07:50.080
This is a general description that we see here.

07:50.120 --> 07:55.310
This one this is the description and this is very important.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.230
This description OK and this one these are the gentleman description.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.730
These are very important.

08:01.790 --> 08:02.090
Right.

08:02.090 --> 08:08.830
What you're upset about is about right of between 50 to 100.

08:08.870 --> 08:09.500
OK.

08:09.500 --> 08:14.590
And make sure it is very awesome and people like it.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.300
OK.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.550
So this is that.

08:16.610 --> 08:22.970
Now let's talk about the boss types here we done with the general and her body both types.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.260
How are both biggies and all other things appear.
