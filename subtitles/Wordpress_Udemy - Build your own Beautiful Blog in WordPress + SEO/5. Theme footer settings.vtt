Relegates them to this video and this video we will work on some of the settings.

00:04.800 --> 00:12.510
Sometimes when you change settings what happens there are the settings to the original altering the

00:12.510 --> 00:19.220
original like slogan will be removed and the follower will come here all the settings will be reset.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.980
But very rare happened this really does happen very rare.

00:23.130 --> 00:32.260
So don't worry but most importantly when you just bought settings there sometime happens that all the

00:32.400 --> 00:34.870
reset but not every time this happens again.

00:35.220 --> 00:39.450
So now you guys know that Holbert unionise having had the settings that are sitting and for sending

00:40.050 --> 00:42.590
those time to work on some other settings.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.180
So let me see.

00:44.310 --> 00:44.560
OK.

00:44.580 --> 00:47.100
We are well over on this side bar.

00:47.100 --> 00:47.910
OK.

00:48.540 --> 00:52.640
Because sidebars there's not a lot of sidebar settings on here.

00:52.740 --> 00:58.980
Well Jane said bartering is by going to the appearance and widgets OK because on the sidebar we have

00:58.980 --> 01:01.720
widgets recent boards recent commands.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.060
These are all DVDs.

01:03.270 --> 01:09.570
So these what you're setting or not here in this sidebar so we won't change it from the sidebar or who

01:09.570 --> 01:10.730
will change it later.

01:10.860 --> 01:13.770
So let's go to a different setting.

01:13.800 --> 01:20.570
I have a whole video on the sidebar OK where I will cover only the side bar and will make the site more

01:20.580 --> 01:21.110
awesome.

01:21.140 --> 01:22.210
OK.

01:22.730 --> 01:25.190
So we are going to work here on the side.

01:25.190 --> 01:26.010
OK.

01:26.310 --> 01:27.720
So let's go to the footer.

01:28.750 --> 01:29.690
OK.

01:29.880 --> 01:35.880
Now you see when we scroll down we have this button right here and we can change this button to disable

01:35.950 --> 01:36.590
if you want.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.610
OK.

01:38.100 --> 01:38.740
OK.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.000
No.

01:40.140 --> 01:40.890
You can't see.

01:40.890 --> 01:42.480
So should I call you also in there.

01:42.540 --> 01:46.440
But right now we have nothing on our footer that's why we see nothing here.

01:46.470 --> 01:47.380
OK.

01:47.790 --> 01:48.380
OK.

01:48.390 --> 01:51.570
Now there is a lay out for our footer.

01:51.720 --> 02:00.980
How many We just do you want your footer two are three are four are you continuously or zero declared

02:00.990 --> 02:01.800
whatever you want.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.070
OK.

02:02.070 --> 02:04.900
But right now we have no more than 20 footers.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.110
So it does not shown up.

02:07.110 --> 02:07.850
OK.

02:08.370 --> 02:09.390
So what does we have.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.710
We have the text.

02:10.710 --> 02:16.240
This text and this text you continue to do one scene is powered by.

02:16.270 --> 02:21.110
OK this part I'm going to remove this part by and I'm going to see

02:23.530 --> 02:31.830
created by one gives you a nice and lets you fish

02:35.430 --> 02:40.220
and see X is change you cannot remove this if you want from here.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.080
OK.

02:41.690 --> 02:44.090
So this is at two different settings.

02:44.110 --> 02:53.360
So Rachel what can you do in the next movie you will work on the sidebar or sidebar again the next Wholefoods

02:53.410 --> 02:55.880
you is about the sidebar.

02:55.980 --> 02:59.020
OK and then we'll go to the digits to work on it.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.710
