Hello and welcome to this you know you guys know how to write a best as oboist now in this video we're

00:06.420 --> 00:12.540
going to talk about something very important card per Mullings what permalink is permalink is basically

00:12.540 --> 00:18.600
the link to link to our website or link to the book was funny but if I click on this the board that

00:18.600 --> 00:25.480
we just thought in the previous video you can see we have this.

00:25.680 --> 00:29.340
This is basically the permalink of this post.

00:29.340 --> 00:29.910
OK.

00:29.910 --> 00:34.600
So we're going to optimize this Mullings but Mullings that are a very important part of our website.

00:34.620 --> 00:35.200
OK.

00:35.220 --> 00:37.410
So let's add these Mullings

00:40.480 --> 00:46.900
OK to set the settings for these permalink what you need to do is go to the settings.

00:46.900 --> 00:49.010
Click on this permalink OK.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.100
OK.

00:52.110 --> 00:56.490
Now you can see we have a lot of options for Mullings.

00:56.720 --> 00:57.480
OK.

00:57.480 --> 01:00.080
The first option is the ID.

01:00.090 --> 01:07.660
This is a very bad one and search engines don't like it because in this we have this question and the

01:07.680 --> 01:12.520
equal sign and the knee and the number of the board or the ID of the board.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.500
And there is no better for this board.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.620
This should be a doddle in the titlebar like we see here.

01:17.630 --> 01:19.370
Click on this post.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.360
We have this title right here.

01:21.360 --> 01:21.830
OK.

01:21.940 --> 01:29.430
What does this bumbling get we see now is pretty much good for press but for such engine sorry for you

01:29.610 --> 01:31.110
but we're going to optimize this one.

01:31.240 --> 01:31.880
OK.

01:32.110 --> 01:34.060
Let me show you how.

01:34.770 --> 01:34.980
OK.

01:34.990 --> 01:37.530
The second one is the D and name.

01:37.530 --> 01:43.900
What we will what will happen it will show the date and then it will show the post name post title.

01:43.920 --> 01:44.580
OK.

01:44.880 --> 01:52.340
And the third one that is the default that is the current one we have that is Diest and that is this.

01:52.560 --> 02:01.650
You can see the year to year the date when it was posted and then post name in the above one we had

02:01.650 --> 02:02.430
the day.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.120
OK.

02:03.420 --> 02:05.420
In this one we don't have the day OK.

02:05.480 --> 02:08.990
And you can see here we don't have the data again.

02:09.870 --> 02:19.840
And now the other one is numeric but this numeric is metric is basically about the.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.600
It goes to the archives that we have for the archive.

02:23.640 --> 02:28.480
Our technology archive archive we have all the show the archive.

02:28.620 --> 02:34.500
And then to be sure the post ID and it will also not look good again because we want the title of the

02:34.500 --> 02:35.090
board.

02:35.340 --> 02:36.470
So don't use it.

02:36.540 --> 02:44.250
And what we have is the last name and this is the best one that we're going to have and that is our

02:44.250 --> 02:45.280
website.

02:45.410 --> 02:51.900
The name of our website for the liberty to regard Facebook dot com or Twitter not come just for example.

02:51.910 --> 02:59.190
OK so it will be here and then forward slash and then the name of our post so click on this and

03:02.580 --> 03:05.820
this one we've got OK for fordable you've won.

03:06.070 --> 03:11.780
You want some custom custom length custom of your choice.

03:11.780 --> 03:17.010
You can always add them all in care what you need to do is just put a forward slash and you can use

03:17.010 --> 03:18.110
for them.

03:18.570 --> 03:23.370
Before this last name you want to appear archive what you need to do is put forward slash.

03:23.380 --> 03:26.820
Then this marvelous line and then right or.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.280
Just like this archives.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.740
And then you've decided and it is.

03:31.740 --> 03:36.150
And then what will happen if we show the archive and then forward flesh and that both names but don't

03:36.150 --> 03:36.830
use them.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.740
Always use disport name again.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.270
This one is amazing.

03:40.290 --> 03:42.240
So it changes.

03:42.870 --> 03:49.260
And now you're going to see that there will not be this 2015 or 11 what we're going to have we will

03:49.260 --> 03:53.780
have to press forward slash and then the title of our post.

03:53.970 --> 04:00.270
So I'm going to go to the home page and now I'm going to go to this post again.

04:00.500 --> 04:08.670
See there is no return 15 or date or whatever is only the title of our page just like Facebook.

04:08.670 --> 04:17.490
When we go to Facebook Facebook dot com forward slash for our idea we have a name for dot dot com forward.

04:17.740 --> 04:18.270
OK.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.390
I'm just going to use them.

04:19.560 --> 04:25.710
That's not my actual idea I'm just giving you the example that that is the thing that is the best for

04:25.710 --> 04:26.510
the SC.

04:26.570 --> 04:27.830
OK.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.950
Make sure you have that one.

04:30.150 --> 04:32.570
So click on this post name changes.

04:32.770 --> 04:33.110
OK.

04:33.150 --> 04:34.820
So that is the permalink.

04:34.820 --> 04:39.270
Make sure you upgrade your permalink from default to this post name.

04:39.270 --> 04:40.860
So you've got to watch this video.

04:40.860 --> 04:42.290
This was about Mullings.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.570
I will show you the next video.
