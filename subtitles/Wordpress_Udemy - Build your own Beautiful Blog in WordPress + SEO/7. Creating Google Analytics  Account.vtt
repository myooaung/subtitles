06:43.750 --> 06:47.080
Right now we have zero visitors on the website.

06:47.090 --> 06:48.120
OK.

06:48.700 --> 06:56.110
But when we come it will go up and we show that which base they are on what location they have what

06:56.470 --> 06:57.100

06:57.100 --> 06:58.810
What is social graph.

06:59.020 --> 07:04.460
But it is not in detail it is not standard but for the data you need to go to the order against anti-pot

07:04.510 --> 07:11.920
