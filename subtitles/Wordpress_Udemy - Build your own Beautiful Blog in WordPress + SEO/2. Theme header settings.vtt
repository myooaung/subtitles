00:00.500 --> 00:06.250
Help guys welcome to this city you're in this video will start working on other settings to settings

00:06.340 --> 00:09.880
is the most important setting of any blog or any website.

00:09.880 --> 00:10.630
OK.

00:10.990 --> 00:16.450
So in the head of settings we have a lot of settings and all of that we need.

00:16.490 --> 00:21.520
Ok there are important settings settings that we will be needing in future.

00:21.670 --> 00:25.840
Not all those settings will get the first setting which is about the logo.

00:25.840 --> 00:32.600
The important setting in logos are things we have to option custom image logo and display site data.

00:32.650 --> 00:37.720
If you remember when we set up over as we entered the site title as hell.

00:37.840 --> 00:43.210
So if you want that data to appear all you need to do is click on display site title and see if.

00:43.480 --> 00:49.300
If you don't want your logo if you want just title then this blizzard has been a tendency of genius

00:49.360 --> 00:59.050
and refresh and see we will have to see help and this is the slogan mythically read or when we set up

00:59.050 --> 01:00.150
the database.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.600
Instead of the word Press.

01:01.810 --> 01:03.970
OK but we don't want it.

01:03.970 --> 01:07.440
We don't want decide that we want her logo to be here.

01:07.570 --> 01:14.280
To do that can custom image logo and here upload your logo files.

01:14.340 --> 01:17.360
I have a logo that ideas I have.

01:17.350 --> 01:22.020
Next up I will use their logo.

01:22.330 --> 01:24.940
Hatred is no different.

01:24.940 --> 01:26.180
Let me see this one.

01:26.370 --> 01:31.070
Ok I am going to use this open select.

01:31.370 --> 01:34.030
OK this is the level of safety in use.

01:34.610 --> 01:37.840
OK the recommended size is this 180 pixels.

01:37.840 --> 01:44.260
Is it 60 pixels height when your logo is in this dimension your logo would be perfect for this team

01:44.260 --> 01:44.880
OK.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.830
Make sure it is in this dimension.

01:46.940 --> 01:47.760
Great here.

01:47.830 --> 01:54.040
I photoshopped it and make it with this Dominican-American like this dimension of Janey's refresh and

01:54.040 --> 01:55.990
see we will have our logo on here.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.560
See now we have our logo like no you can see we have a lot of space above this logo and a lot of space

02:02.560 --> 02:03.760
below this logo.

02:03.760 --> 02:07.960
We can change the space so that it may show you where we can change space.

02:07.960 --> 02:15.300
Here we have 50 pixels than from top and 15 from bottom so we can get you to zero.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.800
Zero lozenges.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.320
Now we will not have a lot of space.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.490
There will be space but not a lot of space.

02:23.520 --> 02:29.270
OK so let's see that we don't have a lot of space above and below.

02:29.480 --> 02:37.310
OK so for example if you if you want the space to be removed do you don't want this space.

02:37.520 --> 02:50.050
Right here to continue to do negative Virginius to ninety five and here negative 5 and see more a space

02:50.050 --> 02:52.460
would be used from top and bottom.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.990
More space will be removed.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.630
See now we have 5 more from 5 people 5 picks and more is reduced from up and 5 bucks and more is to

03:01.720 --> 03:04.050
from bottom so you can do it in the negative.

03:04.180 --> 03:13.130
But I would recommend you to make it zero because that's the good idea to keep it OK.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.250
So now we have the best settings for logo.

03:17.650 --> 03:20.210
OK the next thing is full logo.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.540
We don't want it don't turn it off just keep it right.

03:22.540 --> 03:28.910
With God when you turn on it and you have a big logo that logo will cover a lot of space and your blog

03:28.910 --> 03:32.560
will look toward you will not look good.

03:32.570 --> 03:33.170
OK.

03:33.260 --> 03:34.620
Keep it as it is.

03:34.700 --> 03:39.530
So the next setting is send to the logo if you want your logo to be in the center.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.670
You can turn it on but nobody wants the logo in the center.

03:42.680 --> 03:50.070
But if you can turn this on again the next text the next setting that we have is header top area setting

03:50.490 --> 03:52.400
it up is this.

03:52.850 --> 03:59.580
This right here this area OK this gray area you see contact us about us on this area is dopehead.

03:59.990 --> 04:04.610
If you want to have this stop area keep it in MBRD.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.920
But if you don't want that make a thimble.

04:06.960 --> 04:07.450
OK.

04:07.700 --> 04:11.780
Now you can see we can also have today's date here if you want.

04:11.780 --> 04:12.370
OK.

04:12.620 --> 04:18.810
If you want to date on this bar up bar use this feature on today's date.

04:18.830 --> 04:23.460
So let me refresh it and you will see todays date on the left side.

04:23.510 --> 04:26.530
Let me refresh it and see.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.780
No we have grid is dead on the left side.

04:29.030 --> 04:32.680
OK if you want it I always keep it as good it looks good in here.

04:32.680 --> 04:40.920
OK but as change these settings or format of the date but the hazard is very good to keep it as it is.

04:40.940 --> 04:41.320
OK.

04:41.400 --> 04:48.370
So you can see we have search here if you want to disable it disable it from here live search search

04:48.440 --> 04:55.890
live search is basically the basically the drub drub don't search when you type something and there

04:55.900 --> 04:56.540
is a drop down.

04:56.540 --> 04:58.250
This is basically the third seat.

04:58.350 --> 05:04.500
This is the lifesavers if you want it you pretty neighbor so she'll go on if you want here.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.830
Put in neighbored not right.

05:06.820 --> 05:07.990
No we have one.

05:08.110 --> 05:08.640
OK.

05:08.890 --> 05:12.130
So I covered it lot in depth in the upcoming video.

05:12.140 --> 05:12.440
OK.

05:12.440 --> 05:19.380
So we will have best selling of our fashion icons and I can assure you that how we can create it.

05:19.390 --> 05:20.420
We will use them again.

05:20.470 --> 05:24.390
And almost 90 percent of bloggers use that plugins.

05:24.400 --> 05:24.690
OK.

05:24.700 --> 05:28.420
And I would go with that in-depth to very the next second.

05:28.410 --> 05:29.140
Settings we have.

05:29.140 --> 05:31.210
Is main navigation setting main navigation.

05:31.210 --> 05:32.080
Is this right here.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.900
This is Garmin navigation.

05:34.360 --> 05:40.150
So if you want to this off you don't want me navigation don't just make it easier but nobody wanted

05:40.150 --> 05:40.760
this.

05:40.810 --> 05:45.490
No we have another button here which is random articles when you click on it you would see a random

05:45.490 --> 05:46.940
article from our blog.

05:47.110 --> 05:47.700
OK.

05:47.710 --> 05:52.700
So if you don't want it disable it or get know you can see the navigation menu.

05:52.700 --> 05:58.620
This navigation menu sticks when we scroll down and when we go up it stays stuck.

05:58.630 --> 06:00.840
So let me show you now.

06:01.030 --> 06:09.080
I'm going to move up and that body would be stick see this board is.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.310
So this is God's stick.

06:10.350 --> 06:10.660
OK.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.460
So you can bend it off if you want.

06:14.130 --> 06:20.110
So if you want the your logo to also be in this bar you can upload from here.

06:20.130 --> 06:20.500
OK.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.910
But I will not recommend you because nobody does that.

06:23.910 --> 06:29.310
But if you can always upload it and you can't use the file with it we just upload.

06:29.320 --> 06:29.840
OK.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.900
All right the next thing is responsive settings.

06:33.990 --> 06:40.530
Keep it as it is because of a blog is already in response so keep it as it is.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.980
The next thing is breaking news that you can see here.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.290
I always turn this off.

06:45.290 --> 06:46.180
It doesn't look good.

06:46.190 --> 06:46.510
OK.

06:46.510 --> 06:47.570
You always turn this off.

06:47.570 --> 06:49.460
But you can keep it if you want.

06:49.470 --> 06:57.290
So this off breaking news going to disable it and see if Janey's fresh No it will be gone.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.020
It is gone.

06:59.030 --> 07:03.640
You can also change the settings in the breaking news for example when we do have breaking news.

07:03.710 --> 07:07.290
You can change any mission effect you can select to get a good read.

07:07.310 --> 07:13.320
The breaking news should be coming whether you want to read from bags or you can add custom decks.

07:13.340 --> 07:17.220
This book is all about the breaking news but we have disable it.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.640
We don't need to mess with this.

07:18.680 --> 07:19.360
OK.

07:19.610 --> 07:23.650
So I hope you guys know understand how we can tune our head intercepting how we can.

07:23.660 --> 07:30.350
Jane Jane this bar setting search and this one right here to tell you as we're watching this video in

07:30.350 --> 07:33.430
