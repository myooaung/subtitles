00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.090
- Part of being a good developer

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.010
is understanding what you need to learn

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.060
and what you need to stay up to date on.

4
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.020
So I want to talk about how this course will prepare you

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.030
for the day-to-day operations as a developer.

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.000
Please keep in mind that this course will not make you

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.050
all knowledgeable about writing secure code.

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.000
This course is aimed at giving you the information

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.060
and support that you need to write more secure code.

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.010
In fact, this is one of my primary goals for you.

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.050
There is no way to say you are a secure developer.

12
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.090
What I want you to take away is the ability

13
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.070
to be called a security-minded developer.

14
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.070
Another goal is to prepare you

15
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.060
to be the champion for security practices on your team.

16
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.010
What I've found in both

17
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.010
my personal experiences around security

18
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.050
and through discussions with others

19
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.040
is that for a team to really embrace any

20
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.010
sort of culture of security, you need a champion.

21
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.050
Now, this champion can come from anywhere in the team.

22
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.090
But in my opinion, the single most effective place

23
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.030
for a champion is within the ranks of development.

24
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.050
Right or wrong, developers tend

25
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.010
to listen to other developers more

26
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.020
than anyone else on the team.

27
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.090
In addition, forcing culture on a team seldom works.

28
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.000
This is why I believe the developer

29
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.060
is the single most effective person on the team.

30
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.000
They are listened to and they can be

31
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the grassroots driver of change.

32
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.050
The third goal that I have

33
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.040
is that you become a more effective reviewer.

34
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.080
This may sound strange at first,

35
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.030
but if you work on a development team,

36
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.070
you can only write a portion of the code on your team.

37
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.020
So while you may be great

38
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.000
at writing code that is more secure,

39
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.050
your personal impact in the overall code base

40
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.060
is smaller than that of the whole team.

41
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.050
In most teams, several developers are part

42
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.070
of the code review or pull request.

43
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.080
So your impact can be dramatically increased

44
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.020
by simply being engaged in code reviews

45
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.090
from a security perspective.

46
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.000
Now, if you're not a developer,

47
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.030
you may wonder what value this course can have for you.

48
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.060
If you are a development manager,

49
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.080
you need to understand what your team is doing,

50
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.010
what your team is spending time on,

51
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.060
and what risks they are trying to resolve.

52
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.070
If you're a project manager or a scrum leader,

53
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.000
you also need to know why a development task may take longer

54
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.070
because of the security concerns.

55
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.010
And if you are a quality assurance or quality

56
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.040
control person for a team,

57
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.030
you can leverage this knowledge of exploits

58
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.050
and attack vectors to write more effective tests.

59
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.000
And that's the ultimate challenge,

60
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.010
realizing that security has a place for everyone

61
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.000
on the development team and embracing it.
