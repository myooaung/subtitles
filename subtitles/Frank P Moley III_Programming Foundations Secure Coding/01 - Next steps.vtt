00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.030
- Throughout this course

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.000
we have looked at several different

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.090
yet important aspects of secure coding

4
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.040
and culture, so let's review.

5
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.020
We spent some time talking about

6
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.020
what secure coding is all about

7
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.030
and why it is important.

8
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.020
We talked about our goals.

9
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.070
We talked about the attacker persona.

10
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.080
We talked about how to focus on breaking

11
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.000
and not just building.

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.030
And we talked a lot about risks and documentation.

13
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.060
This foundation led us into a discussion of vulnerabilities.

14
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.060
We spent a significant portion of this course

15
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.090
going through a lot of the most common defects

16
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.010
that routinely appear as security issues.

17
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.030
We talked about what they were,

18
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.020
how they manifest themselves,

19
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.040
and some basic strategies to mitigate them.

20
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.060
Each of these classes was unique

21
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.000
but shared enough similarities

22
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.070
to develop patterns of mitigation.

23
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.060
We then talked a little bit about building a culture

24
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.040
of security within various areas

25
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.040
of the SDLC.

26
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.030
While this course wasn't about culture,

27
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.000
it really is an important part

28
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
of secure coding as a whole,

29
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.060
and I highly encourage you to spend time

30
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.030
on developing a culture of security

31
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.070
within your organization.

32
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.050
Because of the vastness of this topic,

33
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.010
I hope that I gave you enough of a taste

34
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.090
of secure coding for you to dig in a little deeper.

35
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.090
It is a wide and deep focus area

36
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.080
but one that an experienced developer

37
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.070
can find rewarding as well as lucrative.

38
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
I hope you have found value in this foundation.

39
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.030
I want to thank you for your time in this course.

40
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.010
It means a lot to me to have spent this time with you

41
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.000
even virtually.

42
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.040
My commitment does not end when this course is over.

43
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.040
I respond to requests on Twitter and Stack Overflow

44
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.040
on all of my content here

45
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.040
or any other public platform where I present on.

46
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.050
I love learning and sharing knowledge,

47
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.000
so please reach out to me with questions or ideas.
