00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.040
- As we begin talking about culture changes

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.090
around secure coding,

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.020
I think it is only fitting to talk first

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.000
about the point where most developers

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.070
begin their engagement,

6
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.010
and that is the design.

7
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.060
Design is a great place to start looking at ways

8
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.000
to make your application more secure for various reasons,

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.090
but I want to focus on some strategies

10
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.010
for how to take security into account during design.

11
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.010
I like to start all of my design activities

12
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.000
by looking at the system design.

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.070
Whether it's a complete system in waterfall

14
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.040
or a simple feature in Scrum,

15
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.030
the system itself is key.

16
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.060
By looking at what you are building,

17
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.050
you can start looking at ways to destroy it,

18
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.040
and that is in my opinion

19
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.040
one of the greatest assets for a secure developer.

20
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.050
I feel very strongly that developers struggle with security

21
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.070
because they are trying to build,

22
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.050
not tear down.

23
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.040
Good security people learn how to tear down systems.

24
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.000
They learn how to exploit features to attack the system.

25
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.020
This is what you should aim for in design.

26
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.030
Look at your system

27
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.080
or even your feature with a critical eye.

28
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.080
Identify the weakest points in your design

29
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.040
from a security perspective.

30
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.020
Armed with the knowledge that we've just looked at,

31
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.080
do you run the risk of injection attacks

32
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.090
or memory attacks?

33
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.040
Do you leverage a database

34
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.080
and therefore have to work around database issues?

35
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.000
The list goes on and on.

36
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.060
But the point is you are creating an inventory of risks.

37
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.060
These observations on your design

38
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.090
can then be used during development and testing

39
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.090
to ensure you are putting appropriate controls in place.

40
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.080
Sometimes it is an active control.

41
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.090
Sometimes it may be passive.

42
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.060
Sometimes they may be compensating controls

43
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.070
and sometimes you may determine the risk is too great

44
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.030
and you simply remove the feature completely.

45
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.020
The point is you have collected the information,

46
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.080
made observations,

47
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.020
and started the conversation with security

48
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.080
early in the development process,

49
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.000
and that is one critical component of a culture of security.
