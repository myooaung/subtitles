00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.050
- The mind of an attacker

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:07.020
or bad actor is foreign to many software developers.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.010
We spent our lives building things

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.030
that we hope makes the world a better price.

5
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.040
I know that is kind of cliche,

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.090
but the reality is most of us really want to write code

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.090
that improves our business or engages our passion.

8
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.010
As such, we are builders and makers.

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.050
An attacker, however, has a very different mindset.

10
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.040
They want to tear down what you have built.

11
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.010
Now, their motivations can be all over the place,

12
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.000
and while it is important to understand these motivations,

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.040
the simple fact that they want to tear down what we build

14
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.010
is very hard for many developers to grasp.

15
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.050
So part of writing secure code

16
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.080
is understanding the mindset of the attacker.

17
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.090
The first component is looking

18
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.030
at why they want to break your code.

19
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.050
Now, the reasons can be as many as the stars in the sky,

20
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.070
but each attacker has a reason.

21
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.000
Most attacks we hear about seem to be financial in purpose,

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.090
but attacks happen for other reasons,

23
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.030
things like political motivations,

24
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.010
revenge, or building credit

25
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.030
with other bad actors, to name a few.

26
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.020
I have seen attacks happen

27
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.060
because people want to build

28
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.010
a reputation as a security tester.

29
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.080
While I'm not a fan of this type of extortion,

30
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.080
it currently is a reason why people are attacking systems.

31
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.070
Now, regardless of the why,

32
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.060
it's very beneficial to figure out

33
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.050
all of the possible attack reasons.

34
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.090
This why is critical because once you know why

35
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.090
attackers might disrupt your application,

36
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.050
you can start looking at the possible exploits

37
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.020
that could exist in your system.

38
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.030
This is really the heart of understanding the attacker.

39
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.050
As a developer, truly understanding an attacker is

40
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.090
one of the most difficult challenges in my opinion.

41
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.080
But once you start recognizing the mindset of an attacker,

42
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.070
it opens up a wealth of new ways to protect your system.

43
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.040
For instance, understanding motivations allows you to look

44
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.090
at an attack vector in your application

45
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.050
by thinking through the lens of the attacker.

46
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.000
Once you collect this information,

47
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.090
you can start building an attack tree.

48
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.070
The attack tree allows you

49
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.060
to build scenarios based on probable attacks.

50
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.000
With these scenarios, you can determine

51
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.030
where you need to add testing,

52
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.030
increase threat detection, or apply mitigating controls.

53
00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.070
Getting into the mindset

54
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.060
of the attacker can be a huge undertaking.

55
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.060
However, it can reap significant rewards

56
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.000
to your organizations.
