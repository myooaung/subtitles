00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.050
- Security is often a moving target.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.090
When you are starting down this path of secure coding,

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.070
and ultimately, a culture of security,

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.020
it's easy to get lost.

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm going to suggest you focus

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.030
on the most current best practices.

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.080
Consider development tasks like source control,

8
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.030
unit testing, static and dynamic code analysis,

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.060
and peer-reviewed best practices

10
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.000
to help secure your code.

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.060
Don't be afraid to attack them one at a time

12
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.050
and get processes in place that work for you.

13
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.080
You don't, however, have to re-create the wheel.

14
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.030
There are several great resources on the web for free

15
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.070
that will help you build a platform of secure development.

16
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.050
Requirements and design are no different.

17
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.050
A lot of time and effort has been put

18
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.020
into developing secure practices around these tasks.

19
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.020
Again, many of them are published for free.

20
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.030
Consider risk management as one of the bigger areas here,

21
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.010
and focus on how the industry is managing risks

22
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.080
and documenting them.

23
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.060
While not everything will work for you,

24
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.040
you may find enough to get you started,

25
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.020
and ultimately, save you some valuable time.

26
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.070
One area I would highly suggest

27
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.090
you follow industry standards around

28
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.070
is vulnerability management.

29
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.020
Many people have put in a lot of time

30
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.080
to developing standards and strategies

31
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.050
for companies and teams to manage their vulnerabilities.

32
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.040
Things like scoring, ranking,

33
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.090
and prioritizing vulnerabilities have been solved,

34
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.070
as well as ways to accept those risks.

35
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.070
Tracking and reporting on vulnerabilities

36
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.030
has also been vetted pretty well in the industry.

37
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.080
As always, you will make parts of it your own,

38
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.010
but definitely use what you can.

39
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.060
Finally, when it comes to testing and deployment,

40
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.070
there is a lot documented,

41
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.080
but you will have to work through

42
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.070
a significant amount of it on your own.

43
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.080
Start with the basics and reach out to the community.

44
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.000
A lot of work around penetration testing

45
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.090
and automated deployments has been solved,

46
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.090
but things like attack trees are not as common.

47
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.030
You may prioritize your individual workloads

48
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.070
based on what is done and what isn't.

49
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.050
Ultimately, I want to encourage you to start somewhere.

50
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.000
Try out what your peers are doing and go from there.
