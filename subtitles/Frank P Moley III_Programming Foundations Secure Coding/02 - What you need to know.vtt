00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.090
- If you're a professional software developer,

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.010
or looking to enter into this crazy chaos

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.020
that is software development, then this course is for you.

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.030
The consistent theme in this industry

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.030
is that nothing is consistent.

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.080
As such, we need to be perpetual students.

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.020
The only thing I expect you to be armed with

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.030
is a knowledge of how to write software in some capacity.

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.090
I don't care about which language you use,

10
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.000
or what platform you deploy your code to,

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.060
but you must understand that some languages

12
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.030
are susceptible to one kind of attack

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.040
while others can be prone to other attacks.

14
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.040
That is the nature of languages in general.

15
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.060
They all have their advantages and disadvantages.

16
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.050
Platforms work in the same way.

17
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.060
A web platform for instance has very different attack

18
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.080
vectors than the embedded software on an IoT device.

19
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.050
Neither is secure or insecure in its own right.

20
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.020
It's a matter of handling the challenges

21
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.040
that you're presented with in your given situation.

22
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.060
In order to do that you need to understand they're risks

23
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.070
and work from there.

24
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.000
As you watch this course, I expect you to take

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.020
the knowledge of the language and platforms you use

26
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.000
and apply them to make your code more secure.
