00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.030
- Obviously, there was a large focus

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.040
in this course on the development side of secure coding.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.080
But I want to emphasize a little

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.010
about how you can leverage this knowledge

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.080
to positively impact your culture.

6
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.030
First and foremost in my mind is education.

7
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.000
If you have seen any of my other courses

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.080
or heard me speak,

9
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.010
you should get a feeling

10
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.010
that I am all in on education.

11
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.000
This course may be the start for you in secure coding

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and security in general,

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.010
but please don't make it the last.

14
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010
You have to start living this stuff

15
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.030
at least a little in order to really grasp

16
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.050
the full reality of it.

17
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.060
Follow blogs and Twitter

18
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.050
because that is how you will hear

19
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.010
of the new attacks you may need to react to.

20
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.030
If you hear of a vulnerability the day it is announced

21
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.000
and the component you use,

22
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.020
you will have the information to fix the issue

23
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.050
before it becomes one for you,

24
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.010
assuming of course you weren't hit before the announcement.

25
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.070
You also need to test your own skill sub.

26
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.040
Try and execute a few attacks every now and then.

27
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.020
Practice reading buggy code

28
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.050
and practice fixing it.

29
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.050
These skills alone will make you better at peer reviews.

30
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.010
You also need a dose of humility.

31
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.060
This is a very important aspect

32
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.010
of working in security in my opinion,

33
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.030
and one that I personally struggled with a lot,

34
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.060
especially at first.

35
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.070
You will not know everything there is to know.

36
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.010
You will make mistakes.

37
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.060
Just own it.

38
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.000
It will make you a better developer,

39
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
a better secure developer,

40
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.030
and honestly a better person.

41
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.080
You also need to be the change agent for your team.

42
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.050
Development is hard, we know that.

43
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.040
Security is even harder,

44
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.090
but a champion will help the the team

45
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.090
more than any mandate pushed down from above.

46
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.000
You may inspire others to start down the path with you.

47
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.060
The most important aspect, however,

48
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.090
is to apply this knowledge often.

49
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.010
Look at code reviews from The Security Mindset,

50
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.090
look at development tasks and designs

51
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.080
and try to break them,

52
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.020
look at risks and ensure they're properly mitigated.

53
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.030
Question behavior that seems to put your company

54
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.040
or your customers at risk.

55
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.000
Be the champion.
