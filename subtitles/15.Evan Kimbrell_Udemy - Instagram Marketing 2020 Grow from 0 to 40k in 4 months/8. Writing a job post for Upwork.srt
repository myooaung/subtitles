1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,570
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,960
Now that we are at the point where we are pretty confident that we've identified the types of contractors

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,860
that we need to hire to work with to get each section of our content strategy done.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,230
It's now up to us to make a job posting into posts on up work.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,750
Now it's up to you if you want to use people per hour freelancer gooroo dot com or virtual assistant

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,530
dot com I believe is one.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,670
But you use up work just because it's the widest net it has the largest variety of people.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,670
So for like for instance I can hire writers and I can hire editors and I can hire people who can do

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,310
keyway like quality assurance or testing or pretty much anything I can really think of I can find someone

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,000
there.

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,160
Other other platforms that are more optimized for say like data entry like freelance or dot coms better

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,680
for people who are doing really really simple kind of monotonous rote tasks and you can get a better

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,590
value there.

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,740
But there is value in being able to keep everything in one platform so that's what I'm going to use

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,650
for now.

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:00:59,920
OK.

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,880
So once you create an account up work you only have to give them a credit card or anything you can just

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,090
say post new job.

19
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:04,580
OK.

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,140
Now they change their onboarding screens quite a bit.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,330
So keep this in mind.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,040
It might look slightly different.

23
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,890
They seems like every month their process a little bit different.

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,670
So when you go to create a new job post then we'll continue.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,620
OK now the name of your job post.

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,370
Well really the simplest way of doing this is just to describe it in one sentence.

27
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:29,130
There's really no benefit to trying to sell them on it because that's not really going to get more people

28
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,040
to check it out it's actually kind of weird if someone says quick an easy task.

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,640
Generally that's just not good.

30
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,650
You don't track people who don't want to do difficult tasks which I think is just counterproductive.

31
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,950
But for the most part I try to give them the main keywords right so like if we were hiring video editors

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,890
what do they need to know.

33
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,140
Right.

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,900
It's going to be I need.

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,370
It's going to be need video editors right many self-identifying the group I'm looking for not just someone

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,240
I need video editors need.

37
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:09,600
I can say that plural meaning I want to hire multiple people to pile videos on new tech for Instagram

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,330
account.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,250
OK so that's a pretty decent idea of what's involved here.

40
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,220
I don't need to give them any of the parameters like 60 second videos or we're only using lower thirds

41
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,370
taxed or you know any other requirements on what type of media to collect then what I can do is go down

42
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,900
here a job category and it says event video production that's literally going to be looking for people

43
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,080
that are in person usually.

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,620
So easy is going on to design and creative and then it's video production.

45
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,480
So that's a wider category.

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,190
This is just too specific.

47
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,460
We're not necessarily making advertising videos there's people who specialize in that.

48
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,570
And that's not what we're doing.

49
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,500
And then obviously these are other specialties as well.

50
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,160
Like I said I'm making it next.

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,200
Now here is where we put our description and any other information that we need to kind of get across

52
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,670
what it is that we're doing.

53
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:03,510
So I generally suggest is pull open your handy dandy text editor and pull open a new tab then what you

54
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,970
can do is say job post and we'll say this is for the video editors.

55
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,320
OK.

56
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,980
Now the best way that I found to break these up and keep in mind you don't have to write something that

57
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,300
is just perfect it's not something that you'd expect like a Fortune 500 company to write.

58
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,380
It just has pages and pages of information.

59
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:27,230
You need something that gets like 80 percent across simply and ideally doesn't leave anything out.

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,870
But at the end of the day people are going to message you if they're interested in it and if there's

61
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,090
any more details you can then fill them in.

62
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,830
I like to do it typically like this.

63
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,120
I like to start with the what.

64
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,990
Then tell them the why.

65
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,800
Then tell them the how.

66
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,140
And then tell them when and then I like to do extras.

67
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:44,650
OK.

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,350
So all of this pattern it's pretty hard to leave anything out.

69
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,400
You might find you know that you miss something we can always go back and edit the job post.

70
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,720
So what would be a usually one to choose description of what you're doing.

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:06,480
I need video editors to help make videos or my Instagram account and share an account that I might give

72
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,850
them a little bit more information about what it is.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:23,680
These videos are only say 30 to 45 seconds long and they cover new and new and impressive technology.

74
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,450
OK.

75
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:31,380
Now for me that's typically going to be enough because if I say you're going to do it with this software

76
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,760
Well that's that's not what.

77
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,210
Anymore.

78
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,220
That's how.

79
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,560
So that's usually enough for a one to two maybe three sentences on the one.

80
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,040
Now I like to follow this up with a why just because I'm a person who likes context and I don't think

81
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,540
that you're going to get a lot of people motivated about your project if they don't know why you're

82
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,290
doing it even if it's just to fill in.

83
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,570
OK.

84
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,790
Well we're doing it for making an online course or making an Instagram account.

85
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,370
OK.

86
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,380
Even that is helpful it's not going to change the way they work but knowing why they're doing it is

87
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:01,650
helpful.

88
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,810
No one likes being a cog like hammering something together and they have no idea what it's even going

89
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,600
to go into or become.

90
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:23,350
So for the why I might say I'm starting a new Instagram account cover's cool new technology and science.

91
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:32,240
I want to make videos similar to it's always useful to use anchor points to say similar to this.

92
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,060
So it kind of frames their understanding of it.

93
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,150
Now it's similar to what exactly like.

94
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,930
So I might say similar to.

95
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,590
And then I might give say like the link to tech inciter.

96
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,540
Right or whatever it is that we've identified as something that we want to emulate.

97
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,010
OK.

98
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:55,560
Now then we might say the how and this is where we worked on our requirements before Howard going to

99
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,130
be the requirements.

100
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,010
You can write them from scratch here perfectly fine if you are going to do that.

101
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,760
I like to start from the very first step.

102
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:10,710
So I would say I would just give a description of how the process will go and then I can maybe put in

103
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,290
the requirements of written them or you know write them from scratch.

104
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:22,990
So I would say first you will take a new article or it will take a new article that isn't listed in

105
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:33,480
a Trillo column and then I'll give them an example such as you know here's an example of a web or a

106
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:47,780
technology we might cover then I need you to take the pre written caption for it and copy it over and

107
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,920
over.

108
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:56,760
Next you'll find video clips that match each miniature match each caption and then I might put parentheses

109
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:10,220
captions are added up into one two two sentence chunks that explain the new technology and a basic narrative

110
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,290
format.

111
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,840
OK.

112
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,240
OK.

113
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:20,480
So then I'd say like then you'll reduce each clip down to a five to nine just kind of making this up

114
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:34,220
seconds per clip and attach in a lower thirds box the the caption stated with each clip OK and then

115
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,720
really kind of getting into the requirements and parameters so if you can watch the requirements lecture

116
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,790
go back and look at that but it would basically come down to.

117
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:50,990
I might even just say requirements like this and it might just list off some things so I might say videos

118
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,070
must be less than 60 seconds but longer than 30 seconds.

119
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,220
Videos must be exported at least 10 ETP.

120
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,650
Then I might even give them some requirements with the clips that they're collecting and that honestly

121
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,290
I might even do that is an entirely separate job because finding the right clips is really kind of the

122
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,340
secret sauce to making a good video.

123
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,790
But I might give them some basic instructions if I was going to go for this integrated route where the

124
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,620
video person who's assembling all the clips putting the captions doing the timing in the music.

125
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,620
But if I was really going to go for this integrated approach with this person is assembling all the

126
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:34,700
clips adding music and exploring everything and handling that whole process well then I get it maybe

127
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,890
give them some tips at least the ones that I can think of right now so I might say like clip's must

128
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:53,140
be directly directly relevant royalty free and have no jerky movements or overlayed text.

129
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:58,580
So you know I might rewrite that to be a little more clear but what I basically mean is if you're going

130
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:04,840
to have a clip that's talking about recycling I need to show recycling don't show the Earth OK that's

131
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,600
not relevant.

132
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,860
It needs to be more specific than that.

133
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,460
It also needs to be royalty free.

134
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:15,140
Don't grab something from someone who has a claim to this who might tell you to tear down the video

135
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,670
that's a huge pain on Instagram.

136
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,220
And then also things like no jerky movement trying to get them to read text over a video.

137
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,580
It's pretty important that you don't have a camera that's just going like flicking crazy.

138
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,100
That's just a recipe for motion sickness.

139
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,030
And then we might say or overlayed taxed.

140
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:38,180
I don't mean for that is don't grab a YouTube video that already has text overlaid on it.

141
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,620
Then I might just say something like.

142
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:49,730
All video clips must be at least 720 P and that's just because if you're going to make video it's a

143
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,520
good idea to make sure it's all at least consistently high resolution.

144
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,880
If you have a choice between low resolution very relevant and high resolution but decent or irrelevant

145
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,570
you should probably go with the high resolution.

146
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,450
It's very rarely the case that going to run into that type of situation where you can't find anything

147
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,040
more relevant.

148
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,920
Hi rez.

149
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,620
I mean it is an 18 and 19 already.

150
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,980
So most things are already at at least intonated 10 ATP but occasionally you might actually run into

151
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,490
that and you might have to make a decision.

152
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:24,620
And the last thing I might say and you might have forgotten to do this is make sure to add music from

153
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,080
the list provided songs.

154
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:35,860
Ok then when this is when I'm going to describe how much I need from each person and how many of me

155
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,290
these videos were in a produce per week so I might say we're producing I think we're doing three to

156
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:51,050
four videos a day so twenty to twenty or thirty videos a week 20 to 30 videos a week and I need someone

157
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,060
who can spend.

158
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,070
I mean this is just a calculation in your head right.

159
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,350
Because you've made the videos for you know how long it should take.

160
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,240
You should also know that you'll get better at it.

161
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,000
So it's a little bit faster.

162
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,330
Originally took me two hours.

163
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:08,180
So I think ideally we'll get to a point where it's like 45 minutes maybe 40 minutes.

164
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:13,020
So if I need 20 to 30 I want to hire two people minimum so they're going to need to do.

165
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,710
You know it's probably like two hours a day right.

166
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,860
So in at least two hours a day and then that's just me meeting bare minimum right like this isn't even

167
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:28,280
a recipe for stockpiling videos or going to other things you might want to say you might want to just

168
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,640
say like what time zones.

169
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,090
They need to work and if that's something that's important to you if you need to be there with them

170
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,820
have communication with them you might want to say how long they have to turn it around.

171
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,420
That is also something that I consider when because it's a time requirement other things you might want

172
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,520
to mention could be let's say when they start.

173
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,290
That's another big thing especially video editors tell you it's freelance video editors as they always

174
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,970
kind of plan these in advance so a lot of times you'll find someone you really like and they'll say

175
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,820
well I can't start until you know Thursday or X from now or whatever it is.

176
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,050
So make sure that you stay.

177
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:10,050
You give some kind of statement as to I need to start now or I need to start within the week or maybe

178
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,240
even have a set start deadline.

179
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,180
I don't think that's particularly realistic.

180
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:19,080
But again it's kind of up to you and the other thing is letting them know how long this will last so

181
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,330
you might say you know this is a long term position something that we're going to do for the next six

182
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:24,950
months.

183
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,760
That's usually a good thing people like long term work they don't like pickup work that they do for

184
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,610
a day and then they have to find something else to do.

185
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,810
And that's kind of the bane of freelancers is they end up spending a lot of their time finding jobs

186
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,180
and not as much time as they would like actually doing what they're good at.

187
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,000
OK.

188
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,540
Now let's run a little bit long so in the next section we're going to do is we're going to talk about

189
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,460
what goes under the extras which pretty much we're going to talk about running trials and then we'll

190
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,620
take what we have and we'll throw them into an up or post I can show you the rest of the process and

191
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,940
then after that what we'll do is we'll look over the real posts that are used to hire the people that

192
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,580
have been making the post for innovation station.

193
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,020
OK.

194
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,580
It in.
