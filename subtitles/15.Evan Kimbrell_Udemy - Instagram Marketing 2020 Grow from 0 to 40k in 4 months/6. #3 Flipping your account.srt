1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,530
They is welcome back.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,120
OK so in this lecture let's start talking about the number three way of monetizing your Instagram account

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,780
and that is flipping your account.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,150
Now it's not 100 percent flipping.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,620
You know when I say flipping you typically think of like someone who bought a house and proved it and

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,170
sold it I just like to call it flipping it.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,880
In reality it's more often the case that you built an account with the idea that you're going to sell

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,800
it later on.

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,110
So that's what we're talking about.

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,890
How much money can you make and what's the eye on building an account to a certain follower accounts

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,660
or engagement rate and then selling it.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,530
But the first question I think it's worth tackling is how much can you make.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:34,790
Right.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,080
Because that will determine whether or not this is a viable strategy for you.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,160
And honestly it's kind of hard to say.

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:48,330
And the reason why is because a lot of large accounts sell but they don't post anywhere with an asking

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,880
price that you see they're usually done in private one on one negotiations so we don't actually know

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,650
a lot about how much you can sell a large account for what we can tell for sure.

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:08,100
Is that typically any account that sells under 100000 is going to sell at a baseline at about $20 per

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,370
thousand followers.

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,910
Now whether or not that is worth it for you it depends on who you are how much money do you want to

22
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,780
make.

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,660
I think it's especially attractive to go this route of monetization if you can grow multiple accounts

24
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,990
at the same time.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,380
Then you can kind of take advantage of the synergies of helping them all grow together and then you

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,870
can sell them off one to one on one or you can sell them as a whole ring and potentially charge a premium.

27
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:39,350
So now let's go back to that figure I said which is that in general you have a baseline of about $20

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,850
per thousand followers.

29
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,210
Now that depends on a lot of different things that's why I call it a baseline.

30
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,990
The things that could actually change that rate are things like your engagement rate things about whether

31
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,940
or not the person who's buying fits into the niche that you've chosen.

32
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,270
How many comments do you get on average per post.

33
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,170
Are you creating your own content or are you just reposting content.

34
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,280
Also things like how many posts do you have in total.

35
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,520
Now let's talk about why each one of these is important.

36
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,660
With regard to how many posts you have and whether or not it's original content.

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,890
Well that actually helps the person who purchases it because once they buy it they're not going to just

38
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,500
stop posting on it.

39
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,910
Ideally they're going to want to use it for some purpose and in order to keep that momentum going and

40
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,510
to keep it from losing a lot of engagement they still need to post on it.

41
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,610
So if you have a lot of post that means it's relatively easy for them to find all posts and re post

42
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:41,520
them and keep the content going and then also they don't have to think a lot about how to create content

43
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,270
for this specific audience because that would be kind of hard if you just bought an account you didn't

44
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,570
know anything about the users.

45
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,730
So the other thing was whether or not you repost or create your own.

46
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,840
Typically speaking if you create your own that's better repost accounts are kind of cheap.

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,530
I mean it just means that you went around and picked nice things and you curated them which is fine.

48
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,770
But in general you're just not selling as much.

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,240
Not as much.

50
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,460
IP is a very unique account there's a lot of reposte accounts and in general they're going to have lower

51
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,610
engagement rates which is not as attractive as a purchase option.

52
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,100
Now your engagement rate just obviously matters because it's an indicator of the quality of what you

53
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,990
post and the quality of the following.

54
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,920
Right now if you're an accountant has a lot of mass followers are fake followers you can have a low

55
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,090
engagement rate.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,430
Also you know if you a low wage rate it may mean that whatever the Massereene your content and your

57
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,430
audience is that you found is not particularly effective.

58
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,630
So higher engagement means more people are going to see whatever I post which means that I'll be able

59
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,510
to milk that account more because more people actually react whenever I do something.

60
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,480
Comments obviously matters too just because that's something that screams algorithm likes.

61
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,590
But I you know we kind of consider this like a secondary one.

62
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,370
Higher comments will push your posts higher up you're more likely to go on the explore page.

63
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,970
But you know obviously a little bit of a drawback in that oftentimes you'll buy an account a lot of

64
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,560
comments and it's kind of hard to respond to all those comments and to keep up some of the best practices

65
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,520
we covered before.

66
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,410
The last thing obviously is what your niche is and that just has to do with demand.

67
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,190
There's a lot of popular knishes And if you pick something that's really obscure it's going to be hard

68
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,060
to find a buyer.

69
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,960
So those are some of the levers that can either make your sale easier or increase or decrease that baseline

70
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,340
of $20 per thousand that we've mentioned before.

71
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,200
Now you have to think about it why exactly would someone buy an account.

72
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,730
Well typically it's one of two reasons.

73
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,660
One they're getting buy in because they want to create their own account.

74
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,700
And this is a great way of getting a head start.

75
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,110
And the other one is that they're going to use it to promote another account or another product.

76
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:43,200
So if you've created something that say doesn't have a lot of post to work with is a low to say 1 percent

77
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,160
engagement rate.

78
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,550
That's a very good bedrock to build a business on.

79
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:53,100
With regards to the nice your end this is generally something that if you are wanting to sell your account

80
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:58,290
at the end of this whole Instagram journey you kind of have to keep that in consideration before you

81
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,360
start because there's certain issues that have a lot of demand a lot of people have figured out how

82
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,180
to monetize them.

83
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,240
So there's a lot of buyers for them.

84
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,370
There's other ones obviously that are just too obscure and the lack of buyers is going to drive your

85
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:16,690
price down some of the most common types you'll see are things like luxury that's just fancy things

86
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,950
people who aspire to be rich motivation usually just close with like a big strong man staring off in

87
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,060
the distance.

88
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,770
You have girls.

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,040
Yeah.

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,600
I mean that's a really popular one.

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,990
It's just attractive or in shape when you have things like pets.

92
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,870
There's ones that are dedicated to Entire just to dogs or cats or just two specific types of dogs like

93
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,900
one of my favorite accounts is a corgi account.

94
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,440
You also have cars.

95
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,330
That's one that is pretty popular a lot of people really like cars on Instagram such a visual platform

96
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,580
because of things like memes or people who post funny things with the one line at the top one line at

97
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,010
the bottom it's just usually for comedic value.

98
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,760
You also have things like travel.

99
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:03,860
Again obviously it's a very visual platform so great landscape shots very useful.

100
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:10,070
You also have things like fashion and also fitness as a big one too especially like weight loss.

101
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,560
That's a pretty big category.

102
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,870
I'd also say there's things like food and DIY crafts but those maybe aren't as popular.

103
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,190
It kind of depends.

104
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,540
Now if you do want to sell this is what my advice is use that Tony dollars per thousand as your baseline

105
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,970
and then use hype auditor to then adjust that up or down.

106
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,790
So now you remember heighth auditor that's how he check to see what the quality of an account is let's

107
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,570
just look at daily innovation inspiration and innovation station.

108
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,920
You get free reports for your own accounts you don't have to actually pay for this.

109
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:48,370
So if you look at mine we have a 93 out of 100 that's good U.S. based primarily second India third is

110
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,860
Italy and Indonesia and United Kingdom 79 percent are real people.

111
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,100
And we'll just use this to look at those things that we cared about before like.

112
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,960
So what is our engagement rate.

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,580
OK.

114
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,960
So 8.4 percent.

115
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,350
And that's compared to 1.5 percent for similar accounts in my space.

116
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,160
Then let's look at things like comments like the comments ratio is good.

117
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,490
Now I know this fluctuates quite a bit actually.

118
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,790
Sometimes my likes to comments ratio has been bad and it's just something I've been trying to optimize.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,320
So right now it's good.

120
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:25,820
So again that's another reason I might be able to move the baseline up now the Nishi is kind of hard

121
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,330
to say.

122
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,970
I mean it's technology innovation.

123
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,170
So it's going to fit with a lot of business categories or gadgets or things like that.

124
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:39,560
But typically if I were to price this out I would take that Tony dollar based on an item I didn't increase

125
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,600
it quite a bit right.

126
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,410
I'd probably take that up to say like $35 because it's very high engagement.

127
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:54,200
We use our own content it's all original stuff and we have healthy followings that are for the most

128
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:01,100
part clumped in a good geographical regions as far as time zones are concerned we don't have a ton of

129
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:07,040
mass followers so we all like 20 percent or kind of questionable and I don't even know honestly how

130
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,930
those came to be.

131
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,710
Imagine those are from page shout outs from less than savory accounts.

132
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,370
MILLER I think you might well look at is reachability.

133
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,550
So eighty nine point seven percent of followers have less than fifteen hundred.

134
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,090
That's good.

135
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,530
Anybody who has more than fifteen hundred posts something the odds of them seeing your post are pretty

136
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:24,950
low.

137
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,500
So let's say you know I was going to do $35 per.

138
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:35,670
I'm at 21000 soon asking price I could start with maybe around $700 and it specifically $735.

139
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,810
That's generally the range I could start and then see how the interest is.

140
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,840
Now what is the ideal point to sell your account at.

141
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:49,370
Is it best to just make a bunch of five thousand person 10000 dollar accounts all those or to wait till

142
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,750
you're in the millions.

143
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,160
Again it's usually up to you.

144
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,600
Typically speaking though the larger the account the higher that baseline will start to move certain

145
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,150
looking a million dollar accounts.

146
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,710
I generally start revising that 20 dollar advice slightly up.

147
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,750
You start seeing the baseline closer to 30 once you get in the millions.

148
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:11,530
So that would suggest that you have some if you wait longer.

149
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,110
Also just keep in mind that the market for really small accounts is just weak.

150
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,180
I don't know why anyone would want to buy a 5000 person account given that there are two reasons why

151
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,010
people buy this is because they want a head start on their account 5000 is a lot or they want to drive

152
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,460
traffic from it to in another account.

153
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,010
Again 5000 is not a lot.

154
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:35,270
So as long as you're in say 15000 20000 range then you might actually be attractive depending on whoever

155
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,200
the buyer is.

156
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,900
Now if you do want to sell There's essentially two different ways that you can do this.

157
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,430
Now one is by posting it on an exchange and the other one is by doing an outbound strategy.

158
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,940
Now exchanges are pretty simple.

159
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,400
It's really simple just just google Bycel Instagram accounts because there's ones that pop up all the

160
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,690
time.

161
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,100
But the common or the well known ones are like social trade.

162
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:02,460
Fame swap epic in PC and Bycel shout outs.

163
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,060
Some of these we've actually seen an earlier section.

164
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:11,990
So for instance let's look at social trachea the list off on their front page what they have and platforms

165
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,930
useful because you can post whatever it is you're trying to sell.

166
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:22,550
So let's see like this one would be in the nice of weightlifting or fitness and this is a pretty small

167
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,290
account but you can see that they kind of follow that Tony dollars.

168
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,940
I mean they should probably price themselves at 120 and that's probably why they haven't sold yet.

169
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,180
But let's see.

170
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,020
This one's 11000.

171
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,990
That's.

172
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,060
Yeah.

173
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,920
OK they're pretty overpriced.

174
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,630
Let's see this one like 84000 for luxury vibe.

175
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,590
That's right on the money for basically 20 to one.

176
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,700
But you can see they you can post it here and then you can accept offers and you can just have someone

177
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,300
outright bias so you can see like six offers are currently pending it looks like a lot of people will

178
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,980
lowball it.

179
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:05,590
But anyway so you can use a platform to just post them online and then use that as a way to gather attention.

180
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,440
Here's one like player up dotcom.

181
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:13,370
It's just a forum where tons and people are just posting a lot of times they'll post their entire groupings

182
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:13,940
of one.

183
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,190
So like let's see active hot girls like we talked about before there's several people selling several

184
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,760
of those who's a luxury nice one.

185
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,450
That one's pretty obscure.

186
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,390
It's not a super common account.

187
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,190
You can see guns.

188
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:27,390
OK.

189
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,270
So they're getting a little more specific.

190
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,060
Dogs mimis you can kind of see that there's a reoccurring theme here.

191
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,490
And then right here is where they put the price for what they're asking for.

192
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,440
And then you can see if you actually click through you can see comments or people ask questions and

193
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,000
they you know answer them and they can kind of go into negotiations that way.

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,900
Same thing here with like APIC NPC.

195
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,110
It's the same age as a forum.

196
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,970
You post it and it's up to you to kind of engage with whoever reaches out to you and to negotiate something

197
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,900
by sell shout outs.

198
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,660
They work very similarly but they sell them into lists so you get listed and then someone has to come

199
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,920
in like click this list.

200
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,790
And honestly I think it's just because this is not a big focus of what they do on their Web site.

201
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,560
So those are some ones that you could use.

202
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,500
I would suggest diversifying as much as possible getting listed on all the platforms you can find it

203
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,640
is easily 10 or so that are worth your time that will generate plenty of interest.

204
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,970
Now the other option was to do direct messaging and that's just like are saying an outbound strategy

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,450
so what you would do here is you would look for accounts that are in your space that you have some evidence

206
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,310
that they've been buying accounts which you know what end up happening is you might see an account and

207
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,960
it starts posting one type of content.

208
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,410
Then one day it kind of switches and the bio link changes oftentimes that bilingual take you to another

209
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,420
Instagram account or point towards another one.

210
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,340
You'll notice that they'll start posting repeatedly from another one.

211
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,370
It's a pretty good indication that someone bought it.

212
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,400
And if you saw that well and you could reach out to that main account and see if they're interested

213
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,590
in buying another one.

214
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,070
Generally speaking I think an outbound strategy is probably a waste of time until you get into the millions

215
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,560
because at that point it's actually worth spending time and really looking for a good buyer and drumming

216
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,880
up your own interest.

217
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,040
And also there's a larger sales.

218
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,500
Like I said before typically happen in back doors when the direct message section.

219
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,540
So that's where that would be appropriate.

220
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,340
The last thing you can do which is pretty easy is just to change your bio link.

221
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,850
I mean you can change it to a page where it shows that the accounts for sale in this list that it's

222
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,560
for sale.

223
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,450
Again this might hurt your following your engagement rates.

224
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,220
Keep that in mind.

225
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,300
But do you really do want to sell it.

226
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,950
That's a great way of doing it as well.

227
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,290
All right guys hopefully we've covered enough about flipping accounts.

228
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,550
It's not really something I think to do with innovation station.

229
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,290
I think most likely when you do paid promotions or affiliate marketing I think.

230
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,230
But that might change you can follow along in the follow along section and see where I kind of go with

231
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,580
it.

232
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,000
OK guys see you in the next lecture.
