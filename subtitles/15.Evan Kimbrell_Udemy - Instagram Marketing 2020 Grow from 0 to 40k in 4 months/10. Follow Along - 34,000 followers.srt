1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,850
You guys just checking in to show you where we're at and give you an update on how things have been

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,410
going.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:12,270
OK so at this point we're at thirty four thousand followers believe that's rounded up.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:19,260
So last time we checked in talked a little bit I think about how we were starting this push towards

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,720
doing shout for shout and for the most part has worked out.

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,960
We're still having issues where we're not large enough to really make it worth it.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:39,060
But you can see here this is kind of the war room so far with regards to outreach to companies or accounts

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,150
that might make sense.

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:48,720
So we have actually done some I'd say were doing something like probably three or four a week and for

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,360
the most part they're pretty straightforward.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,850
We just started doing mass messaging to people and saying hey do you want to do a shout for show so

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,220
we can look at our messages for the most part.

13
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,100
Let's see.

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:02,630
Yeah.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,160
I mean we have a lot of people who say like yes and then we respond with You know here's some information

16
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,350
and then honestly takes a while for some people to actually get back to us.

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,150
You know like here's one Stargazer official OK so we did one with them all.

18
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,080
This entire process takes like as you noticed messaging a 21st smartphone the 22nd.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,320
Today's lawyer responded blah blah blah and then it looks like we posted I think the next day.

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,610
Right.

21
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,700
So yeah I mean for the most part it's pretty easy to get these going for the most part you really just

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,150
have to be kind of on it when it comes to responding to people.

23
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,820
A lot of times they'll respond late or the responses aren't super useful.

24
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,520
But you know for the most part it's fairly easy.

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,350
You know have someone else doing it for me.

26
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,720
They're doing the outreach.

27
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,360
It's for the most part pretty much just automated.

28
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,260
And then I also have it set up the same person is sending the same message back to them.

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,940
And the way we have it set up is we just say you know hey you like your recount like your audience I

30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:08,340
think our audience would like each other let's do a shout out in the story and then we respond after

31
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,350
they have some form of affirmative by giving them a link to our video and asking them for a video and

32
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:20,460
then as soon as we get their video we just post it on our story and then it automatically will pop up

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,760
in our direct message to them saying like you've been tagged in a story so that's been pretty useful.

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,890
You know at the size we're at 34000.

35
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:37,620
We've done this probably 10 times in the last like two weeks I would say each one on average will get

36
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,340
you a hundred followers just because of the size.

37
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,990
So again it's one of those those issues where it really just depends on the size of your account.

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,350
And you'll notice that this snowballs rapidly.

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,710
Like say we a million people on our account and someone else had a million that they did a shout for

40
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,020
shout We probably get $2000 just from that.

41
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,330
So that could be pretty easy.

42
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,100
Then all of a sudden you know we're gaining a hundred thousand dollars a month.

43
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,500
We just do this like once or twice a day whereas with this it's like yeah you get anywhere from 50 to

44
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,860
150 followers and it's also hard to then convince the other person to keep doing that with you.

45
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,900
Just because again it's just not really worth it at this size.

46
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,260
Also I mean we get most of our followers from hashtags primarily and the follow bought and then we still

47
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,010
get a lot of rebounds from the zombie accounts that are running.

48
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:35,970
So yeah it's getting there where it's getting to the point where it's worth it but not yet have we hit

49
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,200
the sweet spot where this is going to be the main growth channel.

50
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,420
I'm going to start using.

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,740
So let's just check in and see how community growth has been for the most part.

52
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,400
It's been pretty solid.

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,440
I mean it used to be the case that a good day was gaining 100 followers now are getting to the point

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:04:00,060
where like a good days like 250 and this is largely just due to the changes in the size of the account.

55
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,190
I mean that's really it used to be the case of I posted something that was really popular and get a

56
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,130
lot of interactions.

57
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:13,080
And then on the hashtags it might maybe maybe 10 percent five percent of time show up in the top post

58
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,270
for the hash tag page.

59
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:20,280
But now since we have 34000 it's just getting more and more common that even with some of the mediocre

60
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,520
posts We're showing up in the top post for hashtags.

61
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,140
So it's really just that kind of a snowball effect now you can imagine this effect then when you have

62
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,090
a million followers and then all of a sudden you're showing up on like 90 percent of the hash tag pages

63
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,580
that you post for.

64
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,170
So it's really just kind of a game of patience.

65
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:43,830
But as you can see you know 300 319 400 those a great day three 22 and then really just depends on what

66
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,500
we're posting.

67
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,240
Our content strategy has shifted slightly.

68
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,050
I think I talked about this before where we're starting to rehash a lot of our old stuff and then trying

69
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:59,000
to feed in a slow diet of best hits and of new content.

70
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,290
But for the part that means that the 70 percent of our content is going to be stuff we posted four months

71
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,700
ago.

72
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,540
So hopefully no one notices and for the most part you can kind of tell by the comments that no one really

73
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,100
does notice.

74
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,490
Another thing that's also seemed to improve quite a bit is our comments used to be a case like a good

75
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,190
post would get an extra five comments.

76
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:29,510
Now we're getting like 25 10 13 so even some of his mediocre posts are getting a lot of comments like

77
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,230
this one at 13.

78
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,970
This one I don't even know I haven't even looked at the post.

79
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,850
Got 36.

80
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:41,000
I think it's what I'm finding is a lot of the posts that are kind of controversial like dumb tack gets

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,810
a lot of people to respond and say this is dumb.

82
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:50,320
And that is kind of the catalyst to then get other people to participate in the conversation like this

83
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,610
one.

84
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,630
This is one of the ones that man people just hate it.

85
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:03,920
And it's because of this what it is is it's a crop sensor that will flop around as it goes across a

86
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,080
cable across our crops like that.

87
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,990
So it kind of swings right.

88
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,870
And so like 90 percent of the people are just like why is it do that.

89
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,660
Why can't it just be on a track system.

90
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,370
And what I've been doing is just trying to engage people as much as possible and really just playing

91
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,100
into whatever going to get them to respond.

92
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,890
They say that's awesome.

93
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,040
I'm like yeah it is awesome and if it's not awesome then I'll try to argue with them just to get him

94
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,740
to keep responding and that's essentially how you get more engagement and you'll notice that a lot of

95
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:36,980
the people that actually will engage in these arguments do continue to show up in the other posts and

96
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,910
to you know give their opinion on whether or not it's useful or not.

97
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,390
So yeah not much else has happened there.

98
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,830
We're still using a rotating hash tag strategy but we're slowly starting to incorporate larger hashtags

99
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,510
as we get larger.

100
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:58,550
It's kind of overkill if you're using a hashtag that only has like 9000 posts or so for an account that

101
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,250
gets you know on average.

102
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,930
I don't even know.

103
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,660
I mean you know say these old videos likes for each video sometimes.

104
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,820
I want to say it's like usually three or four hundred three hundred.

105
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,840
Sure.

106
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,080
And that seems to kind of make sense so we can look at our hype auditor report and see how we're doing.

107
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,580
OK.

108
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,800
So we're about 83 out of 100.

109
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,020
Our engagement rate has gone down and that is just really a change in US posting old stuff and new stuff.

110
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,450
So you know the bread and butter is going to be stuff that's untested.

111
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:37,250
So if we are doing only posts or only if we are doing only best hits then yeah I would expect this to

112
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,550
be quite a bit higher.

113
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:44,870
So this average is kind of being thinned out by some of the less than fantastic posts you can still

114
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,010
see that this is kind of goofy like it thinks we're in the photography category.

115
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,840
That's just because every post we do is different we have no theme it's just interesting technology.

116
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,440
But for the most part we're still doing a very good job with followers.

117
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:01,790
We're only getting people who are real followers who are actually going to see our posts.

118
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,470
Engagement rate is good yeah.

119
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:10,580
I mean it's about a little over double what our average what we would expect for our category.

120
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,350
That of course is can be something that's kind of hard to really benchmark.

121
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,960
But you know sometimes our engagement rate is as high as like 15 20 percent.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,190
Usually I think of an average around like 8 or 9 and that's kind of what we've seen historically.

123
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:35,810
So if we take a look at our monthly update though we got about Milko rounded up say 9000 followers last

124
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,770
month.

125
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,210
That's I think is pretty good.

126
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,940
I think this will tick up as we started getting larger and everything we do starts snowballing and also

127
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,060
as we maybe start getting a little more optimized with our hashtags so you can see here like for instance

128
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:56,540
last month our engagement rate was about 10 percent and it dropped down to the average of about almost

129
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,110
6.

130
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:04,070
But you'll notice things like I was saying comments received that went up almost doubled likes received

131
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:09,530
pretty much static as our audience is getting larger more and more people are seeing it that's fantastic.

132
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,760
Some of the impressions I think this has more to do with a couple of other videos really started to

133
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,260
go viral typically with a post will get like ten thousand views maybe.

134
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,950
And if the algorithm really likes it it can go up to 80000.

135
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,950
So yeah.

136
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:32,540
And then media person you noticed you post the exact same schedule so nothing's really changed.

137
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,490
I think that might be something we uptick in the future just because more posts means more hashtags

138
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,600
means more exposure means more engagement.

139
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,240
And so that's generally just a good thing all around.

140
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,040
All right guys that's it for now for the most part this is on autopilot like I'm not really doing much

141
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,860
other than arguing with people in the comments like that's really all I'm doing.

142
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,290
And I still have someone posting these and I still have someone doing the shout for shout outreach.

143
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,950
If I were a very patient man I get here and do nothing and it costs me zero dollars because I'm just

144
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,180
reposting the same content over and over again and it would slowly just snowball.

145
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,380
So I'm putting a very limited effort into expansion by doing shout for shouts which are pretty much

146
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,550
the bee's knees.

147
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,320
They're followers.

148
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,240
Basically you don't pay anything for it.

149
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:25,570
And as long as you pick other accounts wisely then actually it's a total win win like your account likes

150
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,160
the posts and by their account likes to post.

151
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,760
I don't really see any downside to it.

152
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,200
Obviously there's limitations to how far you can take it.

153
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,230
All right guys with that being said I will check in again don't expect to check in any time soon because

154
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,140
again we're on autopilot so I'll probably check in at the next milestone maybe 40 or 50.

155
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:43,990
All right see you then.
