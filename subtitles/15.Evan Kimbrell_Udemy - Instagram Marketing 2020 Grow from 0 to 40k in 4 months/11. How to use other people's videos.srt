00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,750
Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,250
OK.
2

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,720
So this lecture we're going to cover
3

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,510
how do you use other people's videos in your own videos.
4

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,800
It's actually pretty useful to understand how you can 
get other clips out there to make your own videos.
5

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,030
I know a lot of you are probably going to 
be using other people's clips exclusively.
6

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,950
That's perfectly fine.
7

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,220
I mean, that's what we're going to be doing at Innovation
Station, we're not going to be shooting any of our own video.
8

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,590
We're going to be using clips from all over the
internet. So we covered a long time back
9

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,680
how to use free stock images on Instagram.
10

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,080
Same thing kind of applies.
11

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,680
There's a lot of free stock video 
platforms, so that's something
12

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,700
also, just go and look at that. The same websites 
I showed you, Pixabay, Pexels, Allthefreestock,
13

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,280
they work the exact same way for videos, 
you just click a button and you go to Video.
14

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,990
Now, if you want to use the video of someone else on 
Instagram, and this is something you will absolutely
15

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:07,380
have to do at some point, especially if you're going 
to be using any of the shout for shout advertising
16

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,330
and marketing strategies that we talk about later,
you will have to figure out how to do this.
17

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,880
So if you're on iOS, the best way that I've found how to do it -
18

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,470
and again, there's a lot of different ways to do this -
19

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,940
is to use an app called IGSaver.
20

21
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,550
is to use an app called IGSaver.
21

22
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,020
If this is not in the App Store when you 
go and look for it, it doesn't really matter.
22

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:35,280
There's tons of them, there's Instagrab, InstaSave, IGSave, 
IGSaver. This is the one that just worked for me.
23

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,640
There's tons of them, there's Instagrab, InstaSave, IGSave, 
IGSaver. This is the one that just worked for me.
24

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,530
It's hideous.
25

26
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,250
It's really annoying, but it works every single time.
26

27
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,790
That's really all we care about.
27

28
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,490
So if you want to try this one out, that's perfectly fine.
28

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,230
Otherwise, there's plenty of other ones.
29

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,670
When you open it up, it just takes you to this home 
screen, which is essentially photos from the people
30

31
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,170
you're following in your feed,
31

32
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,350
plus the ones that you've posted. What you can do is 
just go down here to Search, and then you can search
32

33
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,450
for whatever the account is that you want the video from.
33

34
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,810
So let's say Gary Vee.
34

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:11,910
Let's say we are taking a video from him. So click that, 
go to his actual account, not his 200 other ones.
35

36
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,600
Then you figure out which video you wanted 
for whatever reason, you click that, okay.
36

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,020
Then you figure out which video you wanted 
for whatever reason, you click that, okay.
37

38
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,910
So there's his video.
38

39
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,410
It makes you look at an ad.
39

40
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,630
It's super annoying, but it's free.
40

41
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,560
And then you can watch it to figure out 
this is the one that you want.
41

42
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,300
Do we want this? Do we want this?
42

43
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,230
Yeah, sure.
43

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,070
And then what you do is just hit Save to gallery. It has other
functions on it, but those other functions, like reposting
44

45
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,830
and changing captions, and stuff like that,
45

46
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,580
I would rather use those on other apps that are just better.
46

47
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,340
This is just perfectly fine for saving to your gallery.
47

48
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,710
So now that I've done that, I just go 
to my photos, and it's right there.
48

49
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,040
OK.
49

50
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,930
So now I can use this for whatever purposes, I can throw 
it back into any of the video editing apps, I can transfer
50

51
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,060
it to my computer, or I can just directly 
upload this if I wanted to, whatever.
51

52
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,240
All right.
52

53
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,750
Now let's look at the Android version. Now, on Android,
53

54
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,140
God bless the marketplace,
54

55
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,120
it's the same situation you have everywhere else.
55

56
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,610
Tons and tons and tons of apps that do it.
56

57
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:16,360
They're all much lower quality, it seems like more 
often you run into bad ones on the Google Play store,
57

58
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,650
but I found several that worked. So Save & Repost 
works, Inst Download and Instant Save are the ones
58

59
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,300
that I've used that worked.
59

60
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,430
They're relatively straightforward.
60

61
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,410
I mean, you have to do them a little bit different on 
Android, but I'll show you for instance with Instant Save.
61

62
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:31,960
I mean, you have to do them a little bit different on 
Android, but I'll show you for instance with Instant Save.
62

63
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,640
This is the way that you would do it.
63

64
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,460
So you go there.
64

65
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,970
No photos yet.
65

66
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,860
So the way it works is you go to Instagram,
66

67
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,280
So the way it works is you go to Instagram,
67

68
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,170
you go find the video you want, and then you click 
on the three dots and click copy link, and then
68

69
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,510
it'll automatically work. So I'll show you how to do it.
69

70
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,300
So you can just hit Go to Instagram, now it opens up your 
Instagram, puts you in there, and then you can just find
70

71
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,310
the photo you want. So we can go back to Gary Vee
71

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,510
and we can pick a video.
72

73
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,760
So how about this one? Cool.
73

74
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,430
OK.
74

75
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,600
So then what you want to do is up here, top 
three buttons, like I was saying, hit Copy link,
75

76
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,170
and then just flip back to Instant Save,
76

77
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,980
and there you go.
77

78
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,590
So it automatically detects that you've done it, and 
you have it right there, and then if you want to
78

79
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,960
share it, you can hit the Share button, 
if you want to trash it, trash it.
79

80
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,400
In my experience, you have to do this sometimes 
a couple of times to make it actually save,
80

81
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,870
but such is the way with Android.
81

82
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,960
So when you go to your photos, you have camera and 
whatever, and then it's right here, usually has its
82

83
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,920
own folder, and that's where you can get access to these videos.
83

84
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,140
OK, so that's how you do it on Android.
84

85
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:45,440
Now, let me show you how you would do it 
on the computer from say, like, YouTube.
85

86
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,030
YouTube honestly is a giant goldmine of videos.
86

87
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,170
I mean, you can find videos on anything out there.
87

88
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,980
So I think it's incredibly useful.
88

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,670
But you will notice that YouTube video quality just 
varies wildly, so sometimes you get high res, beautiful
89

90
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:07,350
stuff, and other times you get stuff that was shot on 
like a really old camera and it's just low resolution.
90

91
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,620
So you have to be kind of picky with that.
91

92
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:16,700
The tool I use is called Clip Grab and you go to 
clipgrab.org, it works for both Mac and PC,
92

93
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,690
it just depends on which computer 
you're on, that's what it'll show you.
93

94
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,750
So you download it, and once you actually install it,
94

95
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,630
I'll show you what it looks like.
95

96
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,410
So it looks like this and it's fairly simple. So there's two 
different ways that you can find videos. One, you can search
96

97
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:36,470
through their system, and it's the same rough search 
as if you search through YouTube, or you can go
97

98
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,130
directly to Download and just copy 
the link of the video that you want.
98

99
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,720
So let's say we found a YouTube video.
99

100
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,310
What do we want?
100

101
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,050
Okay, let's say boomerang tricks, this one. Sure, why not?
101

102
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,190
OK.
102

103
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,280
I could take this link up here and go over to Clip 
Grab, and there you go, it automatically copied it.
103

104
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,270
I could take this link up here and go over to Clip 
Grab, and there you go, it automatically copied it.
104

105
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,430
But if it didn't for some reason, I could just copy and paste it.
105

106
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:00,740
OK.
106

107
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,320
And then it pulls up the title of it.
107

108
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,400
If that's what you want, good.
108

109
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,110
If that's what you want, good.
109

110
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,810
You can play around with the quality if you want.
110

111
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,480
Sometimes it will just tell you straight up
111

112
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,600
you don't have HD available for this, only 480, 
but whatever. You can change the format
112

113
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,220
if for some reason you care about that.
113

114
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,690
But otherwise, I just hit Grab this clip 
and pick where I want to save it.
114

115
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,010
OK.
115

116
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,730
I'll let that download and then I'll 
show you it in here in a second.
116

117
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,740
Otherwise, you can just do search.
117

118
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:32,180
So if I did the same thing, it would probably just 
show up like that, if I said "boomerang trick." 
118

119
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,690
So if I did the same thing, it would probably just 
show up like that, if I said "boomerang trick." 
119

120
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,920
OK.
120

121
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,920
So then I could click that and then it 
automatically populates it for me.
121

122
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,330
Great.
122

123
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,620
Now, while this is downloading,
123

124
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,910
I will tell you that YouTube is kind of a 
minefield when it comes to copyright.
124

125
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,650
Earlier we talked about Creative Commons
with regards to photos, but with YouTube,
125

126
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,220
that's quite a bit harder to find.
126

127
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,450
It's harder to tell if they're Creative Commons or what.
127

128
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:03,170
So typically, my advice is that you 
should find a clip that you want, okay,
128

129
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,410
and if it's not watermarked, doesn't have 
a logo in the corner, you can use it,
129

130
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,820
and then in your post
130

131
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:15,340
generally what I like to see is you say, you know,
"Contact me for copyright" somewhere in your
131

132
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:23,080
caption, or "DM for copyright," something like that. 
So if the person who made this finds out that you
132

133
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,180
have it and they actually care, then they can tell you 
that and you can take it down, because a lot of
133

134
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,580
times, people find that you used it and they don't care.
134

135
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,300
They're perfectly fine, they wanted it to 
get shared out there. At the minimum,
135

136
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,280
sometimes they'll ask just for attribution, so all you have 
to do is say at the bottom where you got the clip from,
136

137
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,940
sometimes they'll ask just for attribution, so all you have 
to do is say at the bottom where you got the clip from,
137

138
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,090
and that's usually it. Very rarely you have
someone come and say "No, you can't use it."
138

139
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,700
That usually only happens when you take videos from, 
say, like, big companies or companies that spend a
139

140
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,910
lot of money on their production.
140

141
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:00,310
So that's kind of a minefield. Otherwise, I think
it's just impossible to only work with things that
141

142
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,140
are in Creative Commons, because 90% of the videos 
out there are just a big question mark, and I don't
142

143
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,680
think the content creators think that much about it.
143

144
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,540
OK, now that it's done, you can just go to Show
in Finder or Open downloaded file - of course, this
144

145
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,230
is different if you are on a PC or a Mac, but
it's virtually the same, so there we go.
145

146
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,370
is different if you are on a PC or a Mac, but
it's virtually the same, so there we go.
146

147
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,730
You open it and we have the video.
147

148
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,550
Now we can do whatever we want with it. Cool.
148

149
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,010
OK.
149

150
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,240
So those are ways of getting videos to use in your posts.
150

151
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,770
It depends if you're on iOS or Android.
151

152
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,430
There's just 101 apps for saving things.
152

153
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:36,320
Those are the ones I showed you that for me at least 
are the least obnoxious and work consistently.
153

154
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,690
And then if you want to grab them off YouTube,
I use Clip Grab and I think that works pretty well.
154

155
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,510
Other than that, pay attention to copyright.
155

156
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,190
If you can, try to be careful, give attribution if 
you're open to it, and make sure that there's at
156

157
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,310
least an avenue for them to contact 
you if they care about the copyright.
157

158
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,380
So, with that being said, see you guys in the next lecture.
