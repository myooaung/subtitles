00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,230
Hey guys welcome back OK.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,530
This lecture where we're going to do it is we're going to talk about scheduling post in advance and

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,930
we're going to do it with an app that you speak called later Graham but now it's just called later.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,380
Now what on screen first came out it was the case that every time you post something you had to be at

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,720
your phone and you had to do it with your fingers.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,440
Right.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,080
Then Instagram started adding things like a web version.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,370
Then they started adding in an API that other apps could actually use some of their information.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,190
And then finally they started allowing people to use apps that could publish to Instagram.

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:39,380
Now Facebook and Twitter they give complete control over their platforms to third party applications

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,190
but Instagram for whatever reason is still kind of skittish on that topic.

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,860
But what we have now are tools that can help you do a lot of different things.

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,950
But the main thing we're focused on is being able to schedule in advance being able to schedule these

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,600
things in advance just means that you're not chained to your phone and it's incredibly useful also because

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,980
you can do it on the web.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,800
The web is way easier to deal with.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,560
In general it's just it helps you with organization quite a bit.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,070
Now there are a lot of tools that do this and you're welcome to try other ones.

19
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,530
Some of the tools we talked about used before claim to offer a post scheduling but I'm sticking with

20
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,850
later ground which is probably the best I've used for this.

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,230
The other option is buffer.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,020
And I thought about using them but they're probably equal buffer.

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,330
And later sorry as prices go you can use the free version.

24
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,890
They limit you to using one account and only a certain amount of posts per month but you can use them

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,720
see if you like them.

26
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,780
And then if you like them then you can actually pay for them it's only like nine dollars a month something

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,230
like that.

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,500
So check it out.

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,170
And when you sign up you they ask you to authenticate your account just to make sure that you are the

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,300
owner you are a business account so you should have your Facebook account attached.

31
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,720
So that should be easy once you get through.

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,390
It looks like this.

33
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,910
Now you have your calendar near the media library you have conversations analytics certainly post and

34
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,460
then a tool they call link in bio.

35
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,640
Now the calendar is the thing we care about the most.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,280
So the way that this works is I can upload all of my pre-made media including stuff that I have used

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,590
before and I can dump it in here.

38
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:17,580
And then I can set them up here and around here whenever I actually want to post and then I can look

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,320
at them in the month view.

40
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:26,220
You can even drag the blocks around in the preview and it'll automatically reorganized your posting

41
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,000
schedule.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,050
I think that's pretty cool.

43
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,400
You can also do some pretty cool stuff like sharing your calendar down here gives you a preview link.

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,010
And if you give it to someone then they can actually see what's coming up on your calendar.

45
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,030
That's pretty useful.

46
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,390
You can also add people if you work with them.

47
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,510
So he would be like a grid.

48
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,670
Want to see the feed.

49
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,010
I can just scroll down through all of my posted ones and upcoming ones and here's what's happening in

50
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:57,120
the future and here's my record so far of posting I only started posting yesterday but I'll start picking

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,260
up the pace as we go through it.

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,390
So I wanted to schedule something I could drag and drop it in here if I wanted to.

53
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,040
Or I could use Dropbox or Google Drive which we are to use Dropbox that perfect so I can actually just

54
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,060
attach it.

55
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:17,020
So I'll go to the station posts here and I can just pick whichever one that I want to add in.

56
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,400
So let's say the Riverbend school is one I could do.

57
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,570
I could go back and interactive TV series.

58
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,320
OK so two selected.

59
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,760
Now if I hit shoes I actually throw this in the pile.

60
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,300
Then what happens is it has to load preview thumbnails so they can actually see what they are but once

61
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:47,420
they do load Well you can do as you can and labels and you can add notes so I could add notes about

62
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,770
whether or not this piece of video is done.

63
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,360
I can do labels just so I can say video.

64
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:02,240
So if I wanted to add a label like a video and you know maybe there's something else that I thought

65
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,490
is relevant.

66
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:11,150
I know it's about education like education and then over here what I can do is and I can sort by labels

67
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,840
that I have.

68
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,150
So if I just wanted to look for video I could click video apply the label and it should just show me

69
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:23,450
whichever one I just tag that I'll be useful if for instance I was trying to felt my calendar and was

70
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,070
trying to follow a pattern and I didn't want to look at a bunch of photos that I'd made before I really

71
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,880
just wanted a video.

72
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,810
You can also do pretty interesting things like media usage so you can for instance sort by all unused

73
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,720
media or you can just look for ones that have been used.

74
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,300
It is something that we will do once we post something we'll see how well it works and we'll reposed

75
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,230
it if it does work and eventually get to a point where recycling more posts than we're actually creating.

76
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,560
But from our find just going with unused media now they click.

77
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,840
This is actually kind of exciting because I made the label video it already auto tagged it as video.

78
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,110
Now it's not on the calendar.

79
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,680
So have a quick business and actually do anything for me but I can add it and then later on I could

80
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,260
put it in there.

81
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,520
So let's say I wanted to post this.

82
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:16,520
Echo whatever so I could say create post right here OK now gives me the same exact setup that I had

83
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,400
on Instagram on the phone.

84
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,270
But I can't just do it here.

85
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,670
So when I can do is go over and grab the caption for this one.

86
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,680
It's called Echo.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,480
See like I said this one.

88
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:41,740
I'll grab the caption and the call to action and then we'll do up a server here.

89
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:49,900
Then I can do some of the regular cleaning that I would've done anyway so I could copy and paste those

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,190
blank spaces that I usually do.

91
00:05:52,330 --> 00:06:00,040
I wanted to so I would just say face that and then I have to go up here and then copy and paste it copy

92
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,760
this out of my notes.

93
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,680
And so I make sure that I don't have any extra spaces.

94
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,300
There you go.

95
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,310
And I can kind of do the same thing I would do.

96
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,600
It was actually in my posts.

97
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,280
Now if I wanted to add a Mowgli's beforehand so I don't have to do it on my phone what you can do is

98
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,380
if you go to the Web site Moji PDA here you can search for all the emojis and then just make sure that

99
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:34,270
you only sorting by ones that you've seen before or actually are on mobile phone so let's say I wanted

100
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,450
to TV show Black Mirror.

101
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,630
OK so I could put a TV.

102
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,480
So search for TV.

103
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,600
OK some television and I could copy that and throw it in here.

104
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,410
So black air space TV.

105
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,940
Active TV series I could use that one again.

106
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,710
Forward and over it.

107
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:02,510
They don't like new was added and another line break just for the sake of making it look good.

108
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,160
Copy and paste this again.

109
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,720
So see.

110
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,880
Let's break it up here.

111
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,770
There and that.

112
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,090
Ok cool.

113
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,530
So down here it says create my Lincoln bio page what they're trying to do is set you up with this other

114
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,730
feature that we'll talk about really briefly in a second but it's not always something to worry about.

115
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,570
Now what I can do is I can schedule it.

116
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,200
Now when exactly would I want to post it.

117
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,240
So what you can do is just follow the generic standards that we had before which were the peaks.

118
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:42,530
Whatever the best times were generically for Instagram users which was like 10 p.m. 2 a.m. and about

119
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,700

120
8:00 a.m. I think it was.

121
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:51,080
So those three peak points or you can just kind of go whenever you think it's convenient or based on

122
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,590
the other ones or if you have your own data you can go to icona Square and see when your users are most

123
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,270
active and most engaged and then use it based on that.

124
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,490
So what I'll do is I'll just have a post here and a couple of hours.

125
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,640
So EPM I'll post that.

126
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,240
So then I have notification.

127
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,850
So auto publish for Instagram is not available for video or multi photo posts.

128
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,510
Now if you're from the future and they fix this problem that's amazing.

129
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:23,570
But for videos what happens is it saves it and then it gives me a push notification on my phone and

130
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,550
then all I have to do is click through to their app and hit a button for whatever reason and I'm only

131
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,720
with people publishing videos from their phone.

132
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,700
I think eventually they'll change that though.

133
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,990
So it's safe.

134
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,980
Now I can see it on the schedule right.

135
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,600
It's scheduled for 8:00 o'clock and I can preview it and there it goes.

136
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,800
And so I can look at the preview and my whole goal was to keep the quotes always in a line.

137
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:57,350
Honestly I can only do that if I just keep the same pattern of two videos one photo two videos one photo.

138
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,930
OK.

139
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,440
So I'm not really going to worry over that one what I'll end up happening is it'll put the post here

140
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,220
in the next post it'll move it here.

141
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,410
But the next photo will be here so will always be in the same line.

142
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,790
I just can't keep it in one specific one but if I wanted to I could really organize this one with any

143
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,440
of my future posts coming up.

144
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,700
Now the best way of doing this is just to spend like two hours with all of your content.

145
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,390
Plan it out for a week and then you don't have to worry about it.

146
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,920
OK.

147
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:33,520
So we posted that now let's upload a photo post so we put a photo post to find this to be useful and

148
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,500
we'll schedule that as well.

149
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,950
Now when we schedule photos it can auto post I don't have to do that funky thing where I come in enough

150
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,480
to press a button so that's nice.

151
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,640
However with your hashtags you will have to remember to get on it add your hashtags after it posts which

152
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,680
can be pretty annoying but unfortunately that's kind of just the way it is the way you can get around

153
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,960
that those if you wanted to say go to your post.

154
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,280
It's right here.

155
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,950
Click and it opens up.

156
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:06,160
You could do something like this where you can take those clear line breaks and just copy and paste

157
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:14,900
a bunch of those so that it actually hides it at the bottom so we could do that.

158
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,700
Two three four and then we could copy your hash tags.

159
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,240
So that's one way of doing it if you want to.

160
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,690
How that works law.

161
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,120
You're going to have to get used to tweaking it and kind of playing around with it.

162
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,890
So I'm going to copy some of the hash tags I've used before and then tweak some of them.

163
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,940
Ok so like for instance I he doesn't work

164
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,160
activity doesn't really work.

165
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,870
Kickstarter smart doesn't work.

166
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,170
Not really trying to optimize my hashtags right now.

167
00:10:53,170 --> 00:11:05,970
We have a section on that design future of TV so it's really small on the

168
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,520
great TV.

169
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,760
We could try.

170
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,170
It's interesting.

171
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:21,140
TV interviews publicity to you you travel now.

172
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,630
We say that.

173
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,420
I love TV maybe TV.

174
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,940
So what else could we do.

175
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,540
Virtual reality maybe that's pretty similar to virtual reality.

176
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:42,830
OK so one more hash tag so I'll do something like.

177
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,350
I don't think you know it's not technically I have to use kind of in the same space.

178
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:47,790
OK.

179
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,050
So then I can save that and then when it post it it should actually be hidden unless the person manually

180
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,730
scrolls down to find it.

181
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,750
But worst case scenario what I can do is I can go in and copy it into the comments after it posts.

182
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,890
Ok so now we can check out some of the other sections.

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,480
So here is the media library so I can just sort of play around with all of the stuff I have here and

184
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,210
I'll fill that out as they go conversations is where I can see all of my likes and my comments and I

185
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,370
can delete the ones I don't like I can respond to the ones I like.

186
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,020
It's just a lot easier to do it in this and I can immediately see for instance like this person I can

187
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,520
see stats on them and as you can see if all the more people than they're being followed by so they're

188
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,290
probably going on a legitimate comment.

189
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:39,470
And same goes for this one so great then you can do things like post view if you want to just look at

190
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,760
the posts and only work on each post and just deal it that way.

191
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,110
Or you can look at the users see all the comments by one user and this is a great way to keep engagement

192
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,800
with your users to make sure that you are popular users that constantly post.

193
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,470
You always respond to them then they give you some analytics.

194
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,960
Now analytics are kind of the same thing as what you have any Konno Square to be honest.

195
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,820
I mean it's just going to give you summaries and how many comments you made and many followers you haven't

196
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:11,060
been able Beaubois if you upgrade to a pro it gives you some stats on like if you use their link bio

197
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:17,130
and just you can rank your posts by how well they did.

198
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,290
And if you want to see a graph you can click here and then you can scroll down and see the graphs specifically

199
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,020
for that.

200
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,490
So it's collecting my data.

201
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,470
It usually needs a certain amount of time.

202
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:31,520
OK now search and repost this is great for doing shouts if say I had a goal of doing one shout out a

203
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,680
day then I could use this and just search for things that I think might be interesting I might look

204
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:43,840
for hash tag innovation and just find something.

205
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,200
Let's just say you know theoretically I wanted to post somebody else's quote.

206
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,160
I think it looks fine doesn't really fit with my design but whatever.

207
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,770
So what I could do is just add that to my library and then add it to my library.

208
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:04,200
I have to say yes I know about the content but the law yes I agree and then.

209
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,610
Yeah.

210
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,140
Hyper again.

211
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:12,230
So if the calendar then I can create a post out of this post and it gives me all of the stuff they put

212
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,700
in there already.

213
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,730
So what I would do is I would change it right.

214
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,560
And then just make sure that I tagged the original person and that's pretty much how I would do it.

215
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,470
I hit save I'd pick a time and that's it.

216
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,480
So I can schedule it and make sure that I have one a day and that's generally like a pretty good healthy

217
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:29,870
diet.

218
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,220
Now if I want to get rid of this I just have to trash it right there and throws it away.

219
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,810
There we go.

220
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,950
I mean the last thing is the linked in bio.

221
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,460
And honestly we're not going to really deal with this until we get to the section on how to make money

222
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,500
with Instagram.

223
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,490
This is what this is is for retailers.

224
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,050
People are selling things.

225
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,990
They create an auto generated link that you can put in your captions or your bio and it takes them to

226
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,910
a mobile optimized Web site that shows them the things that are for sale.

227
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,470
And it just converts really well for Instagram and it also has a lot of trackings that you can optimize

228
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,510
that is very useful when we get to it but it's not.

229
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,480
We're talking about today.

230
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,010
All right so that's all we need to know about later for now.

231
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:10,340
You'll see in the follow along sections I will fill this up and as I tweak it and try to use some of

232
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,850
the more obscure features.

233
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,450
But this is enough to get in and get dirty.

234
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,770
I also encourage you guys to check out buffer if you think that might suit your needs better for the

235
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,460
most part they're really the same kind it depends which brand you like.

236
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,780
They both have to send messages to you to actually post it so just be aware of that.

237
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,020
All right.

238
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,400
That being said the next lecture.
