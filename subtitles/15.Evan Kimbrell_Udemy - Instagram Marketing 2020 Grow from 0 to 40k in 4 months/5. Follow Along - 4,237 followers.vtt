00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.650
He goes we'll come back.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.650
OK so this is day 17 or 18.

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.780
TURLEY sure.

4
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.550
I'm now in Slovenia.

5
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.600
I'm not the best recording environment but I just want to update you have been very active not terribly

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.180
but I can show you what's happened in the last two three days.

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.560
So pretty standard growth slow growth slow.

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.280
It's really kind of slowed down a little bit.

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.980
Notice here the per day growth is kind of all over the place.

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.990
So you can see we're headed to a summer in here where I only played 18 this on it.

11
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.240
Eighteen dollars on the 13th for whatever reason and the next day we had 80.

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.960
And then you know here we had 80 a couple times 100.

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.550
Yes.

14
00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.560
So that seems Wii my ranged anywhere from 50 to 160 but more commonly it's between 50 and 100 and it's

15
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.310
perfectly fine.

16
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.220
Again this is kind of a snowball thing.

17
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.070
So once you have more people then you get more engagement which means you get to shop higher on my cash

18
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.800
drag pages.

19
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.570
So you might actually get in the top post and then that's pretty much where a lot of things change.

20
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.140
So let's see where we're at.

21
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.850
OK so one thing I started doing was I started posting carousels.

22
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.870
Now the idea was that you're posting videos all the time so why not do a reoccurring kind of thing where

23
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:39.120
I take all of the best videos that five best videos of the last week and and post that because this

24
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.370
is an example of that one.

25
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.990
And I just put all of them into a carousel and then I put you know which one is your favorite.

26
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.410
And I listed them out and said tell us in the comments.

27
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.890
You know once you have actually more followers maybe people actually answer that.

28
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.730
But I don't know.

29
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.690
Anyway so that was the idea.

30
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.520
It's just basic as free content basically.

31
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.120
So I don't know if I do this daily or weekly or monthly.

32
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.510
Not really sure.

33
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.700
It looks like it's going to be above average for engagement which is good.

34
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.360
So probably something we can repeat it tells us something it just takes no time at all to do because

35
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.220
it's already just old.

36
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.060
You have to edit them any way.

37
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.370
What I tried doing was using new hash tags.

38
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.910
I got really kind of dug for some different ones here and unfortunately I don't think any of these have

39
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.220
have it on the top post page so I'm pretty doubtful now on the things I've been doing.

40
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:48.060
I started using Jarvi to output very large list of hash tags and then I'm just going through them and

41
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.130
removing the bad ones that don't make any sense and then looking at some of the ones I'm not really

42
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.430
entirely sure of.

43
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.820
One of the great things about Tarby is when you do output your hashtags and he goes I'm talking I'll

44
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.690
go back to the advanced hash tag section is that it automatically filters it by number of posts.

45
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.600
Which is great.

46
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.610
Be a little more helpful for me if I knew like how many likes average likes the top posts have but that's

47
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.310
just not something they poll anyway.

48
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.150
So now where I can do is I can just kind of post a set in a range of these.

49
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.440
And then if for some reason my engagements are lower than I expected then I can for the next post then

50
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.700
lower them like go and find less popular ones because I'm personally trying to shoot for the top post.

51
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.060
I've also been trying to compile suggested users are starting to add that to the original pile that

52
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.670
I had before.

53
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.720
The idea is that I want to start doing shout for shouts and collaboration.

54
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.350
As soon as possible the plan is to do it once it got to 5000.

55
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.260
So I'm kind of getting ready for that.

56
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.010
I'll be at 5000 any day now.

57
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.560
Yeah.

58
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.490
So really that's just an outreach thing.

59
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.720
Once I have a list of just tons and tons of them then it's just a matter of e-mailing all of them.

60
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:12.560
Another update on the V.P. s I have created our first zombie kind of was just like a poke and prod.

61
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.570
I wanted to get in and kind of see what it would look like if you know I was using it in the way that

62
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.530
I thought.

63
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.550
All right so you can see the zombie right here.

64
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.120
Was it an innovation.

65
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.340
And again it was kind of a poke and prod.

66
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.780
I just wanted to see because it just updated some of their settings for how many interactions you can

67
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.340
do.

68
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.390
And I just want to see how that worked and then kind of conceptualized the council more once I have

69
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.400
an idea that works and I'll start replicating it.

70
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:49.680
But right now it's just running the basic kind of set up where it's follows the minimum amount of people

71
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.690
and slowly over time kind of cranks it up.

72
00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:01.130
So you can see here just like 565 likes a day by 56 follows on 387.

73
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.000
Technically the limit for these are eight hundred each.

74
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.770
So I have plenty of room to spare but it's like a brand new account so I don't want to push it.

75
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.390
We can show you see my father sitting so I have it for instance like follow a maximum 175 to 200 per

76
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.120
day increasing it 25 each day.

77
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.030
Eight hundred.

78
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.220
That's it that's like moderately aggressive.

79
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.100
I think it's fine.

80
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.450
I did run into one issue where the count disappeared for like an hour.

81
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.370
It turns out I had to verify a phone number.

82
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.010
OK.

83
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.360
And Jarvi actually does that for you which is bizarre.

84
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.180
I think I ended up using a burner.

85
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:50.280
And we talked about this if you go back to the robot section or use Jarvi used a burner an app called

86
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.860
Burn or so.

87
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.930
Yeah.

88
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.950
That's running D'Arby has kind of having some issues right now and running in a VPN I'm a cheapo.

89
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.700
So the GPL I pay for is like $10 a month.

90
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.610
So it's incredibly slow.

91
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.750
But yeah and you know for the most part that's how that's working.

92
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:15.130
Other than that recently just got of getting in the habit of posting stories regularly.

93
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.620
Just why not.

94
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.020
I mean the thing is that writers are already giving us singular lines.

95
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.510
We want to hear and have a singular a line that takes no time to put these together.

96
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.950
Did it run into a problem actually.

97
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:34.950
So I hadn't one I hired another person and she is for us to take over the posting of the accounts.

98
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:42.780
And the reason why is because the original person who was doing this was doing it in Europe and just

99
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.840
the timing just wasn't right because some of the peak times when we get united states are just kind

100
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.870
of on time.

101
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:56.670
If you're in Europe so I needed someone in the U.S. So she's decent at doing this.

102
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:03.840
She's kind of going through a training process here and just showing her what what we're doing and how

103
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.710
we're doing it.

104
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.880
I wrote her a big guide on how she's supposed to do everything.

105
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.390
So it looks like this.

106
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:19.200
So just kind of details how often we post how to use later and how to use Trello How do you update that.

107
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.770
You add or captions or you an explanation of how you put in double line breaks because this is really

108
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.560
weird.

109
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:32.940
You have to be fully aware of them before you actually start to this otherwise you are going to be confused

110
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.480
and see.

111
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:34.940
Yeah.

112
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.820
Weinberg's anyway.

113
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:44.100
So I will always post this in the resources we talked about making these and I go over this one way

114
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.220
more in depth in the section.

115
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.810
Are we talking about accelerating your content production to look for it there.

116
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.690
So what I was saying is the new person is using a Motorola G4.

117
00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:00.660
And for whatever reason it just took an odd shape or phone it's five and a half inches.

118
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:07.490
And so when she was posting stories like we made them seem the right size for stories.

119
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.960
But when she posted that they would crop weird.

120
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:17.620
So the logo getting cut off and the outro story and the other one just looked weird.

121
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:25.710
So we started to do is displayed around the cropping and re-export and all of the videos into smaller

122
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.850
sizes that now fit when she posts them.

123
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.470
So it's not a problem with posts.

124
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.810
That's that's for sure.

125
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.990
But it is definitely a problem with stories for some reason.

126
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.100
Anyway so that's what I'm doing.

127
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:44.520
Not a whole lot kind of building up to a point I think once we get to Shelfer shouts going that'll be

128
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:51.780
a big inflection point and once we start figuring out a pattern that works for the zombies that will

129
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.130
be a big point too.

130
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:59.510
You guys probably saw me do this in the zombie section so you might see some repetitiveness but I'll

131
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:06.780
start with that being said I am moving back on to Montenegro and I will hopefully update in the next

132
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.700
couple days.

133
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.130
CNN.
