00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.570
Hey guys welcome back OK this lecture we're going to do is we're going to take a look at the software

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.670
that will be using neuron or zombies that's called Jarvi and then we'll look at one of the options for

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.690
gang of.

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.350
You don't remember VPM is a virtual private server different than a virtual private network virtual

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.040
private server.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:27.060
What that is is it's almost like your own independent machine that runs on someone else's server.

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.190
It looks very very similar to your operating system on your computer.

8
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.280
Let's say I log into my computer I log in through my user account.

9
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.210
I see my desktop I see all of my files.

10
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.020
It's kind of the same thing except the hardware that's running that is going to be somewhere else.

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.280
And then we use the internet connection to connect to that.

12
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.350
It's not super complicated it can get complicated.

13
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.690
But for our purposes we keep it pretty simple.

14
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.390
So let's first look at the system they're going to use called Jarvi.

15
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.010
Now this is kind of what it looks like now Jarvi is a remake of an old system called mass following

16
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.360
and not following was one of the most popular Instagram automation tools on automation and management

17
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.350
tools but it ended up getting banned and shutting down.

18
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.250
And so this is kind of the next generation of it.

19
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.740
They kind of took a lot of mistakes at mass follow orders following their followers had and they tried

20
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.010
to improve on it to make sure that you break all of the rules.

21
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.520
It also has pretty much the same feature set.

22
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.880
They just added a lot to it.

23
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.410
Now the reason why I'm teaching guys how to use Jarvi is because I'm fairly confident that even if Jarvi

24
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.240
gets shut down there'll be another system that pops up and does the exact same thing.

25
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.390
So really you only have to understand the basics of it and you should be fine.

26
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.600
This is what the company's website looks like.

27
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.740
It's not designed to be beautiful it's actually pretty simple and they just kind of focus on shoving

28
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.850
as many features as they possibly can into one system.

29
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.260
They do things like Facebook and Twitter automation as well as Instagram's if you end up doing it yourself

30
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.150
this actually saves you a lot of time.

31
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.220
It helps you do things like post scheduling.

32
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.230
So I'll show you in the coming up lectures how we can schedule posts using Jarvi.

33
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.980
It does the same follow on follow like calm and direct message automation that we we used to have asked

34
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.140
for and at one point I was using social pop but they cover a lot of that too.

35
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.980
So it is it is pretty useful in that if you just want to use Jarvi Well you can use that for everything

36
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.420
and you don't actually have to use a lot of other softwares or having any stats to that are very similar

37
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.320
to what you might get with like iconv Square.

38
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.350
But I generally find iconv scored a lot easier to use now so you really quickly what the software looks

39
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.860
like.

40
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.750
Keep in mind you dont need to study it right this second and the follow up lectures will go over actually

41
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.630
what the sections of the app do.

42
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.630
So it looks like this.

43
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.590
Now you just noticed I just teleported to a different computer and this is my V-P guess its actually

44
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.820
a Windows machine somewhere in Atlanta.

45
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.630
Now this is where I have all of my zombies and you can see we actually have quite a few of them and

46
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.740
it works just like any other software its kind of slow and ugly and buggy but its got a lot of features

47
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.690
baked into it.

48
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.140
OK.

49
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.350
So that should whet your appetite to understand what it looks like.

50
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.370
And in the future what we'll do is we'll jump in here and show you how to use it.

51
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.020
OK.

52
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.330
Now back to how to set up a VPN s.

53
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.770
Now there's two different ways that you can run Jarvi.

54
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.500
Now you can run it on your computer or you can run it on a VPN.

55
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.400
There's a pretty key distinction here though is that if you run it on your computer it's a system that

56
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.280
just runs on your computer.

57
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.740
And when you close your laptop lid or you turn off your computer it stops running.

58
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.680
So that's something you have to keep in mind.

59
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.200
If you're someone who wants to use the box features which are making zombies you do and you don't really

60
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.740
want to have to worry about how long you have your laptop open or your computer on or you know if you

61
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.510
are trying to do like video editing at the same time it might actually compete for resources on your

62
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.400
computer.

63
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.670
They don't worry about that.

64
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.330
You should do a VPN.

65
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.680
Now the VPN that allows us to do is to upload this software application to a computer that's always

66
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.250
on.

67
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:28.020
So our VPN is always going to be running and that allows Jarvi to run unimpeded and to use the full

68
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.940
breadth of its features.

69
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.640
Now one thing to point out is if you guys are a Mac user which I am you have to do the GPS because there

70
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.400
actually is no Jarvi version for Mac.

71
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.290
So it actually kind of forces us to do the VTES perfectly fine because I think that's the way you should

72
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.640
do it anyway.

73
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.340
Now what I use for my VPN is just a service called green cloud.

74
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.570
Now the reason why is just because Jarvi works with this company so they recommend using them.

75
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.870
So you know everything on this Web site is tailored towards are doing Jarvi software.

76
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.230
Right.

77
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:08.290
So I don't know exactly how in my head what exactly they would have to do to their servers or setting

78
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.690
some make it such that it works well with Jervy.

79
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:18.550
I kind of just assume that there's a lot going on back and forth in a collaboration such that this probably

80
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.430
saves me a little bit of headaches.

81
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.370
So anyway it's green cloud veeps dot com.

82
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.930
Are they the cheapest in the world.

83
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.180
Not really what you can do though is you can get a VPN for about eight dollars a month.

84
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.650
That's their cheapest version.

85
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.850
So if you go to their website right here you can see that they have three main offers of dedicated servers.

86
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.370
K.V. MVP apps and Windows apps.

87
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.310
Now generally speaking we don't have to worry about these two K.V. EMS and dedicated servers just because

88
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.180
Jervy it runs constantly but it doesn't use up that much in terms of resources.

89
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.830
So we don't need something really hard core like if I was running an actual web application thousands

90
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.310
of users that I might run a dedicated server but for something this simple I'm just going to stick with

91
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.460
whatever they have that's cheap and easy.

92
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.540
Now what you want to do is go to Windows because their thing runs on Windows so this is going to be

93
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.280
automatically configured to run on as a Windows operating system.

94
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.080
I think they give you Windows 2000 or something or Windows XP.

95
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.840
It's the turn of the millennium version so it's really old.

96
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:30.010
But they do that because it's just not really necessary to install some of the newer Windows because

97
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.200
they're too large and they take up too many resources and so by keeping it bare bones we can actually

98
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.330
focus on whatever it is that we are using the VPN to begin with and not have to dedicate resources to

99
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.530
running the operating system.

100
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.590
So over here you can just click Windows CPS and you can see what they have.

101
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.170
So for the most part they cost you about 8 bucks a month.

102
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.000
They believe quarterly.

103
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.550
And so that's just kind of a cost that you have to take into this.

104
00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:03.300
So we want to go to a budget and to be honest budget windows those are pretty much all you would need

105
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:09.550
until you start having say a 100 different zombie accounts.

106
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:15.160
In my situation I think I paid a little bit more like 15 bucks a month so that I have a little bit faster

107
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.500
on just because I found that my computer my virtual private server was really really slow and I was

108
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.810
just driving me crazy.

109
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.230
But if I was a little bit more of a patient person I could easily get away with one of these $8 a month

110
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.310
ones or $10 a month.

111
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.100
So if you look at here it'll give you the stats so it's you're basically borrowing resources almost

112
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.470
like you buying a computer.

113
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.790
So two gigs of RAM for gigs around 8 gigs of RAM will give you some storage but you don't actually need

114
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:46.360
that because it costs nothing and Dharavi requires storage and it says like what your processor is again.

115
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.280
You don't think you'd ever really need to go over say like the budget 3 and that's only something I'd

116
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.500
really do if I had to 300 zombies if you're just going to do 20.

117
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.420
Then you can be perfectly fine getting away with this do you're Blazey like me or you get annoyed by

118
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.590
slow things and Budget to also works as well.

119
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.680
So we can check out when my client area looks like.

120
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.950
OK so when you actually set up an account it looks like this you'll have over here and services active

121
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.950
products as you see I have a budget to and I call it zombies.

122
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.550
If we go to services you can see that I actually had my old one called Innovation accounts and I thought

123
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.790
I was too slow so I upgraded and I canceled it.

124
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.620
So now I think I've had 20 bucks a month.

125
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.520
If you want to look at the settings just click here and it just looks like this.

126
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.630
You want to upgrade it here you can request cancellation right here.

127
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.620
There's only really two important things right here which is that they'll tell you your hostname and

128
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.570
that's something you said.

129
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.500
Then they'll give you your primary IP.

130
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.520
That's very important.

131
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.890
And then your username and password.

132
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:48.270
So the way you would access this is by using a software program that allows you to tunnel into the CPS

133
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:54.660
and then access it kind of like you saw me do just earlier in the way you do that as you would point

134
00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:01.210
it towards this dome this IP and then you'd use this username and password to basically get into it.

135
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:06.300
And then the rest of it's just you know if you want to reset it powered off power and on etc. etc..

136
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.020
So when you do sign up for one if you do decide to use green cloud.

137
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.750
Yes this is essentially what will happen you'll buy something like this.

138
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:17.300
It'll give you this basic information and then it's up to you to connect to it.

139
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.430
Now what I use to connect and honestly it's the easiest one I've ever found.

140
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.060
It's just Microsoft remote desktop.

141
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.190
It's an application that looks like this.

142
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:33.000
It's super simple works on both Mac and Windows and really all you have to do is go here once you install

143
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.120
it.

144
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.460
Click next and you can give it a connection name.

145
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.550
That's just for you.

146
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.980
And then give it the IP address.

147
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.820
Remember our IP address is right there.

148
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.370
And then it will ask for a gateway which you don't actually need.

149
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.320
Asked for credentials which you do need and put those.

150
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.600
And then everything else is you just kind of leave it alone right.

151
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.600
If you're using 0 as 10 then do as 10 native If you're using Windows then you would go to custom and

152
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.190
I would just ask for Windows.

153
00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.160
The rest of it.

154
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.730
Honestly I wouldn't even screw with it because everything else is pretty much set up the way you'd want

155
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.360
it to be.

156
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.080
There's some other advanced settings but I really wouldn't touch them unless you know what you're doing

157
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.730
so I wouldn't really dive into that.

158
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.870
But once you set it up you'll have it will add it down here.

159
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.460
So a lot of people have multiple veeps so they might have multiple ones.

160
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.470
And then once you have it like that it's really as simple as just double clicking it to log on when

161
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.580
you first used this.

162
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.820
You'll do this.

163
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.910
It'll take you to here you'll see a bunch of log in stuff saying that it's logging in it's using the

164
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:35.130
password and then essentially you'll have it look exactly like a Windows computer.

165
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.580
You'll have a button to click for the administrator you click that you log in.

166
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.920
You don't have to do a pass or a meeting.

167
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.810
And then once you do that you just hit this screen your desktop.

168
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:51.180
Just like any other computer then it's really just up to you to use the embedded Internet Explore or

169
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:56.430
to install Google Chrome if you want to to go to Jarvi to then install it and then having it you'll

170
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.660
have it run here and it's pretty easy from there.

171
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.110
Once you have everything set up.

172
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.930
One thing that I think is very important that you do really quickly is just go to your browsers and

173
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.590
do what we did before which is what is my IP dot com.

174
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:18.830
Now they tell you what your IP address is in the green cloud as admin panel.

175
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.030
But I've found that sometimes it fluctuates.

176
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.440
Here at the very end.

177
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.040
So what you ought to do is just go find your public IP address.

178
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.670
We'll be right here and then write that down.

179
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:32.250
Now the reason why you want to write that down is just because later on when we start using IP addresses

180
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:40.950
whether or not you use high proxies or whatever some of them will require authentication through a IP

181
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:41.500
address.

182
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:47.940
So all you have to do is go to whatever your IP service is with shared proxies or high proxies or there's

183
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:53.760
a million different providers and then tell them that hey this is the IP address right there that I

184
00:11:53.760 --> 00:12:00.180
want you to validate from because what's going to happen is start putting our proxy IPs these up here

185
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.950
into our Jarvi account.

186
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:07.790
You just need to make sure that when Jarvi tries to use a proxy IP from up here which you will still

187
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:13.200
take these IPs and are dedicating them to accounts that every time it tries to connect Instagram to

188
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:21.390
do something on your account it has access to the IPs because your system is already set up to recognize

189
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.290
that virtual private servers IP address.

190
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.570
And to give it the green light otherwise you're just going to have a bad time.

191
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:28.100
All right guys.

192
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.940
That's it for now.

193
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.380
Green cloud is the one I just showed you how to use.

194
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.040
We also used Microsoft's remote server.

195
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:40.730
A very simple application to easily tunnel into your VPN.

196
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:47.970
It only takes three points of information just the IP address the administrator name and the password

197
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.210
to get India of us.

198
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.930
And then we both green cloud G.P.A. that's just about 10 bucks a month.

199
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.640
I think it's pretty reasonable although I'm not crazy about the service just because it's pretty bare

200
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.700
bones.

201
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.180
Plenty of other providers out there if you find a better one.

202
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.440
I'm not surprised.

203
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.290
All right guys the next question what I want to do is show you how to set this up with Amazon AWOS.

204
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.170
Why.

205
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.320
Well because Amazon AWOS gives all new users a free year.

206
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.580
So for those of you just really trying to touch just test this out and don't want to spend $10 a month

207
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.140
this is a free version.

208
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.940
Slow but it's free.

209
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.650
And then you can kind of see whether or not you like it.

210
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.130
And if you want to upgrade.

211
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.720
OK.

212
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:25.580
