Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,590
OK, let's go over some real quick additional criteria
that will help you narrow down your list of possible
2

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,480
names. And this list I'm going to give you consists
of one do and then several please don'ts.
3

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,810
First up, you clearly know what your business does, and
probably know a decent amount about the space you're in.
4

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,770
First up, you clearly know what your business does, and
probably know a decent amount about the space you're in.
5

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,820
Well, if you're stuck for a name,
6

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,760
here's a quick little hack that might work for you,
7

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:31,620
if it's possible. Now, think to yourself, "Who are the
biggest brands in my space?" Or, more specifically, "Who
8

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,650
are the brands in my space that
have large Instagram accounts?"
9

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,100
Not every big company is big on Instagram.
10

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,040
Generally speaking, magazines and online publications
are in pretty much every niche and they almost
11

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,240
always have big accounts, but other big
companies are there potentially as well,
12

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,720
and hey, there might even be some of those
themed pages we talked about before.
13

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,490
You know, those pages that aren't really owned by a
person or a business, but they just post things based
14

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,830
on some general topic or theme.
15

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:08,160
There are usually big Instagram accounts in every single niche,
I think the stat is 80% of businesses have an Instagram account.
16

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,170
There are usually big Instagram accounts in every single niche,
I think the stat is 80% of businesses have an Instagram account.
17

18
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,770
So...
18

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,310
So, for example, let's say you sell travel.
19

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:12,830
OK.
20

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,080
What's the biggest account out there for
showing pictures of, say, landscapes?
21

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,120
Probably Nat Geo.
22

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,730
I mean, you could probably find a bunch of them.
23

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,830
What if you sell tools or machines?
24

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,040
Ok, I don't know.
25

26
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,910
Is there a big themed account that just shows
off interesting robots or processes?
26

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,200
Anyway, if you know some of these already, then good,
27

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,130
and if you don't, just try searching a little bit in
the search section of the app, and then see if you
28

29
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,930
can find some monster accounts.
29

30
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,450
When I say monster accounts, I mean accounts with
followers in the millions, or at least, you know, half
30

31
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,170
a million to a million, things that are
at least famous, everyone knows it.
31

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,640
OK, so when you find some of these accounts,
and trust me, it's a when, not an if,
32

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,840
ask yourself, "Can you use their name in your name?"
Now, specifically, can the first word in your name be the
33

34
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,570
same or similar to theirs. Now, why?
34

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,560
same or similar to theirs. Now, why?
35

36
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:10,110
Because when someone goes and searches for that
monster account, and a lot of people do usually, as they
36

37
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,090
type the full name in,
37

38
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,340
you actually have a good chance of popping up as well,
potentially benefiting enormously from that free visibility.
38

39
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,590
you actually have a good chance of popping up as well,
potentially benefiting enormously from that free visibility.
39

40
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,170
So let's say, if you're in, like, the entrepreneurship space.
40

41
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,200
Well, this one is actually pretty easy.
41

42
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,520
If you put in entrepreneur as your first word, because, well, a lot of people go to entrepreneur.com, they're a big Instagram account,
42

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,750
If you put in entrepreneur as your first word, because, well, a lot of people go to entrepreneur.com, they're a big Instagram account,
43

44
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,930
they have 1.3 million followers,
44

45
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,480
so in that case all you have to do is just put entrepreneur
in your name, and put it at the front, to front load it,
45

46
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,590
so in that case all you have to do is just put entrepreneur
in your name, and put it at the front, to front load it,
46

47
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,670
so when they search for the .com, they'll
actually see you in the same list.
47

48
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,690
Let's say your niche is gadgets and tech products.
48

49
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,120
OK.
49

50
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,830
Try putting, let's say, wired as the first part of your name.
50

51
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,240
Try putting, let's say, wired as the first part of your name.
51

52
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,840
Wired is close to something like 700,000 followers.
52

53
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,940
Anyway, these are easy wins.
53

54
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,340
Now, obviously, make sure the name you're using
isn't so unique that you're clearly ripping them off.
54

55
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:09,870
I couldn't say, like, if I was showing off hotel spaces,
probably hard to put Airbnb in the first part of my name.
55

56
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,680
I couldn't say, like, if I was showing off hotel spaces,
probably hard to put Airbnb in the first part of my name.
56

57
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:16,020
Let's say there's a theoretical account called Grand Hotels, you could get away with saying Grand Hotel and then something else.
57

58
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,490
Let's say there's a theoretical account called Grand Hotels, you could get away with saying Grand Hotel and then something else.
58

59
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,170
The point is, if it's too unique, then
you kind of have copyright issues.
59

60
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,310
You might end up getting a cease and desist later,
60

61
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,780
and if you get popular enough and people start to think
your account is actually run by the other account,
61

62
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,130
well, that's no good.
62

63
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,850
Also, make sure that the account is relevant.
63

64
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,140
Also, make sure that the account is relevant.
64

65
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:41,280
If you sell gravel, please don't put TheRockSeller, even though TheRock has 101 million followers at the time of this recording.
65

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,380
If you sell gravel, please don't put TheRockSeller, even though TheRock has 101 million followers at the time of this recording.
66

67
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,650
Yes, The Rock has more than three times as many
followers as Barack Obama and Oprah combined.
67

68
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,890
Now, don't be shocked if you can't make it work.
68

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,870
It's just nice if you can. Let's go over some don'ts
69

70
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,460
that might potentially save you
from being Instagram notorious.
70

71
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,950
Now, first off try not to use an account that already has
several running accounts that are a variation of your name.
71

72
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,960
Now, first off try not to use an account that already has
several running accounts that are a variation of your name.
72

73
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,470
It's OK if they're similar and you are
trying to ride off of a big account.
73

74
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:17,550
I'm talking about, like, let's say you were Cute
Cupcakes, and there was a cute.cupcakes and a
74

75
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,280
cute_cupcakes, and a CutestCupcakes, and all three of these accounts were active, frequently posting and had a lot of followers.
75

76
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,680
cute_cupcakes, and a CutestCupcakes, and all three of these accounts were active, frequently posting and had a lot of followers.
76

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,510
Now, you can tell if they're active but just going to
their account and then seeing when the last post was,
77

78
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,390
top left is the last post. When you click the last post,
at the bottom of the image you can see a time stamp.
78

79
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,810
top left is the last post. When you click the last post,
at the bottom of the image you can see a time stamp.
79

80
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,770
Now, if you have a bunch of accounts that
are similar, but none are active or serious,
80

81
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,740
then in this scenario, it's not really a big deal.
81

82
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,140
People are going to search for you and you will clearly
show up at the top of your respective search.
82

83
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:55,180
The problem is when you have active competitors
that at the very beginning might be bigger than you.
83

84
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,630
So, kind of awkward when you do cute cupcakes,
and someone's looking for cute cupcakes,
84

85
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,260
but the one that's very similar has more followers, you're
going to get a lot of people going to that account instead.
85

86
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,550
but the one that's very similar has more followers, you're
going to get a lot of people going to that account instead.
86

87
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,890
So, check out your name copycats, and then make
sure they aren't running the show in search.
87

88
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,440
Here's a do, OK?
88

89
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,160
Keep it simple.
89

90
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,360
The fewer the characters, the better.
90

91
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,510
Say this with me. Fewer characters are better.
91

92
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,470
It's easier to remember Great Gadgets versus
Great Cheap Gadgets and Tools.
92

93
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,670
It's easier to remember Great Gadgets versus
Great Cheap Gadgets and Tools.
93

94
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,060
All right.
94

95
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,410
Next up, a tip, it's a don't. Don't get frustrated and just
put a random number at the end of your account name.
95

96
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,460
Next up, a tip, it's a don't. Don't get frustrated and just
put a random number at the end of your account name.
96

97
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,450
Don't be that 40-year old that still uses the account
97

98
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:42,710
sk8erkid77 with an 8, you know, for the "ater" part.
If someone searches for your name and you have
98

99
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,840
a competitor of the same-ish name,
99

100
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,270
they will show up higher on the list because
their name would be deemed more relevant.
100

101
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,900
Also, it just kind of looks tacky if you
just stick a bunch of numbers at the end.
101

102
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,730
Also, worth saying, don't use underscores or periods.
102

103
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,460
Yeah, a lot of people do that, but it's not a good idea.
103

104
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,830
Imagine you had to tell someone
about this amazing account,
104

105
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:11,210
Cheap Vacations, except it's cheap_vacations.
That doesn't really sound natural, and what is
105

106
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,270
an underscore? In that same light, don't use special characters,
they just make it harder to say and remember.
106

107
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,550
Don't be tempted to change your A
to an @ and your S to a dollar sign.
107

108
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,840
Just pick a different name.
108

109
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,090
Oh, also, Instagram can't display those anyway, so
even if you've got them submitted, they wouldn't
109

110
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,130
show up. And last thing, don't use repeating letters.
110

111
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,130
Yes, it's fine if you need to do two Os for the word cool,
111

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,120
but I mean, don't put like Instagraamm with two As and
two Ms just because you couldn't get the normal name.
112

113
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,810
but I mean, don't put like Instagraamm with two As and
two Ms just because you couldn't get the normal name.
113

114
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,800
It just sounds like you have a speech impediment.
114

115
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,630
You're either yelling the name, or you
just don't know what you're doing.
115

116
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,220
OK, guys. You got it? Try, if you can, to piggyback
off other accounts if it's available to you.
116

117
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,810
OK, guys. You got it? Try, if you can, to piggyback
off other accounts if it's available to you.
117

118
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,360
There are big accounts in your niche. Find them,
118

119
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,680
see if you can start with their name. If you can,
119

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,890
awesome, you can, move on.
120

121
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,350
Make your name as short and simple as possible.
121

122
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,820
Don't use special characters.
122

123
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:13,310
Don't use repeating letters, don't use underscores,
periods, or something with a random number after it.
123

124
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,630
