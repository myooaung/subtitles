Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,340
All right, so this section, we're going to focus
on stories. Now, stories aren't really that new.
2

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,700
They came out a long time ago when Instagram
completely originally came up with this,
3

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,890
I'm joking, they just stole it from Snapchat,
but it's been a pretty popular feature.
4

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,020
Now, you see this up in the top
of your screen all of the time.
5

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,040
Any time you go to the Explore page, it's at the top,
any time you look at your feed, it's at the top.
6

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,210
A lot of companies are using stories and a lot of
companies are doing it, I'd say, incorrectly. Generally,
7

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,020
the purpose of stories is to engage the audience you
already have, and that's why we're covering it so far
8

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,780
in the course. Earlier on,
9

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,420
if we only had a handful of followers,
then it's not particularly useful.
10

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,050
We had to gather a bunch of them and now
we can actually see the power of stories.
11

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:56,400
So what we'll do is we'll cover what the best practices
are, some accounts that use them well, we'll cover
12

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,460
a tool for making them,
13

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:05,190
and then you can follow along as I design a story strategy
for Innovation Station, and then see how that goes.

00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:05,690
and then you can follow along as I design a story strategy
for Innovation Station, and then see how that goes.
15

16
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:05,940
All right.
16

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,260
That being said, wish me luck.
17

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,100
See you next lecture.
