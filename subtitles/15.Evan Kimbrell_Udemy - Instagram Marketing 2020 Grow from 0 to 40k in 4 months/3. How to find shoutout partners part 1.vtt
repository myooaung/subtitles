1
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.250
They will come back.

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.760
Hey there's much more to cover.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.410
How do you find people that do shout outs with.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.750
All right.

5
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.730
So before you're like OK this new worlds opened my eyes to see the fact that everybody seems to be pushing

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.140
other people just deleting them and that's how they just wrote rapidly apparently.

7
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.970
That is actually the case and sometimes you can feel it is that of an underground world.

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.160
So I'm going to try to break down the process of finding people to work with.

9
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.690
And you can do it a little bit more in-depth follow along sections.

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.680
But I'll give you two bowls really.

11
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.240
All you need right now.

12
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.890
So the first thing you want to do is go to that list that we should look like this.

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.690
You forgot.

14
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.520
Looks like you make this kind of wish you made it.

15
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.480
And so what I want to do here is now I want to go through this list and establish who here would suit

16
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.100
me and to who is available to do shout outs.

17
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.460
So what I do is just call.

18
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.030
So just if always call and then I insert call them right here and one right there.

19
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.380
OK.

20
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.670
So I will call this one shows cost runs and I just put a yes or X..

21
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.080
If they do do that.

22
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.200
Now what I want to do is just go through these accounts and let's just establish whether or not they

23
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.750
do.

24
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.840
It's a very tedious manual process but this is the way you do it.

25
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.560
And what I think you should do is just grab one that you think might be a good option.

26
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.930
Also check out their profile.

27
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.650
Now we are looking for three things.

28
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.540
There are three things you will see.

29
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.780
Number one you will see in there by helping you address the Qik addresses that they a a out or some

30
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.400
other way of contacting them you might say give me for business inquiries any time they e-mail address.

31
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.530
That means that they 99000 the time do shout outs because why else would you list that there.

32
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.980
OK so that's the first thing we look for in the future.

33
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.910
Just they don't have that one.

34
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.280
The next thing we look for is whether or not they're posting photos that have attacked captions in them

35
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.590
they attack someone else.

36
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.570
So let's see what he just dig around in a couple.

37
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.620
OK.

38
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.260
No look like that one is look like that was the most recent one.

39
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.680
I mean that was OK.

40
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.210
So that's a failure.

41
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.970
Now it is we want to see if they have posts that clearly look like they're from someone else.

42
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.700
They can tell they have the same font and they have the same kind of logo here the top.

43
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:52.090
So why scrolling we can see whether or not we see that scene did not match the general trend.

44
00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.200
So it looks on an different as you remember.

45
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.930
Right.

46
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.770
See.

47
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.020
OK so this one fails on pretty much all three jacks so it's a pretty good guess that they don't.

48
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.290
Now it doesn't absolutely mean that they don't do it just means that if they do they need to very quickly

49
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.290
see that.

50
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.850
So we move onto the next one.

51
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.790
Let's go to.

52
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.050
Awesome inventions.

53
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.350
OK.

54
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.740
Now pretty much right off the bat we see hey they actually have an e-mail address.

55
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.340
OK.

56
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.510
That they claims for giving them cool inventions.

57
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.450
All.

58
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.500
Let's be real they probably do shout outs as well.

59
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.010
So usually a little more obvious say like Diom for business inquiries but this is pretty I generally

60
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.960
say yes.

61
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.280
OK.

62
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.660
Now let's see if we can see if they tag other people.

63
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.030
So here now here no here.

64
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.410
You could even have a cash option isn't it.

65
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:08.550
Now see here no know OK well now let's just see if they're posting things from other people.

66
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.470
So we just have a look at our list.

67
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.410
They kind of have the same style going on here with similar ish style.

68
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.200
So we might want to pick one that just seems like it's out the door.

69
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.290
So this is awesome mentions.

70
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.950
OK.

71
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.310
And here we go actually.

72
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:34.510
So they do do shout outs or at least their opposing counsel see or hear they actually tap someone else.

73
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.970
AK Flack's warm OK.

74
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.140
Which is probably either the company or who knows.

75
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.140
But then they said by this company.

76
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.640
OK.

77
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:50.750
So you know I'll say it again golf ball or so they might just be crediting other people or winking to

78
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.520
the companies themselves.

79
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.560
But again it's generally a good sign.

80
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.750
So we would say yes to one of these.

81
00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.220
We go back.

82
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.500
Awesome bench.

83
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.660
I'm just going to call it wife or yes because I'm pretty sure does it really hurt to reach out to them.

84
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.960
Worst case as you know.

85
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.930
OK so long on science purely ranks right up the back check.

86
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.240
Number one do they have e-mail address.

87
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.500
This is where it is right there you go OK it pretty much does.

88
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.370
So that's a yes we really need to check the rest of them because that's just me.

89
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.440
Yes absolutely.

90
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.310
OK great.

91
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.390
So I could go to sites purely

92
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.500
and mark them.

93
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.520
Yes.

94
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.210
OK.

95
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.250
Now another one.

96
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.380
Actually one of them violent ones.

97
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:47.390
So if you go to technology $422 in this town knows you know that these top three posts don't look like

98
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.530
they had anything to do with technology.

99
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.480
What is a girl losing weight.

100
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.660
One is someone on the longboard and one is just some guy.

101
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.810
Chapter one for business inquiries.

102
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.710
There you go.

103
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.460
They are automatic one if they want to do more check to see if they're tagging other people.

104
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.090
Yes indeed they are.

105
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.210
I'm so proud of my friend and the wall of your shoes everybody.

106
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:19.100
OK whatever went on this person knows them I seriously doubt it but that is probably someone who paid

107
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.590
for access.

108
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.100
Absolutely.

109
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.070
You have that you'll notice in the next one will also travel groundbreaker.

110
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.260
This is a repo's from a company called Travel ground.

111
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.120
So there are a bunch of these down here.

112
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.970
They have the actual video.

113
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.040
Wow.

114
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:45.540
So I just click that and then went to a blank page that was actually there was a shout out to me.

115
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.400
I said as I was watching you guys see this happen sometimes these are how you deleted the second one

116
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.610
that we saw as well.

117
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.840
Those were shout outs.

118
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.420
OK.

119
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.510
The rest of these are just popular post that oh actually this is another shout out right there.

120
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.820
Impressive things page.

121
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.680
OK.

122
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:10.600
And they only have seventy eight thousand dollars and they have two point or 4.2 million so you know

123
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.020
that that was a shout out.

124
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.560
So what do we do then go back to our list and then find them I'll just mark them down.

125
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.860
OK so this takes a little bit of time.

126
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.190
It just depends on how you list is a lot easier.

127
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.500
Just tell me like it has 100 followers does it it's not worth doing four hundred twelve hours doing

128
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:33.170
six Come on you can just delete these anyway because they're not really worth even trying to get in

129
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.140
a relationship with.

130
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.510
OK.

131
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:43.340
So the way that we go and try to do a shout out with some on kind of breaks down in a step by step process

132
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.760
to try one thing doesn't work then that's the next.

133
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.850
The first thing you do is you just email them.

134
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.760
Ok really set this up for doing shout out so I would just send them an email.

135
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.420
OK.

136
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.200
What exactly do you say.

137
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.020
And this works for pretty much all that is we cover on how to contact people.

138
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:07.800
It doesn't matter literally all you do is ask if they want to shout out and that's it.

139
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:13.640
They say ask for X and then answer your own message or you just say shout out a question mark do you

140
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.010
think that you could say how much for a shout out.

141
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.420
Questionmark that's it.

142
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.980
You don't need to write with them on this crappies beautiful whole you know replies.

143
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.470
They just want to get to business right.

144
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.160
They don't want to spend a lot of time figuring out their shadows because honestly they post a lot of

145
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.210
times per day so we just get rain.

146
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.720
They just spend all day negotiating with people and going to small talk just to get the point.

147
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.660
We say yes we're actually going to do it.

148
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.570
So you know the law.

149
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.510
OK I will try to follow up within probably two to three days.

150
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.600
That didn't work.

151
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.910
Who was the next option.

152
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.940
That's often seen in a direct message and you can't do this on the web version.

153
00:08:51.980 --> 00:09:01.310
You have to actually go to the mobile version on a mobile version and we would go to technology Google

154
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.410
and I can message them right.

155
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.560
What would I say.

156
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:10.700
As far as OK if I said espress that means can you shout a shout.

157
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.470
Well they have 4 1 2 million viewers so unless you were in the millions that's probably not going to

158
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.610
happen.

159
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:22.700
And even if you had one million they still year you post four times they post one so probably not a

160
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.110
great idea.

161
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.280
Generally you're just going to ask them if they do pay ads because at this point that's really all you

162
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:29.900
can do.

163
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:35.360
I mean you cannot say a hundred thousand you have 15000 that you could actually negotiate with them

164
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.800
probably figure something out.

165
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.360
OK.

166
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.950
So Senator organisationally don't like that.

167
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.490
And then another one is a follow up.

168
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.400
They don't respond to that.

169
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:47.380
Then we have to move on to the third option and that is checking out one or two apps.

170
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.350
One is called Kick k what it's called telegram now using Aissa.

171
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.210
All business accounts on Instagram used to kick.

172
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.510
And it's kind of changed a little bit.

173
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.760
OK some of those still will list off.

174
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.740
Here's my kik address with their bio.

175
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:03.600
The message that.

176
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.630
Right.

177
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.630
But in this case you don't see that as often.

178
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:13.550
So it's either a kick or another one called Look around which is basically what's out.

179
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:18.020
I mean I don't really know what that Facebook Messenger telegram but it's pretty simple.

180
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:23.420
So I guess doing this is downloading it really quickly and then opening up and creating an account in

181
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.820
cash.

182
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.770
There are still a lot of people who use it to find out.

183
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:33.010
So what I do suggest is that when you set it up you'll go through a process set up exactly like your

184
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:33.760
Instagram account.

185
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:34.360
OK.

186
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.480
Put your logo right there put your name the same as whatever.

187
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.770
That's what other people do.

188
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:44.260
So then what I want to do is just search in here to see if they have it kick it out.

189
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.810
OK.

190
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:51.550
It was technology that's a hard one to tell but what I would use here plus you find people.

191
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.300
OK.

192
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.980
And then you just type in what you think their username might be.

193
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:06.680
So all we see if we have anybody that matches this username and I said name what does that look like.

194
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.740
No it doesn't.

195
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:08.700
OK.

196
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:15.860
So then we probably are kick off a list I guess we should say has the technology we can try to find

197
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.800
it online.

198
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:25.580
I said it also mentioned the other one was that we marked all the cows on the road and then we want

199
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.510
to see those MASH is MASH.

200
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.780
So it's back than no logos anyway so we look at their cow.

201
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:40.100
So there might be a chance that it's the same person because they have the exact same name to the tee

202
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.110
on both of them.

203
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.370
And then that in my head in their own logo.

204
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.930
But does it really matter.

205
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.570
Can just try to contact the ballet.

206
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:54.590
So you just hit start chat and then you ask them Do you want to do a shout out same thing that you can

207
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.520
find out all this as well.

208
00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:03.410
Then that's when the telegram so this telegram I suggest you set it up the same exact way.

209
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:08.510
So in that telegram you actually just search your chance for whatever reason to search your contacts

210
00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:15.350
and you contacts so you can get a chance to go search your time and see if you can find them all there.

211
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:21.610
So for example one of the ones we want preserve count calls science pure science.

212
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:28.040
You really write Plus we have a mash out you know the exact same name.

213
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.800
Science see that same logo again.

214
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.750
No they don't.

215
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.490
So we don't actually know what chance they are.

216
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.040
So we'll see.

217
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.080
We are here.

218
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.020
This is HIVers and the ghosts of stuff.

219
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.730
I'm going to say no it is not in English.

220
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.100
It's for some reason.

221
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.330
So that's a no.
