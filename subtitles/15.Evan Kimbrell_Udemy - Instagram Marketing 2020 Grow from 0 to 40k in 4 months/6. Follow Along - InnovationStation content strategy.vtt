00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.880
Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.330
OK. So let's talk about Innovation Station
and what our content strategy is going to be.
2

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.300
OK. So let's talk about Innovation Station
and what our content strategy is going to be.
3

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.040
Now, I'll be the first one to admit it, your content strategy
at the beginning is going to be some rough sketches.
4

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.210
Now, I'll be the first one to admit it, your content strategy
at the beginning is going to be some rough sketches.
5

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.040
I mean, it's going to be very broad strokes.
6

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.130
I have a general idea of what I think is going to work,
but I'm perfectly flexible knowing that I might
7

8
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.850
change it along the way. What I'm thinking is that,
as I kind of explained before, we're going to focus
8

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.900
on technology, innovation, medical breakthroughs,
things that are a little more highbrow, things
9

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.360
you might read about in The Economist, something
like that, and we're going to differentiate ourselves
10

11
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:51.560
from the ones that are more just posting dumb
DIY life hacks, or just stupid kickstarters,
11

12
00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:00.030
people who will post just silly kind of gadgets that
a lot of the videos are made to be memes, or a
12

13
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.810
lot of the videos are, you can tell they're fake.
13

14
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.200
lot of the videos are, you can tell they're fake.
14

15
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.890
I mean, there's a lot of, like, vaporware, and things
like that, so they post it and they're like, "Is this cool?"
15

16
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.880
and you know, it's just kind of ridiculous.
16

17
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.110
So I wanted to focus on things that are a little more,
I don't know, I was kind of going for maybe an
17

18
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.750
older demographic or a more serious demographic.
18

19
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.580
Again, that's what I think, it might be the case that I have to
go to the dark side and start posting crappy DIY life hacks,
19

20
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.750
Again, that's what I think, it might be the case that I have to
go to the dark side and start posting crappy DIY life hacks,
20

21
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.230
and, you know, tips and tricks, and things like that.
21

22
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.290
Hopefully, I don't have to, and I can
take a slower growth approach.
22

23
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.890
I don't know, we'll see once we actually get into
the later sections of the course and we start
23

24
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010
looking at the stats that come back.
24

25
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.670
My composition is going to be heavily video.
25

26
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.400
My composition is going to be heavily video.
26

27
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.500
So, of the three, video, images, and stories, I'm going to
focus on videos, and just from my research I've found that
27

28
00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.240
people who are focusing on gadgets and tech usually do
videos, and videos seem to work a lot better, especially
28

29
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.540
in my case, kind of hard to summarize
an innovation with an image.
29

30
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.960
You know, I tried doing some dry runs, where I'd make
an image. and it just wasn't. I didn't think it was great.
30

31
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.440
You know, I tried doing some dry runs, where I'd make
an image. and it just wasn't. I didn't think it was great.
31

32
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.410
I mean, I don't really know how people respond to it.
32

33
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.100
So what I was doing with the images was taking
a shot from whatever the technology was.
33

34
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.690
So, for instance, later on we'll make an image, and I'm
not sure if I'll do the exact same what I was doing
34

35
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.250
before, but I did one that was, it was, people made
a graphene printer that could print on food, and
35

36
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.260
then your foods could become electronics,
because graphene is electric conductive.
36

37
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.310
So I blurred out the background and then I put a
description of it as a sentence, and then the caption
37

38
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.030
I thought was were we were going
to write about why it's interesting.
38

39
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.290
So I don't really know if that's going to work.
39

40
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.880
I mean, someone would see that,
click it, and then go to the caption.
40

41
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.820
But then it just kind of becomes, like, Instagram for
reading, it's like Medium or something like that.
41

42
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.770
So I don't know if that's going to chafe
against how Instagram works.
42

43
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.720
If that's the case, then I'm just going to
focus almost exclusively on videos.
43

44
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.700
But then make it so that occasionally I do
things like quotes. So quotes are just easy,
44

45
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.590
honestly, I can put innovation quotes, quotes about,
45

46
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.270
you know, Henry Ford saying whatever,
or Steve Jobs saying blah blah blah.
46

47
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.920
People tend to like that stuff, and it's really easy to
produce, and I can throw it in there, and it also
47

48
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.720
kind of leaves the door open for later on when we start
talking about shout for shouts, which are a huge part
48

49
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.490
of growth, where you start trading posts with each other.
49

50
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.510
So that's what I'm thinking.
50

51
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.390
And when I think about videos, I'm thinking more just
like slideshows than anything, it's going to be kind
51

52
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.850
of like videos you might see on Nat Geo, or even
I was kind of modeling it off of Facebook groups.
52

53
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.790
There's a lot of Facebook groups,
I'm thinking like, Now This.
53

54
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.320
And there's a lot of these left leaning political
Facebook groups that do this, like Vox does
54

55
00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.870
it, and they will put clips of something, and then
text that pops over as what we call lower thirds
55

56
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.460
in videography, explaining what it is as it goes through.
56

57
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.780
And they're very easy to produce, and for me that's
relatively simple, I mean, I produce courses, so I
57

58
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.970
can put that together quite easily.
58

59
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.790
So I'm going to focus on that.
With regards to things like sizing,
59

60
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.240
I'm probably going to stick with square everything,
just because I don't have any reason to believe that
60

61
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.730
using landscapes or portraits are going to make sense
for me. If I was filming employees or something,
61

62
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.850
I might use the portrait mode, and if I was filming
landscapes, then I might use the landscape mode,
62

63
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.990
but from what I understand, statistically, squares are the best.
63

64
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.790
So there you go. As far as aesthetics go,
64

65
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.980
I'm going to use the dominant color pattern
from the logo, so it kind of looks like this.
65

66
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.110
It's kind of, starts with orange, goes to red, goes to
purple, goes to blue, I might simplify this a little
66

67
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.470
bit, but that gives me enough color to work with.
67

68
00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.620
It's kind of like fire turning into night sky.
68

69
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.420
So I think that's unique enough that I could use it,
and I'll use that as a way to accent things throughout.
69

70
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.580
So I had a frame made for quotes, and this'll be the
frame that I'll probably use, and that background
70

71
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.930
is the same color set, it uses the same kind of geometric
shape pattern that looks a little like high techy,
71

72
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:28.050
which is perfectly fine, and then it has my branding
at the bottom and it has that outlined logo.
72

73
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:35.220
I'm planning on taking those colors and then trying to...
Like, for instance, when I do reposts or take other people's posts,
73

74
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.240
I'm planning on taking those colors and then trying to...
Like, for instance, when I do reposts or take other people's posts,
74

75
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.430
I'll try to infuse those colors into it.
75

76
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.420
I don't know how that's going to work.
76

77
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.730
We'll see, if it doesn't work, I'll stop doing it.
77

78
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.190
But that's how we're going to try to keep
some visual consistency on the feed.
78

79
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.370
It might be the case that I just end up deleting a lot
of the posts that I'm sharing from other people.
79

80
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.340
As far as watermarking and reinforcing brand goes,
I'm going to do this a lot, I'm going to use that outline
80

81
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:03.120
and stamp that on things, and I'm going to stamp that
as much as I can, especially if I'm going for a repost,
81

82
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.330
or trying to get people to share it.
82

83
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.700
That one's relatively simple. As far as font goes, that font
83

84
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.910
is called Ubuntu, and that's probably
what I'm going to stick with,
84

85
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.860
but I'm also considering doing a secondary font, so it
could be primary font Ubuntu, which is really a pretty
85

86
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.700
common font unfortunately,
86

87
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.550
and then doing a less common one that I can use for text
that just looks better. In my courses, if you haven't noticed,
87

88
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.210
and then doing a less common one that I can use for text
that just looks better. In my courses, if you haven't noticed,
88

89
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.880
we use Proxima Nova, which is kind
of an expensive font, but it's quite nice.
89

90
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.060
You can also use the poor man's Proxima Nova, which
is called Montserrat, which is very, very similar, and I don't
90

91
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.650
think anybody can really tell the difference.
91

92
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.360
So you might just do that.
92

93
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.580
Sometimes it's a little weird using two different
fonts, but if you do it correctly and they're similar
93

94
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.850
enough, then you'll be fine.
94

95
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.600
One issue might be if I did something that had serifs,
for instance. You know what a serif is, it's like
95

96
00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:01.590
let's say, like Times New Roman has the little edges on the letters,
that looks way too formal and it looks totally different than that.
96

97
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.990
let's say, like Times New Roman has the little edges on the letters,
that looks way too formal and it looks totally different than that.
97

98
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.430
The only other thing that I'll say is that I'm mostly concerned
when it comes to content with scalability and automation.
98

99
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.600
The only other thing that I'll say is that I'm mostly concerned
when it comes to content with scalability and automation.
99

100
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.510
I really don't want to have to be coming
up with new stuff every single day.
100

101
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.970
I'd rather just set templates for what works and then
create an automated process. We have a section in
101

102
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.430
the course where we'll talk about automation and I'll
show you what I'm doing and how you can do it as well.
102

103
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.660
That's really my main focus.
103

104
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.500
And so that means I'm not going to be doing a lot
of behind the scenes shots and things like that.
104

105
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.290
In regards to stories, I don't really know.
105

106
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.240
In regards to stories, I don't really know.
106

107
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.210
This is something I'm going to screw around with later, after
I've gotten a solid foundation of videos and photos. Stories,
107

108
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.510
This is something I'm going to screw around with later, after
I've gotten a solid foundation of videos and photos. Stories,
108

109
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:44.160
they're used to engage the group you already have,
and we have a section on stories, but primarily what
109

110
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:50.940
I'm going to do is probably do things like the best
posts of the week, I'll combine those into a story, or
110

111
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.240
I might take the stories of the day and combine them.
111

112
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.440
I don't really know, I mean, this is one of these things
that you try, and then you see the stats, and the
112

113
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.870
stats will tell you if it's worth doing or not, especially if I'm just reusing posts I've already made, then it should be fine.
113

114
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.840
stats will tell you if it's worth doing or not, especially if I'm just reusing posts I've already made, then it should be fine.
114

115
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.070
But again, this is something that's like,
115

116
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:12.390
later on I'll try to screw with. Another thing I'm going to
think about doing is probably some "ask the audience" posts.
116

117
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.810
later on I'll try to screw with. Another thing I'm going to
think about doing is probably some "ask the audience" posts.
117

118
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.510
Those are just easy to do.
118

119
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.950
Honestly, as soon as a new technology comes out,
you post and you ask people about it, it's super easy.
119

120
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.600
And giveaways, yeah, I'm going to try those, might as well.
120

121
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.150
Might as well see how those go.
121

122
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.800
That's usually a pretty good way of increasing engagement.
122

123
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.450
So I'll try that out. Anyway, so that's the plan.
123

124
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:35.670
It is definitely due to change as we go through, but
you will see every step of the process, you'll see
124

125
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:37.860
what works and you'll see what doesn't work.
125

126
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.020
Hopefully that excites you. See you in the next lecture.
