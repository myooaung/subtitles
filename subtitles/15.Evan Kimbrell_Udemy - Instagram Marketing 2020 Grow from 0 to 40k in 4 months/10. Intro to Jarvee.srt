1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,930
Everybody welcome back.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,380
OK.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:09,210
So in the last couple of lectures we set up our P.S. one lecture we did it with Drene cloud and the

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,250
other one we did it with Amazon 80 of us which was the free one.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,750
Now that we have our set up we create an account with Jarvi.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,250
We've downloaded the software.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,860
Now we're going to do is actually spend some time getting used to the user interface for Jarvi what

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,850
it looks like and what are the sections that we care about.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,660
So get into your GPS assuming that you did it in the GPS unit just install it on your computer which

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,280
is a perfectly viable way of doing it and you should.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,350
When you first open up Jarvi see just your dashboard.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,450
Now I'm going to use the Jarvi instance that I've actually been using for the account just because there's

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,690
more to play with.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,410
But your thing will look like it's pretty much empty now on the left hand side.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,990
We have six different sections.

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:57,230
There's a dashboard social profiles tools Gobal tool settings proxy manager and my account.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,500
Now you really are going to be using probably three of these.

18
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,820
There's other ones that you all set the settings for once and that's pretty much it.

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,720
So let's just take a tour of what it should look like now.

20
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,810
The dashboard is split up in the summary statistics what's new contact sport and notifications.

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,790
The summary is pretty much the only useful part of the dashboard.

22
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,890
This just shows you what's going on.

23
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,780
And I find it very useful to make sure that it's actually running because occasionally I've had a setting

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,480
wrong or whatever reason.

25
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,010
It's just not running.

26
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,650
Sometimes like my license might expire then I'll stop.

27
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,010
And so I like to check this to make sure that yes indeed stuff is moving so I can even check the time.

28
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,850
So to 6:37 a.m. to 23 is the time according to the server.

29
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,910
So I know it's actually running as we speak.

30
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,810
That's great.

31
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,540
Statistics is somewhat useful.

32
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,860
This will just tell you more or less like how many actions Jerry's going to be running.

33
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,090
How many follows it's done.

34
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,380
Unfollowed how many post it's made.

35
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,970
It's fine.

36
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:05,150
I'm perfectly fine using things like iconv Square just looking at the accounts just because it's faster

37
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,570
and you can use a VPN.

38
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,680
It's pretty laggy so I don't really find it super useful.

39
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,930
What's new is really tell you about updates.

40
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,840
They do update this quite a bit.

41
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,700
So if you are really going to get in the zombie strategy it's worth checking out and seeing what exactly

42
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,800
they've been fixing or changing because occasionally you'll have a button and it'll work totally different

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,480
one day and you have to go kind of fish the changes out of here and what's new now.

44
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,120
Contact support is right here.

45
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,770
Typically I just contact him with this Bakugan CommSec support.

46
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,420
They're actually pretty fast.

47
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,940
And each time you run into a problem like your accounts getting blocked they can actually look at it

48
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,080
and then tell you which is great.

49
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,400
Now social profiles is where you're going to set up all of your accounts.

50
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:53,240
And we might as well just add that account that we made before I think advanced technology today.

51
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,770
So in order to do that you go to add profile and then you want to do Instagram profile.

52
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:00,580
OK.

53
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,110
Now make sure that you give it a name that actually makes sense.

54
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,560
I always give mine just numbers so I know which.

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,870
So maybe we're talking about.

56
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,230
You could name it based off the name of the account.

57
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:15,680
But I found that that got really confusing really fast it's much easier to say number 27 is malfunctioning

58
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,300
or whatever.

59
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,010
I also like for instance to put in the username and password here into the description it just saves

60
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:27,890
me from having to go and finding it to find it later on especially if I'm sharing this with say like

61
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,910
a virtual assistant that actually helps quite a bit.

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:38,720
Now what you have to do here is click Show proxy settings and then you have to make sure that you enter

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,640
in your proxy because you don't enter in your proxy.

64
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,300
The first time this thing runs it's going to connect with the IP address of your virtual private server.

65
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:54,610
Now remember in the previous lectures we found the IP for our VPN is and it's usually pretty static

66
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,630
it doesn't change that often miners like 69 24 somethings I mean something which is fine for one account

67
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,880
but then if you keep forgetting to do this you'll have every single account first log in with an IP

68
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,510
address and then unscramble soci at that IP address with all of your accounts.

69
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,500
And that's bad.

70
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,820
So what we want to do is do our proxy IP or proxy username proxy password.

71
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,640
Now it depends how you set this up.

72
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,150
If we were doing the authentication through username and password which was one of the settings with

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,070
high proxies then we would just do this.

74
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,320
And then also make sure to put in the IP in the port.

75
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,180
But if you don't then you actually can just leave this blank.

76
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:35,410
OK so let's go grab that IP that we set up before they're going to is this one right here one it's going

77
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,920
to proxy it's in Chicago.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,190
Here's the proxy IP.

79
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,850
Here's the port now.

80
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,290
Just copy and paste this.

81
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,840
Although it depends if I think on your Mac it doesn't actually let you copy paste it.

82
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,250
So a lot of times I just keep flipping back and forth to do it.

83
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,340
Once you get the IP in there the next thing to do is add in the port and the way they have it set up

84
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,850
it's kind of clunky but you just have to put a colon and then put the ports of Mines to 1 3 0 8.

85
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:11,310
So I put a colon to 1 3 0 8 and that is just the way that they like gathering this information so that

86
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,030
it's not working it's probably that you did the syntax slightly wrong.

87
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,650
So just make sure you check that first.

88
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,990
Now again thing is being authorized by the local IP address remember.

89
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,680
So I don't actually put a new user name and authentication so I can just do this right here.

90
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,810
So let's see now the next thing is entering the username and password for your account and this is the

91
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,370
Instagram account right.

92
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,160
Not your proxy account.

93
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:46,110
So we were advanced technology today type in your password.

94
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,770
And then what you want to do is hit varify account and it'll check to make sure that not only your proxy

95
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,560
works but also your user name and log in for Instagram ok.

96
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,740
If you got everything right it should stay valid.

97
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,740
Great browse button.

98
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,120
All that does is actually it opens up in a browser where you can log in and view the Instagram account

99
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,410
through this little miniature browser like this.

100
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,350
And this is useful for a lot of different things.

101
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:19,360
Sometimes you just kind of get disconnected from the system where you don't really know exactly what

102
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,310
you're doing and sometimes you can just log in and do it manually right here.

103
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,730
We'll use this a lot actually later on.

104
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,260
OK so now we have it all set up and go back to social profiles and we can see that Instagram account

105
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,880
there down here is set up now it has a number of post number of followers shows us the followers increases

106
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,750
is an incredibly important number because I want to make sure that's always going up.

107
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,010
As you can see these are all zeroes which actually just kind of a bug sometimes it just I don't know.

108
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,180
Jeremy's not like a perfectly polished product but is something I like to check quite a bit.

109
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:02,420
And then you can see the total number of fall the wings engagement and et cetera et cetera.

110
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,050
Now the next section is the tool section and this is really the most important thing we have.

111
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,700
OK.

112
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:14,350
So what it does is it lists all your accounts and then it has columns for all of the different things

113
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,390
that it could be doing.

114
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,200
So it could be auto liking can be auto commenting can be auto falling auto following.

115
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,190
It could be read saying direct messaging.

116
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,520
It could be automatically deleting your posts so or Sarah like for instance liking on comments and also

117
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,540
things like story viewers so we'll talk about each one of these.

118
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,740
So if you want to just get into your new account to double click on it.

119
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,560
OK so you see a section like this.

120
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,460
And now here's where we set all of the settings for different things that we wanted to do.

121
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,840
So we have to follow the follow back and follow the like the comment contact direct MR's manage comments

122
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,880
tweet post comments.

123
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,570
You get the point.

124
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,750
You can do a lot of different things.

125
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:58,510
Now what you do in these setting pages pretty much is the difference in success and not being successful.

126
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:04,540
Typically what you would want to do is at first you start with followings and unfollow things.

127
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:04,930
OK.

128
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,770
And then as you establish some credibility with your account it's not a brand new account anymore.

129
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,610
Then you can start adding on more things like likes some people and comments.

130
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,990
I personally hate it because it's just not good engagement.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,380
If you've seen on innovation station we have a lot of commenters who post something and it makes no

132
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,010
sense.

133
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:30,100
It's not relevant it's not in context to the post that's generally people using bots for comments because

134
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,810
it always just says something really generic like a hard or a thumbs up so I usually just say just don't

135
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,290
do it.

136
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:40,930
Contacting is a setting you can give it so that it automatically goes out and finds new accounts and

137
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,620
messages them not necessarily people who follow you.

138
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,580
It just goes and finds new accounts.

139
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,540
Now keep in mind when you contact an account they don't follow you you don't follow them it often ends

140
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,710
up in that secondary folder on Instagram where you know you go to your messages you see your messages

141
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,810
and it says other than a parentheses and says how many messages you have.

142
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,210
That's where those messages usually end up.

143
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,740
So a lot of people even look at those I generally ignore those now direct messages a little bit different

144
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:11,170
that's for sending direct messages to people that you follow or they follow you in which case it usually

145
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,850
shows up in that direct messages section and not the other section of direct messages.

146
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,460
Now the other settings are kind of optional Noojee things I don't do until much later like deleting

147
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:21,970
posts.

148
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,150
I don't usually delete posts.

149
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,470
If you have a curation strategy that you really want to make sure you only you are constantly deleting

150
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,390
and then reposting and deleting that something a can be useful deleting comments that's not terribly

151
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,470
useful once you find out that you're getting a lot of like negative comments blocking follower is not

152
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:44,170
usually useful reposte end users and hashtags however are things that are pretty useful.

153
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:49,830
Now I use the repo's tool to repost from my main account and that's where I put all my settings.

154
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,480
That's pretty much the heart of this so users and hash tags has a section where you can tell Jarvi to

155
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,570
automatically generate hash tags and then automatically append them to your post.

156
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,640
It is actually pretty cool.

157
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,940
They can add hash tags to your comments and not the caption.

158
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,510
If you want to which is something that we always suggest because adding them to your captains usually

159
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,840
looks bad unless you're only using a couple.

160
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:18,120
This is something we will explore and then it's coming lectures and then liking comments.

161
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,030
This is just an automatic system for liking the people who comment on your post.

162
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,770
It's pretty straight forward.

163
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:29,050
Generally speaking this is a good thing because Instagram likes to see accounts that engage with people

164
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,100
who comment.

165
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,980
So something to keep in mind.

166
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,730
Save posts and story viewer.

167
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:41,560
These are two different settings for if you want to have your account randomly move around and do things

168
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,150
that bots don't usually do like bots don't usually go around and save posts.

169
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,510
They also don't usually go around and watch stories because why would they write it's just a computer

170
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,530
doing this.

171
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,790
But we use these just to make your accounts look more authentic.

172
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,110
So it is something that I toyed around with we don't really know 100 percent whether or not this makes

173
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,010
your life easier.

174
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:08,030
But I would imagine it makes your account harder to distinguish from accounts that are obviously bots.

175
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,770
So something to consider.

176
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,570
OK now there's a lot to do here and we'll do a entire lecture focusing on that but we'll just want to

177
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:19,820
move through and view what the rest of the software looks like so good global tools.

178
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:26,360
Now Google tools is a section where you can just do a lot of manual tasks or set up tools that apply

179
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,850
to every thing there.

180
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,290
For instance like if you have story viewing set up you'll have a section here that shows the stories

181
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,060
in real time that you're watching.

182
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,550
Here's your direct messages.

183
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,060
This can be pretty useful if you want to actually go and look at all the messages that people are sending

184
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,070
you or that you're sending without actually having to log in to every single one.

185
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,420
This could be crazy if you had 300 zombie accounts.

186
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,780
So this action is called creating accounts and this is exactly what it sounds like.

187
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,750
You can actually create accounts for you.

188
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,920
So if you have a system for creating a profile picture and getting a name and having a bio and everything

189
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,280
like that you can actually have them do it for you.

190
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:03,510
No.

191
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:09,260
Typically the way you do it is by importing like image files that it can randomly grab for its pictures.

192
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,660
It's not something that I'm really going to sporks this is I would consider way way more advanced than

193
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,860
you guys need to know.

194
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,290
If I were really going crazy with my zombies and I wanted to have thousands of them this would be crucial

195
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,080
but for me it's not OK now managing comments well this is again just a viewer.

196
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:32,710
I can see all the comments I get for all the different zombies that I have and I could potentially you

197
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:37,490
know click on some of them view them and even respond to them see like this is a comment on one of my

198
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,760
posts actually from my account but I could respond to it.

199
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,630
You have that kind of fish out the ones that are actual responses.

200
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,870
And it kind of just depends of your zombies doing well.

201
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,660
Now here's engagement groups.

202
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,420
Here's another section that you can explore on your own.

203
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,270
It's not something we cover in the course.

204
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,410
I don't particularly find it super useful.

205
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,020
Why.

206
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,580
Because Jarvi has a section called like exchanges now which acts as an engagement group but I think

207
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,930
it works way better.

208
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,660
Next up the settings.

209
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,630
These aren't early.

210
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,800
I don't really touch anything in here.

211
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,020
This is something that if you get really advanced you can check out some of the things that they have

212
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,050
here.

213
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,090
Honestly you don't really need to dive into this if you don't want to.

214
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,980
You can put some settings for your embedded browser.

215
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:23,390
Notice that was the browse button that we hit before so we could actually go and use it like a normal

216
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,340
person.

217
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,040
Then they have some other settings that don't actually apply to us like social platforms you do a lot

218
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,620
of settings for Facebook and Twitter and stuff like that.

219
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,360
So if you're doing a cross-platform strategy makes sense to try this.

220
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,950
But for the most part you're not going to touch this now proxy manager right here is a bird's eye view

221
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,360
of all the proxies that you're using now.

222
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,610
This is kind of the page you'll use if something goes wrong in one of your proxies.

223
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,830
You'll figure it out here very quickly.

224
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,300
You can also do things like selecting all of these and then verifying all the proxies that'll do is

225
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,280
just ping all of the settings you have to see which ones are working or might not be working.

226
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,350
You can also use this to manage your proxies so that for instance you could have it so that three or

227
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,880
four or five accounts share one proxy or even have them rotate.

228
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,650
That's something that you thought was useful.

229
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,360
So yeah I mean I only have 30 zombies or so.

230
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,120
So this isn't particularly useful on my account.

231
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,910
Nothing really happens here except for upgrading your plan like friends and I'm in a professional plan.

232
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,150
It's 50 bucks a month.

233
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,440
That's because I have 30 accounts.

234
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,730
So it allows me to go up to 70 for that.

235
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,330
Now if I only want to do 10 accounts I'd be fine doing 20 bucks a month isn't per se works for me.

236
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:35,180
And then if you have more than 150 which a lot of people do you have to actually contact them and set

237
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,130
something up with them.

238
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:36,500
OK.

239
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,710
Now this next section is called campaigns and destination lists and the way that this works is that

240
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:49,910
you can set up what are called independent campaigns and these are particularly useful if you for instance

241
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:56,820
want to narrow in on someone else's account and repost lots of their postings.

242
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,000
But then you want to do it too.

243
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,490
Not just one zombie but maybe 10 different ones so you could do is you could create a campaign have

244
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:11,110
that campaign only target one account grab their information and then send it to your accounts.

245
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,150
I don't actually use campaigns just because with the repo's tool and all of the tools tools that we

246
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,460
explored before I pretty much get everything I need I can just do it there.

247
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,060
But if I was re posting specifically from a list of different accounts this is actually where I would

248
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,720
do it and I'd set it up here.

249
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:33,740
A lot of people do spend a lot of time here in the campaigns and they might set up different ones depending

250
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,020
on whatever.

251
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,950
I mean they might make one every month that focus on different accounts just to mix it up.

252
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,820
Destination list is where you set up your zombie's for accepting campaign.

253
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:51,100
So let's say I set up a campaign and I have it such that it scrapes all of them from business insider

254
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,760
their account.

255
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,050
OK well then I'd have to set up a destination list for every single zombie.

256
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,880
And then when I'm campaigns automatically be able to check the destinations which are either individual

257
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,840
zombies or groups of them.

258
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,020
And then I can set it up that way.

259
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,610
OK hopefully this isn't too overwhelming.

260
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,450
Honestly the first time you get into Jarvi it is overwhelming.

261
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,880
It's also very slow.

262
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,300
So you do kind of feel like you don't want to click on the next section because you don't even know

263
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,120
if it's going to load or what.

264
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,770
But as as you get more and more familiar with this as you start setting up the settings for some of

265
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,160
your zombies it starts to get a little bit easier.

266
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,710
There's still a lot of features I don't use but that's also because I'm not trying to build hundreds

267
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,430
and hundreds and hundreds of zombies if I were suddenly something that I would want to look into.

268
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:37,840
OK.

269
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,530
Next lecture will start getting into the individual settings.

270
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,160
When you set up your first zombie.

271
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:44,930
OK so you then.
