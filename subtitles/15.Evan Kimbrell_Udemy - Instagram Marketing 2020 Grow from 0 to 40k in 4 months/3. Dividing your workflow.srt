1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,650
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,110
All right.

3
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,490
Well that's what we did is we talked over workflows identifying the step by step process you take to

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,320
make your post.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,690
Everyone has one.

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:17,430
And if you've gotten to this part in the course and you haven't yet figured out what you consistently

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,300
do over and over again.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,110
Well it's about time that you start to figure that out.

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:28,780
Now we went over the workflows that I have and I kind of showed you the step by steps that I go to.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,900
And you don't have to do it and that level of granularity but I think it helps now that we have a workflow

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,100
written out.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,780
It's really easy to just look at it and see whether or not it's overly complicated.

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,240
If it doesn't have enough detail if there are parts in here that we're not very good at if there are

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,650
parts in here as well that you kind of wrote something generic so maybe you said put music OK.

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,090
That's something I see all the time.

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,510
Well where do you get your music.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,700
What actual criteria do you use to select your music.

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,380
So just check it over and make sure that it actually has the level of detail that you want.

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,130
And you think that it doesn't really leave anything out.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,810
But it's not overly complex you don't need to say.

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,680
And then you type this key or take this word or click this screen just do it in two actual like actions.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,020
Now what we want to do is we want to break down our tasks into unique task groups.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,490
Now the best way I can kind of explain this is kind of like a production line like let's say we buy

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,250
a phone at Best Buy.

25
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,150
There are a lot of people who touch that phone in the supply chain before you buy it.

26
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,260
And every single person in that supply chain has different skills and qualities and also cost points.

27
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,180
So usually you have the designers who design it.

28
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,410
Then you have people who work with procurement and manufacturers to make it.

29
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,720
Then you have packaging and packaging and then you have sales for people who make ads and make it easy

30
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,690
for instance informational packets that go in it and then you have people who work with distributors

31
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,750
to solve your transportation and you have retail and obviously skipped a couple in there.

32
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,920
But our process is really not that different.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,570
Right.

34
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,970
So typically let's say with a photo post I have to figure out well enough to find a quote.

35
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,650
OK.

36
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,930
That's research.

37
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,840
Then I have to find an image to put on it.

38
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,140
And that's again kind of just research.

39
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,550
I mean it's very like an administration task pretty easy.

40
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,690
You don't be good at looking at photos to find that one.

41
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,570
Then all I have to do is write a caption for it when I list out tough facts.

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,370
And that's again just research.

43
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,900
It's a really easy one to do.

44
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,040
Then I am the actual task of posting it on to later gram or on to Instagram and then putting in things

45
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,820
like the mowgli's and the hashtags now hashtags might take a little bit more skill someone who's used

46
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,470
to a tool to figure that out.

47
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,730
But for the most part these are all things that can be done by like a virtual assistant.

48
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,750
So in that I see really only two different skill sets that are needed.

49
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:09,480
One is research finding an image finding a good quote and then finding the facts for the captions and

50
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,070
then administration is essentially then just following a set process putting things together and doesn't

51
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,730
require a lot of critical thinking.

52
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,990
But on the video workflow now it's a little bit different.

53
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,440
Now we actually have to bring in other skill sets and we actually have other task groups that can only

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,720
be finished by one person the designer of the phone probably can't do the manufacturing manufacturer

55
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,240
probably can't do the packaging and packaging person probably doesn't know how to sell it on the floor

56
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,140
of Best Buy.

57
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,380
So for this I just need to isolate it down by the skills needed.

58
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,120
So what I would say is one two three and four.

59
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,970
These are all research right.

60
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,820
Like you actually have to think about them a little bit have some kind of sense of what's interesting

61
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,500
and what might fit with your brand that's a little bit outside the scope of an administrator than just

62
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,400
market as a separate group.

63
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,300
So unbury can just click that button down there and then I can market like that.

64
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:09,600
OK so that's one grou then what I'll do is just put a little space here and I'll divide them off by

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,130
just adding a line break line separator right there.

66
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,760
OK.

67
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,440
Then what do we have to do.

68
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:22,390
Then we have to write five captions with one that sends them if to write 100 full captain plus a call

69
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,730
to action.

70
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,560
And then I have to do a short description of the video for each continent.

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,780
So what do I have to be able to do in order to do these four things.

72
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,470
Well the first three I have to be someone who's comfortable or good at writing.

73
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,760
Case or a writer has to do those now running on a short description of a video.

74
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,910
That's not nice.

75
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,320
You don't have to be a good writer to be able to look at a caption and say you should probably show

76
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,390
the companies app if you're talking about a feature in the app.

77
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,610
That's probably something that's a little bit more like Administration but it is something that the

78
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,090
writer could possibly do especially because they're involved in the process.

79
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,050
They wrote the caption and they probably had something in their head when they wrote it so I can mark

80
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,130
this as a separate task group.

81
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,580
OK.

82
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,810
And then I'll separate this off again.

83
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:11,800
OK.

84
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,920
Then we have searching stock videos and YouTube suitable clips that match those descriptions creating

85
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,720
a Dropbox folder and then then you essentially start opening up your apps.

86
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,900
Now the first one.

87
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,670
Nine and 10.

88
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:32,060
These would be something that's like Administration or research Asgari someone who can find clips based

89
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,050
on a criteria.

90
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,520
Now your criteria are always going to be things like high resolution right.

91
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,930
Or something that works and a square resolution or something that just makes sense and doesn't look

92
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,820
bad and doesn't look raster ised.

93
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,120
Each person has a different content process.

94
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,060
They probably have different criteria but that's in general the rough sketch guidelines.

95
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,870
So I can actually identify this as a separate task group because anyone can actually do this.

96
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,990
So what I'll do is I'll just mark this separately OK then next up we have a set of things you have to

97
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,310
do in a video editing player.

98
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,280
And these are not necessarily hard things to do because you're using templates and you're adjusting

99
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:19,100
things and you're just trying to clip out pieces of the clips to find the best usable pieces pre-selecting

100
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,710
music and adjusting for timing and things like that.

101
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,190
But for the most part these are all things that an editor would know how to do.

102
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,380
Couldn't go to a random person and say do this because they wouldn't actually know how to do it.

103
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,440
Especially like working with the text templates it's somewhat complicated.

104
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,190
So I would say that this is a separate task group OK.

105
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,540
And then the last set of stuff is really just kind of an administration task.

106
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,390
I mean it's just really basic stuff like adding in tax it's early been written.

107
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,530
You're right it's going to be a writer adding in hashtags.

108
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,580
Now that's depends how you do your hashtags right.

109
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,780
If you've pre made them you have a list of ones to rotate through.

110
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,510
Then you know they don't have to do anything as well but this whole section right here this is all this

111
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,930
administration.

112
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,630
So what I'll do is just mark this separately.

113
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,650
OK so what I have is five separate task groups write one up here.

114
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,640
Is it easy.

115
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,630
Yes it's easy to do but it's probably best for someone who understands the brand and probably has some

116
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,170
basic research skills.

117
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,550
The next one is probably best for someone who's comfortable writing.

118
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,620
It's not generally in the range of something that anyone could do.

119
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,410
Like a hundred characters for a full description that can get pretty old if you're someone who doesn't

120
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,550
like to write.

121
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,190
Then we have some basic stuff here like research.

122
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:42,370
Now you have to have some sensibilities on how to pick certain clips but really I mean it's just a task

123
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,950
with minimal training you can figure out.

124
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,340
Then we have task that editors can do and another set of tasks that are really kind of in the administration

125
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:48,750
range.

126
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,070
So the next thing I think you do after you separate these out is just have a good think to yourself

127
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,930
what are you good at and which of these tasks just take too long.

128
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,700
OK.

129
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,740
Because at the end of the day if you're constantly stuck doing let's say 10 posts a day and you're doing

130
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,520
the same task over and over again that you're not confident you're good at or they just take you an

131
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,540
inordinate amount of time you're going to burn out and you're never actually going to reach the goal

132
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,430
of growing your account to what you want it to be.

133
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,490
So for instance the things that I enjoy doing on this are literally just the first one.

134
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:25,580
I like reading the stories and saying this is interesting and I'm good at connecting it to the brand.

135
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,730
Now writing the captions.

136
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:32,290
Personally I hate doing it but I can do it quickly and then things like searching for stock videos that's

137
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,090
just a drudgery.

138
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,540
I don't generally enjoy doing that.

139
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,890
There's nothing fun doing now and then putting them together.

140
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,260
I mean that's just a manual assembly process.

141
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,530
There's no real creative touch involved.

142
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,320
So I'm not a huge fan either.

143
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,410
And then there's stuff I'm generally terrible at.

144
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,780
I'm terrible at Administration and organizing things and stuff like that.

145
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,320
So really this is the only one that makes sense for me personally to do.

146
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,240
But what do you guys out there will probably want to do a lot of this and that's perfectly fine.

147
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,250
Now just do that for yourself so that you know going forward.

148
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,870
There's some of these things that are going to focus on getting someone else to work on more so than

149
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,310
other task groups.

150
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,880
The next thing I want to do is just go to a Web site called Trello.

151
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,500
So travel looks like this once you log in.

152
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:17,260
Basically the way this works is you have what's called a board and in your board you can list off task

153
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,110
and you can list them off in a linear process like a step by step process.

154
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
Now they will make more sense when I show you it.

155
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:28,040
So go over up here in the top right to us and we're going to create a new board add your board titles.

156
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,360
Also it's the Instagram demo.

157
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,590
OK and then you could pick some whatever colors you want.

158
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,200
OK.

159
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:41,070
And then this is basically what it looks like now the way they set it up is you have cards and you have

160
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,650
lists a list is where you're going to store individual tasks and then you'll move them from list to

161
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,900
list as the State of the task changes.

162
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:55,520
OK so we went back to our process flow we could say that the first one is picking stories right.

163
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:03,440
So we could say picking a story and then we could say writing captions

164
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:22,100
that we can do gather media and then the last thing assemble video and then ask Gadgil slash post.

165
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,770
OK.

166
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:29,960
So what we have here is that five step process that we just kind of designed over in our little text

167
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,250
app.

168
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:35,760
So first you pick a story and you write the captains for it then you gather suitable media for the video

169
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,080
then you assemble that they are with the media adding the text from the captions and then you schedule

170
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,620
and post it.

171
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,070
That is the rough process right there.

172
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,230
Now you can break these down quite a bit more.

173
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,940
You can make it way more granular and you could say writing video captions and have a separate one right

174
00:10:50,940 --> 00:11:00,090
here that says writing full caption and then how you can even do has a call to action writing the full

175
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:04,880
caption and we can go writing a call to action

176
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,520
but it's really up to you how granular you want to get.

177
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:20,080
My tip is that if it's a task group and one person does it in one sitting in one go then you don't need

178
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,360
to do this because there's no point of them coming in and updating this constantly if it's nothing's

179
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,300
changed and they're not passing after another person.

180
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,220
Now the person who gathers media for video needs to know what the captions are before they can work.

181
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,510
Person assembles the video needs the media for they can do then the person who post needs to finish

182
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,070
post.

183
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,970
So there's no point having these intermediary steps like this.

184
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,230
Generally that's something I don't do.

185
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,370
Get rid of that.

186
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:47,890
OK.

187
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,280
Now a card represents the actual work that you need to do.

188
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:57,790
And so if I actually had a story I could say we put it here and we would say that those that vibrate.

189
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,380
Goal.

190
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:58,600
OK.

191
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,140
There's these headphones that you don't put in your ear yet you put them on your head.

192
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,690
And that's called bone conduction headphones.

193
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,620
So you hear the music but it's not in your ears.

194
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,940
It's totally bizarre.

195
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,050
Something I'd probably cover.

196
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,280
OK.

197
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,410
There you go headphones that vibrate skulls.

198
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:17,180
So if I were the person who was picking a story because I've isolated myself with that I would be filling

199
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,660
this out.

200
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,570
I would be going onto the Web sites or wherever I've identified in my sources and in my workflow finding

201
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,790
notes and then filling them up here.

202
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,000
Then the question is do you want to write the captions if you want to write the captions.

203
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,420
OK then you can collapse these down together.

204
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,300
Be picking a story writing captions into one list.

205
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,470
Do you want to get into the media.

206
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,680
You could do it again if you wanted to assemble the video.

207
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,790
You could do it again.

208
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,230
You could also just use this as a organizational tool.

209
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,510
Right.

210
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,700
So if I have say 10 different stories.

211
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:57,500
Six 10 then I can very quickly look at this even if I'm only working alone and see exactly where I am

212
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,220
in the process.

213
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,980
So let's say you know we have some that are still waiting on captions that have captions just waiting

214
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:11,830
for Media and then we could say like we a bunch and assembling the video like that.

215
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,500
OK.

216
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,200
So I can look at this and go oh wow see the train is working perfectly but we have a bottleneck right

217
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,540
here and nothing is ready to post which could be a problem depending on how many times you posted that

218
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,120
day and what your goal is.

219
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,570
Now the rest of the things in Trello that you can use that are useful for this process are just things

220
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,820
like for instance you can click the card right here and it gives you a lot of different things so you

221
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,910
can put individual notes on it so I can take notes to myself here.

222
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,770
I want to you can also edit the description.

223
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,910
So for instance if I'm picking a story I might put the link here and I'll put a description of the link

224
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,090
here so link link.

225
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,910
I can also if I'm working with other people I can tag them by putting it at and selecting their name.

226
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:59,110
No one's in this group yet but I wanted to I could I'm to things like putting labels on them.

227
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,360
Right.

228
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:07,410
So let's say one is a photo and one's video I can make green for photos so you can change this two photos.

229
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:16,730
And then we can make yellow two videos and then what I can do is just go through and then and tag each

230
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,130
one.

231
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:23,600
If that information is actually useful to you at a distance it could be especially if for instance you

232
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,090
want to post three videos a day and two photos while you can look over here and see what's close to

233
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:34,200
the end of the pipeline and it might be the case that there let's say all photos that could be a problem.

234
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,120
OK so that's the basics of what's called a con on board and Trello is free forever.

235
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,350
I don't know if they charge for stupid things like putting stickers.

236
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,810
So it's a very popular tool that you can use yourself if you just want to keep track of your projects

237
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,060
and you want to be able to look at it very quickly and see where in the process you are.

238
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,900
It's a great way to remind yourself oh right I need to put the video together for eight to nine and

239
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,950
four.

240
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,750
It also is incredibly helpful if you start adding people or you add them just going over show menu and

241
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,480
then you get an invite and you just type in their e-mail address.

242
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,600
And then when they're added they themselves can actually move things.

243
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:13,290
And you can notice down here on the activity feed what's happening if another person moves something.

244
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,640
So I say gather media over here.

245
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,850
I moved seven from gather media to assemble video.

246
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:25,550
OK so that's the basics of setting up Trello and getting ready to design a more efficient content pipeline

247
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,580
whether or not you do this yourself is totally up to you.

248
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,390
It really depends on whether you think you're good at it whether you're enjoy it and whether or not

249
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,510
any of these tasks take you a long time.

250
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,980
Some of the tasks in here take me a long time assembling the video.

251
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,510
Some people are just better at that than I am actually gathering media as well.

252
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,970
But picking a story I think that's something I enjoy and I think I'm actually good at so some other

253
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,220
person probably would actually struggle with doing that.

254
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,670
So generally I focus on that but again find other preferences I might do other parts in this pipeline.

255
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,950
OK.

256
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,260
Next a lecture of what we'll do is we'll jump into the pipeline that I've been using to create post

257
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,920
and then you can kind of see a more specific way that I've set it up.

258
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,490
All right see you then.
