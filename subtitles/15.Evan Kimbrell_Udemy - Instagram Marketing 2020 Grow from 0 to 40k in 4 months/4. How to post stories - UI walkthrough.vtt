00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.340
I go is looking back some socks are going to do is we're going to go over how do you post the story

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.900
and then what auctions do you have when you're posting them.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.620
OK.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.850
So it's relatively easy although occasionally I'll admit I forget where it is because it's the easiest

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.860
thing access in the world.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.060
But for the most part it's pretty dang simple.

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.090
You guys have made a story before you have to do this.

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.280
Please just skip the lecture.

9
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.930
This is just kind of be redundant you're not going to see anything new.

10
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.740
So the way you do it pretty simply is just go over to the home screen and see at the top left where

11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.880
you have the camera button.

12
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.320
Now you swipe right and it just goes directly to your camera or you can go up here and click on the

13
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.400
actual camera.

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.460
Now the way it works is the same way as posting a photo or a video.

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.020
So I could do something very impromptu right now and make a video and then post that to my story.

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.670
Now if I want to take a photo I just click it if I want to do video I'd hold it so I did a video like

17
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.810
this.

18
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.880
Worst story ever.

19
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.770
But I'm going to post it so like that.

20
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.130
And then what I have to do is just put plus to my story.

21
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.640
That's pretty much it.

22
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.680
If I wanted to add a video that I already had then what I would just do is click on this little square

23
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.010
at the bottom and then pick say an image that I already had.

24
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.500
So just do a standard isn't he talking.

25
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.400
Great.

26
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.460
Now what happens is it opens up a lot of the different features that you can use.

27
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.810
So let's see.

28
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.690
So for instance you can add a link.

29
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.010
All right.

30
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.830
So for me I can handle it.

31
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.080
That's the reason because my count has over 10000 followers.

32
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.390
So what this basically means is that if I add you to a site like my web site then when people swipe

33
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.030
up and they have a button that says See more at the bottom it takes them to that Web site in a browser

34
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.260
inside of Instagram.

35
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.460
Now this isn't something I regularly use because I'm not promoting any products or anything specific

36
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.680
but if I were selling something that's a great way of doing it I could do a promotion for a new product

37
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.600
somebody even someone to have an affiliate relationship with.

38
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.980
And I put that as if you are out and no one is interested slips up and they automatically go to the

39
00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.310
page.

40
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.900
It's a great way to convert people.

41
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.600
Other things you can do is you can and like stickers for instance.

42
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.260
Now stickers are kind of the default way that you tag something.

43
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.800
Believe it or not.

44
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.270
So if I wanted to mention someone I could do a mention if I wanted to add a hash tag so it shows up

45
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.570
with hash tag pages but a hash tag I can also do a location.

46
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.170
Right now I'm in Denver so we could put that.

47
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.770
So anybody who searches for Denver will see this and let's see then I could add.

48
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.070
Do another hash tags say something like You're to me or you go to anybody searching for that can see

49
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.520
more then there are other things that you can add in.

50
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.430
So for instance like polls these are really really effective.

51
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.980
So if I wanted to poll them I could ask a question and then say yes or no.

52
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.130
This is also incredibly strong way of just asking your audience whether or not they like something but

53
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.970
also to get them engaged more.

54
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.320
Right.

55
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:57.030
So if I post a new post in it's a new invention and I say cool or not or game changing or fake something

56
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.430
like that then people can click yes or no.

57
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.040
You can also do things like you can add in this emoji swipe.

58
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.980
So what you could do is put that down there.

59
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.680
And based on whatever the photo you're showing is they can read it.

60
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.070
All right.

61
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.950
So you often see this it's like models put a new photo up and you have this this slider right there

62
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.020
that someone can slide to show how much they like it.

63
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.330
Typically people put it all the way to the right and you'll be amazed.

64
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.750
It's easily 70 80 percent of people will do that.

65
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.870
So keep that in mind as a mechanism for increasing engagement past that you have things like adding

66
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.340
text.

67
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.790
Now if I just tap the screen I can just add text like hello students and I can change the color.

68
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.500
I can pick a color using this drop or somewhere else on the screen.

69
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.550
I have a lot of other colors like gray scales and flesh tones and things like that.

70
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.010
Also I can go up here and click this way and that will also add one hour.

71
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.940
What you can do is change the font by using these other buttons up here.

72
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.410
So what you can do is click up here to strong.

73
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.170
And what that does change the type of font you're using.

74
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.260
So classic.

75
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.570
That's pretty much the same thing.

76
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.430
It's just not a tablet sized.

77
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.090
And then if I wanted to increase it I have this bar over here for size.

78
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.390
You can do this by pinching as well so don't you know you don't have to do it right here.

79
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.260
Now let's say if I wanted a modern to do neon or typewriter kind of just depends on whatever your content

80
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.630
strategy is whatever form you use.

81
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.740
I try to typically find something that's similar or not.

82
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.970
But keep in mind they keep this simple on purpose.

83
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.400
They don't want you to have super customizable stories because stories are so quick and easy.

84
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.010
So if you want to delete something just grab it hold it and then just throw it right there in the trash.

85
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.650
The other thing you can do here on the top left looks like an A-plus plus.

86
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.390
But really what it is is for a background.

87
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.690
So if I wanted to put a background in clicking like that get rid of it click and that's just one way

88
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.660
of having it stand out and make it a lot easier.

89
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.950
So you can kind of tell that you know if I were a personal account I could very easily just take a photo

90
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.740
of me filming of course and then put hello or whatever as I'm going through it or put a poll with a

91
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.700
question that I might have and that's a great way of kind of bringing people into my world and to get

92
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.710
an affinity for my account.

93
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.500
So that is pretty much it.

94
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.570
Typically speaking people will post multiple ones a day.

95
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.390
So I would do this three or four times a day whatever it is that I want even the photo that I saw.

96
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.380
And then I would just share it there because it's again I don't want to put a lot of thought into posting

97
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.450
it on my regular post-paid then what would happen once I actually posted that it would show up at the

98
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.100
very end wherever I added it.

99
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.850
Currently you can actually re arrange the stories that you posted but it shouldn't really matter.

100
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.700
I mean you can always go back and delete stories and then add them just a little bit of a pain.

101
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.120
OK so that's pretty much it.

102
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.160
That's how you add them the same way you had to post it as opposed to using the post button down here

103
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.350
you just go straight to your camera and then send two or click.

104
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.140
Plus add to my story it automatically adds it it automatically disappear in 24 hours.

105
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.330
And it's always 24 hours since when you posted it.

106
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.640
Right.

107
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.600
So if I posted one thing an hour ago and then another one.

108
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.490
And right now the first one will disappear in 23 hours and this one will disappear in 24 hours so keep

109
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.590
that in mind too.

110
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.430
If for instance your stories need to be played right next to each other to make any sense then you probably

111
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.870
should post them at the same time.

112
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.350
All right guys.

113
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.820
That's it for you.

114
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.310
I walk through a posting a story next lecture what we'll do is we'll post a story on innovation station

115
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.490
and I'll show you one of the ways that I would use it.

116
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.090
All right CNN.
