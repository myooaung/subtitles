00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,430
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,930
So last lecture we went over link tree and that's a great way of dividing up your traffic and pointing

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,560
them towards whatever direction you need them to go in order to collect leads.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,280
This lecture actually going to do is we're going to create a mobile optimized landing page ourselves

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,320
using a tool called lander.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,660
Now the reason why I'm covering this is because with the link to tree it kind of assumes that you already

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,630
have a page that you have to send people to and also it doesn't really give you a ton of control over

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,790
what you want.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,550
Now there's is only one thing you want to drive all traffic towards the trees.

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,640
Probably not a great idea because the whole idea with that is that you can set up multiple links and

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,890
do that easily in a way that you know converts.

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,430
All right so check it out a toad Lander app dot com.

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,050
There are a lot of landing page softwares out there.

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,690
You guys have taken any other courses.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,440
We've go over other ones.

16
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:59,250
There's like on bounce there's the one I personally use which is insta page but they're kind of expensive

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,090
and considering you are only trying to make a landing page for our Instagram page.

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,370
They're kind of overkill.

19
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,100
I obviously have nothing against lander.

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,940
It's just that I use other ones for different purposes for Instagram.

21
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,030
I think this is the easiest it's easiest to set up.

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,670
You can do it the fastest and also their pricing is completely reasonable compared to the other ones.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,000
Just keep in mind they don't have as many features but again you're not going to really use any of those

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,320
other features for a mobile optimized site that's just for Instagram so you can see right here their

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,160
basic starts in about 16 a month and they go all the way up to 83 whereas like insta page for instance

26
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,440
believe they start at like $60 on unbound starts around $50.

27
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,310
So keep that in mind so it just laner app dot com.

28
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:42,840
OK.

29
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:48,160
So if you wanted to set up a page let's just go and get a free account.

30
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,100
Now I can give you a 14 day free trial which I think is plenty of time to create your own page and figure

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,460
out whether or not it's going to work for you.

32
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,600
So fill out your information and you get started.

33
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,790
Click Start free trial now.

34
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,570
Right now we just have to check our inbox and verify it.

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,780
All right now we verified our account.

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,750
This is what it pushes us into.

37
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,980
So what's going to happen is going to choose a folder name.

38
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,160
And so any page that we use on land or they're going to give us an automatic u r l.

39
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,490
This is obviously auctioned off to you if you want it to run from your own domain.

40
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,600
They have tools for that.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,250
But for simplicity sake we can just use their system.

42
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,460
So will the innovation station OK available.

43
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:26,880
Great.

44
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,650
Done.

45
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,280
All right then he gives us some videos to watch on how to use your thing.

46
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,130
But for the most part their system is not very complicated.

47
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,940
So just hit new landing page.

48
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,910
OK name our landing page this is all just internal.

49
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,160
So we'll say innovation station and next.

50
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,230
Right now it's good to give us a bunch of templates.

51
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,580
This is one of the best parts about this.

52
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,580
You don't have to sit down and pay a web designer and a web developer to make your own web site.

53
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,410
This is great if you are driving people to one specific purpose.

54
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,800
OK so if we were making an Instagram page to promote an app that we made Here's a great template for

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,870
that and take them directly to your app page and it's very obvious that the goal that page is to download

56
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,010
your app.

57
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,660
There's also ones for like announcing an ebook.

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,090
Here's a it you know get this awesome book today.

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,420
This is a great Legion tool as well a lot of people write e-books or just templates or guides or something

60
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,160
that's really useful and then drive traffic to that people sign up and then you can put them into an

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,120
email sequence and sell them things later.

62
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,820
Here's one for just a standard software subscription.

63
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,650
Let's see there's other ones for like events that's pretty useful if you want to do a web and are here

64
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,060
some women are ones.

65
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,200
Here is a physical in-person event.

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,060
These are all things that you could be driving leads to coming soon which is pretty useful.

67
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,660
Let's say you wanted to build a pre-launch list for a Kickstarter or a launch list for who knows what

68
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,210
you could use one of these.

69
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,230
These are all pretty easy to use.

70
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,780
You can even put a timer right here so people know when to sign up.

71
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,080
But for the most part yeah this is pretty simple.

72
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,960
So let's say our innovation is Asian we're going to be launching a YouTube channel.

73
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,400
OK.

74
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,700
Haven't launched it yet but we want to get people who are interested in watching longer form videos

75
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,690
about what we're doing.

76
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,090
So what I might do is pick something like this.

77
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,850
So let's see if this works for what we're trying to do.

78
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,370
So that create then it says Welcome to our editor.

79
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,760
You guys can launch a tour if you want to.

80
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,580
Otherwise I'll just show you what matters.

81
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,250
And there we go.

82
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,560
Now we have your logo we have a countdown timer.

83
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,080
Hang in there soon and then.

84
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,770
Website coming soon.

85
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,840
Then we'd have down here is typing in an e-mail address.

86
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,150
Subscribe.

87
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,200
And that's pretty much it.

88
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,810
You want to move the branding.

89
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,470
Unfortunately you have to be a paid account.

90
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,200
We're in a free trial we can't do that right now.

91
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,280
But if this is useful.

92
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,870
Very easy for us to get rid of this and justify the cost of paying 15 bucks a month.

93
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,350
OK.

94
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,240
So let's just assume that we're making a YouTube channel.

95
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:58,160
So what we could probably do see is change this logo over here and where we can say innovation station

96
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,140
plus YouTube nation plus YouTube.

97
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,130
OK.

98
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,610
Simple enough.

99
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,350
We should probably add to the image so we can throw in our logo.

100
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,900
So we clicked this ad image over here then it shows the gallery that we've already uploaded.

101
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,610
We don't have it yet so we're just gonna browse for the file we want.

102
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,480
So here is one logo that we can try out.

103
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,010
So it should have a blank background.

104
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,780
What we want.

105
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,420
OK great.

106
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,970
Up here put it in the corner just so we keep the same semblance of branding.

107
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,350
OK.

108
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,620
Now let's just look over some of the tools over here pretty dang simple.

109
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,460
As you noticed here the basics these are the tools for adding in basic things like a line break to break

110
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,000
up your content adding in a video.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,500
This might be a smart thing if we are doing a YouTube channel we can make a video introducing people

112
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,300
to it.

113
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,980
A button if you want them to click through to something else.

114
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,020
Here's some text.

115
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,070
Here's a box if you want to frame some of the content you're using and then obviously the image.

116
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,420
The things you can use are basic social so you can add things like a like box widgets.

117
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,670
Twitter followers followers etc..

118
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,790
Personally I'm going to get rid of those because I think those are a distraction.

119
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,600
If the sole purpose of my landing page is to get them to go to a YouTube channel so I'm saying no other

120
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
things are in the advanced column.

121
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,640
So you can type in your own HVM mouth.

122
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,590
That's something that you really needed to do.

123
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,890
You know if we were doing a local event and this would be really useful you could show a map to where

124
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,300
it is.

125
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,500
If you're a local store that's also pretty useful as well.

126
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,880
You're trying to make money off your landing page let's say trying to make a really simple page to sell

127
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,320
something that's in your profile.

128
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,580
You could put a PayPal button here and have people pay you for whatever it is.

129
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,650
So over here we have some global settings for the page so we can set the width of the page height.

130
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,190
You can change things like the metadata.

131
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,420
So if someone searches for this we could set that up.

132
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,020
That's not parable important for us just because we're trying to make this for Instagram only we can

133
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,960
put in scripts too if you want to do basic like pixel tracking like Facebook pixel or if you want to

134
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,450
do google analytics or something like that lander gives you basic analytics so you can see as people

135
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,220
hit your page you don't really need that unless there's something very specific you're looking for in

136
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,890
your traffic data.

137
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,320
Here is where you can change the background see it's white right now.

138
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,970
But if I wanted to I could change to something else also change things like color or opacity.

139
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,860
And yeah pretty much that's it.

140
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,720
Right you are weakening goals and I believe if you're in a pro account you can add multiple goals.

141
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,080
That's obviously not a very good idea.

142
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,740
You want to focus everyone on one thing at a time.

143
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,890
So we have a form submission.

144
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:28,950
So what happens is if say like I unchecked us then when someone goes and fills this out it works all

145
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,460
the same.

146
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,600
It's just that lenders are not going to tell me it's not good to track that.

147
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,190
So right now lenders thinking oh form submission is the goal.

148
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,610
So when we give you analytics we're going to give you a percentage of how many people hate your page

149
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,960
and do this goal.

150
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,700
All right so do this form submission.

151
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,580
OK passed and everything else is pretty simple.

152
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,560
I personally like to rely on their templates as much as possible with you have your own page you can

153
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,430
do that.

154
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,240
But again this is probably not the best tool to use for that.

155
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,470
So I just spent a little time customizing this so it looks a little more legitimate.

156
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:06,620
So innovation and put the year OK then up here we have the timer.

157
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,640
So if we want to modify this we just click it and then automatically press properties tamps gives you

158
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,750
everything you can change about it.

159
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:18,000
Now there there's a lot obviously here's the sizing here's the time zone here's the date that it's essentially

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,120
counting down to.

161
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,000
Right so it's like 600 for these days.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,620
Let's go down to Torrini 22.

163
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,610
So let's say we're going to launch our channel.

164
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,210
Let's see.

165
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,930
So it's July.

166
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,730
So we're going to launch it in a couple of months.

167
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,070
Well we're in a launch in a couple of months.

168
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,870
I don't know November 14th sounds like a nice one.

169
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,140
There we go 61 days.

170
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,500
OK.

171
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,640
Now obviously you probably would want to do a landing page for something that's going to launch that

172
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,890
far out in advance.

173
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,230
Hard to get people actually care if it's that far away so keep that in mind.

174
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,700
Now that we've changed it so there's actually one digit missing.

175
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,810
We can move this over to center again and you notice we have these snap grids that pop up.

176
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,480
See how that means it's left aligned.

177
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,930
This means that center aligned.

178
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,550
So we want that to be center aligned.

179
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,670
Now we can do different things so if you guys want a 24 hour clock you can set this up.

180
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,480
You can set it up so that these numbers mean something else.

181
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,010
You can bat some goofy branding If you want to here you can change the color opacity.

182
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,260
You can do a reflection which is very common.

183
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,340
The upside down version of it that's fine to use out if you want to just make sure you turn up the opacity

184
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,740
so it doesn't really ridiculous then the animation.

185
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,650
So I was scrolling down kind of like a slot machine.

186
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,070
They have other options so we can do Faid instead.

187
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,660
I personally think that's maybe a little less obnoxious although it flashes on a screen so that's probably

188
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,110
killing me.

189
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,440
And then delay this is how many microseconds it delays.

190
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,940
So if we set this higher it's just going to take longer to move.

191
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,900
So here the delay is 100 Sonera So it's like very abrupt and shaky.

192
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,500
So you know it's kind of up to you personal preference.

193
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,770
All right pass that you can set the color here or you can set the inside border.

194
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,130
So this separator really up to you.

195
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,640
You know I think solved works perfectly fine.

196
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,400
We wanted to we could do dotted all together on the sea makes much of a difference or none at all.

197
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,950
I think that's probably the worst.

198
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,050
Then we can change the font to fit whatever it is that we want animation and we use it.

199
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,320
Do we typically use flaunt.

200
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,320
Proxied and no I believe.

201
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,460
No it's U-Boot too.

202
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,990
So certainly don't have that one but you can just pick something that matches as close to you as you

203
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,360
can get it to as possible I'm pretty sure under the pro versions you can change this.

204
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,850
OK.

205
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,340
So then you want to go down here and change our.

206
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,730
Pretty simple.

207
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:35,880
So we might want to give something that entices them to watch long form tech videos.

208
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:43,320
Ok that might be a little wordy or whatever but I need to give them some reason to sign up so I might

209
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,930
want to simplify this so I might just say something like low tech videos I think that might be a little

210
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,610
more to the point.

211
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,910
It doesn't look like crap.

212
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,470
OK.

213
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,060
There we go.

214
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,310
And then down here is the subtitle.

215
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,960
So it says new website coming soon.

216
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:06,440
But for us it's like you know we could say YouTube channel launching soon.

217
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,160
OK.

218
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,010
Now we noticed that this headline is smaller than this one.

219
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,270
So what we can do is just highlight this right here and change the font size over here.

220
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,260
So I'm not sure what it has currently at 14.

221
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,600
So we could probably put it.

222
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,250
Yeah.

223
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,740
So put it at twenty two.

224
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,090
Put it at 28.

225
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's put it at I think 36 is fine.

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,590
There we go.

227
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,800
Now it has a little bit of what we call kerning meaning the letters are really squished together but

228
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,270
that's perfectly fine.

229
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,570
OK I want to be the first to know why launch just fill out the form.

230
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,110
There you go.

231
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,930
OK.

232
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,200
That's pretty simple.

233
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,600
If I were to do really actually launching a YouTube channel I would probably put in a video and I would

234
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,360
probably play around the background colors.

235
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,360
I probably make a logo specifically for the YouTube channel.

236
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,550
Honestly.

237
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,810
So I might even call this like let's call innovation tube.

238
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,330
It sounds terrible.

239
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,840
It's a little bit more catchy.

240
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,170
Innovation tube.

241
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:09,080
So I might even put something like the YouTube icon on YouTube iconic.

242
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:24,180
You go to YouTube PAGG you go and download that back now it's at an image brows and there you go.

243
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,780
OK then I put this up here just so people get a little bit of an idea what we're talking about.

244
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,390
I can automatically resize this right here by grabbing the corners.

245
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:38,190
Now notice it will constrain the dimensions so it doesn't make the image look screwed up so if I go

246
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,160
like this it always keep it like that.

247
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,410
So let's just make it at a reasonable size throw it right there.

248
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:44,990
OK.

249
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,980
There we go.

250
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,770
OK great.

251
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,170
So I think that perfectly gets the point across.

252
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,920
This should be a good mobile optimized website.

253
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,850
There's a lot of other small things on here.

254
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,610
This is useful for grids.

255
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,690
So this shows you where the grid is is going to help you line things up correctly such that if you don't

256
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,160
know the center line or you think there's not enough spacing you can kind of get more detailed with

257
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,390
it.

258
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,560
Here are the guys who can turn this off with a snap grid guides drive you crazy.

259
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,600
For me I don't really care.

260
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,520
And then last thing here is we have the layering.

261
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,220
So for instance I had this image on top of the YouTube for whatever reason and I wanted to be in front

262
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,270
of the YouTube I could say send forward.

263
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,360
Like just imagine it's like a stack of pieces of paper.

264
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,190
And I want this to be higher on the stack so I get sent for it.

265
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,870
Up there you see now it's covering it.

266
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,690
OK.

267
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,320
So use that to your heart's content.

268
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,810
So then we're not going to check it out by hitting preview tenacity to save it or to say yes.

269
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,970
All right so then once it's done saving it preview and this is what it looks like.

270
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,380
OK.

271
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,340
Pretty simple.

272
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,750
You also notice that it has equal spacing on both sides.

273
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,200
This bar appears just to remind you that hey we're looking at a preview I can click X out to remove

274
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,580
it.

275
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,310
But keeping this equal signs like this is actually very useful because when we want this to be viewed

276
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,810
on mobile it's very easy to get resized on mobile when it has this grid system.

277
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,630
OK.

278
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,900
So back to here we are.

279
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,550
And let's just finish.

280
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,750
All right so now we have this is the you are l link.

281
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,630
It's innovation innovations there's an innovation section with we want it to post we can publish it

282
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,330
we want to do a basic AB test meaning like we have two different pages of different wording or different

283
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,170
images I'm going to see which one performs better.

284
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,080
We can put new variant what that will do is make a copy of this page and then we can make changes to

285
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,590
it and then set it up here to run some basic tests.

286
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,330
Usually it's pretty simple.

287
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,110
Then down here you have a bunch of other tools that you can hook up pretty easily.

288
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,620
You guys you zippier that are useful if you use an email marketing software so you like say you want

289
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,900
the sign ups to go directly to your software.

290
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,850
You can do things like that consing contact a web very popular MailChimp too.

291
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,740
Now down here you can get a welcome email so when someone signs up you can send them a follow up e-mail

292
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,360
which is usually a very good idea.

293
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,710
Either way it's just that publish.

294
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,500
OK now let's publish we have this link so let's see it live.

295
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,730
OK so it looks like that.

296
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,820
All right so now you do have a page and it's ready to go after you publish it.

297
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,570
We'll publish anything you have.

298
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,360
You want to make changes you have to keep going back and doing this.

299
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,520
Now the last thing you have to do in order to make this work for mobile is is very crucial step as you

300
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,890
go down here to Mobile.

301
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,760
And you want to hit go to Ed..

302
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,730
So you have to change the mobile layout.

303
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,150
It's worth doing because this is what we came here for.

304
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,180
So now we have the mobile out right here.

305
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,020
Unfortunately it just takes you right back to the same page you made before.

306
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,390
But with some very quick editing we can change this up.

307
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:41,220
Obviously it's a good idea to have a mobile version and a web version because people might still go

308
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,640
to your web version or they might be on the web version of Instagram so it's worth having both.

309
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,990
Also keep in mind what looks good on a Web site does not necessarily look good on a mobile system.

310
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,830
So we'll just make our edits really fast.

311
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,450
OK so that didn't take very long at all.

312
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,750
Now it's updated.

313
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,810
Now I just want to make sure that everything is center aligned right.

314
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,060
So it's line up that.

315
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,880
And then once we get that bar I should be good.

316
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:23,370
OK.

317
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,040
Everything else has been updated on the Get rid of these buttons and let center line this just for the

318
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,690
sake of statics go.

319
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:32,880
OK cool.

320
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,440
Now what we can use you can save now we can preview the mobile version.

321
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,280
It should look like that.

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,390
And we go back and publish it one more time we should be good.

323
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,370
Let's finish.

324
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,150
OK.

325
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,850
So as pending changes well it's because I updated the mobile site so it's at republish they republished

326
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,220
this landing page and there we go.

327
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,650
OK.

328
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,290
Now we can look at it on our mobile phones and then put it into our Instagram.

329
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:56,970
OK.

330
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,130
So this is what it looks like.

331
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,700
There we go.

332
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,870
Pretty much optimized for a mobile phone.

333
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,360
I think it looks perfectly fine.

334
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,350
It's very dynamic it's got to form right here it can enter in very easily.

335
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,740
Cool.

336
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:14,220
So let's just copy and paste this and right there and then it's good or Instagram

337
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,400
then are just good at it profile.

338
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,610
It's at our Web site.

339
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,220
It in and hit done.

340
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,200
OK.

341
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:25,790
So there we go.

342
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,800
That's our link now.

343
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,370
So if I click it it takes us to that page where we're promoting our innovate our innovation too.

344
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,270
Now you notice that it's going to push you to a window that's through the Instagram browser so some

345
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,160
of the rules might be different than your Safari browser.

346
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,980
So what I would want to do is go back and say for instance move that YouTube icon slightly off just

347
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,400
because I know that this version of the browser overcompensates.

348
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,810
And also if I got to the point I like this I would get rid of that powered by laddered crap right there.

349
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,100
Now you notice that the link is kind of crazy.

350
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,680
So in this case what I would suggest doing is using a real wrapper.

351
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,400
Right Billy B.

352
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,750
T L Y is a great way of doing it.

353
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,670
Although again I know there's somewhat of a negative association with it.

354
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,480
If you have your own branded domain we talked about this earlier in the course when we talked we were

355
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,260
getting pretty Lincs.

356
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,530
That's a great way of doing it as well.

357
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,970
You can also just take any domain that you have and then do what's called a redirect and doing a redirect

358
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,650
is relatively simple just google it.

359
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:25,090
It's pretty simple depending on who your web host is almost all of them will just have buttons where

360
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:30,130
you can click and say redirect to then you'll set the URL to this so that then someone could say go

361
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,600
to Edinburgh dot com and send them right to this instead.

362
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,020
That is very useful.

363
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,900
Now that we have this set up though we also have analytics from Instagram.

364
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,670
And as people start to see it there will also give us our own analytics.

365
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,720
Keep in mind that you have a limit to how many people can visit it and it's 25000 which is consciously

366
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,530
a lot.

367
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:52,780
If you've gone through 25000 visitors so and decided if you like Lander Well then that's your problem

368
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,590
I guess.

369
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,670
All right guys and that's a pretty easy clean way of doing that.

370
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Save you at a special event say you had something you wanted to collect.

371
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,370
An e-mail address for say You just wanted to collect leads somewhere.

372
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,990
Then you can do whatever you like what we did and we could do an e-book you could direct them to a page

373
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,530
about you.

374
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,690
They can contact you.

375
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,880
There's a lot more flexibility with this than linked tree.

376
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,740
All right so that's it for now I'll see you guys in the next section.
