Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,810
OK, so we're going to talk about another crucial
part of your profile, that's the profile photo.
2

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,130
OK, so we're going to talk about another crucial
part of your profile, that's the profile photo.
3

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,380
So where does the profile photo
fall in the order of importance?
4

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:18,240
Well, I'd say it's probably only second to the combination
of your username and your profile name, and, well,
5

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,620
obviously your content is number one to all of that,
6

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,370
obviously your content is number one to all of that,
7

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,090
but when we're talking about the five or six things we have to optimize in the profile page, I'd probably put it like number two.
8

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,220
but when we're talking about the five or six things we have to optimize in the profile page, I'd probably put it like number two.
9

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,410
It's important because it sets the stage for your account.
10

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,970
A great looking profile primes people to
think that this is a high quality account.
11

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,110
Don't be surprised if people follow you
just for having a great profile shot.
12

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,300
That actually does happen quite a bit.
13

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,470
Great shot, I'll follow you. Sometimes
they don't even look at your actual photos.
14

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,590
Great shot, I'll follow you. Sometimes
they don't even look at your actual photos.
15

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,850
Great shot, I'll follow you. Sometimes
they don't even look at your actual photos.
16

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,950
But if you're a branded company, then I'd say it really
has less to do with your profile quality, simply
17

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,100
because I don't know what people really expect you
to put besides your company name or just your logo.
18

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,830
So in the case of business profiles, people just subconsciously check off that "Hey, it's not a pixelized photo
19

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,330
of a naked mole rat or a middle finger,
so we're pretty much good." Regardless,
20

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,560
put some thought and effort into this.
21

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,500
So, you know, with that being said,
22

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,320
how exactly do you rock a profile photo
in the profile photo game of Instagram?
23

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,920
Well, first thing you need understand
is how it technically works.
24

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,800
So where exactly are you going
to see the profile photo?
25

26
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,110
Well, if you've never used Instagram,
26

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,730
I will tell you. One is on the profile page in the top left,
27

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,190
but also you have a tiny, tiny thumbnail
version of it in comments,
28

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,130
and then, again, you might see it at the top left of your
profile, but on web, and on web it's a different size.
29

30
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,300
and then, again, you might see it at the top left of your
profile, but on web, and on web it's a different size.
30

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,630
So you have your web profile, your mobile profile, and then
you have your comment miniature thumbnail. Mobile
31

32
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,090
phones and tablets always show the logo the
same size, but web essentially upgrades it.
32

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,490
OK.
33

34
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:02,100
So here's the rule: 110 pixels by 110 pixels is what you
see on mobile. Now, 180 by 180 is what you see on web.
34

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,750
So here's the rule: 110 pixels by 110 pixels is what you
see on mobile. Now, 180 by 180 is what you see on web.
35

36
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,550
So here's the rule: 110 pixels by 110 pixels is what you
see on mobile. Now, 180 by 180 is what you see on web.
36

37
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:10,350
So that means we should use a photo that is, you
should probably make your photo 180 by 180.
37

38
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:16,170
You really don't want your photo to look pixelated
or rasterized, if you're fancy, on web browsers,
38

39
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,540
because a significant amount of the
traffic actually is on web browsers.
39

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,910
Now that we've covered the size and gotten that down,
40

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,680
what do we need to say about shape?
41

42
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,380
Well, as the more astute in the
course have noticed, it's a circle.
42

43
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,070
Now, do you want to upload a photo that
is a circle then? Well, no. If you do that,
43

44
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,500
Now, do you want to upload a photo that
is a circle then? Well, no. If you do that,
44

45
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,310
then essentially the Internet explodes and it's kind
of like dividing by zero. It creates a black hole.
45

46
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,490
then essentially the Internet explodes and it's kind
of like dividing by zero. It creates a black hole.
46

47
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,420
You can't do it and it's irresponsible to even try.
47

48
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,760
So you upload a square photo.
48

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,440
Yes, a square.
49

50
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,240
Who said rectangle?!
50

51
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,210
You need a square.
51

52
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,200
Luckily, any time you upload a photo for your profile picture, Instagram, inside of the app, will actually help you crop it,
52

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,220
Luckily, any time you upload a photo for your profile picture, Instagram, inside of the app, will actually help you crop it,
53

54
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,040
so it's really not that big of a deal.
54

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,590
Now, everything else I can give you is in the form of
wisdomly and wizardly advice, really it's just going
55

56
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,020
to come down to what type of account you have or
you're going for, at least. If you're a company or a
56

57
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,510
brand, and you're just making a profile for
an extension to that, then it's relatively simple.
57

58
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,140
You put your logo. I'm really not kidding on this one.
58

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,790
Your main goal is to provide something that's
consistent with your name and account.
59

60
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,580
If someone expects to see something, well, then you
want to meet that expectation. With regards to logos,
60

61
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,910
there are a couple of tips though. If you can, use the
symbol of your logo and not the text. The symbol,
61

62
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,430
if you don't actually know what I'm talking about, is
the graphic that generally accompanies the name
62

63
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,610
of your company or often is just by itself.
63

64
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,400
Nike's is a swoosh, Puma's is like
a house cat, and Adidas is...
64

65
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,260
I honestly don't know what the hell Adidas is. The reason
we preferably use a symbol is that the user can already
65

66
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,860
see who you are by virtue of your
account name and username,
66

67
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,360
so it's kind of redundant. If you don't have
a symbol in your logo, it's perfectly fine.
67

68
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,610
so it's kind of redundant. If you don't have
a symbol in your logo, it's perfectly fine
68

69
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,450
- a lot of people don't -
69

70
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:12,780
then you have to use what's called logotype.
Logotype is your name, but it's in a stylized way.
70

71
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,050
then you have to use what's called logotype.
Logotype is your name, but it's in a stylized way.
71

72
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:18,140
So some companies don't have symbols,
they just have their name, but it's all funky.
72

73
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,580
An example of this might be like Under Armour's logo.
73

74
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,420
It's like a U and an A kind of mixed together.
74

75
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,210
There's also this one, if you look at H&M.
75

76
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:26,590
There's also this one, if you look at H&M.
76

77
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,120
Literally just H&M, that's their logo,
but it's written funky and it's in red.
77

78
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,280
Now, if you don't even have that, then just try to put
the most simple and uncluttered version of your
78

79
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,660
logo you can. Sometimes we just don't have non-text
logos, or the text we have is really similar to what
79

80
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,320
you would just get if you typed it into a Word doc.
80

81
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,500
That's fine.
81

82
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,720
What you can do though is just go
for the shortest thing you can.
82

83
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,160
You really just have to make do with what you have
and keep in mind it's going to be viewed in a circle.
83

84
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,370
OK, here's an example of a company
that just didn't do anything.
84

85
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,390
This is Foundr (minus the E at the end),
and they do really well on Instagram,
85

86
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,860
but I mean, they did a decent job with their logo,
86

87
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,650
given the circumstances. Not ideal, but they don't have
a symbol logo, and that is technically their logotype.
87

88
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,050
given the circumstances. Not ideal, but they don't have
a symbol logo, and that is technically their logotype.
88

89
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,130
OK, so your logo, well, that's boring, right?
89

90
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,700
How exactly can you stand out?
90

91
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,990
Well, I'd say there's two ways that
I've seen that seem to work.
91

92
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,410
The first one is to use the background of the page
or the circle outline of your image in your logo.
92

93
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,730
OK, let's look at WeWork, for example.
93

94
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:32,600
WeWork is, they do rentals for co-working
spaces that are hip and cool all over the world.
94

95
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,340
Here, what they did is they made a concentric circle
inside of the gray line that automatically shows
95

96
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,890
whenever you put a profile photo,
96

97
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,290
so it looks like the image edge is
actually part of the logo itself.
97

98
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,500
Nicely done.
98

99
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,180
So nice, I almost want to pay $45 a
day to use their co-working spaces.
99

100
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,250
So nice, I almost want to pay $45 a
day to use their co-working spaces.
100

101
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,180
I say almost, because $45 a day for
cucumber water... kind of stupid.
101

102
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,850
But with that logo, mmm, I don't know.
102

103
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,470
But with that logo, mmm, I don't know.
103

104
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,130
But with that logo, mmm, I don't know.
104

105
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,080
All right, now here's another one. Walmart.
105

106
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,130
All right, now here's another one. Walmart.
106

107
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:07,170
And yes, I know, they are the Fortune 500 equivalent of
the death star, but their logo works. White on white
107

108
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,380
stands to highlight the actual color in the logo.
108

109
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,310
Here's another one.
109

110
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,370
The Onion. I don't know if you guys have
ever read The Onion, they're hilarious.
110

111
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,570
They kind of do the same thing.
111

112
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,080
They use the white background to blend in the page.
112

113
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:23,460
You know what you get extra points for? You get extra points
if you can actually get your logo to work with that red
113

114
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,720
and magenta circle that shows around your
profile when you have a story posted.
114

115
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,740
But that is boss mode,
115

116
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,220
and trust me, we'll get into that and
the whole stories thing later on.
116

117
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,600
and trust me, we'll get into that and
the whole stories thing later on.
117

118
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,370
I've only seen a couple accounts ever do it well. Now, if you want to spice it up a little more, try using the inverse of your logo.
118

119
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,900
I've only seen a couple accounts ever do it well. Now, if you want to spice it up a little more, try using the inverse of your logo.
119

120
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,190
OK, some branding experts would disagree that you
should ever do this, but I personally think it spices
120

121
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,170
things up and people still recognize who you are. Look at Tinder's website, and then look at the profile photo they have, for example.
121

122
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,320
things up and people still recognize who you are. Look at Tinder's website, and then look at the profile photo they have, for example.
122

123
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,690
They inverted their colors. Cool.
123

124
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,610
They inverted their colors. Cool.
124

125
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,620
OK, what if you're just a person and not a brand then?
125

126
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,080
OK.
126

127
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,350
Again, pretty straightforward as to your options.
127

128
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,930
You - and get this - want to show your face.
128

129
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,350
You - and get this - want to show your face.
129

130
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,270
Not only do you want to show your face,
130

131
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,720
you want to show a good photo of your face.
131

132
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,480
OK, here's the thing with personal accounts, your face conveys your personality way more than your body or your clothes.
132

133
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,910
OK, here's the thing with personal accounts, your face conveys your personality way more than your body or your clothes.
133

134
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,500
We are social animals.
134

135
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,740
We get a lot more information off of
the face than we do your chesticles.
135

136
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,130
We get a lot more information off of
the face than we do your chesticles.
136

137
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,280
So, first thing, don't go for a body shot,
show your face as much as you can.
137

138
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,350
So, first thing, don't go for a body shot,
show your face as much as you can.
138

139
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,410
The second thing you should do is make sure
that you have a high resolution image,
139

140
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:38,010
that was preferably shot professionally, and that
essentially means it was shot with a good camera, light,
140

141
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,600
and someone who knows what they're doing. And I don't
generally mean, like, you know, the hostage photos
141

142
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,720
you took standing next to a wall for your work lanyard.
142

143
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,330
I mean, like a professional headshot. Like, for instance,
what did you use for your LinkedIn photo?
143

144
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,750
I mean, like a professional headshot. Like, for instance,
what did you use for your LinkedIn photo?
144

145
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,480
I'm not saying use LinkedIn's photo, because
sometimes those are really too stuffy,
145

146
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,740
but you want one that's as high quality as possible.
146

147
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,980
If your photo was shot from, like,
an iPhone, it's fine, but it's not great.
147

148
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,840
You're not really doing yourself justice.
148

149
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,610
Remember, this is like one of the first things people
see. Look, here are photos of me on an iPhone,
149

150
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,320
and here are photos of me with an actual person who
knows what they are doing with the camera - went from
150

151
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,690
potato face to glorious magnificence.
151

152
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,280
If I was making a personal account, I would use
one of those and maybe make it look like this.
152

153
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,450
Now, a nice camera will shoot at a high
resolution, and that means crisper images.
153

154
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,260
Now, "Why is that exactly?", you ask, considering that it's,
you know, it's going to be 180x180 pixels no matter what.
154

155
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,490
Now, "Why is that exactly?", you ask, considering that it's,
you know, it's going to be 180x180 pixels no matter what.
155

156
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,410
Well, a nice camera actually will easily triple the
pixels in the same space, so when you downsize it
156

157
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:49,250
or at least they downsize it on their servers,
their servers can pick the best pixels in the photo,
157

158
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,200
and that's actually why it ends up being sharper.
158

159
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,330
I know, if you shoot something in a low resolution,
it just doesn't have as much to work with.
159

160
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,890
You also want to make sure your photo doesn't
have a bunch of noise in the background.
160

161
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Now, when I say noise, I mean basically things to look
at, visual noise. Seriously, have you seen how small
161

162
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,090
the thumbnails are on this thing,
especially in the comments?
162

163
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,680
You won't be able to see any of that and it'll actually
just make your image look like a smudge on the screen.
163

164
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,640
You won't be able to see any of that and it'll actually
just make your image look like a smudge on the screen.
164

165
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:20,570
You could either show them one thing, your face, or
nothing. If you try to show them more than one thing,
165

166
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,410
they'll see nothing, because nothing is essentially what you
get when you have too much visual noise on the image.
166

167
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:25,940
they'll see nothing, because nothing is essentially what you
get when you have too much visual noise on the image.
167

168
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,110
Use a plain background photo,
168

169
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,900
and if you're really nice, I might show you how to use
Photoshop to remove your background manually.
169

170
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,300
It's brutal, but you can do it.
170

171
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,400
OK, and last up, if you are a themed account,
171

172
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,750
again, this is one of those accounts that just post photos
on a theme, and it only kind of adjacently supports
172

173
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,910
your business or your industry,
173

174
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,990
well, you kind of have the same options.
174

175
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,700
You can use a logo or just use the best photo you have
from what you think will be your content. If you're
175

176
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,130
a comedy account, well, you can get away with anything
really. You can get away with a lower resolution photo,
176

177
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,590
like fuckjerry over here, I think it was kind of
a play on, like, that design from the 1990s.
177

178
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,120
But if you're not a comedy account,
then really the same rules apply.
178

179
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,400
Keep it simple, and then keep it high resolution.
If you can make it blend well with the container line
179

180
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,820
or the background, well, extra points.
180

181
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,630
or the background, well, extra points.
181

182
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,700
The only other tip I can give you is, since you have a more
wide open canvas to work with, make something colorful.
182

183
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,570
The only other tip I can give you is, since you have a more
wide open canvas to work with, make something colorful.
183

184
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,260
Seriously, color should never be underestimated.
184

185
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,330
Why?
185

186
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,180
It's because of your comment thumbnail.
186

187
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,820
You're going to get a lot of viewers that click through
your comments to your page, because that's a
187

188
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
big part of growing your account.
188

189
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,550
What stands out when you're
scrolling through 100 comments?
189

190
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,980
Well, something that's crisp and has colors in it.
190

191
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,880
Personally, I like deep reds, like Airbnb here.
191

192
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,110
Another example is Thought Bot. Red, for whatever
reason, kind of always stands out, especially against white
192

193
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,110
and gray, which is what the text and the background is.
193

194
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,720
Green works as well, but only if you use it as an
overwhelming color, or it's a shade that you don't always
194

195
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,490
see. Again, dark green actually
kind of blends in a little bit more.
195

196
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,350
All right guys, that is really it for now.
196

197
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,770
Remember, we shoot for a square image,
197

198
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:15,670
it's a 180 by 180 pixels, and you want either a simple
symbol logo as a brand, or a professional shot of your
198

199
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,620
face if you're a human person. Themed
accounts can really do whatever they want.
199

200
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,170
My suggestion though is to go for something that's
colorful and then matches your content. Next lecture, I'll
200

201
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:32,050
show you how you can put up your photo, what to
do if you have no editing tools or motivation in life,
201

202
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:38,320
and then, finally, if you do want to get professional design or professional photos done, what exactly are your options.
202

203
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,190
and then, finally, if you do want to get professional design or professional photos done, what exactly are your options.
203

204
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,610
All right, guys. See you then.
204

205
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,140
All right, guys. See you then.
