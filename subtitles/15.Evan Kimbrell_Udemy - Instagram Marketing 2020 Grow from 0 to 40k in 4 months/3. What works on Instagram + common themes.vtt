Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.650
We're going to talk a little bit about Instagram content, what
users expect, and in general what works on this platform.
2

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.910
We're going to talk a little bit about Instagram content, what
users expect, and in general what works on this platform.
3

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.670
Now, every platform's different and it caters to different tastes.
4

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.890
Facebook is anything that's casual and social.
5

6
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.430
Twitter is good for anything that's concise and catchy.
6

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.710
Snapchat is pure crap and mostly only appeals 11-year olds.
7

8
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.630
But Instagram is the king of visual and of presentation.
8

9
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.830
Instagram started as a photo sharing site and still
largely is. The first thing that took off from the
9

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.550
site actually was just landscapes
taken from photographers.
10

11
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.370
Landscapes are pretty, and with the right image editing,
pretty drool-worthy. There are some landscapes
11

12
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.250
I look at and I want to eat it. So it makes sense that
anything that's visually compelling is going to
12

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.750
be a natural fit for Instagram.
13

14
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.050
So the first question I think business owners need
to ask themselves is, "Is what I'm doing inherently
14

15
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.580
visual, and if not, can it be made visual?"
15

16
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.930
If you make a software that, I don't know, helps
you optimize code, can you make that visual?
16

17
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.890
If you make a software that, I don't know, helps
you optimize code, can you make that visual?
17

18
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.560
No, not really.
18

19
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.920
I honestly can't think of how you
would consistently make that visual.
19

20
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.190
But if you're running, let's say, a coding school, on
the other hand, then yeah, that is visual, right?
20

21
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.020
You can show your space, you can show your students,
show your events, I don't know, give acceptance tips, etc.
21

22
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.140
etc. People doing things is something
that generally works on Instagram.
22

23
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.400
Now, the next thing I want to point out is brevity.
23

24
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.790
Facebook doesn't have a limit on the length of their videos.
24

25
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.040
You can post the whole three videos of the
extended Lord Of The Rings if you want to.
25

26
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.360
On Twitter, you can and do often link out to blogs.
26

27
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.680
Instagram is not one of these things. People typically
interact with the site in order to see pretty things,
27

28
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.400
Instagram is not one of these things. People typically
interact with the site in order to see pretty things,
28

29
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.310
laugh, and maybe find something that's interesting or to keep
in touch with friends and brands that they might care about.
29

30
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.220
laugh, and maybe find something that's interesting or to keep
in touch with friends and brands that they might care about.
30

31
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.490
So what that means is that brevity works really well
on Instagram. If you can't explain what your service
31

32
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.660
or product is in a sentence, then
Instagram could be difficult for you.
32

33
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.810
Your best bet here would be to focus on something
that's adjacently related to your product.
33

34
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.520
Let's say you're a new medical device that's basically
a better mousetrap for... insert into the blank.
34

35
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.740
Now, sometimes this can be hard to explain, so maybe
you make an account that's themed around the disease
35

36
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.940
or ailment that your device treats, and
then you fill it with stories and tips.
36

37
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.170
You can then curate that audience and
then drive that audience to your business.
37

38
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.920
Of course it is possible that you could make it for your 
medical device company, you know, for God's sake,
38

39
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.940
Medtronic has 30,000 followers, and Novo Nordisk,
I've never heard of them, but they have 77,000.
39

40
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.960
How did they do it?
40

41
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.030
Well, for the most part, they just focus on their employees,
and then every now and then they'll give like
41

42
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.830
a feature of their product.
42

43
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.370
So, in general, we need some type of visual interest
and themes that we can express succinctly.
43

44
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.180
If you're ever stuck for what to post,
44

45
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.120
there really are a lot of categories, and in the resources
we've attached a decently exhaustive list that
45

46
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.820
you can go back to in the event that you forget.
46

47
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.920
Here are some common posting themes though that you'll
see across Instagram that have all demonstrated traction.
47

48
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.640
Here are some common posting themes though that you'll
see across Instagram that have all demonstrated traction.
48

49
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.880
We have product photos, short video demos of a product
even, we have customer stories or customer highlights,
49

50
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.480
we have the same thing, but for employees, you can
highlight an employee, tell their story, or just take
50

51
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.700
photos of them doing their job in a non-creepy way.
51

52
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.560
We have motivational or inspirational quotes.
52

53
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.890
There are entire accounts built off just motivational quotes,
53

54
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.480
usually it's like the entrepreneurship niche,
or things like weightlifting, or just motivation.
54

55
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.870
It's possibly the laziest way to make a successful
Instagram account, so don't discount it.
55

56
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.310
I mean, it still works.
56

57
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.770
Educational content works really well as well.
57

58
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.740
Tips and tricks for whatever your theme or niche is,
or how to do something in 60 seconds, since a video
58

59
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.690
limit is 60 seconds.
59

60
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.750
There are accounts that are popular just because
they post interesting facts or life hacks.
60

61
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.130
Now, another style that works across all types of media
on Instagram is what we call BTS or behind the scenes.
61

62
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.240
Now, another style that works across all types of media
on Instagram is what we call BTS or behind the scenes.
62

63
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.090
If you're either a brand or a person, well, then virtually
everyone out there has some interest in knowing
63

64
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.430
what your production looks like or
what you do on a day to day basis.
64

65
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.440
What's happening behind the camera or the computer
screen that's producing these posts? For whatever reason,
65

66
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.370
we're just fascinated by these things.
66

67
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.870
This doesn't work as a themed account, but it works
really well for both businesses and personal accounts.
67

68
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.460
Another big type you'll see is UGC or user generated content.
68

69
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.530
You do this by asking your followers or any customers
you have honestly to do something or send in a
69

70
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.100
photo. Photos, for whatever reason, engage at higher rates
70

71
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.590
with this type of stuff, although it can be hard to
maintain things like production quality if you ask
71

72
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.670
some random guy to do it for you.
72

73
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.580
Some of my favorite posts that actually fit into this category
are what you call ask the audience, where the entire
73

74
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.860
point of the post is actually just to
ask your followers a question.
74

75
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.540
So, a music company might ask, "What are you listening
to right now?" or a tech company might say, "iOS
75

76
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.410
or Android? Fight in the comments" and it's guaranteed
to get responses, and it's brain dead easy to pull off.
76

77
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.220
Now, some others you'll see across the
platform are promotions and giveaways.
77

78
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.430
Usually, you give something away in return for
a comment, a share, or answering a question.
78

79
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.840
Another theme you might see from day one
is humor too, funny posts work really well,
79

80
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.080
assuming they fit your brand and are actually funny.
80

81
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.970
So those are some really common themes that you can
dip out of whenever you need something to post.
81

82
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.150
So let's recap it.
82

83
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.360
Instagram is the king of visual, and while it's
not as short attention span as Twitter, users
83

84
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.350
still do prefer to get things quickly and then move on.
84

85
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.930
Make sure your account matches these two requirements.
85

86
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.570
Sometimes it can be hard to think of a visual aspect
that you can take advantage of, but trust me, there
86

87
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.290
are companies that are in way worse
positions than you that pulled this off.
87

88
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.740
Tylenol has an Instagram account.
88

89
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.710
I'm not even making this up.
89

90
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.510
Once you get yourself lined up and know what is
the general theme that you're going for, or going to
90

91
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.710
be posting on, or some visual pattern
you're going to be aiming for,
91

92
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.440
then you just need to get into the nitty gritty and
start thinking about the actual what of your post.
92

93
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.310
There is an enormous amount of precedent, and you
could post 10 times a day for 100 years without running
93

94
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.520
out of ideas that have already been done.
94

95
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.940
Show your product.
95

96
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.920
Put up a quote.
96

97
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.980
Teach them something.
97

98
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.940
Show something from behind the scenes,
ask your users a question.
98

99
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.130
Throw a contest.
99

100
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.860
Tons of stuff that you can do.
100

101
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.600
We'll explore these common types of posts later on in the
course. Like always, if you have questions, post in the Slack.
101

102
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.710
We'll explore these common types of posts later on in the
course. Like always, if you have questions, post in the Slack.
102

103
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.660
Otherwise, see you next lecture.
103

104
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.620
Otherwise, see you next lecture.
