00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.680
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.460
All right so we're going to go over another way that you can put together image post for Instagram.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.000
And this is photoshop.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.630
I don't know if you use Photoshop before but it is kind of the master tool of pretty much anything image

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.670
manipulation image filtering coloring anything really.

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.460
It's probably the most complex and the most capable image manipulator out there.

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.130
Now if you're satisfied with the other tools that we've used then I would just say skip on if you're

8
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.380
just curious about how Photoshop works.

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.480
You can follow along.

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.440
I'm going to just say this that we're not going to hit every single feature on Photoshop that would

11
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.690
take roughly a year to do.

12
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.210
We're just going to cover the really basic stuff so that we can do effectively what we've done in the

13
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.010
other lectures with the other tools.

14
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.620
And then it's really upon you if you want to get in deep with learning how to do a lot of the other

15
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.790
stuff they can do.

16
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.510
But it sounds a very very powerful tool.

17
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.800
So there's really anything you want to do you can do in Photoshop it's just a question of whether or

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.690
not it's the most efficient way of doing it.

19
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.230
One thing worth pointing out is that Photoshop has a sister program called illustrator.

20
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.330
I wouldn't use Illustrator for something like this.

21
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.580
Illustrator is good for what's called vector vector is just a way of describing an image that means

22
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.170
that it's infinitely scalable because all of the points on the image are all relative to each other.

23
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.530
Where as Photoshop is more like the way we think of an actual photo each individual tiny little space

24
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.780
is a pixel that has a color and then you put them all together into a photo so it's just a lot easier

25
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.450
to work with.

26
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.520
All right so let's just jump right in.

27
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.060
I'm going to use 6.

28
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.450
Now this is actually an outdated version now used to be that you would see one two three four all up

29
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.260
to six.

30
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.550
But they then stopped doing that and started doing Adobe c c and c c just means Creative Cloud.

31
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.410
The reason why they did that is that they wanted it turned into a subscription service and you had to

32
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.560
constantly have it attached to the Internet and that's how they got around pirating whatever.

33
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.550
Personally I use the old one because I'm just more used to it.

34
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.460
There's rarely any difference between the two.

35
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.510
Really all they've done is just rearrange the buttons and icons change the names of some things and

36
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.070
then use that as a justification for charging you more money.

37
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.340
So I'm not doing it but it's up to you to use CC if you CC perfectly fine.

38
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.700
Just keep in mind that it cost something like $25 a month $30 a month something like that.

39
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.360
Do you have a student e-mail address you can actually get it cheaper.

40
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.640
But that's pretty much the only thing you have which is better than buying it outright.

41
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.240
That used to be like $300 or so anyway.

42
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.960
This is generally what it looks like.

43
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.390
Generally you have toolkits over here on the left.

44
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.630
You have a lot of different random stuff.

45
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.690
Over here we're not going to talk about that.

46
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.340
Over here we have layers.

47
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.150
Now if you don't see any of the stuff I'm showing you you can actually just go up your window and check

48
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.430
the box or whatever you actually need.

49
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.970
So this is pretty useful cooking history that will show you all the things you've done.

50
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.620
And then you can roll your image back.

51
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.690
You've made a mistake.

52
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.440
So the first thing you want to do is just go to file new.

53
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.280
And what we're going to do is just create something that matches the size of an Instagram post.

54
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.720
Now in its current post if you remember right it's 10 A.D. by 10 the rest of it I don't really suggest

55
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.050
screwing with.

56
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.410
I mean you can start with a white background if you want more background color.

57
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.150
The rest of the stuff is just not terribly important.

58
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.580
The resolution is perfectly fine and the rest of it you should be fine.

59
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.820
So you can give it a name if you want to.

60
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.920
It's called Instagram post.

61
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.900
And there you go.

62
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:49.110
So the way that this works pretty much like everything else you can zoom in and out and back it's command

63
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.750
minus or the dash in and command plus to go back in.

64
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.570
On Windows it's very similar as opposed to a command.

65
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.720
I think it's just control plus and minus.

66
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.660
Over here the way this works is you just have a series of tools.

67
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.760
Now they're not all immediately useful but it's worth knowing how a couple of them work.

68
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.800
You add text over here the text button you have shape's over here with the rectangle tool and then what

69
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.510
you do is just change it to a line or a custom shape or an ellipse or any of that stuff if you want

70
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.090
to ever say like just make a background color for your space.

71
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.050
You get this bucket of paint and then what you do is come down here and it has two different colors.

72
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.490
So usually what you're going to do is just set the foreground color and then pick what you want.

73
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.140
You can use a hex code if you want to.

74
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.730
Let's say I wanted to use that red.

75
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.050
So then what I do is there we go and I go over here and just click OK.

76
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.410
So that's how you get red if you want that red.

77
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.610
Now if you didn't want that you could also just hit in Mac commands Z or in Windows controls.

78
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.520
So we just go back up here is the eraser tool that's pretty useful if you are editing something and

79
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.480
you want to go back.

80
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.110
You just start.

81
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.010
You can just start doing Racinet the way you want to modify this is up here.

82
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.630
It'll show the size and so the size is kind of will dictate how big your racer is.

83
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.130
Sometimes it's a lot easier to work with smaller racers if you're doing some fine tuning the rest of

84
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.410
it.

85
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.360
I just ignore it.

86
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.640
OK so if you wanted to important image as background which I strongly suggest Hesters is doing it like

87
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.910
a bar or else just taking an image and throwing it and going rolling stock photo places even you can

88
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.260
just take something and then just drag and drop it like that.

89
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.040
And there you go.

90
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.530
Not automatically put you into the cropped mode and the crop mode.

91
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.620
You can just grab over here over here if you want it to scale with the same proportions of the image

92
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.020
doesn't look screwed up use the corners but then also hold shift while you do it.

93
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.330
Or alternatively you can go up here and click this link buttons it links the width to the height so

94
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.210
that you're not changing one at a time.

95
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.430
So that's what I would you like this probably just over extend it like that.

96
00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.310
OK.

97
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.490
So we know this is the canvas right here.

98
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.020
Everything that goes outside of the canvas that's going to show up so it doesn't really matter.

99
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.850
And then I might just check the box to say I'm good.

100
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.140
OK.

101
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.660
Now you'll notice over here when I did that it created another layer.

102
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.000
OK.

103
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.740
Now Photoshop works in layers.

104
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.670
It's very similar like you noticed in Kanva how you can push things forward and backwards.

105
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.960
It's just treating objects like layers so the background is that white thing.

106
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.340
And then this toast image we put down is on top of that.

107
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.010
Now if I wanted this to be underneath the background I just moved down here.

108
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.180
Same thing over here if you wanted to just change the visibility.

109
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.010
You can do that.

110
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.630
You don't see it and you can also change things like the opacity over here and the fill if you actually

111
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.770
have a color that's in it.

112
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.720
All right so then it's probably going to do depending on your version.

113
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.660
Can I ask you a bunch of gobbledygook that doesn't mean anything to anyone.

114
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.000
But basically it's going to ask you to rasboras this into an object the smart object.

115
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.950
It doesn't really matter.

116
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.160
Basically means you can edit it.

117
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.360
So you say yes.

118
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.870
Now it's like a Photoshop Element or something.

119
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.750
I don't even know.

120
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.310
All right cool.

121
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.980
So now depending on what we want to do.

122
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.110
There's a lot we can do.

123
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.850
So if you want to manually blurt this out a blur background the blur tool over here.

124
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.090
Now you could blur it or sharpen it or just smudge it which is slightly different.

125
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.190
And here is the tool and I don't generally suggest using the blur like this.

126
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:23.040
I mean if you want to individually blur something specifically then sure grab this and just go to town

127
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.000
on it.

128
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.860
Generally if you want to blur it we're just going to use a filter.

129
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.940
Ok so at the top here at seena a filter and I'm sorry in advance if your Photoshop version doesn't say

130
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.870
it like this.

131
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.530
They're all bad.

132
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.200
I mean they all have the same features they're just reorganized.

133
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.830
Like I said it's a giant scam.

134
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.040
So you just got a filter here and you have a lot of different options and what this will do is it apply

135
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.810
a uniform filter to the entire thing.

136
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.500
So anything the filter setting up here that's going to affect everything over here you can actually

137
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.830
kind of tailor it to what you want.

138
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.640
So what just going to blur that as a bunch of different types of blur.

139
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:04.390
And it just depends how much you want to get into this again tilt shift blur.

140
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:10.320
We saw this earlier it's when you blur the top and the bottom and you can adjust that Iris more I believe

141
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.650
is like a radio ball or feel better.

142
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.850
I'm not even entirely sure that just have a lot.

143
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.380
OK so if you just want to you know whatever I don't understand this just blurred blurry there.

144
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.750
Personally I like this version it's called gaussian blur it's a very common type of blur.

145
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:30.750
It's a for me I think it's a little bit easier to make out what is being blurred.

146
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.780
So I would say gaussian blur.

147
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.410
OK and then has a preview here which is pretty useful.

148
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.750
So how blurred do you want it to be.

149
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:43.320
Well I'd probably want it to be blurred but enough that I can still kind of tell what it is.

150
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.940
The way that you would modify this is by changing the pixel so the radius of the pixels are basically

151
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:54.050
it treats it like Blur pixels being pasted on top of it larger the size essentially has a larger effect

152
00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:01.560
so we would think that's like a very good like we can tell but it's going to give us plenty of room

153
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.370
to work with.

154
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.320
So we could just blur it like that.

155
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.780
OK.

156
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.450
Now let's say we didn't want to blur it.

157
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.210
We could just control Z and then go up here and there's just tons and filters you can play around with.

158
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.770
Now these filters give you way more control which is a good or bad thing depending on your workflow

159
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.570
and your technical experience or just experience with the design.

160
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.100
They have tons and tons of things here.

161
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:29.940
I mean you just play around with these and see if you can just get some type of design or effect that

162
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.340
you think is interesting like that.

163
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.810
OK.

164
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.330
And you can tile it.

165
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.430
Interesting.

166
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.000
Ones you can try.

167
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.130
Let's say you want to add noise that just adds little speckles onto it right dust and scratches.

168
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.320
Just a different style of noise.

169
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.520
Dust and scratches.

170
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:50.110
It kind of just adds a little bit of a too much all over the

171
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.180
not too visible.

172
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.960
I mean it has an effect it's just kind of hard to tell.

173
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.260
So you look at that.

174
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.890
Yeah I mean clientèle It's like scratched up a little bit.

175
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:13.590
Roll that back with control or Z if you're on a Mac trying distorting it if you want it to try like

176
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.130
a ripple distort.

177
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.540
This is usually a little bit easier to work with.

178
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.740
You can zoom out of the preview you want to see.

179
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:27.240
So that's the it's like this that makes it look like you're tripping on some psychedelic drugs a little

180
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:33.330
bit but you know got kind of looks like a 10 year old TV set used to screw up with getting the signal

181
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.360
incorrectly.

182
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.940
So they're I don't know it's another fact.

183
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.860
Now if I wanted to do any of those things that we did in the Instagram app or anything like the photography

184
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.720
apps we play it the hue the brightness the contrast things like that.

185
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.890
One way of doing it is up here.

186
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:48.690
You know the top right.

187
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.040
So this is just determining what type of tools you're being presented with so I can give you a different

188
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.170
grouping of tools if you go down to photography.

189
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.650
It will then give you some more things you'd see in photography This is called a histogram which just

190
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.810
helps you see the balance of colors and images.

191
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.400
That's up to you feel like a hard core photo editor.

192
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.360
And here you have adjustment so if you do brightness contrast levels curves these are things that are

193
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.160
you have to play with a histogram to do it.

194
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:21.570
Fun to play with but very hard to understand exposure levels huge saturation color balance black and

195
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.780
white channel mixer is a little bit weird.

196
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.440
And then things like inverting color.

197
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.270
So really I just stick to the simple stuff.

198
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.520
So if you want to lower the contrast here what you can do is just play with the slider right here.

199
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:38.330
It lowers the contrast up a little bit in his photos and how a lot of contrast work with those it were

200
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.920
here creates a new layer for this adjustment.

201
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.470
And they just do that I think out of convenience so that if you keep adding adjustments we'll just have

202
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.390
stacks of them and then you can edit each one that way.

203
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:56.670
So I want the lower contrast like a little bit darker as well.

204
00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.170
We could do it like that.

205
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.560
And Photoshop is great if you really want to like fine tune things.

206
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:09.070
Or if I wanted to and text you just go over here to the text button and I could put in whatever it was.

207
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.270
We want it to be.

208
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.580
So I think that originally we said electronics.

209
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.980
So if I wanted to grab some fonts up here I could do whatever they want.

210
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.890
I'll probably just stick with proxy even Noma because I know that one works pretty well and here is

211
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.290
where I change the settings on how thick it is.

212
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.980
Here's where you change the size.

213
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:35.250
And then you have one last thing that gives you a way of slightly changing the way that each text is

214
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:40.620
processed to make it look crisp sharp strong or smooth and you'll kind of notice when the image gets

215
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.310
a little or the text gets a little bit larger.

216
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.400
So if it does like that and I wanted to make it look stronger I could go to strong.

217
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.740
And you kind of notice it like old it a little bit.

218
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.470
See if you can make this larger.

219
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:58.300
So if I wanted to make it crisp you kind of pull back the are a little bit.

220
00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.890
It's sometimes hard to tell.

221
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.060
And sometimes it actually makes a pretty big effect.

222
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.170
So we probably want this to be smooth

223
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.170
OK.

224
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:14.660
So I have that and then if we wanted to change the thickness it could just highlight it and then go

225
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.610
to Simmie Bowl.

226
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.690
You'd see it just got thinner.

227
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.270
I personally I like extra bolts.

228
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.500
I'm trying to read it so good.

229
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.380
Extra Bold.

230
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.720
OK cool.

231
00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:31.150
So we have that I probably would shrink it a little bit just so it sticks out a little bit better.

232
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.470
We'll drop this down to 80.

233
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:41.270
OK then I'm going to do is I'm going to add a background and then add opacity that background just sticks

234
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.150
out a little bit more.

235
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.160
So what I'll do is go and I'll draw a box.

236
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.200
Now when I draw the box it will create its own layer.

237
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.300
But if I wanted to manually create my own lawyer I could go down here and click on this button looks

238
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:59.050
like a piece of paper folded over that all manually created if I wanted to do this.

239
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:05.480
OK so it came out red remember we said this is red but I can still change it by double clicking here

240
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.730
and then changing the color to whatever I want someone to go with white notes here.

241
00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.900
So I need to pull the text above it on the left side to make sure it pops up on top.

242
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.300
Now what I'm going to do.

243
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:21.540
So I'm just going to lower the capacity of this rectangle and make it kind of look like something that's

244
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:31.170
just really framing it's ever so slightly I might try to change the color slightly to make it more of

245
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:37.730
a gray that it doesn't have such a weird outliner effect.

246
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:45.610
So we could do it like that if you wanted to and then I might change the shape of the rectangle again.

247
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.490
Well you can do on Mac and T or Control-C on PC.

248
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.710
Well that does it just puts you back in that editor or you can change the shape of any object.

249
00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.370
You want to make sure that you're being symmetrical.

250
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:04.390
Go up to view and then go to a show and it should have grid.

251
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.330
So you go to grid.

252
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:05.790
OK.

253
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.530
Now you can see it like this.

254
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:13.880
And if you wanted to you could really kind of just tailor it every way like zoom in and see that you're

255
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.740
making it pixel perfect.

256
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:16.970
OK.

257
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.610
So whatever you get two pixels on each side.

258
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:22.380
There we go.

259
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:22.870
Great.

260
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.340
I'm going to move the grids because it drove me nuts.

261
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.160
So there we go.

262
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.280
Let's see you do a little bit of adjustment.

263
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:35.420
So we'll go up here and this is going allow me to move this box if I click it and then just use the

264
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.110
arrows.

265
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.400
I can just ever so slightly move it.

266
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.130
OK.

267
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:44.490
So the rest of what I have to do is just throw in the logo and just some tweaking.

268
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.260
So if I want to throw on the logo I can do the exact same way I did it before.

269
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.810
Just find it and drop it in

270
00:15:53.240 --> 00:16:01.190
severe we this here I will throw it in and then just lock it so I don't screw up the sizing on that

271
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.170
we'll try a different orientation of the logo this time.

272
00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:08.760
Just see outcome's out there and then I'll throw the other one text.

273
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.060
And will lock it and screw it up.

274
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:15.650
And put it down here.

275
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.170
Probably

276
00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:20.740
OK.

277
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.440
So that's one way of doing it.

278
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:30.160
Personally what I would probably do is edit this back ground a little bit more just so it fades a little

279
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.750
bit more.

280
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.720
So I could go back and do another round of contrast.

281
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.280
Lowering it can just make it darker if I wanted to.

282
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:44.280
So I think this is probably fine even if I want to blurt out I could do that could have gauzy and blue.

283
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.490
And then just do a very light one and see if that helps.

284
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:49.750
OK.

285
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.620
Yeah I mean it doesn't make it a little bit easier to focus on the text.

286
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:52.880
OK.

287
00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:53.770
So there you go.

288
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:54.680
That's a 10 anyway.

289
00:16:54.750 --> 00:17:00.300
Any image we put our own text in there we put in our logos we used the background color and we showed

290
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.440
how to edit it.

291
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:09.120
That is just a very very small piece of what Photoshop can do their entire course is built off of Photoshop

292
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:14.660
that are like 30 hours if you want to Photoshop images this is a good start for you.

293
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.290
You know how to create the size of the image you know what to work with layers you know how to modify

294
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:25.620
some of those photo effects on it you know how to add filters that are like preset type of effects and

295
00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.840
you know how to use the basic tools over here to get going also to import images.

296
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.690
An error of change your text and all that stuff.

297
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.240
So I think that's good enough to get started if you want to find more about Photoshop will attach some

298
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:42.390
summaries and some guides that we found useful and the resources otherwise seen next ex-boxer.
