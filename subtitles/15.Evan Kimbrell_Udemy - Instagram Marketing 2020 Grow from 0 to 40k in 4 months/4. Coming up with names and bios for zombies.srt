1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,730
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:08,110
OK so with this lecture we're going to do is talk about creating names and creating bios.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,410
I generally suggest doing this up front as opposed to creating an account and then coming up with a

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,110
name and a bio at the same time.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,000
Just because it's a lot easier if you batch these together it's a lot easier to kind of get in whatever

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,600
mode you need to be and pull this off.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,930
And also it's kind of nice because if you know how many zombies you want to create.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,370
Well you can just create X amount of account names an X amount of biros and then is just a matter of

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,700
copy and paste when you go and set them up.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:42,000
OK so first thing we want to do is we want to come up with some names that we know are available.

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,580
Now previously the way we did this it was through a Web site called name checker and it's without to

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,080
eat the very end you can use that Web site.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,660
It works perfectly fine.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,610
I've found that occasionally sometimes it's wrong and when you're doing this in bulk that can actually

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,520
be kind of a pain.

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,680
So I prefer actually just go directly to the Web site itself and to do my name checking there.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,010
So just go to ask.com not common and log out so that you can see this original Sign-Up screen right

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,670
here.

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,240
You have to fill out this information if you get a check for a user name.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,810
All you have to do is just fill in username right here.

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,570
And if it's wrong you'll get an x and if it's right you'll get a checkmark.

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,270
OK.

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,330
Now the strategy of coming up using names is.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,770
I mean it's kind of the same thing that we talked about before we came up with these names in general.

25
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:37,620
I personally like to pick a bunch of common words that are in my space and my niece and then add some

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,770
adjectives and by adding those two things together I can find a lot of available account names.

27
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,650
Now my niece is innovation it's technology it's business.

28
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:54,580
It's gadgets it's robots it's really anything that's generic enough to represent technology.

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,700
Also it's pretty lucky because I can say technology and if that's not available say tech Now obviously

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,950
easy really good short accounts are just not going to be available socially in bulk.

31
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,290
So give yourself a little bit of a leeway when you start picking names so let's just say I wanted to

32
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:18,960
make an account that the base of the name was technology and I wanted to say something like It's futuristic

33
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,580
or it's advanced and it's very new.

34
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,850
So I might say advanced

35
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,500
technology and if I think this is available I might just stop in and see if it's available.

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,730
Pretty sure it's not.

37
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,770
OK so I'll just add one more modifier so I could say today and let's see if that was available.

38
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,830
Get in and it is so it has a checkmark that means that's a good one.

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,320
So it's difficult but I just do is I just copy and paste this into a note dark and have her note whatever

40
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,180
or even physically write it down if you want to just keep track as you go through these.

41
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,040
So you can create a list now.

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,790
You know if I want to create 10 zombie accounts that was my strategy Well I don't do that nine more

43
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,410
times.

44
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,800
Now there's pretty easy tricks.

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,080
All I like to do is use the base like technology and then just change some of these modifiers.

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,990
So instead of advanced I could a future or futuristic Let's see if those are available.

47
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,550
Future technology today a little bit ironic but OK.

48
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,850
So check mark good one.

49
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,130
Now we got to now I can do the next one.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,670
I could say the future is stick.

51
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,280
Yes this one is also available futuristic technology today.

52
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,530
OK great.

53
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,720
Anybody coming to this account knows exactly what it is.

54
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,120
It's futuristic technology today and since it's a repost account they're not going to be confused as

55
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,800
to what I'm reposing all about and chances are if they follow this account means they're interested

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,730
in technology which means that they're probably getting interested in my main account is also technology.

57
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,940
OK there's not really any magic to this.

58
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,380
This is just the way that I like to use it.

59
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,400
Pick some adjectives you can even write them out beforehand like what are adjectives you think could

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,980
describe your accounts and then use a base word like technology or gadgets or whatever else say you're

61
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,840
taking account yoga.

62
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,310
OK well yoga could be your base stretching could be your base.

63
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,870
I don't know.

64
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,490
Oh my.

65
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,330
Could be your bait whatever is something that your users or that are and you're going to recognize.

66
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,010
You should know this since this is your.

67
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,460
Right.

68
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,460
The next thing you need to do is just pick a bio.

69
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,330
Now again we're going to refer back to the bio strategies that we talked about way back at the beginning

70
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,050
of the course.

71
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:26,500
So for instance with intimations station we did the bullet point list with one singular emoji.

72
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,600
And I just kind of thought of what are some things that might make my account attractive or something

73
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,840
you might see on a technology account.

74
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,270
And again I just took this and it is kind of remixed it.

75
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,110
So in my old one or the main account we say curated list of the best in tech innovation world changing

76
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,120
trends to watch weekly tech giveaways open submissions to us.

77
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,710
There's a lot of different lines I could have put in if you remember watching me create this account

78
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,680
is a lot of things I could have said I just kind of left them out.

79
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,610
So this is the time where you can kind of start bringing these back.

80
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,850
So I'll give you an example of what I ended up doing.

81
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,300
I just wrote out a bunch of these.

82
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,660
OK.

83
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:07,560
So the coolest gadgets and tech on the web follow for robot spaceships and everything tech.

84
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,370
OK.

85
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,440
Daily Post of the most exciting new technology get inspired motivated and intrigued as you can see there's

86
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,300
pretty much a trend to this right.

87
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,600
I used kind of the same lines that other accounts use that we covered before.

88
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,730
Things like follow four and then say whatever it is that you're going to be posting.

89
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,080
Then you can use something like a broad based description of the account like this.

90
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,920
We posted this here so every day the newest and wildest technology I think you kind of get the picture.

91
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,570
I even read you some of the things like Diom for submissions because that sounds like it's a real account

92
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:50,470
that someone who is actually running now one piece of wisdom is that don't make these too obvious don't

93
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,320
reuse sentences.

94
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,470
That's a big no no.

95
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:59,260
If I for instance read used curated list of the best and tech in innovation not only would that be confusing

96
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,450
to someone who followed the zombie account and then came over to the main account and saw this.

97
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:09,190
It also will set off red flags don't make it easy for Instagram system to figure out that hey this is

98
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,860
the exact same person running two accounts.

99
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,810
So just try to mix it up if you're really lazy you can even jumble the words.

100
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,450
So as opposed to saying curated you could say exclusive lists.

101
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:27,940
You can set up instead of the best to say the most interesting set of taxi gadgets that have innovation

102
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,870
say the future.

103
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,260
OK you kind of get the idea.

104
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:37,300
There's enough combinations in there that you can make a lot of different bio pieces.

105
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,810
Now do you need to make the same exact length as this.

106
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,390
No.

107
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,500
Personally I make them simpler just because it's going to drive me crazy if I have to come up with four

108
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,550
lines for every single account.

109
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,330
But it's Tiley up to you.

110
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:55,070
OK so what I suggest doing is just spend a little bit of time on the Instagram intro page.

111
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,850
Figure out how he's Ahmadis you want and then do another of these adjectives modifiers until you have

112
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,100
enough accounts.

113
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,650
Of course you can do whatever you want just keep in mind that this is an easier way if you're doing

114
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,570
this and bulk.

115
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,800
Then once you have a list of all the names you want I suggest going in writing some BIOS.

116
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:19,150
I prefer to keep the same style that I used on all the other ones just because it's simpler and I can

117
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,600
mix and match them.

118
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,470
And it's easy.

119
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:27,080
So I have to come up with another one I can just look at an old one or one of these ones up here and

120
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,830
that usually can give me some inspiration for what I can say.

121
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,520
Not really science to it.

122
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,510
It's really just kind of an art.

123
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,030
It might take you a couple hours if you are literally making 50 accounts or whatever.

124
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,010
Just you know keep in mind that like we said before zombies take a lot of time up front and this is

125
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,410
what we would include in the upfront time.

126
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,720
All right guys so in the next lecture what we'll do is a follow along lecture where I'll go and create

127
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,040
an actual account for innovation station.

128
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,770
It will be a zombie that reposts for innovation station we'll just set up a blank account and then in

129
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,870
the preceding lectures what we'll do is we'll start installing Jarvi which is the software that's going

130
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,210
to help us run these things and then we'll get into the settings of how you set that up and what your

131
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,350
strategy is going to be.

132
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:15,870
OK.

133
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,280
See the.
