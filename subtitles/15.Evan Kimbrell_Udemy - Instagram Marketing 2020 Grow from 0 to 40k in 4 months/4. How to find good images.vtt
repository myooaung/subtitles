00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.470
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.120
This lecture we're going to talk about where you can find good photographs online.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.740
If you don't want to use any of the stock ones that are included any of the tools that we go through

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.990
most tools have a lot of stock images you can use and a lot of times even on Instagram you can find

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.650
ones but if you didn't want to use one of those you wanted to go it alone by yourself.

6
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.540
You can actually find them online.

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.030
Now the number one rule when it comes to finding stock photography online is make sure that it's high

8
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.530
resolution rare your images are by default 10 80 by 10 80.

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.970
So if you're gonna be using an image that covers the entirety of that post it needs to be at least 10

10
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.100
85 10 80.

11
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.700
This happens all the time.

12
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.930
You get one that 720 by 720 or something like that and you end up stretching it and that just looks

13
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.590
like crap and Instagram is the most sensitive of the social media platforms to that kind of what we

14
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.500
call restoration but it's really just stretching the number to rule when it comes to finding images

15
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.090
online is understand what Creative Commons is.

16
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.500
OK.

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.930
You might have some issues with copyright.

18
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.130
A lot of times people take photographs and they're copyrighted.

19
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.760
There's a lot of even famous stories about copyright photos being taken away from people.

20
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.660
If you go to Wikipedia you actually can see that they're in a lawsuit with a man who went to go take

21
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.480
photos of monkeys drop his camera and then the monkey took the camera and took a selfie of himself.

22
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.100
He claims it's his copyright.

23
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.210
Wikipedia claims that it's the monkeys copyright.

24
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160
I have no idea when that one.

25
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:45.090
What Creative Commons is is a public license meaning that people can designate their images their videos

26
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.400
their writing even as Creative Commons.

27
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.950
That basically means anybody can use it.

28
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.900
It doesn't mean that you have to give them attribution.

29
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.750
Does it mean they have to pay them royalties.

30
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.860
It's just free.

31
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.130
OK.

32
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.770
So a lot of people go out there and just grab whatever they can.

33
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.570
Just make sure that it fits within Creative Commons.

34
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.390
OK the first thing I do what I'm looking for outside images is just a check a lot of different Web sites

35
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.870
that have tons and tons and tons of them.

36
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.530
So the first place I suggest looking out is on Splash dot com.

37
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.420
Now on Splash one in the originals it started making photos that didn't suck and you can kind of scroll

38
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.780
through and see that they're all high resolution.

39
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.870
That's great.

40
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.850
And there's a lot of them and they're not terrible I mean it's San Francisco.

41
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.040
That's an awesome photo.

42
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.440
There's tons and tons of these.

43
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.330
So I'm just going to go through the other ones that I think are worth checking out here.

44
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.880
The next one I think worth looking at is called Death to the stock photo.

45
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.410
Dot com.

46
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.020
This one is another one these ones those kind of a trailblazer.

47
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.010
They have really nice photos that are kind of not something you'd expect.

48
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.470
I mean they've just really well curated and their free version perfectly fine.

49
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.720
What they do is actually they email you every week or month with a bunch of new ones so they're brand

50
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.020
new.

51
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.290
I mean that's the benefit there is that no one else has used them yet.

52
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.820
The downside is they don't have a database that you can search the next one is pick jumbo OK.

53
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.010
I think it's the same.

54
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.020
It's a little a combination of the two.

55
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.800
They'll send you e-mails with new ones which is great.

56
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.750
And they also have a database right here that you can just see all of these they have article featuring

57
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.870
click more images like this and they use that basic photo A.I. to kind of decide what photograph to

58
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.500
show you.

59
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.540
Tons and tons of cool photos there as well.

60
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:39.030
Next one pixels pixels Yeah with an E there's another one great part about this place actually is that

61
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.490
they not only filter them by photographer which can be kind of cool if you find one that you really

62
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.730
like.

63
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.880
They also do videos.

64
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.980
So finding stock video is actually quite a bit harder than stock images just because I know many people

65
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.910
that make them.

66
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.590
And more people are insistent on you paying so pixels as one of them.

67
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.030
Next one is pixel eBay.

68
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.210
It's just another one.

69
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.290
Works same way as everybody else.

70
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.150
They have ones that other ones don't have.

71
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.130
Maybe they have the same ones.

72
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.070
I don't even know they have an app that's kind of nice if you want to download it directly to your phone

73
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.900
through an app that can save you time.

74
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.390
This is one I use all the time actually it's free pick with a K..

75
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:25.040
I like them a lot because they give you vectors and a vector is an image that is infinitely scalable.

76
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.020
So if you stretched it it doesn't lose any definition.

77
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.760
It doesn't look crappy like normally happens if you have photo and you went like that.

78
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.580
They are great for illustrations.

79
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.080
They're great for icons.

80
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.560
You'll even notice some of the things that we use in this course came from free pick.

81
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.330
We get ideas from them as well.

82
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:49.330
Now if that's kind of overwhelming having like six choices to go to there is all the free stock dot

83
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.860
com was once great as well it's kind of ugly hard to use but what they claim is that they've taken all

84
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.380
the images and the other ones and stuck them together into one place.

85
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.700
So you can search for everything through here including stock like videos and fonts and icons and things

86
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.480
like that.

87
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.310
Downside to this place is just that it's the user interface right.

88
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.180
The reason people continue to use these other ones is that they actually have a fancy like search queries

89
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.670
and ways of filtering your list view of images.

90
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.120
They help you find things more quickly or is this one and not so much but they have everything and it's

91
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.330
all free.

92
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.650
OK now another thing you might do at some point is do a placement image.

93
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.550
Now what that means that you take an image and you throw it on a screen of some sort.

94
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.620
And there's two places I like for doing that.

95
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.240
One is place at dot net.

96
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.750
So what you do is you notice how there are phones here and as you scroll over you can see what it looks

97
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.220
like if I dropped a screen onto it.

98
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.450
That's great if you're trying to do like a mockup.

99
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:59.790
If you're promoting an app or something right and you click right here and then you can upload the screen

100
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:05.100
of your app and it will automatically paste it here and then give you all sorts of different sizes.

101
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.530
They cost money when you actually download them.

102
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.660
So keep that in mind.

103
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.790
It's not too expensive because you can use smaller ones.

104
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.990
You don't need a giant blown up image.

105
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.780
They'll give you whatever you need.

106
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.360
Over here you can actually sorted by what object you actually want because sometimes it's just a bunch

107
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.050
of random stuff.

108
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.000
So if you wanted Mac books for instance you could do this and you'll notice this is pretty Mac heavy.

109
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.810
Although they do have Android here and they also have pieces.

110
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.410
But the amount of images they have are just not nearly as the same as Max.

111
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.240
OK.

112
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.140
The other one.

113
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.570
Same thing it's place too and it's not as easy to use but it's all free.

114
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.790
OK.

115
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.270
So the same thing like you drag and drop.

116
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.160
I don't like their stuff as much because they just don't look as good as you can tell these kind of

117
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.230
look a little more amateur.

118
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.460
Maybe that's something that you want.

119
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.990
I mean they're still good photos.

120
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.170
They're just not the same as that clean crisp kind of look at the other site but hey it's free.

121
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:09.390
So find something I want to throw there I can drop it on and it pop up here and then I could just save

122
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.900
it and you wouldn't actually end up having the watermark.

123
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.160
OK.

124
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.730
Now the last trick I want to show you is how if you cannot find what you're looking for in any of those

125
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:23.550
sites which could happen if you want something really specific is to go to google images and as you

126
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.470
know they have every photo on the entire Internet.

127
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.230
But the question is which ones can I use.

128
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.530
About people getting angry at me.

129
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:36.470
And so what you can do is just go to settings and it should allow you to go to advance search.

130
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.790
And over here usage rights.

131
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:39.410
OK.

132
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.520
So not filtered by license.

133
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:47.040
You want to go free to use or share even commercially or even you go this one.

134
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:53.730
So this is like the maximum and then you set that and you should be good and then anything you search

135
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:54.180
for.

136
00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:02.140
So I wanted to talk truck search that I know that any one of these images is free to use.

137
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.950
I can take it and do whatever the hell I want with it.

138
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:05.670
OK guys.

139
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.790
That's it.

140
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.370
The last tip I'll leave you with is if you do end up using an image someone gets mad at you but really

141
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.590
the recourse is just to take it down.

142
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.750
I mean that's how it works.

143
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:21.270
If you just have no idea if someone actually owns it just posted in the caption Say message me for copyright

144
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.320
you'll see that quite a bit on other people's accounts and if they do they message you and you take

145
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.750
it down and apologize.

146
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.140
It's really no harm no foul.

147
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.800
All right guys check out those Web sites are pretty sweet the resources we have even more.

148
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.520
See you next lecture.
