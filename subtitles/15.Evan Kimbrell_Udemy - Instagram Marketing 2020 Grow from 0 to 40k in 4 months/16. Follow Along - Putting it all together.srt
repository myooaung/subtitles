00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,950
Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,440
All right, so in this lecture I'm going to put together
all of the different pieces that we went over
2

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,940
in this section for the follow along account Innovation Station.
3

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,080
So that includes the profile photo, which
I talked to you about how I did that, with
4

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,760
99designs, the name, we already talked about, you know,
I used SquadHelp plus reaching out to people,
5

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:31,130
the account name, we'll do the bio, the
call to action, and then we'll set up the link.
6

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,520
OK.
7

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,960
So let's do that.
8

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,090
First up, the profile photo.
9

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,470
So let's just get started.
10

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:46,140
All right, so I logged into my account. What I'm going
to do is I'm going to take the photos that I got from
11

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,250
the competition, and I just uploaded them to Dropbox.
The way you want to get files and videos to your
12

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,920
account, because you can't do a whole lot in the web
version of Instagram, is just to use some type of
13

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,070
cloud service like Google Drive,
Dropbox, One Drive, Amazon Drive.
14

15
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,880
That's pretty much the only way you can do it.
15

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,300
Like I said before, and we'll run into this later on,
if I wanted to transfer a video, or transfer a photo,
16

17
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,820
get it into the Instagram app, you've got
to do it through some kind of service,
17

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,480
get it into the Instagram app, you've got
to do it through some kind of service,
18

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,720
get it into the Instagram app, you've got
to do it through some kind of service,
19

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:21,150
especially if you're making the images on the
computer. So I am using Dropbox, and I put two of
20

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,600
my logos here, I don't necessarily know which
color scheme I'm going to go with immediately,
21

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,400
I might change them up later.
22

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,410
Let's say we started with this one. On iOS, you just tap it,
and hit Save to Camera Roll, and it exports and it
23

24
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,250
saves it, on Android it's slightly different.
24

25
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,380
I think it's just save,
25

26
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,070
and if it's not save, you hit the three dots
and put export, it's the same thing.
26

27
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:45,770
OK.
27

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,500
So then what you would do is you go to your
Instagram account and then click on Edit
28

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,280
Profile, remember, you don't click
on the actual profile image itself,
29

30
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,590
that takes you to the stories thing. Then what it'll
do is it'll ask you to readjust it by pinching
30

31
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,800
with your fingers. Alright,
31

32
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,040
so that's good enough, I'll screw
with that more later to get it perfect.
32

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,990
so that's good enough, I'll screw
with that more later to get it perfect.
33

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,820
And hit done, there you go.
34

35
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,760
Now we have a profile picture.
35

36
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,250
OK.
36

37
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,130
Now, moving on to the account name.
37

38
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,630
This is what I did.
38

39
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,540
I just used an app for scribbling down notes, it's called
Bear, and I just wrote out a bunch of variations.
39

40
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:20,810
I just used an app for scribbling down notes, it's called
Bear, and I just wrote out a bunch of variations.
40

41
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,100
So with the account name,
41

42
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,080
this is a themed account, so what do we care about? We care about immediately explaining what the account does or delivers.
42

43
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,290
this is a themed account, so what do we care about? We care about immediately explaining what the account does or delivers.
43

44
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,120
We also want to make sure that we
get some keywords in there.
44

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,080
So these are the options I had.
The best innovations every day,
45

46
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,890
the most inspiring innovations every day, life-changing
innovations every day, we post the best innovations
46

47
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,970
every day, daily innovations for inspiration, inspiring
innovations every day, daily innovation inspiration.
47

48
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,780
OK, the reason why I used these was the keywords
I wanted were innovation and inspiration.
48

49
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,290
Inspiration is a really big key word.
49

50
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,380
Innovation is a decently strong keyword.
50

51
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,830
I might change this later on.
51

52
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,020
I don't know.
52

53
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,730
This is what I think will work now.
53

54
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:05,240
I also really wanted to emphasize that I post every single
day, so that's why I said every day, every day, every day.
54

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,060
I also really wanted to emphasize that I post every single
day, so that's why I said every day, every day, every day.
55

56
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,810
I realize it's two words, but sometimes, you know,
you have a 30 character limit, so sometimes you have
56

57
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,880
to work with what you got.
57

58
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,850
I tried to use some adjectives or describers that
were a little bit out there, like life-changing, that
58

59
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,970
could work, but really I think what I'm going to land
on is this one right here, daily innovation inspiration.
59

60
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,000
Daily is the most succinct way of
saying we post every single day,
60

61
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:37,910
innovation inspiration has that rhyme and that
alliteration that I like, it also just looks cleaner than
61

62
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,830
this, it seems kind of weird sometimes
putting a sentence in your account name.
62

63
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:48,500
OK, so Daily innovation inspiration, will load that up,
so I will put that in. Alright, now you can look and see
63

64
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,330
how it looks. It looks fine for now.
64

65
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,070
And now we move on to the bio.
65

66
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,600
OK.
66

67
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:00,170
So the bio is 150 characters. What do we care about? We
need to do a two sentence technique or a list technique.
67

68
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,670
So the bio is 150 characters. What do we care about? We
need to do a two sentence technique or a list technique.
68

69
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,710
I decided on the list just because I think it's easier to use,
I think it makes your account look a little more professional,
69

70
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,190
I decided on the list just because I think it's easier to use,
I think it makes your account look a little more professional,
70

71
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,990
And also I just don't really know how
to sum this up in two sentences.
71

72
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,820
So what I did is I wrote out several
sentences that I think I could fit in.
72

73
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:23,150
So, curated list of only the best in tech and innovation,
don't fall behind, world changing trends,
73

74
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,770
monthly tech giveaways, DM for business inquiries,
74

75
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,430
and then, you've never seen this before.
75

76
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,390
So what I did is I just thought about what were things
I wanted to convey to people about the account,
76

77
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,630
I needed to make sure that I justified
why they should follow me.
77

78
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,590
Ok, so I said curated list of only the best in tech.
78

79
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,430
There's a lot of accounts that do tech
and gadgets, but they just post anything.
79

80
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,990
So I wanted to make sure that this was the most curated,
because I am going to be posting things are a little
80

81
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,450
bit weirder that you wouldn't necessarily find on Instagram.
81

82
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:58,690
Then I tried to justify why you might be following this,
so I said, don't fall behind, world changing trends.
82

83
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,930
That makes sense to me.
83

84
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,550
Like, I'm trying to go for the business community, so
why would you follow an account that talks about
84

85
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,810
weird stuff that's being invented?
85

86
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,030
I'm guessing that it's because you like to follow trends.
86

87
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,910
It's about being competitive.
87

88
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,390
Then I put monthly tech giveaways.
88

89
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,470
That's something I might do.
89

90
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:21,380
We'll cover that later in this course, it's actually way at the end, where we get into giveaways, and promotions, and sweepstakes.
90

91
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,310
I think that's worth doing, at least putting it up there now,
91

92
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,720
but you could totally put in whatever you want.
92

93
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,300
Here's another option, DM for business inquiries.
93

94
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,430
Later on, we'll talk about growing the account, and that
is something that can be extremely useful, getting
94

95
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:40,640
people to message you and then figuring out co-
promotional opportunities. Then the last one is like,
95

96
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,700
you've never seen these before, because
I'm trying to differentiate myself.
96

97
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,620
So maybe these are things that
are secret, or weird, or different.
97

98
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,550
What I ended up settling on
98

99
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:55,880
was just these three, so 150 characters really only give
you three short sentences, and this might actually
99

100
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,020
take some fitting in when I actually get to posting it in.
100

101
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,670
But before we post that in, we need to decide
on our call to action, because that goes in the bio,
101

102
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,890
like we talked about before. Here's some call to actions
I came up with, so I came up with two options. One was
102

103
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,680
I could promote my idea generation course, I think
that complements it decently well, and the other
103

104
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,280
one was I could actually promote one of the companies that
I'm using as a source, they're a database for innovations,
104

105
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,960
they're kind of expensive, but I think I could promote them
and set up some kind of an affiliate relationship potentially.
105

106
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,160
they're kind of expensive, but I think I could promote them
and set up some kind of an affiliate relationship potentially.
106

107
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,380
So I set up call to actions that work for either one of those.
107

108
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,190
So, come up with a new business idea in one day, it's easy.
108

109
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:40,610
Need a business idea? It's easy. $10 for business coaching? It's real. 97% off award winning course on innovation, 33k students.
109

110
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,020
Need a business idea? It's easy. $10 for business coaching? It's real. 97% off award winning course on innovation, 33k students.
110

111
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,580
Those are just things I think could be interesting to
highlight. Some of these like, need a business idea,
111

112
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,200
Those are just things I think could be interesting to
highlight. Some of these like, need a business idea,
112

113
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,750
$10 for business coaching, these are rhetorical questions.
113

114
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,930
So you read it, and if your answer is no, and you keep
on reading, and if your answer is yes, then I got you.
114

115
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,390
So you read it, and if your answer is no, and you keep
on reading, and if your answer is yes, then I got you.
115

116
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,850
You're the person I want to talk to.
116

117
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,910
I also want to appeal to the short attention spans
on Instagram by saying you can do it and it's easy.
117

118
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,170
I also want to appeal to the short attention spans
on Instagram by saying you can do it and it's easy.
118

119
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,610
So if you're someone who is looking at my account
because you're trying to start a business, you're trying
119

120
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,960
to come up with new ideas,
120

121
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:17,120
then I can convince you that it's actually pretty easy,
that piques interest a little bit, like, it shouldn't be easy.
121

122
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,720
then I can convince you that it's actually pretty easy,
that piques interest a little bit, like, it shouldn't be easy.
122

123
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,280
Is it easy?
123

124
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,590
And this also is another one.
124

125
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,710
You know, we have to be tangible about what we're
trying to give them, so I was trying to fit in things like
125

126
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:32,390
do it in one day, or here's tangible, like, $10 bucks,
that's really cheap, or another tangible, 97% off.
126

127
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:38,690
Those are kind of the highlights to get people to click through
and this was just credibility or award winning. Again,
127

128
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,280
Those are kind of the highlights to get people to click through
and this was just credibility or award winning. Again,
128

129
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,680
I won some random awards. And then down
here were the ones I was thinking for
129

130
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,110
the company called Springwise, and these I just
pulled off their website, because they have 8,900
130

131
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,790
innovations, so I just came up with something
like these. Potentially, I could say it's a database
131

132
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:58,520
of 8,900, the world's never seen them, so
appealing to their competitive sense, or
132

133
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,020
maybe I can get a percentage off, which I doubt,
because I actually know this company, or just focus
133

134
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,550
on the number of how many they have
in their database, so whatever.
134

135
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,830
I think what I'm going to probably use is some
type of like, this one, I could try this, but it's really
135

136
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,430
just going to depend on how it looks visually,
and whether or not I have enough characters.
136

137
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:25,730
OK, so what you want to do is you want to go to Notes
on your phone. On Android, the way you would do it
137

138
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,370
is just use Docs, so get on here,
and then just use Google Docs.
138

139
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,680
is just use Docs, so get on here,
and then just use Google Docs.
139

140
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,280
is just use Docs, so get on here,
and then just use Google Docs.
140

141
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,780
It works the same way as Notes.
141

142
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,300
And then just make sure that you
obviously have a Google account,
142

143
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,260
you'll create a new doc, and just do it like that.
143

144
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,900
OK, great. Back to iOS.
144

145
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,360
OK, great. Back to iOS.
145

146
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,900
So you open up Notes, now this is the
way that you copy it into Instagram's bio.
146

147
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,760
For whatever reason, this is just a hack.
147

148
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,850
This is how you do it.
148

149
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,720
If you do it this way,
149

150
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,960
then you can put in breaks in your sentences,
150

151
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,510
whereas if you just type it in Instagram,
it actually doesn't allow you to do that.
151

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,200
So this is what I picked, curated list of only the best
in tech and innovation, world-changing trends to
152

153
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,910
watch, weekly tech employees, need a business idea, it's easy.
153

154
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,650
Now, I had to change some of these from what
you saw on the screen before because of the links.
154

155
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,120
So I was just running into some issues
with things like, don't fall behind,
155

156
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,430
So I was just running into some issues
with things like, don't fall behind,
156

157
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,050
or business as opposed to biz idea.
157

158
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,170
So I just had to simplify these a little bit.
158

159
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,910
I think I actually have a little bit of extra room now,
but I can use those for whatever I want later on.
159

160
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,790
I think I actually have a little bit of extra room now,
but I can use those for whatever I want later on.
160

161
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,110
Again, this is just a game of optimization,
optimization, optimization.
161

162
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,210
So we'll see later. Ok, so what you do is you copy it out of
Notes, go to Instagram, your bio, and then you can paste it.
162

163
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,190
So we'll see later. Ok, so what you do is you copy it out of
Notes, go to Instagram, your bio, and then you can paste it.
163

164
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,300
So we'll see later. Ok, so what you do is you copy it out of
Notes, go to Instagram, your bio, and then you can paste it.
164

165
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,710
Now, I didn't include my link in the bio, because
the link actually goes up here in the website section.
165

166
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,090
That's how you get it clickable.
166

167
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:58,530
I don't actually have a link right now, so I'm just going
to put mylink.com, we'll set that up later. Hit done,
167

168
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,690
now you can look at it visually.
168

169
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,290
OK.
169

170
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,330
We have our logo.
170

171
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:01,980
It's the rocket.
171

172
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,750
That's cool. Daily innovation inspiration,
cool, whatever, and the rest of it looks decent.
172

173
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,060
I'm going to clean this up really
quickly by doing a couple things.
173

174
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:18,640
I want to have it visually not have this weird
staircase look to it, like that first sentence is way
174

175
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,660
too long, I don't need that long of a sentence.
175

176
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,960
And I also think I can clean this up, or at least make it
a little more visually interesting with more emojis.
176

177
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,310
And I also think I can clean this up, or at least make it
a little more visually interesting with more emojis.
177

178
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:34,180
So I'm just going to do this really fast, so I don't need to
say "only", I think that'll help, and I can put in more robots.
178

179
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,860
So I'm just going to do this really fast, so I don't need to
say "only", I think that'll help, and I can put in more robots.
179

180
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,300
You guys have trouble putting in emojis,
180

181
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,160
just go back to the Notes app, or go
back to Google Docs, and do it that way.
181

182
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,080
I'm allowed to do this because I'm using the Google keyboard.
182

183
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,910
It's called G-board.
183

184
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,920
I didn't choose a pasty white hand
because I'm also pasty and white,
184

185
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,410
I picked it because the normal emoji is yellow and I
wanted to contrast it with a bag of money, which is yellow.
185

186
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,630
I picked it because the normal emoji is yellow and I
wanted to contrast it with a bag of money, which is yellow.
186

187
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,780
I think that looks better.
187

188
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,420
There's just more to look at.
188

189
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:11,250
It's more visually interesting, it's got more color,
and that first sentence has been kind of reined in.
189

190
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:18,090
I think ideally I could get that one down to something
simpler, so I can maybe just say innovation instead
190

191
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,020
of tech and innovation, but for the
most part I think this is pretty good.
191

192
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,000
of tech and innovation, but for the
most part I think this is pretty good.
192

193
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,630
OK.
193

194
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:29,170
So that pretty much covers it for me
on my end with Innovation Station.
194

195
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,220
See you guys next lecture.
