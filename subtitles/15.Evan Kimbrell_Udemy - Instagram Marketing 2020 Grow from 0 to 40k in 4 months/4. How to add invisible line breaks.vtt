Hey guys, welcome back. Ok, quick-ish lecture, I want to show you how you can add invisible line breaks in your captions.

Hey guys, welcome back. Ok, quick-ish lecture, I want to show you how you can add invisible line breaks in your captions.
2

3
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.680
They generally look better than putting
symbols to break up your lines.
3

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.890
But on the go sometimes it's not really worth trying to figure
out how to do it. The way you do it is incredibly dumb,
4

5
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.430
But on the go sometimes it's not really worth trying to figure
out how to do it. The way you do it is incredibly dumb,
5

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:29.080
I'll admit it upfront, and it changes it seems like every year.
Before, it used to be the case that you just write it in
6

7
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.440
your Notes app, and then on Android you write it in like
a preview app or a Google Doc app, copy it over and
7

8
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.570
it keeps the line breaks.
8

9
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.890
OK.
9

10
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.930
For some reason, they changed that and
now you have to put in special characters.
10

11
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.600
It's ridiculous.
11

12
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.230
But I'll show you how you can do it.
12

13
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.920
So on iOS, this is the way you do it.
13

14
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.920
And if you look at my post, you can see right here,
there's actually a line break right there.
14

15
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.840
Yay.
15

16
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.960
OK, so the way you have to do it is
you have to go to Notes on iOS,
16

17
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.720
OK, so the way you have to do it is
you have to go to Notes on iOS,
17

18
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.350
Copy it into Notes. Ok, so you'll notice here,
18

19
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.030
I have line breaks in it,
19

20
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.750
but what happens is if I were just to copy this over,
it wouldn't actually keep the line breaks, it might
20

21
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.350
keep this one right there where I just went to the next line,
21

22
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.650
but it won't give me a clean break like that.
22

23
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.340
So the way you have to do it, and
23

24
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:31.280
I put this in the resources, you can just copy it over, you have
to put this goofy bracketed copy into it, so it looks like this.
24

25
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.510
I put this in the resources, you can just copy it over, you have
to put this goofy bracketed copy into it, so it looks like this.
25

26
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:41.360
So what this basically is is a bracket with a bunch
of "&nbsp", which are codes that show up silently,
26

27
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.930
in iOS at least, but in programming
they're actually relatively easy to do.
27

28
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.490
So you have to take this and copy it, and then you have to go
over here, and then go into these little spaces right here, and
28

29
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.380
you now have to, essentially have to fix it, so I'm
going to paste it in between the middle of these two.
29

30
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.200
But before you do that, this is actually really important, go back
to where you want to have a line break and make sure that
30

31
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.870
there's no space after the period where you want the line break
to then happen next. If you put a period, it will not work.
31

32
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.730
there's no space after the period where you want the line break
to then happen next. If you put a period, it will not work.
32

33
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.360
So now let's say I want to put it right there.
33

34
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.990
So I hit return, return, go to the middle,
34

35
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.170
So I hit next return, return, go to the middle,
35

36
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.380
and then I just have to paste this in, paste,
now over here I'm going to do the same thing.
36

37
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.570
So back to there, ok.
37

38
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.480
So back to there, ok.
38

39
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.120
No space after the period, return, return.
39

40
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.430
I'm going to copy and paste it here.
40

41
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.270
Now, will it post with these brackets?
41

42
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.600
Yes, it will.
42

43
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.110
Yes, it will.
43

44
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.810
So what we have to do the next thing
is go here, delete the brackets,
44

45
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.400
and you'll notice it's still kept this goofy space
in here, like there's a chunk of something.
45

46
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.040
That's what we want. So we go back,
let's remove the brackets again.
46

47
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.350
And there we go.
47

48
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.510
So now it should be good.
48

49
00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.480
Now if I copy it, if I go and select all, you should see an extra
line show up in our post. So let's go over here to Edit,
49

50
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.400
Now if I copy it, if I go and select all, you should see an extra
line show up in our post. So let's go over here to Edit,
50

51
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.520
Edit caption, ok.
51

52
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.810
So originally there wasn't a line there.
52

53
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.220
Hopefully, we will see it now.
53

54
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.620
Delete, paste it in.
54

55
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.580
Alright, hit Done.
55

56
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.820
Here we go.
56

57
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.280
OK.
57

58
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.780
So now we have clean breaks like that.
58

59
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.120
For whatever reason, that's the way you have to do it.
59

60
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.360
I apologize in advance.
60

61
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.940
OK.
61

62
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.200
Now, a quicker way of doing this, in iOS at least,
62

63
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.770
and guys, the thing with Android is it works the exact same.
63

64
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.810
You just have to take those brackets and then paste them
in, and in the resources I should have an Evernote doc
64

65
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.160
where you can literally just go and copy-paste it in, and I strongly suggest you save it into at least your Notes or your Google Docs.
65

66
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.210
where you can literally just go and copy-paste it in, and I strongly suggest you save it into at least your Notes or your Google Docs.
66

67
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.910
But on iOS specifically, there is a shortcut for doing this. On an Android, it really just depends on what apps you have installed.
67

68
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.460
But on iOS specifically, there is a shortcut for doing this. On an Android, it really just depends on what apps you have installed.
68

69
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.620
OK, so on iOS there's one way of doing it.
69

70
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:06.790
So what you do is you go to Settings and then we want
to go down to General, then you go to Keyboard,
70

71
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.600
So what you do is you go to Settings and then we want
to go down to General, then you go to Keyboard,
71

72
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.020
and then you want to go to Text Replacement. Now,
Text Replacement is a tool so that if you type in
72

73
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.460
something specific, you'll have the option
of then converting it to a shortcut.
73

74
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:25.070
So if I type the same words over and over again, I might
make something like AB turn into entrepreneurship.
74

75
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.360
It used to be the case that it automatically changed it and it
was hilarious, because I used to do this on my girlfriend's
75

76
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.110
phone, and just changed random words on it, so that
when she was typing, it would randomly change her words,
76

77
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.860
and it took about a month before she figured
it out, but it was funny while it lasted.
77

78
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.950
So the way you do this now is you just go up here to add one,
78

79
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.390
So the way you do this now is you just go up here to add one,
79

80
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.720
and then what we want to do is copy in that goofy little bracket system that we had before, you could either copy the brackets,
80

81
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.330
or you can copy this mystery chunk of text right here, so like that, I'm just going to copy that, but you could do the brackets,
81

82
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.510
same thing, you just have to delete the brackets.
82

83
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.350
Then I'm going to go up here and paste it.
Ok, you just have the mystery,
83

84
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.660
and then I want to have a shortcut.
84

85
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:13.100
So I generally suggest making it three letters, because
if you do two it's going to pop up way too often.
85

86
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.720
So some people do like, BBB, I did LBB as mine,
86

87
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.840
but you could do yours as like, 
87

88
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.020
yeah, you could do LBB if you wanted to.
Now, I've already saved this one.
88

89
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.420
So here's my LBB.
89

90
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.450
There you go, ok, so Save.
90

91
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:34.630
Now what happens when I'm typing in Notes is I can just type,
91

92
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.470
if I want to delete this magic line,
92

93
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.940
ok, then I can type in LBB, and then see right here,
93

94
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.660
it gives me that suggested as a blank.
Here we go, that's how I do it.
94

95
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.650
it gives me that suggested as a blank.
Here we go, that's how I do it.
95

96
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.700
Also I can just do that directly in Instagram.
96

97
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.940
So if I go on Instagram, do the same thing, and just went
LBB and then threw it in there, it would do the same
97

98
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.770
thing, so we see that it preserved it.
98

99
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.640
Then what we want to do it hit LBB.
99

100
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.670
OK.
100

101
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.670
See? It stayed the same.
101

102
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.580
That's great.
102

103
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.770
That's what we want.
103

104
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.060
Android, again, it's just going to come
down to what software you use.
104

105
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.110
We'll put a review in the resources, how to do it,
105

106
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.520
We'll put a review in the resources, how to do it,
106

107
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:23.970
but it's the same thing. I just personally, on Android,
it really depends on what operating system you are
107

108
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.030
using, and launcher, if you're using one of those.
108

109
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.840
It can really depend how you do text replacements. Often
times, you can do it directly with Google Keyboard.
109

110
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.110
OK, so that's good enough for now.
110

111
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.060
See you next lecture.
