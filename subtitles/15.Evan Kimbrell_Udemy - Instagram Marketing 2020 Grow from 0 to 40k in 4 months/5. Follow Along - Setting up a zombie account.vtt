00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.850
Everybody welcome back to this lecture we're going to take everything we've done in the last couple

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.230
lectures and roll it forward into creating our first Zombi account.

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.100
Now as you covered in the last lectures we need to make sure that we have an IP address.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.360
We need a name and we need a bio in order to get this ball rolling.

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.390
There's two other things we'll have to do.

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.390
But we'll get to them when we get to them those are setting up a phone number and then picking a logo.

7
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.680
So that's what you're going to do is we're just going to set up the account get it pretty much squared

8
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.090
away with the IP address and then we'll move on to some of the more elective things we don't have to

9
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.220
do right this second.

10
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.760
OK.

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.970
So you use your proxy service of choice are used high proxies because I'm familiar with it and I prefer

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.750
to use a server or an IP address that is only dedicated to one account.

13
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.210
And then my plan is to later switch to a cheaper provider but I'm on high proxies and I need to just

14
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.130
log into my account.

15
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.260
Now I got to by proxies by unscrewing proxies and I'll just buy one right now it's three bucks.

16
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.380
OK $3 monthly.

17
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.320
So keep that in mind.

18
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.680
Do you kind of add up if you're going to choose this strategy.

19
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.520
OK so we paid high proxies $3 20 cents.

20
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.220
Now give me an invoice she'll say unpaid at first but it eventually will go through.

21
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.870
So I go back to the client area.

22
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.180
Now I just go to services.

23
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:33.430
This is under my account or the client area and it list off all the proxies that I'm using See the one

24
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.480
I just did is 320 right here.

25
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.560
Service Id blow up go back up to services go down to my proxies and we can see the one that I just bought

26
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.100
here is under one screen a proxy and it's in Chicago.

27
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.620
That's the server doesn't really matter.

28
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.150
All we need is the proxy IP right here and the port and I will show you how to do this.

29
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.510
Now there's two different ways you can authenticate your IP address.

30
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.990
You can do it down here through a user and password authentication or an IP authentication.

31
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.140
Now explain these in order for their servers to understand who the owner of these IP addresses are.

32
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.240
You have to have some kind of verification system.

33
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.710
Now either I tell my computer that when I log in through this IP system to use my username and password

34
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.540
and to send that to the server in the server then checks that out and then allows me access or more

35
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.300
simply I can just tell them what my IP address is and then they can just decide.

36
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.920
Anybody who comes from this IP address or the series of IP addresses.

37
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.290
Well they must be the owner therefore we'll let their traffic through.

38
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.400
So I choose IP authentication.

39
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.370
Personally I think that's much simpler.

40
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.650
The other way is perfectly fine you can do it.

41
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.870
I just think that it's one more thing that could go wrong.

42
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.670
So I prefer not to to check your IP.

43
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.460
The easiest way is literally just go what is my IP dot com.

44
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.930
OK.

45
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.340
And I'm in Denver Colorado Yes indeed.

46
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.480
That is my public IP address.

47
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.570
OK so what I do is I just copy this go back to high proxies so I'll go here and put it into one of my

48
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.980
IPs then I'll have to use it set up.

49
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.490
Now usually it works instantaneously and it should.

50
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.080
But I like to sometimes wait a couple of minutes just to make sure that the all the settings go through

51
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.250
properly.

52
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.140
Now in order to log in to my proxy This is the way that you would do it.

53
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.690
And there's a lot of different ways and just kind of depends.

54
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.590
I mean they're all pretty simple I'll show you the most manual way of doing it.

55
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.040
So take your proxy IP number right here.

56
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.850
I'm on a Mac.

57
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.610
OK.

58
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.180
Which is a very similar process to the way you would do it on a PC.

59
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.800
I'll show you how it works on a Mac and you can kind of deduce that it works in a PC but I just go to

60
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.610
System Preferences.

61
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.640
Then I go to network.

62
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.530
Then I go to advanced and right here we have a proxy setting.

63
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.960
Now in order to get this work correctly I'm going to be accessing and scan through my web browser which

64
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.810
means that I need to set up these HTP and each TTP s web proxies right here.

65
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.210
So I have to copy it into both of these.

66
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:18.270
So paste the number right there and then this number right here after the colon is the port number.

67
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.660
This just tells the server what socket specifically to use the technicality of this doesn't really matter.

68
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.080
We have the port right here.

69
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.590
So Tony 1 3 0 8 so I can go back and put this in as the port

70
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.270
OK now I want to do just that OK and hit apply.

71
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.950
Now I should be routing my traffic through this IP address.

72
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.540
Now I'm using Chrome and chrome automatically defaults to whatever IP address your system is using.

73
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.030
However if you're using Firefox.

74
00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.870
Keep in mind that Firefox actually will by default ignore the IP address that you're using as a proxy.

75
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.900
You need to input it into Firefox itself.

76
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.440
It's relatively simple.

77
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.660
You just go up to preferences and it'll have a section for proxies and security and then you just input

78
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.700
it that way.

79
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.780
Make sure you if you're to use Firefox that you do it manually through their system.

80
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.450
Now do you guys in a PC the way you do this is very very similar.

81
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.700
Will you go to settings and then it's under like network and Internet and then you should have a input

82
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.370
field for proxies.

83
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.300
It's pretty self-explanatory.

84
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.330
Hopefully we'll put in the resources a quick like link to a guide for how to do it honestly should take

85
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.640
you a minute tops.

86
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.710
OK now that I've loaded up my IP I want to go back to what is my IP com and check that it is indeed

87
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.310
the IP that I decided on and it's not just the original one right.

88
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.960
So I'm seventy three point nine five.

89
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.690
Let's just make sure it's not that.

90
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.680
OK.

91
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.430
So sixty four point four four I'm magically we are now in Chicago like that.

92
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.000
OK so now we are good.

93
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.210
The next step would be to go to Instagram and create an account.

94
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.290
Now personally I like to do this with a private browser just because Instagram will store cookies any

95
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.080
time you log in on web and that can create problems because sometimes they can actually recognize that

96
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.380
hey this is linked to another account and we don't want that.

97
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.050
You could also do this on your mobile phone.

98
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.570
Keep that in mind.

99
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.780
I just find that it's harder to change your IP on your mobile phone.

100
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.260
I think for Android users it's a lot easier.

101
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.160
But I find it kind of clunky doing this on your phone.

102
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.440
So I like to use the web.

103
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.970
But you guys have a good VPN setup or shared or a proxy set up on your phone.

104
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.680
Go for it.

105
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.460
Doesn't really matter.

106
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.350
The concepts are still the same.

107
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.570
So on Chrome specifically I'm going to go to New Incognito browser on Firefox it's just called a private

108
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.150
browser and you access this up in the top left.

109
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.040
It's kind of the same story with Safari.

110
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.780
I don't actually know how it works for Internet Explorer.

111
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.500
I haven't used it in over a decade but I'd imagine it's very similar.

112
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.020
So we'll go here and we'll go to Instagram.

113
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.990
OK and assuming we're locked out we should be presented with this screen now.

114
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.210
We need to create a account so it says mobile number or e-mail.

115
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.560
Now it's up to us if we want to use an e-mail address or a mobile number.

116
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.510
Now I'll show you one way of getting an e-mail address and one way for a mobile number.

117
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.180
And these are both the easiest ways of doing it but also more advanced ways of doing it.

118
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.690
And a follow up lecture.

119
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:29.230
The easiest way to get an e-mail address in my experience is literally just Outlook dot com which it's

120
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.140
common to use Outlook dot like dot com.

121
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:38.870
Hopefully they'll change the name between now and then but it's it's whatever Microsoft's public e-mail

122
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.920
exchange is so good here.

123
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.370
And then to create a free account the information you put into this is not really important.

124
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:56.230
You can just come up with whatever name you want so I can call this zombie bomb the one and next and

125
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.260
then create a password.

126
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.720
Make sure it's always something you remember.

127
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.400
Then you can create your personal information.

128
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.790
None of this really matters.

129
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.920
It's not like it's ever going to be useful in the future.

130
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.540
Make sure you set the birth date whatever it is.

131
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.640
And then it'll ask you for a quick capture.

132
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.710
OK and now it's Hi Mr..

133
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:23.710
That was my name.

134
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:30.530
Click through this and you should be and your e-mail inbox and no time whatsoever.

135
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.920
All right once you see this screen you are now good.

136
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.990
Now we need access to the screen because Instagram will send a varify email to you.

137
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.760
So when you sign up you'll want to use this to confirm it and that's a good thing because if you don't

138
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.610
confirm your email address Well you'll have a bad time.

139
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:53.320
We'll make it a lot harder on you and you're more likely to have your account get shut down so we can

140
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.530
do something about it.

141
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.250
And

142
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.150
then for the full name doesn't really matter because he can change us obviously.

143
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:10.030
But remember kind of the principles that we had with names you want to make sure it's always relevant

144
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.790
and remember it's the first sentence you ever see on an account so that's pretty important.

145
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.290
So we might call ourselves advanced technology

146
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.430
and our user name is the one that we came up with before.

147
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.400
I don't remember exactly when we came up with before but whatever.

148
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.670
It's good enough.

149
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:30.680
OK.

150
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:36.540
Now go and sign up and we are now the very familiar screen or it asked us to follow people.

151
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:41.090
We don't really care on the web you I actually there's no like next button you just have to go up here

152
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.520
to your account and there we go.

153
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.460
Now we're pretty much ready to set this up.

154
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.800
We logged in using the special new IP.

155
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.730
Now remember.

156
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.680
Write it down.

157
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.270
This IP is going to be associated with this account and this account only so that you don't accidentally

158
00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:01.530
cross-contaminate your IP addresses and the rest should be pretty straightforward.

159
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.540
All right now we want to fill out our profile with what we have real fast or just go to adek profile.

160
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:11.190
And then here in our bio we won't mess with much else until later.

161
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.080
And let's just go to the list of bios that we were up before.

162
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.310
And here we go it's just this long.

163
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:27.520
Whatever you think matches the name of the employees that there we go and hit submit your profile say.

164
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.840
Now last thing let's confirm our e-mail right here from your e-mail address.

165
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.360
OK great.

166
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.850
And let's look at our accounts see how it looks.

167
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:38.560
Here we go.

168
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:39.110
Great.

169
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:45.920
All right so in the next lecture I'm going to show you how you can set up brand new phone numbers if

170
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:52.740
you instead of using an e-mail address or if you wanted to use it in conjunction with a e-mail address.

171
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.020
You wanted to use a phone number.

172
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.260
Now why would we use a phone number.

173
00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:01.830
Well because Instagram kind of gives your phone numbers a little bit more leeway.

174
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.710
It seems a little bit more real.

175
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:09.080
Anybody can make an email address for us getting a new phone number is a little bit trickier.

176
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.030
Generally the more you have on here the more real it's going to look.

177
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.880
So that's really all we care about.
