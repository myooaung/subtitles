Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.720
OK, so this is the follow along section, where you get to
watch me do the things that we just talked about doing.
2

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.110
OK, so this is the follow along section, where you get to
watch me do the things that we just talked about doing.
3

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.090
We're going to do this throughout the entire course, so
you get to ride along as I try different things to see if
4

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.810
they work and see if they don't.
5

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.090
OK, so this lecture specifically, we're
6

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.620
first going to talk about what do you do if you can't get
the account name on Instagram that you want, and
7

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.020
then we're going to talk about what I did for my name.
8

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.740
OK.
9

10
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.830
So, first off, this happens all the time, every time
you want to create a new account, this happens,
10

11
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.270
because, as it turns out that Instagram
has like 600 million registered users,
11

12
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.600
a lot of those are inactive.
12

13
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.310
OK, so a lot of accounts are just sitting there, not
doing anything, or someone else already has them.
13

14
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.080
It's kind of like, I don't know, pretty much everywhere
else on the internet, like buying domains, it's
14

15
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.210
really hard to get good domains
anymore because they're all taken.
15

16
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.210
*I'll look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.*
16

17
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.400
OK.
17

18
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.690
Instagram has the same problem.
18

19
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.740
So if you find something, like I said, an account name
that you really, really want, you think it's perfect
19

20
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.430
for what you're doing, it really just comes
down to one of two things.
20

21
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.190
One, is it being used?
21

22
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.010
OK.
22

23
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.140
If it is being used, you can just tell by looking
at how many followers do they have,
23

24
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.860
how many posts do they have,
24

25
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.470
when's the last time they posted.
25

26
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.710
when's the last time they posted.
26

27
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.190
Go to the first or the last post in their feed and
then look at the time stamp underneath it.
27

28
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.680
OK.
28

29
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.840
That's generally a good way of telling. If it's been in
the last, say, 3-4 months, I would consider it active.
29

30
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.110
That's generally a good way of telling. If it's been in
the last, say, 3-4 months, I would consider it active.
30

31
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.100
And the other thing is whether or not you can
figure out some way of prying it from the person.
31

32
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.590
OK.
32

33
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.910
So the first question, whether or not it's active,
you just have to go and look at it.
33

34
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.620
OK.
34

35
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.880
If it is active, I personally suggest giving up.
At that point, it doesn't really make sense.
35

36
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.510
If it is active, I personally suggest giving up.
At that point, it doesn't really make sense.
36

37
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.290
It's really hard to pry a used account from someone
and want something they're actually using. If they have
37

38
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.220
no use for it, then it's a totally different question.
38

39
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.320
So if that's the case, just give up.
39

40
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.870
But if it's the case that it's inactive, like, you went and looked at it, and it hasn't been used since 2014 or even a year and a half ago,
40

41
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.280
But if it's the case that it's inactive, like, you went and looked at it, and it hasn't been used since 2014 or even a year and a half ago,
41

42
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.840
then proceed to step two.
42

43
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.680
then proceed to step two.
43

44
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.270
Now, step two is you do one of two things.
44

45
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.430
I mean, one, you just try to reach out to them
and start a dialogue about what they want.
45

46
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.630
Are they using the account? What they
would want in return for the account?
46

47
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.550
A lot of times people would just give it to you for free,
because they're nice people. Don't count on that though.
47

48
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.300
A lot of times people would just give it to you for free,
because they're nice people. Don't count on that though.
48

49
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.620
Other times you have to buy them from people,
and then a lot of times you just can't,
49

50
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.130
they won't sell it to you or you
can't even get a hold of them.
50

51
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.240
That happens all the time, but almost 50% of the
times you find an inactive account, they either
51

52
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.890
don't respond or they just don't want to
sell it to you or just give it to you at all.
52

53
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.880
The only thing you can really do if that's the case,
if you've just stonewalled every single step in
53

54
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.490
the process, is, especially in the US, at least, you
can file a trademark. Now, if you file a trademark,
54

55
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.100
then you can essentially submit that to Instagram,
55

56
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.140
and sometimes they will rule in your
favor and take the account for you.
56

57
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.720
OK.
57

58
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.640
It's a little heavy handed, I'll say that much.
58

59
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.400
If you have the money and the time and you really,
really want your account, then it is an option for you.
59

60
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.610
If you have the money and the time and you really,
really want your account, then it is an option for you.
60

61
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.150
Just keep in mind, it takes months
of time, hundreds of dollars,
61

62
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.460
Just keep in mind, it takes months
of time, hundreds of dollars,
62

63
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:45.430
a lot of attention and attention to detail, and we don't
actually know necessarily if it will work every single time.
63

64
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.090
a lot of attention and attention to detail, and we don't
actually know necessarily if it will work every single time.
64

65
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.190
I mean, if I gave it a success rate,
I'd say probably 60% of the time it works.
65

66
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.120
So, really, the key is, if you are going to file a trademark
to take someone's account, come down to whether
66

67
00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:03.250
or not you're in the same industry roughly and whether or
not people would confuse your trademark with their name.
67

68
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.410
or not you're in the same industry roughly and whether or
not people would confuse your trademark with their name.
68

69
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.460
OK, so a lot of times what you can do is you can just
file a trademark that's identical to what theirs
69

70
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.560
is, and then pick an industry that's similar enough.
70

71
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.640
Sometimes it's a little bit hard with the trademark office,
because they want to make sure you're actually a business,
71

72
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.230
Sometimes it's a little bit hard with the trademark office,
because they want to make sure you're actually a business,
72

73
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.650
but there's other ways of getting around that.
73

74
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.310
And then you have to make sure that
the names are similar enough, right?
74

75
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.690
And then you have to make sure that
the names are similar enough, right?
75

76
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.260
So in Instagram, you don't have spaces
in the names, you have an @ symbol.
76

77
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.880
Sometimes they'll say that that's
not similar enough to your name.
77

78
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.800
So if you want to do that, make sure that you trademark
something in the internet space, or social media,
78

79
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.910
or something that has to do with the account, because
it has to look like, if a consumer actually saw it,
79

80
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.920
they might actually get confused about it, they might
think that your business and that account are related.
80

81
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.380
That's really your only shot there.
81

82
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.740
If you want to actually trademark it,
the best way to do it is just online.
82

83
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.220
I mean, you could do it if you go out and get a lawyer and
have them manually do it, it's going to be really expensive.
83

84
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.010
There's simpler ways.
84

85
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.260
One option is Legal Zoom, I think
they charge you like $200 to do it.
85

86
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.250
They're a little more expensive,
but their service is a lot better.
86

87
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.860
And then another option is like Trademark Plus.
There's a bunch of these places, and they work fine.
87

88
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.120
You know, this one's $50, but they don't give you as much
support, they're going to walk you through it as well,
88

89
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.360
their product is just a little crappier.
89

90
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.370
So if you couldn't deal with that, just, I don't
know, pick which one fits your budget.
