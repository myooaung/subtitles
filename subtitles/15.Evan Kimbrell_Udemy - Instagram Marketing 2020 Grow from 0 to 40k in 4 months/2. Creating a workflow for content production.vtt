00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.950
Hey guys welcome back OK.

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.200
This is what we're going to talk about is creating a workflow for your content production.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.950
Now what exactly do I mean.

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.690
I mean that we never you make content for your Instagram post whether it's a photo a motivational quote

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:24.090
a video even a story you have a set process where you go by now the only way you can possibly start

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.210
to grow your content production is like first understanding each step of the process isolating each

7
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.280
step trying to figure out better ways to improve and optimize each step.

8
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.060
And then learning how you can package and bundle each step together with other staps and then essentially

9
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.880
outsource it.

10
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.230
Now most people who do Instagram accounts run into this problem almost immediately which is that they

11
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.370
make a post.

12
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.030
OK great.

13
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.990
They make another post.

14
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.560
OK great.

15
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.280
They're making other posts.

16
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.730
Ok great run around the time that you know two weeks later 5th or 6th post they start realizing that

17
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.920
it's actually really hard coming up with new stuff every single time.

18
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.280
For those of us who are not very self aware we're not detail oriented.

19
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.480
It might appear that we just have to come up with something new every single time we post.

20
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.250
That's not really the case.

21
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.100
Successful Instagram accounts have systems and they've systematized their process of making the same

22
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.260
repeatable content.

23
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.100
Now should you be concerned about using the same content over and over again.

24
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.550
No not really.

25
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.930
Number one people like consistency and some of the most popular accounts out there have it's consistent

26
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.540
pattern so they know what to expect every time they go to the account.

27
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.960
But of course you also have the option of breaking it up and trying out different things.

28
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.500
I do photos and videos.

29
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.820
OK.

30
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.480
But you can do anything you can do behind the scenes.

31
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.760
You can do employee highlights you can do promotional post you could do call to action post.

32
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.340
You can mix it up but you need to break down each process so you can understand it better and then design

33
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.880
it better.

34
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880
So how exactly do you outline a workflow.

35
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.880
Well first of all what I like to do is outline what I have already done to create each post.

36
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.310
It's essential that you create your first couple post.

37
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.610
Otherwise you won't know what goes into each post.

38
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.980
So the first thing I'd do is just sit down and either think about what I did to say create a photo post

39
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.810
or video post or go and create one and write down every single thing I did.

40
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.830
So let's look at the workflow I have for creating photos.

41
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.260
OK.

42
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.690
So here we go.

43
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.560
It's about 20 steps.

44
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.720
Some of these skip over a little bit and I tried to drill down on some of the other ones.

45
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.850
So number one I usually go to brainy quote OK that's they have the most quotes on the Internet and I

46
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.960
consistently find good stuff there then what I do is I search for one of the following terms.

47
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.520
Now you probably recognize these terms are also hashtags I use frequently innovation product design

48
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.310
entrepreneurship leadership strategy and future.

49
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.030
These are all topics that I think my audience actually cares about and I think they're on brand so any

50
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.300
code that's in that general area is probably going to fit.

51
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.310
Now I said if no good ones are available and this might be the case after I make a lot of these then

52
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.020
I go search alternative sites.

53
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.330
Now do I have alternative sites.

54
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.460
No because I haven't actually exhausted brainy quo.

55
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.320
There's a lot of it.

56
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.050
So you just google search that is open Kanva you see me do this then what I do is a duplicate the old

57
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.050
quote template.

58
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.560
OK so I have a quote template I already use the same design for each one.

59
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.540
Now for some of you guys this might change.

60
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.990
Right.

61
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.570
You might be using different images every single time.

62
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.430
Maybe you don't use can mean use.

63
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.350
So maybe you go in there and you have your own search criteria to find different backgrounds.

64
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.060
Maybe you go into an stock photo or an splash and you grab something there and then you throw it in.

65
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.710
I've chosen to make a template out of this and you saw this way back in Section 1 I think because it

66
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.550
just saves me a lot of time and it's good for consistency.

67
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.420
What I do is I just change the quote OK so early made it all of you change the code and change the name

68
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.530
of the person on it.

69
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.020
Then I Axford it as a P and g y a p n g it just loads better it's not really a big deal then what I

70
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.340
do is they load it into Dropbox and I label it.

71
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.350
Now I've talked about this before but that's how I organize things.

72
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.480
And I use Dropbox because then I can access it on my phone but also when I work with other people they

73
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.780
can access it as well so I kind of have this master group of content in the cloud that everyone can

74
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.140
access anytime it's not stuck on one computer.

75
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.450
Now I've shown you what it looks like.

76
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.500
It just looks like this innovation station post and I split them into categories.

77
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.720
Now add other categories as I do other things that do giveaways.

78
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.280
I'll make a giveaways one if I start doing call the action post.

79
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.160
I'll do that.

80
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.320
But right now it's just that.

81
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.160
And then each one I break it down into different versions of the video and then individual clips.

82
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:50.520
OK so back to photos then what I usually do is open text edit or ever knew OK then what I do is I start

83
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.090
searching for interesting facts regarding the person who wrote the quote.

84
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.440
OK it's Steve Jobs it's pretty easy.

85
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.320
It's someone more obscure than I might have to read the Wikipedia page.

86
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.200
So I copy five facts into text editor Evernham it doesn't really matter that I rewrite the facts that

87
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.910
I have to be more concise and impactful and also to fit the voice of the account.

88
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.200
Sometimes the way people write it they write it for a blog or they write for their audience.

89
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.220
That's not the same as my own.

90
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.850
So I like to rewrite it so that what I do is I take that text and I copy it into Evernote and into text

91
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.210
at it.

92
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.710
And I saved that file to Dropbox so the reason why I do that is just because then I kind of everything

93
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.410
stored in one place then I can go to the dropbox folder and see here's the photo.

94
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.230
Also here is a text file with all the captions and everything I need.

95
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.020
Then what I do is either one of two things that go to later Graham and I schedule the post or I go to

96
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.260
Instagram and just post it just depending on when I produced it.

97
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:51.180
Then I schedule a post or I load it into Instagram then I copy the caption to notes remember.

98
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.790
Or you can do it in Evernote or bear doesn't really matters.

99
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.940
Make sure it's in one of those cloud services.

100
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.870
Then I add a mode and line breaks member have Weinberg set up to automatically run.

101
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.270
Then I copy it back into Instagram I post it at hash tags and the first comment then I add extra comments

102
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.800
as Moji.

103
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.720
Now this is pretty much an overview of it.

104
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.940
Now I can break this down quite a bit more I could explain where I get the hash tags right.

105
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.420
I could break it down as to where they are how often I should change them.

106
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.000
I also go into how I schedule posts right.

107
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.810
But that's kind of generic and I don't think it's really worth while I could say you know here is my

108
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:31.110
scheduling criteria and so the next available slot has to be this or I have to time it with photos because

109
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.860
I like to do two one to one posting patterns.

110
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.670
OK so now my video workflow looks like this and it's quite a bit more complicated.

111
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.540
So what I do is I go to Spring wise man for business insider.

112
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.150
Then I search for new technology.

113
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.980
OK.

114
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.340
Usually I just scan it or I use search terms then what I do is a copy the link of a story I like into

115
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.630
one of those core services like Evernote or bear down I find the web site for the company being covered.

116
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.990
That one's actually kind of important because I need their visual assets.

117
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.730
Then I summarize the story with five to 10 capstans it consists of one to two sentences you've seen

118
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:08.130
me do this before then I write 100 character full caption describing the story and my first impressions.

119
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:14.310
I like to editorialize that as I say then I write a call to action and I write that separately then

120
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.310
I write down a short description of video that is needed for each specific caption and then what I do

121
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.140
is I search stop video Web sites and YouTube for clips that match those descriptions.

122
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.620
OK.

123
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.740
If the sentence was talking about landfill usage I would say I need a video of a landfill.

124
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.130
OK then how would I get you.

125
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.270
As I got to search for that specifically and then I can't find the clip.

126
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.760
I can go back here and find a more creative interpretation I could show actual trash or could show someone

127
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.350
throwing something away.

128
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.980
Either way I then create a Dropbox folder for the post.

129
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.310
I saved the raw clips there.

130
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.290
I just like to have everything housed in one area.

131
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.570
Then I open final cut pro or Adobe Premiere depends on my PC I use premiere if I'm going back.

132
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.230
These final cut pro then I copy the clips onto the timeline.

133
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.170
So these are just raw clip like they're on it.

134
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.020
Then I reduced the clips to usable pieces of seven or nine seconds.

135
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.690
Then I had keyframes to the still images to add motion.

136
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:09.870
So otherwise it just ugly because it just an image motion than it actually is a little bit more visually

137
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.470
interesting.

138
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.320
Then I add text templates over video and images.

139
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.030
Now this is something I've previously established you if you doing text you should probably figure out

140
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.830
your text earlier on.

141
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.500
And what works good.

142
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.370
And then just reuse that over and over.

143
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.480
You shouldn't be reinventing your text every single time.

144
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.720
Otherwise again you're just going be driven crazy.

145
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:34.210
This is part of systematizing this and this is how you get out from under the workload of posting constantly.

146
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:37.510
Then I put AD music from pre-selected music.

147
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:42.930
So what I did for that one is I went to the YouTube royalty free section and I just downloaded a bunch

148
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.710
that fit the terms inspirational motivational.

149
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.140
I just threw them in a folder and then I just rotate through them because no one really cares about

150
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.660
the music but you do need music.

151
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.770
Then I preview it and adjust timing.

152
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.740
Seventy nine seconds doesn't work for every single thing.

153
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.400
OK.

154
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.620
Sometimes you need more time to read something and sometimes you need less time.

155
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.620
Then I add the outro sequence.

156
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.750
Then I export it as an MP for loaded in the drop box and I label it.

157
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.570
Then I put a text file with the captions and the full caption Plus the called action in the same folder

158
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.400
then I do pretty much the same thing open lawyer Graham and Instagram if I want to was scheduled for

159
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.240
later or posted.

160
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.210
Now the difference here with later Graham buffer.

161
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.920
I'm currently speaking is that they can't automatically post a video so it's slightly different.

162
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:23.770
Do the same thing.

163
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.590
I copy the caption to the notes at a Modise and line breaks copy and post it or set a reminder that

164
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.810
pose a it varies and then I do my hashtags and I Mowgli's and I'm done.

165
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.550
OK so how exactly did I put that together.

166
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.940
Well at this point in the course you've already posted.

167
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:44.400
At a minimum 10 things so you should have some idea of how you've done it and over time you get better

168
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:44.750
at it.

169
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:50.040
So over time I might come back here and change things and fix them and say I might use a different app

170
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.460
or I might run it through one more process at Add a watermark or whatever.

171
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.850
There's a lot of different little things bells and whistles that you can add.

172
00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:02.920
The point is that you need to first write them out so that you can then start isolating each one figuring

173
00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:09.130
out a better way to do it and then deciding whether or not you can get someone else to do it or you

174
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.130
can programmatically automate it.

175
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:11.470
OK.

176
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.520
In the next lecture what we're going to do is we're going to take our sample workflow and we're going

177
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:20.200
to break it down into similar chunks or usable chunks.

178
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.340
Then we're going to import them into Trello and I will show you how to use that.

179
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:29.020
And that's essentially the springboard that we're going to use to actually start a content production

180
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.800
process.

181
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:30.210
See the.
