Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.290
OK, let's talk about what goes into a great profile page.
2

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.070
Now, in the metaphor of dating, your marketing efforts
will be like your clothes, your content will be
3

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.760
like your personality, your hashtags will be
your sweet tan, bro, and your profile page,
4

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.500
well, it's pretty much your face, not in the
way that you can't change your face,
5

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.100
any South Korean will tell you otherwise, but I mean
in that it's unavoidable. Unless you wear the mask,
6

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.910
they're going to see your ugly mug.
7

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.600
So, as you'll hear me say over and over, if you already
feel good about your profile, skip this lecture,
8

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.940
because we're just going to go back to the
basics and cover what actually matters. Anyway,
9

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.610
I personally like to think about the Instagram profile
10

11
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.060
kind of like a landing page. People land on your profile
and you want to give them the best impression possible.
11

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.730
kind of like a landing page. People land on your profile
and you want to give them the best impression possible.
12

13
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.930
That impression could be the difference
between success and failure.
13

14
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.410
There's really only so much growth hacking that you
can do. If your face looks like one of those "Don't
14

15
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.190
do meth" posters, then you're
probably going to have a bad time.
15

16
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.260
Now, before you go off thinking that making
a good profile is something that's hard,
16

17
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.570
let me stop you - it's really not.
17

18
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.800
It's actually quite simple.
18

19
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.050
In reality, there's only five things on your profile that
you need to care about, five things that, if done
19

20
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.240
well, will make you look like this,
20

21
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.750
and if done poorly, will make you look like this.
21

22
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.840
Number one, your profile picture.
22

23
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.990
Number two, your username.
23

24
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.670
Number three, your name, your account name,
and yes, that is different from your username,
24

25
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.930
more about that later.
25

26
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.760
Number four is your bio text, and number five, that's your
call to action, or what I'll sometimes refer to as a CTA.
26

27
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.930
Number four is your bio text, and number five, that's your
call to action, or what I'll sometimes refer to as a CTA.
27

28
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.920
That's it.
28

29
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.500
Pull those letters correctly and success
is essentially within your grasp.
29

30
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.070
So, do you have a high quality, high resolution profile photo
that matches the tone of your account and your posts?
30

31
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.840
So, do you have a high quality, high resolution profile photo
that matches the tone of your account and your posts?
31

32
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.630
Is your username memorable and
something that you could pronounce?
32

33
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.010
Does your account name succinctly summarize
what your page is, and is it optimized for search?
33

34
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.940
Does your account name succinctly summarize
what your page is, and is it optimized for search?
34

35
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.230
Does your bio text make me more
interested in what you have to say,
35

36
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.750
or less interested? And finally, are you using the right
language in your call to action to get the right outcome?
36

37
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.030
or less interested? And finally, are you using the right
language in your call to action to get the right outcome?
37

38
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.730
Now, some of you might be a little bit clueless
about the individual things I'm talking about.
38

39
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.710
So let's cover some very, very basic Instagram jargon.
39

40
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.810
Again, if you have experience with Instagram,
why are you still watching this lecture?
40

41
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.650
Anyway, moving on. We'll cover some Instagram
jargon, or what I'll refer to as insta jargon.
41

42
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.840
What's your profile picture?
42

43
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.290
Well, it's that thing right there in the big circle in the top left
of your profile page, you also see it in your comments.
43

44
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.190
Well, it's that thing right there in the big circle in the top left
of your profile page, you also see it in your comments.
44

45
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.390
What's your username?
45

46
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.790
It's right there at the top of the page, you'll see this pretty
much everywhere, with the @ symbol next to it.
46

47
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.290
So what's your account name?
47

48
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.740
Yes, I know that it's incredibly stupid
that it's called your name.
48

49
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.170
I personally like to think of it more like a subtitle,
but whatever it is, that's what it's called.
49

50
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.340
So if you're reading a blog somewhere,
that's what they'll call it. Anyway,
50

51
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.320
it's right there, it's literally the first thing
a new viewer will read on your account.
51

52
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.130
Your bio text, on the other hand, is the next 2-3
lines of unbolded and unitalicised text. And then,
52

53
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.990
last up, your call to action is literally like
the last 1-2 lines of your broader bio.
53

54
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.750
It goes there, and if the account you're
looking at has any clue what they're doing,
54

55
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.530
It goes there, and if the account you're
looking at has any clue what they're doing,
55

56
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.330
it'll be a link or at least something like an e-mail address
or some way to convert the attention on the
56

57
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.550
account into something that's an actual business.
57

58
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.080
Now, if you're curious, what's this area called? It has
several names actually, sometimes you hear it called
58

59
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.790
a feed, an album, a gallery. Those are pretty common.
59

60
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.990
a feed, an album, a gallery. Those are pretty common.
60

61
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.350
I personally call it your wall, because I'm a first
world anarchist, rebel without a cause.
61

62
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.840
OK, so those are our top tier concerns, and
we'll tackle them one by one in this section.
62

63
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.760
Are there other things we care about
when making the best profile page?
63

64
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.430
Yes, but we cover those just later on.
64

65
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.290
These are the things like the broader aesthetic, the color
patterns of your wall, the number of people following you,
65

66
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.570
These are the things like the broader aesthetic, the color
patterns of your wall, the number of people following you,
66

67
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.240
the ratio of how many people you follow to people that follow
you, and the quality of the link you use in your call to action.
67

68
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.520
the ratio of how many people you follow to people that follow
you, and the quality of the link you use in your call to action.
68

69
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.880
Like I said, keep those in mind, but we're going to
cover those later, so right now it's not a big deal.
69

70
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.830
Like I said, keep those in mind, but we're going to
cover those later, so right now it's not a big deal.
70

71
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.320
Like I said, keep those in mind, but we're going to
cover those later, so right now it's not a big deal.
71

72
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.730
OK. Got it?
72

73
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.280
OK. Got it?
73

74
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.080
In order to master arguably the most important part
of Instagram, you need a game plan for your profile
74

75
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.910
picture, your bio, your username, your
account name, and your call to action.
75

76
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.230
So that's what we're going to do in the next couple of lectures.
76

77
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.850
Next up, I'm going to walk the complete newbies
through creating their first dummy account, and after
77

78
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.740
that, we'll tackle the first step, which is your username.
78

79
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.310
See you then.
