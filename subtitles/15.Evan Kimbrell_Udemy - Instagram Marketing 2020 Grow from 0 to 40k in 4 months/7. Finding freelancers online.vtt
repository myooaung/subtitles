00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.620
Our guys will come back.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.170
So this lecture we're going to talk about is specifically where do you find freelancers that you can

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.630
integrate into your content production team.

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.810
Are even hiring freelancers for very long time.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.920
You never see any of my profiles online you can see how many people I've hired.

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.690
I think the first person I ever hired was back in high school believe it or not and I paid them to write

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.900
a paper and I believe were in Eastern Europe.

8
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.090
It kind of worked out.

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.370
But ever since then I've been kind of addicted to figuring out what the best platforms were on line

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.210
for finding people and how to get the most out of them.

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.480
So we're going to talk about is just a broad sweep of what's available to you.

12
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.420
All right so let's say you wanted to hire a writer well online you have some limited options.

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.520
Now number one is up work and this is something I'm going to say for pretty much every type of freelancer.

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.330
It's the largest freelancer marketplace pretty much in the world.

15
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.740
It used to be called oDesk and another committee called Elance and then they merged together to create

16
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.760
this behemoth that is up work.

17
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.100
Upper is pretty useful for finding writers although it's probably not their most native platform.

18
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.780
You do find a lot of them on there but they tend to be more like article writers or copy writers.

19
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.920
And the reason why is because of work you pay per hour or you pay say like a fixed fee for a large project

20
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.240
like talked about before with writers sometimes they write in very strange ways.

21
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.980
So it's very hard to set up an upward project that says I'll pay you per word or pay you per caption

22
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.240
but for the most part they are on there and I don't know.

23
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.730
It's just really up to you to figure it out.

24
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.210
Another platform that's pretty useful for writers is people per hour.

25
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.820
Now the reason why I'm bring this up is that they're basically the same thing as up work.

26
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.450
But the difference with them is that they have these things called our lease.

27
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.110
Now if you ever use fiver or dot.com this will probably ring a bell with you.

28
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.190
But they have hourly.

29
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.230
And so there are a lot of writers on there that will do generic tasks for writing and they'll do it

30
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.090
within That's usually like half a day or something like that.

31
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.150
They're usually very cheap rates.

32
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.090
So what you can do is you go to people per hour and then search for our least section and then look

33
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.040
for the writers there.

34
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.320
And then you can actually see whether or not any of those people offering our Aurelia's could theoretically

35
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.790
fit what you're looking for.

36
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.350
Now the last one I use for writers is a Web site called pro blogger dot net.

37
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.590
And the only reason I did this was because before I was hiring the long form writers and it worked out

38
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.270
pretty well.

39
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.970
But this one is more just like a traditional job board.

40
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.730
There are a lot of writers who are on it though and it can be tricky to get right the first time you

41
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.350
use it.

42
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.550
It's a pretty unstructured website so it's not like up work or people will bid and then you select them

43
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.380
and then they pay through up work or people are people are on the same exact way.

44
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.090
I'm a blogger.

45
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.210
It is just a job board.

46
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.920
So you have to give them step by step instructions for how to get in contact with you and how to figure

47
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.510
out everything else after that.

48
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.060
But it is something worth trying although it is a little expensive at something like $70.

49
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.720
Every time you post a job that now if you wanted to hire video editors I'm not going to shock you when

50
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.670
I say the first place I usually look is up work.

51
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.070
The reason why is just there's a lot of video editors on there.

52
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.370
There's a good range of people there.

53
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.090
Now the second place I'd say is video Pixi and that's a online marketplace that specific to video editors

54
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.670
and you can get all sorts of different people who could help you in the video production process video

55
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.510
Pixi tends to be a little more expensive.

56
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.630
So if you're OK with going up market a little bit then you can find some people there.

57
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.070
There is no real support in their actual app itself for working with these people so just kind of keep

58
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.790
that in mind.

59
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.130
Now if you wanted to hire photographers kind of just depends because you're going to have to hire them

60
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.080
locally.

61
00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.390
Most likely because they're probably going to take photos of some visual whatever that you actually

62
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.540
own or they want to go in a photo shoot with you or something like that.

63
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.250
If you're in the US I typically like to use thumbtack that seems to work decently well.

64
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.040
You can always go for Craigslist even though it seems a little sketchy but there are a lot of photographers

65
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.470
on it.

66
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.100
Outside the U.S..

67
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.890
Can you give me six specific advice because it just depends where you are.

68
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.380
Typically just going to Google and searching higher photographer and then put your area.

69
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.490
That's probably the best way to do it especially in Europe for instance because every country has a

70
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.570
different site for it.

71
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.830
Now if you wanted to hire virtual assistance Welden your options are quite wide.

72
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.580
Now the first place I usually go for virtual assistants is actually a place called freelancer dot com.

73
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:47.820
They're the biggest competitor to up work freelancer dot com is a great place to get really really cheap

74
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.680
people who work really fast.

75
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.420
That's kind of what they're best at.

76
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.630
When you post a job posting on freelancer you can get 15 bids in 15 minutes.

77
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.300
It's kind of absurd.

78
00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.420
So it's a great place.

79
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.350
If you are really trying to work with a budget because you'll get tons and tons of people from all over

80
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.130
the world.

81
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.440
I've been working on one virtual assistant who actually has become kind of a project manager plus video

82
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.600
editor plus basically everything.

83
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.780
And that's where we actually met was freelancer so you can find people there and then kind of work with

84
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.250
them over time and then see if they fit.

85
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.670
What part of your process.

86
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.540
The second suggestion is again up work.

87
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.100
There are a lot of people there specifically now with a virtual assistant you're just going to have

88
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.960
to be aware of the price sensitivity that's going to be involved with this an up or up.

89
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.070
There are some really cheap ones and there are also some pretty expensive ones so it just depends how

90
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.660
much hand-holding you want to give them.

91
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.370
Now if you want to hire social media managers I generally just suggest just slapping yourself because

92
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.240
that's just not a good idea.

93
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.730
These people just take your money and they don't really help you in any way past that.

94
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.230
You have things like consultants and people that can help you with various random things and that's

95
00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.210
just that's a different world and that's really going to be for one off things if you're really stuck

96
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.260
with something.

97
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.330
All right so those are my suggestions for trying these things out.

98
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.140
Next lecture we can kind of go over the sites that I use to find the team that I'm currently working

99
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.470
with.

100
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.010
All right see you in.
