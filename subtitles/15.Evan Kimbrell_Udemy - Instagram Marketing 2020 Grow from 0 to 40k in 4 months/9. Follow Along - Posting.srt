00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,660
PR is welcome back.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:07,090
Cause this lecture going to do a another post and I'm going to switch out from videos to photos.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,550
Now I'm not going to show you me posting every single one up till 10 because 10 was the goal we're trying

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,510
to get to but I'm going to show you the photo because this is a change of format for me.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,580
OK so down here we have the post that I just put I've been trying to record this over and over the last

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,450
half an hour.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,570
The iPhone just stops recording randomly.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,250
So I'm sorry.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:33,050
So what I did was over here and there I wrote it out and I put the image here.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,580
I made that and Kanva just like the way we made the dean common quote then.

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,930
But what's your favorite fact about Steve Jobs That's called action.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,040
I'm going to try putting it at the top and then down here have the top five facts you know.

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,600
And then I put some facts and kind of rewrote them so they're a little more punchy.

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,310
Cool.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:49,700
OK.

16
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,480
So the other ones that's just not the style music for the videos.

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,150
But I mean it's I don't really know how else to do it so what I'm going to do for clothes is I'm just

18
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,380
going to write about the person who told the quote OK I think that's a little more educational and it

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,190
makes sense.

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,400
And we had one issue you notice that we originally posted on the dummy.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,410
Dummy didn't do so hot.

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,770
So we had some screw ups there.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,870
And in the main one that's haunted by it just again I screwed up a little bit.

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,730
So it kind of is wrapped around.

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,780
Mean you need to break that up again and I need to add a couple more comments too high.

26
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,440
The hashtags that I.

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,720
So here with the hashtags now I change the hassocks slightly.

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,260
Word of Wisdom.

29
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,420
Instagram doesn't like when you use the same exact hash tags over and over and over again.

30
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,650
So if you just get a copy and paste halftracks make sure that you have a couple of hours in between.

31
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,800
Otherwise I don't think you're spamming and it can be a bad thing.

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,020
So for this I mean later on we're going to optimize hash tags and then we'll get into like how you cycle

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,810
them out and pick the ones that work.

34
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:59,150
Right now I just copy paste the old ones and then I just took out the obvious ones like I took out like

35
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,730
Kickstarter it was a hash tag.

36
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,560
OK so I remove that and I put in some stuff like motivational clothes Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs quote.

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,350
Sure.

38
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:06,720
OK.

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,050
So that's where I'm going to be getting some traffic from now to crack this whole screw up and see if

40
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,220
we can do it over here and there.

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,990
So you what actually happened.

42
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,960
Is that an extra little space right there.

43
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,530
That's bad.

44
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,780
That's what happened.

45
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,410
We got it.

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,070
Yep.

47
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,770
That extra long just kills it.

48
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,760
You've got to understand that sometimes your keyboard will just add this stuff.

49
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,740
So where did it go.

50
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,430
B.

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,990
Now we can do is copy this back if we correct the problem.

52
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:05,340
Now we just want a quick here at the whole thing.

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,080
Oh leave it there.

54
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,290
So that should work.

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,040
I agree.

56
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,410
Yeah it looks better.

57
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,190
So a fear factor of Steve Jobs whatever.

58
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,980
Right.

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,320
That's what it looks like.

60
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,430
And I put hashtags and so you actually see some traffic come in on this which is a little weird considering

61
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,270
that I'm not actually trying to actively go out and get people yet but whatever.

62
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,170
So let's see.

63
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,620
It looks fine.

64
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,500
I think it might put an extra space on that top line.

65
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,480
But other than that I think I like this.

66
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,860
It's hiding right there so we shouldn't see that.

67
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,850
OK so that's good.

68
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,980
I'll check in two years later when I have all ten posted and then we can kind of see what it looks like.

69
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,650
I'm not going be changing anything substantially so I don't need to really update you guys.

70
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,250
All right.

71
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,020
So the next letter.
