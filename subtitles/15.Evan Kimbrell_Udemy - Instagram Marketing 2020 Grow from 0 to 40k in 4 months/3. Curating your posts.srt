Hey guys, welcome back. OK, this lecture, we're going to
talk about another habit worth getting into your process,
1

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:14,580
and that's called curation. Now, typically, curation just means
I pick and choose which things I want, like a curated
2

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:22,080
experience or a curated interior design, that's kind of what
I'm talking about, but I mean it in a different way. What
3

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,540
I mean is that on Instagram, and
you might have actually noticed this,
4

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,750
you can delete your posts.
5

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,730
You might have asked yourself how is it that these gigantic accounts out there, usually the ones that have 1 million+, 
6

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,750
how is it that they post really weird stuff that has
nothing to do with their brand, looks totally different,
7

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,860
how is it that they post really weird stuff that has
nothing to do with their brand, looks totally different,
8

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,550
it's not a match to their name,
9

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,660
and then when you go to their profile, you only see that one that you saw on the feed, or you don't see anything at all.
10

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,850
Well, it's a very common thing called curation,
and it's something that you need to do.
11

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,640
So the basics of this, without sounding too obvious, when
you post something, it shows up in all of your followers'
12

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,410
feeds and then a little bit extra,
13

14
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,760
some other people who are not
following you will also see it,
14

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,280
and it'll show up on your profile. OK, after you post it, it
kind of throws it out there on top of someone's list, and
15

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,970
it just depends how much they scroll before they see it.
16

17
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,030
If you delete it almost immediately afterwards,
17

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,660
well, then it's not going to show up on your profile, but it still
shows up on their feed, it doesn't pull it from their feeds.
18

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,210
well, then it's not going to show up on your profile, but it still
shows up on their feed, it doesn't pull it from their feeds.
19

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,360
So what often happens when someone posts something that
is experimental, doesn't go off with their brand, whatever,
20

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,720
they'll post it and then take it down.
21

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,360
Now, there are three main reasons why you
would choose to curate a post. The first reason
22

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:45,420
is that what you're posting is a change in brand, or tone, or style, or even a different type of media something that's different.
23

24
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,130
is that what you're posting is a change in brand, or tone, or style, or even a different type of media something that's different.
24

25
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:53,950
If you established your account as a motivational quotes account, and then you posted a one-minute long video, and it's like an interview style,
25

26
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,560
If you established your account as a motivational quotes account, and then you posted a one-minute long video, and it's like an interview style,
26

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,290
that might be the case that you go back and you start deleting slowly over time some of your older things, so that you can
27

28
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,890
change the brand of your account over to videos,
assuming that that's what you want to do.
28

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,720
Alternatively, it could be the case that you wanted
to just try out a new style and it didn't work,
29

30
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,210
so then you delete it. Now, if you follow the other lectures, I say the best way of doing this is using your dummy account, because
30

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,790
in your dummy account, you'll be posting the same things on it automatically by using Buffer, which we covered before,
31

32
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,840
but on the dummy, you can post and it doesn't really matter.
32

33
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,160
You don't really have to worry about it.
33

34
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,450
You don't have to keep checking to see if you should
delete it, you can just post it and leave it there.
34

35
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,860
Curation doesn't really matter there.
35

36
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,340
Now, the second reason why you might curate
a post was because it was an advertisement.
36

37
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,820
OK.
37

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,680
Obviously these's different types of advertisements.
38

39
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:47,310
Next section, we're talking about shoutouts, that's a very
common one where you shoutout someone else, so
39

40
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,860
you take one of their posts,
40

41
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,150
you post it on your feed, and then you link back
to them. It's a way of kind of sharing an audience,
41

42
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,720
we'll talk about that later.
42

43
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,130
That might be a reason why you delete it.
43

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,180
OK, someone else's account doesn't really match
your brand, doesn't look right, and people can
44

45
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:07,830
kind of tell when you post something that's benefiting someone else, and not necessarily your audience to the fullest extent,
45

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,560
so you might delete it in that case.
46

47
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:15,690
It's could also be the case that you are promoting your
own product, so you posted something, you let
47

48
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,230
it out there for, let's say, I don't know, an hour,
people see it, interact with it, whatever,
48

49
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,680
it out there for, let's say, I don't know, an hour,
people see it, interact with it, whatever,
49

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,760
and then you just take it down.
50

51
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,330
Why?
51

52
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,880
Because maybe you don't want your feed to look like you
have product pitches over and over and over again.
52

53
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,760
By doing that, you can post more often.
53

54
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,070
By doing that, you can post more often.
54

55
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,690
Why wouldn't you just leave it up for like a week instead
of just posting it repeatedly and taking it down? Every time
55

56
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,130
you post it, it pops it up to the top of their feed.
56

57
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,460
you post it, it pops it up to the top of their feed.
57

58
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,830
So if you leave it up for a week,
58

59
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,260
eight days later, the odds of people seeing it are much lower.
59

60
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,410
You also run the risk of them going to your profile and seeing it, and getting that impression that it's a kind of spammy account.
60

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,080
Also, it could possibly be like a product placement. Sometimes real companies will pay you to post, that's something you'll deal 
61

62
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,950
with when you're a larger account and
62

63
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:04,010
you have lots of followers, but it's pretty common, especially if you get larger, people will reach out more and more, so maybe
63

64
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,480
you post yourself drinking something from a company that
64

65
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,610
wanted you to do that, you might take that down
depending on what the agreement was.
65

66
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,180
Why you might take something down?
66

67
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,980
It just had low engagement. Remember, we calculate engagement
67

68
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,160
by taking the comments, the number comments,
plus number of likes, divided by our total followers.
68

69
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,840
Typically, we see something a baseline of 2%, 1.8%,
69

70
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,870
but it depends on the industry.
70

71
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,500
Usually, you have an industry baseline,
and then you have your baseline.
71

72
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,290
Maybe the industry baseline is 1.5% and yours is 2.5%
72

73
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,380
Let's say you post something and it just flops, it's a 1%.
73

74
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,960
Okay.
74

75
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,680
In that case, you might actually delete it, because you
don't want someone to then go to the rest of your
75

76
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,250
posts and see the ones that just didn't perform well.
76

77
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,990
Nothing wrong with the style, or the tone of
the voice, the media or anything like that,
77

78
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,870
Nothing wrong with the style, or the tone of
the voice, the media or anything like that,
78

79
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,950
it just didn't work, for whatever reason.
79

80
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:03,330
So those are the three reasons. One, you're experimenting or you're changing over your account to an entirely different style,
80

81
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,730
or brand, or media type. Two, you're dealing
with shoutouts or advertisements.
81

82
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,820
And then three, one of your posts had low engagement.
82

83
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,720
I really like to think of curation as like turning
the hedges, it's something you need to do,
83

84
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,850
and generally, I like to at least once a week or twice a week
84

85
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:27,170
go back to the posts and kind of thin out
the herd, let's say. I might go and look at it,
85

86
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:34,380
and for some reason if a shoutout or an advertisement is still up there, I might delete it, I might just look at the posts using
86

87
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,420
Iconosquare or Instagram's Insights, although
it doesn't give you as much information,
87

88
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,600
Iconosquare or Instagram's Insights, although
it doesn't give you as much information,
88

89
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,910
see which ones just aren't doing well,
89

90
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,250
and then let's say go and trim them out.
90

91
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,840
It's really up to you.
91

92
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:53,250
Sometimes what I do is I try to look for posts that have a
larger deviation from the average, so let's say my average
92

93
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:59,240
is 3% and I'm OK with anything from 2% up.
93

94
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,190
Well, maybe I have something that breaks that
2% rule and it's a 1.8% or something like that,
94

95
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,570
I might want to trim that down, because at the end of the
day, it doesn't matter if you have a thousand posts that
95

96
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,910
are medium quality,
96

97
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,750
what really matters is that all of them are high quality.
97

98
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:20,190
People aren't going to scroll past a couple hundred in general. It's also the case that sometimes if you repost old content, and
98

99
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,870
that's something we will do at a certain point, just because
we've created enough content to last for years,
99

100
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,280
that's something we will do at a certain point, just because
we've created enough content to last for years,
100

101
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,260
you might actually go back and delete your old ones.
101

102
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,180
Someone who might be scrolling through it might notice them.
102

103
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,070
Curation is generally a tool worth using,
103

104
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,860
and it even lends itself to some pretty weird
strategies that you can try out if you want to.
104

105
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,120
For instance, what you can do is if you
know you have two different audiences,
105

106
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,170
let's say a big audience in the UK, a big audience
in the West Coast of the United States,
106

107
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,220
the time difference really is 8 or 9 hours,
107

108
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:59,020
so if you're trying to post for the optimal
time in the US, you would want to post at
108

109
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,480
let's say you want to go for the 10:00 PM.
109

110
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,240
OK, so if you post at 10:00 PM San Francisco,
110

111
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,390
that's 5:00 or 6:00 AM in London.
111

112
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,410
That's not useful for the second audience.
112

113
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,350
So what you might do is post one for San Francisco, leave it up
113

114
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:21,160
for a couple of hours, delete it, and then post when it actually
gets to the next best time for your London audience.
114

115
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,920
Then it's up to you if you want to leave it up or not,
you could take it down or you can just leave it up.
115

116
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,220
I generally like to leave it up. That way you can be
at the top of the feed for both of your audiences,
116

117
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,790
and if you want to, you can even tailor the post,
maybe say something location specific.
117

118
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,700
All right, guys, that's enough about curating posts, you'll probably see me talk about that and do that in the follow along
118

119
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,830
section, it's pretty important, I'll make
sure that I have at least one video on it.
119

120
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,610
Alright, see you next lecture.
