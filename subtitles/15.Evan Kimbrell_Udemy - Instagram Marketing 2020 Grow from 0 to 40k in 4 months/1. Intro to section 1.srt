Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,710
Let's go over quickly what we're
going to cover in this section.
2

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:11,430
OK, now, if you have experience with Instagram, you have
a profile that you like, and you're, you know, crushing
3

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,640
it with the daily feed of you smashing your face into bread,
4

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:22,560
well, then I would suggest skipping this section entirely, or
at a minimum being picky about the lectures you watch.
5

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,560
well, then I would suggest skipping this section entirely, or
at a minimum being picky about the lectures you watch.
6

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,160
You'll be warned at the outset of each lecture that, you
know, this lecture is the equivalent of a G-rated movie -

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,640
You'll be warned at the outset of each lecture that, you
know, this lecture is the equivalent of a G-rated movie -
8

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:37,130
also known as extremely boring, because
there's no gunfights or curse words. OK.
9

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,140
You've been warned.
10

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:44,240
Please don't be this guy. Anyway, what we're going
to start off by doing is talking about your profile,
11

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,160
what goes into it,
12

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,820
what parts are your top tier concerns
and what parts are minor,
13

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,200
we'll talk about picking or creating a profile image
that works specifically on this platform, how to
14

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,020
create a dummy account which we'll, you know, incorporate
into our growth strategies later on, how to get
15

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:09,070
your very own special pretty links, links that don't
look like crap, and we'll spend some time getting
16

17
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,770
the absolute beginners used to the basic UI. That's
going to be a lecture, for those of you guys who have
17

18
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,900
an Instagram account, please skip it.
18

19
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,480
We'll talk about what to do when the name you want
is inevitably taken by a group of Danish teenagers
19

20
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,490
(that will make sense later), how to write your own bio,
and how to get started with some basic analytics tracking.
20

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,280
(that will make sense later), how to write your own bio,
and how to get started with some basic analytics tracking.
21

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,800
All right. Got it?
22

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,620
All right. Got it?
23

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,550
Everything to do with the profile is
going to be covered in this section.
24

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,480
Why do we care about the profile?
25

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,550
Well, I don't know, it would be like asking why do
we care about the home page of our website.
26

27
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,980
Now, for those of you who know the answer, good job,
you're done with this lecture, and those of you who
27

28
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,200
don't know why a home page is important,
28

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,400
I'll indulge you, but Jesus, we are off to a bad start.
29

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,070
No matter what your goal is embarking on this
journey of Instagram growthage - real word -
30

31
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,570
whether it's just a ton of followers or more leads for
your business, or more revenue for your business,
31

32
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:10,120
whatever, every possible follower, lead, meat sandwich
filled with money, they have to go through your profile.
32

33
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,670
The entire business of Instagram,
33

34
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,570
believe it or not, is for the most part
limited to one link in your profile.
34

35
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,930
Now, that's where you can drive people to your website,
to your lead generation page, or to whatever, even
35

36
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,750
other Instagram accounts.
36

37
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,060
Yes, I know, you can make money elsewhere on Instagram,
and we will cover those, but this is the number
37

38
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,190
one place of concern for you as a business.
38

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,210
Make a bad impression, lose the followers.
39

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,460
Make a bad impression, lose the followers.
40

41
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,240
Make a good impression, and everything
else will seem like a piece of cake.
41

42
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,670
So take this section seriously.
42

43
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,490
It's the foundation of any success
you have with this platform.
43

44
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,260
Got it?
44

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:46,960
All right.
45

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,940
See you in the next lecture, where we're going to break down
the profile into digestible chunks that we can target one by one.
