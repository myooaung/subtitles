00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.620
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.360
All right so let's jump in and see a little bit about how I've designed my task groups and how I've

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.210
essentially isolated them into individual users who accomplish each thing in succession.

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.490
So Ever hear of innovation station posts.

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.250
Now this is kind of the Barger view of my production process.

6
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.110
So first we have needs captions.

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.780
Now before I just said listing off whatever the action is you do Alternatively what you can do is put

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.820
things like it needs blank.

9
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.060
Right.

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.170
So when other people read it they say oh anything and this needs captions.

11
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:49.800
So I know that to start this off I need to put things in here so I add cards and I put in links for

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.340
things that I want to actually turn into a post.

13
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.140
Then what happens is I actually have three people who are writing captions on all varying different

14
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.910
degrees of participation.

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.080
What they do is they just grab one and while theyre working on it they drop it into their section that

16
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.030
says like for instance Lauren is working on and its just blank look we know theyre working on captions

17
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.450
but I could just say working on it so that way.

18
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.910
What ends up happening is if this say lets say like this what goes into Lauren's like that.

19
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.800
And then Michael for some reason wants to actually do that one as well.

20
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.980
OK well he can look and see it right there so he shouldn't start on that.

21
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.570
These ones are free and open.

22
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.080
He can do whatever he wants with them.

23
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.810
Now over here Dan we just have needs video.

24
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.170
Now the reason it needs video in such a large chunk like its not really broken up in anything is just

25
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.420
because I haven't yet decided on the process yet.

26
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.470
I haven't yet found a good combination.

27
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.880
Now I was thinking about doing a situation where it says needs media needs assembly like before which

28
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.660
would require essentially getting one person to go find the clips and then one person to assemble them.

29
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.920
And so for the most part what I found as the video editor can find the clips because they are editors

30
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.840
although they're kind of overqualified for just looking for clips.

31
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.890
They generally have a good idea of what they need because they'll throw it into Final Cut Pro or Adobe

32
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.210
Premiere or whatever and then see immediately that this doesn't work.

33
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.700
Now over here.

34
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.930
So Iryna is working on video.

35
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.180
And then we have another video person and another video person.

36
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:26.100
So what I realized pretty quickly was the video is the bottleneck so it's it takes about 25 to 30 minutes

37
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.970
for any one of these people to write a caption.

38
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.010
And to put a video together we first started doing it it was two hours of video and now we've gone down

39
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.810
to about an hour.

40
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.360
So it's still three people writing captions they're still going to fill this up with three times as

41
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.970
many as will have actually processed through it.

42
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.600
So I've just begun the process of bringing on two more editors and will cover later how I find these

43
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.500
people hire them and vet them.

44
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.500
But then what happens is once the video is done we throw it and needs review.

45
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.570
This is something usually I do I usually look at it and make sure something's not wrong.

46
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.330
But I can also find anyone who's like an administrator who has very generic skills to do this as well

47
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.280
and just to look for mistakes or typos or something doesn't look right or something that just the video

48
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.370
editor missed.

49
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.520
And if that's the case something's wrong.

50
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.640
I would open it up and I would add in does here's a mistake and then I would take it and I toss it back

51
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.320
in that person's pile.

52
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.720
I've done that several times over here for captions so you can see for instance like this one.

53
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.170
So here is the caption Michael just copied it right into his card.

54
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.690
And then I gave feedback right.

55
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.080
So I just read through this and what I said was the grammar here is weird.

56
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.560
This doesn't make sense.

57
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.110
Also I'm confused what you're implying with this.

58
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.520
And so then you fixed it and then we moved it along the process.

59
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.650
Then the very end we just had a couple of other processes are scheduled for post and posted so I separated

60
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.700
those two out.

61
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.010
You can do them both.

62
00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.250
It doesn't really matter.

63
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.290
I'm going to be using a scheduling tool and we'll cover that in the next Pletcher potentially.

64
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.100
But either way even if I don't use the scheduling too I'm still going to manually write out what's going

65
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.680
to be posted today or you might store them somewhere so we know beforehand we have five posts for today

66
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.560
tomorrow and the next day and that by the fourth day we need to get enough of these through the process

67
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.480
and to the end.

68
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.610
OK so that's just a peek at how I've been doing it.

69
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.020
This will change as we go through especially towards the of the Course I'll keep updating you as this

70
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.790
changes.

71
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.330
If I had more people over move people but otherwise next picture what we're going to do is going to

72
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:40.560
talk about using scheduling tools for automation and how that can actually take out a significant chunk

73
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.220
of work for you and save you a chunk of time.

74
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.420
OK.

75
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.240
So see the.
