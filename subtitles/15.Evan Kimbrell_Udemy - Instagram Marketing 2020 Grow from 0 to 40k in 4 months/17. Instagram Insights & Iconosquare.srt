00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,850
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,690
OK, so this is an extra lecture.
2

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,050
You don't necessarily have to do this, but I think early
on it's worth doing, it's something that maybe later
3

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,370
when your account is growing you'll absolutely
need, but right now it's up to you.
4

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,690
when your account is growing you'll absolutely
need, but right now it's up to you.
5

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,590
when your account is growing you'll absolutely
need, but right now it's up to you.
6

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,700
Ok, so what we're going to do in this lecture is
we're going to set up our account with analytics.
7

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,440
Ok, so what we're going to do in this lecture is
we're going to set up our account with analytics.
8

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:28,020
The reason why we do this is because we want to know
as we start going through the process of posting,
9

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,480
and following people, and interacting, all the things
you do to grow your account, what's working.
10

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,400
We also want to know whether or not
we're growing or shrinking over time,
11

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,980
and as we start to bring together an audience, we also
want to know insights about that audience specifically.
12

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,250
Now, there's a lot of best practices out there for 
Instagram's audience as a whole, but those are only
13

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,030
partially relevant to us.
14

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,600
We actually want to know specifically how our
group performs, when are they on Instagram,
15

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,180
We actually want to know specifically how our
group performs, when are they on Instagram,
16

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,810
when do they like photos the most often, things like that.
17

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,570
when do they like photos the most often, things like that.
18

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,490
So what we're going to do is we're going to explore two
analytics tools that are out there, one is free and one is paid.
19

20
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,620
So what we're going to do is we're going to explore two
analytics tools that are out there, one is free and one is paid.
20

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:14,060
There's a lot of other free apps out there, but personally
they don't pass my bar of quality to suggest them.
21

22
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:14,630
There's a lot of other free apps out there, but personally
they don't pass my bar of quality to suggest them.
22

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:20,040
Most of them seem like lead generation tools that are not
particularly consistent and not particularly accurate or useful.
23

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,200
Most of them seem like lead generation tools that are not
particularly consistent and not particularly accurate or useful.
24

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,810
So what we're going to do is instead we're going to first
work with the analytics embedded in Instagram, that's
25

26
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,540
the free version, and then the paid version,
we're going to use a tool called Iconosquare.
26

27
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:37,470
OK, now, believe it or not, Instagram allows you to have a lot of analytics for your account, but they only do it if you're a business.
27

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,620
OK, now, believe it or not, Instagram allows you to have a lot of analytics for your account, but they only do it if you're a business.
28

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,490
OK, so you have to switch to a business account.
This is perfectly fine, because I'm assuming all of us
29

30
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,150
are business accounts, so it shouldn't
really be that big of a deal.
30

31
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,920
Now, the only thing you have to do before you set
up your Instagram insights, is what they call it, is
31

32
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,100
you have to create a Facebook page, because as soon as
you try to switch your account to a business account,
32

33
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,750
it's really easy to do, it's going to ask you to connect your Facebook page, because they're assuming you're a business.
33

34
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,220
it's really easy to do, it's going to ask you to connect your Facebook page, because they're assuming you're a business.
34

35
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:11,920
So the first thing you want to do is go on your Facebook,
and we're going to create a business page. Keep in mind, whenever you make a business page,
35

36
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,290
it does not notify everyone in your personal Facebook
what you've done, so don't really worry about that.
36

37
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:16,730
it does not notify everyone in your personal Facebook
what you've done, so don't really worry about that.
37

38
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,710
Also, don't worry about filling out your Facebook page.
38

39
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,160
You don't need a Facebook page, you don't have to use it.
39

40
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,330
You don't need a Facebook page, you don't have to use it.
40

41
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,550
We just have to create the account when we then go to
our Instagram profile and switch it to a business account.
41

42
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,970
So the first thing you do is just go
over here and click this down arrow,
42

43
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,950
and then where it says Create a Page,
right there, just click that.
43

44
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,670
So now what you want to do is pick any of these.
44

45
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,440
It really just wants to know what type of business you are, because it's going to change the questions and change some
45

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,030
of the pre-made templates that they give you.
46

47
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,130
We're just going to pick business organization.
47

48
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,570
This one is kind of generic.
48

49
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,670
Or you can pick any other, it doesn't
really matter. Then it asks
49

50
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,760
for a company name and then
you have to choose a category.
50

51
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,150
So, company name, Innovation Station,
pretty easy, and then choose a category.
51

52
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,190
What I'm going to choose as a category is just, I'm going
to pick Internet company that works, pretty generic.
52

53
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,830
What I'm going to choose as a category is just, I'm going
to pick Internet company that works, pretty generic.
53

54
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,290
We're running on the internet.
Doesn't really matter what you pick,
54

55
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,740
they just use it for their own statistics.
55

56
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:18,040
Then, next up, they want you to add a profile picture, I'm not going to do that, I'm just going to skip, you could just skip it if you want. Add a cover photo, I'm not going to do that either.
56

57
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,040
Then, next up, they want you to add a profile picture, I'm not going to do that, I'm just going to skip, you could just skip it if you want. Add a cover photo, I'm not going to do that either.
57

58
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,330
You can just skip it. OK, so that's it.
58

59
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,240
You can just skip it. OK, so that's it.
59

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,560
Now I actually have a page, technically.
60

61
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,650
So all I've got to do is really just exit out of these annoying
tours, and you don't have to do anything else
61

62
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,120
on this page, congratulations. So next thing to do
is go over to your Instagram app on your phone,
62

63
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,920
it doesn't matter if you use iOS or Android.
63

64
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,130
So just go and select Instagram, your app. Then
64

65
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:47,290
we're going to go to the bottom right to where our
profile button is. Ok, now we see our profile. Now you 
65

66
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,290
want to click the three dots on the top right.
66

67
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,500
So what we're going to do is go down to Switch to Business
Profile, and then we just want to click that, and what this
67

68
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:02,580
will allow us to do is now become a business, which
makes it so that we can use Instagram ads, we do
68

69
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,190
that later on in the course,
69

70
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:13,010
but it also allows us to put more contact information, so
we can put a phone number, an email, or use an address,
70

71
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,990
so it gives us extra options of just playing out on
our profile. What I want to do is just hit Continue,
71

72
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:23,300
and it gives us some preview of all the cool things that
they give us, which are pretty cool and pretty useful.
72

73
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,950
And then, you can see a preview of, if we went
to our account page, if you go up here and
73

74
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,380
click on the bars icon, that's going to be
where we see the analytics for our profile.
74

75
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,440
click on the bars icon, that's going to be
where we see the analytics for our profile.
75

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,500
Then you can also see that it gives the users more options to contact us, pretty cool if you're using this for lead generation.
76

77
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:42,680
Next, we just need to connect a Facebook page.
77

78
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,190
Next, we just need to connect a Facebook page.
78

79
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,600
OK.
79

80
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,500
So if you did this right and you're
logged in Facebook on your phone,
80

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,160
you should see your pages, so I just have to click
Innovation Station. Alright, now I can set up
81

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,800
a business profile, and if you hit Done, it will actually
force you to put in at least one of these three.
82

83
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,360
a business profile, and if you hit Done, it will actually
force you to put in at least one of these three.
83

84
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,930
You can always change it.
84

85
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:07,640
Personally, what I suggest doing is making an email address
at the pretty link that you made before in the previous lecture.
85

86
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,670
Personally, what I suggest doing is making an email address
at the pretty link that you made before in the previous lecture.
86

87
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,720
So I'm just going to have a contact@innovationst.at
and that way they can
87

88
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,710
contact me for, later on when we start talking
about collaborating with other accounts.
88

89
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,930
Just make sure that whatever you put,
you're OK with people contacting you.
89

90
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,790
So if put your phone number, be aware, people might actually
call you, so if you don't have a real business, then I probably
90

91
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,080
would avoid that. Ok, so now it says
"Welcome, innovationstation." Cool.
91

92
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,070
Click through it, and now we are a business account. Great.
92

93
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,190
Ok, then at the top
93

94
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,610
you can see those bars and the icon, that's what we're going
to use to see insights about our account, so if we go to
94

95
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,010
that, it just shows us immediately how many followers
we have, how many we got in the last seven days, it even
95

96
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,420
gives you stats on posts, and other things like that. So
if we scroll down a little bit, you see the followers part,
96

97
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,050
gives you stats on posts, and other things like that. So
if we scroll down a little bit, you see the followers part,
97

98
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,810
and it says you need 100 followers to see this demographic
info, but once you do, it's actually pretty useful.
98

99
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,330
and it says you need 100 followers to see this demographic
info, but once you do, it's actually pretty useful.
99

100
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,850
and it says you need 100 followers to see this demographic
info, but once you do, it's actually pretty useful.
100

101
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,750
and it says you need 100 followers to see this demographic
info, but once you do, it's actually pretty useful.
101

102
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,940
It tells you about the people who follow
you, and that will help you a lot
102

103
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:07,110
later on when we start looking for accounts to mimic or get inspiration from. Then, they give you information about your posts,
103

104
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,570
later on when we start looking for accounts to mimic or get inspiration from. Then, they give you information about your posts,
104

105
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,540
that's also really useful, it will tell you which ones in the last seven days were the most successful, the most engaged with.
105

106
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:20,090
You get some stories insights, which is pretty useful, stories
are kind of hard to track, and then promotions, that's ads.
106

107
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,600
The biggest thing that is going to be able to see
how many followers you got over the last day.
107

108
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,050
So, today, Monday, we put 10 posts, and I want
to see how many followers we got from 10 posts.
108

109
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,970
Maybe the next day we do three posts,
and I want to see the difference.
109

110
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,580
Maybe the next day we do three posts,
and I want to see the difference.
110

111
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,370
And also, I generally want to see if I'm losing people too, if I'm posting the wrong stuff, if I'm posting too often, not enough,
111

112
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,320
this is what we can get out of Instagram insights,
112

113
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,380
although it's a little bit limited, and that's what we're
now going to cover the paid version, Iconosquare.
113

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,870
Iconosquare has been around for
a long time, they're really popular,
114

115
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,070
Iconosquare has been around for
a long time, they're really popular,
115

116
00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:00,590
and they give you a lot that you can do. That's one of the reasons I'm picking them. Instagram tools pop up and pop down
116

117
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,740
every other day, it seems like. There's hundreds of
them and they're always changing, like, for instance,
117

118
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,610
Social Rank was a really popular one for seeing your followers.
118

119
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,300
They quit doing Instagram.
119

120
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,120
Great. Mass Followers was another
one that got shut down by Instagram.
120

121
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,130
That's kind of different, but kind of the same space.
121

122
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,440
Now, I'm choosing Iconosquare because
of two different things.
122

123
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:31,940
One, it's the cheapest for you, cheapest out there, it's only
$7 a month, and two, it's been around for a long time, so
123

124
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,920
we know it's not going anywhere.
124

125
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,720
I also like the analytics they give you. Now, Iconosquare
125

126
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:45,120
has added a lot of new features to their thing, so it can be
a little confusing if you should pick them over another app,
126

127
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,090
and there are seriously hundreds of these
apps out there that do the same thing,
127

128
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,130
it's just a Venn diagram from hell on what everybody does.
128

129
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,460
It's going to be up to you which one you want to use,
129

130
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,610
It's going to be up to you which one you want to use,
130

131
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,120
just make sure that they have the analytics that we
cover in these lectures, and that's pretty much it.
131

132
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,410
just make sure that they have the analytics that we
cover in these lectures, and that's pretty much it.
132

133
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,690
So if you post in the Slack, and you ask, "Evan, have you used such and such tool?" I've probably heard of it, but I probably
133

134
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,210
don't use it, because they're all the same.
134

135
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,810
So just try it out yourself and see what it can let you do.
135

136
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,100
I think they're really reasonable,
if you look over their pricing page.
136

137
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:22,310
They allow you to use $7/month up until
100,000 followers, which is quite generous. Ok,
137

138
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,560
so I'm going to sign up, I will just go over, back
to the front page, and click Start a free trial.
138

139
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:28,970
OK.
139

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,950
So fill out your information here, and at the bottom
you'll have to fill out the industry, again, kind of
140

141
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,410
like we did with Instagram business.
Doesn't really matter what type you pick,
141

142
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:44,380
I'm just going to put self-employed. Again, it's
for their information specifically. On industry,
142

143
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:53,810
I'm going to probably put information technology or education, since we do innovation and it applies to education, IT is probably 
143

144
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,540
the most similar thing to being an internet company.
144

145
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,860
It doesn't really matter, just hit next. Ok, the next thing
we want to do is we want to connect our social profile.
145

146
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,320
It doesn't really matter, just hit next. Ok, the next thing
we want to do is we want to connect our social profile.
146

147
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,540
So make sure that you are logged in in your
browser to Instagram in the right account.
147

148
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:12,320
So then all I have to do is hit "Add social profile" and when you click it, it asks you to connect a social profile, so we'll just click Instagram. Ok, 
148

149
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,700
and then you just have to authorize it.
149

150
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:14,960
Great.
150

151
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,810
Now we have our account, and we
can just hit "Start using Iconosquare."
151

152
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,920
Now we have our account, and we
can just hit "Start using Iconosquare."
152

153
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:25,250
Now, what you see here is, it's going to pop up and give
you some information, if you want to watch some
153

154
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,730
videos of how to use Iconosquare, but
it takes a while for them to update,
154

155
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,000
so that you can use it. For whatever reason,
even if you don't have any posts on it,
155

156
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,910
it just takes like 30 minutes, 45 minutes, so just open
it up, get it going, and then come back to it later.
156

157
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,080
In the meantime, we kind of look over here at the side.
157

158
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,880
We have analytics,
158

159
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,210
we have, that's kind of the bread and butter of what
we're going to use it for, then we have a comment tracker.
159

160
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,750
That's pretty useful actually, because it allows you
to see all of your comments, likes, and interactions
160

161
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,830
on your post inside of their app, and then
you can respond to them all right here.
161

162
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,310
on your post inside of their app, and then
you can respond to them all right here.
162

163
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,390
on your post inside of their app, and then
you can respond to them all right here.
163

164
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:07,050
So it's kind of nice to be able to do it on a web browser as opposed to just doing it with your fat thumbs on your phone. Then
164

165
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,800
it has Media, and this might be useful to you, but it's just royalty free stock images that you can use if you want to post,
165

166
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,780
it has Media, and this might be useful to you, but it's just royalty free stock images that you can use if you want to post,
166

167
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,680
it has Media, and this might be useful to you, but it's just royalty free stock images that you can use if you want to post,
167

168
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,960
I don't really care for that stuff.
168

169
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:21,650
I personally like to use Latergram and Buffer for picking my
media and scheduling, which was the next one, Scheduler.
169

170
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,100
I don't really care about that. Then they
have Search, and that's for researching
170

171
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,300
other people and other accounts, but also finding a
post that you want to repost, which can be useful, but
171

172
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,000
again, other tools do it better.
172

173
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,760
And then you just have Tools, Instagram feed, and discover. Instagram feed tab is not something we're going to use, that's
173

174
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,040
for people who want to pour over their
Instagram posts to their Facebook page,
174

175
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,520
we don't really care about that.
175

176
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,410
Once it's set up, it should look like this, it's
going to give you a bunch of tour buttons,
176

177
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,350
you can go through these if you want, I don't really care.
177

178
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,110
you can go through these if you want, I don't really care.
178

179
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:53,670
OK.
179

180
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:01,540
So up here we'll see our total followers, we'll see our total followings, how many people we followed, total likes received, total comments received.
180

181
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,810
It's going to chart it out, which
181

182
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:09,040
is incredibly useful, it's going to show us follower growth, so it's going to show us, are we decreasing in growth, increasing
182

183
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,610
in growth, that's what we care about. It'll give us
183

184
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,850
in growth, that's what we care about. It'll give us
184

185
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,530
gained and lost, that can be pretty useful, because we want to see the ratio of how many we gain a day versus how many we lose.
185

186
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,880
gained and lost, that can be pretty useful, because we want to see the ratio of how many we gain a day versus how many we lose.
186

187
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,830
Sometimes you post stuff and you're
like, hey, I see people following me,
187

188
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,020
but you're actually losing them
faster than you're gaining them.
188

189
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:31,170
Then down here, it just gives us big totals of how many
we've gotten, it covers our engagement it covers how, down
189

190
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:38,490
here, our media lifespan is how each post persists over time,
are we just getting likes upfront, and later on nothing,
190

191
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,450
or is it actually something that's a little more evergreen.
191

192
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:47,310
It'll give you some more account stuff about likes history, comments history, average likes, and stuff like that, it's actually
192

193
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,490
all very, very useful.
193

194
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:55,790
Over here, we have a Competitors tab, what we can do is we can add a competitor that we can track to see how they do on similar ones.
194

195
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,850
Here's Hashtags,
195

196
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:04,270
we'll use that later on when we start doing our advanced optimization of hashtags. Comment tracker is there...
196

197
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,000
Honestly, just play around with it,
197

198
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,580
we don't have any posts in this part of the
course, so I wouldn't really worry about it.
198

199
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,380
It's just more that we got it set up, and now, as we start
posting and as we start interacting, we'll come
199

200
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,520
back to this, and then it will actually become useful. I just
want to make sure you have it up since the beginning, because
200

201
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,340
you want the data from the very beginning.
201

202
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:23,970
OK.
202

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,980
Now, with that being said, check it out.
203

204
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,560
If you don't want to pay money, just use Instagram business.
204

205
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,580
It works pretty well, just not as robust.
205

206
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,900
If you've got $7 a month, try Iconosquare, it's quite useful.
206

207
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,050
If you've got $7 a month, try Iconosquare, it's quite useful.
