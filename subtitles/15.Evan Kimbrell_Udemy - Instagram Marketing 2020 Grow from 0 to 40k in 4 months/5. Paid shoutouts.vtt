00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.720
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.370
This lecture we're going to do is we're to talk about paid shout out specifically.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.890
Now we talked about them before.

4
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.280
You probably have a rough idea of what they are.

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.400
But I feel like we just didn't give enough attention to it.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.740
And there are some specific things of page outs that are worth addressing and a separate lecture.

7
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.840
So page outs if you're not familiar yet skipped a lecture or something.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.970
Their shout outs where you just pay for them.

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.340
OK.

10
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.420
Some situations call for paid shout outs only and that's usually when your account only has X amount

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.970
of followers and you're trying to get a shout out from someone who has ten times as many.

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.700
If that's the case they're just going ask you to pay for one.

13
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.090
Also I mean there's a lot of accounts out there that are designed to make money through paid shout outs.

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.570
So those ones sometimes will ask for money no matter what.

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.570
Now whether you want to do paid channels is really up to you and your budget.

16
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.040
Can they be worth it.

17
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.450
Sure.

18
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.770
I mean it just depends what worth it means to you.

19
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.210
If you don't want to spend any money growing your account you won't do it entirely organically.

20
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.970
And the answer is no but if you ok spending a little bit of money to get a boost every now and then

21
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.860
while Sure I personally try to avoid them just because.

22
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.260
Sure.

23
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.740
A shout for shout with the real account takes a little bit more work but it doesn't.

24
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.290
It's nothing.

25
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.480
Nothing wrong with that.

26
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.090
I take someone else's post I pick it because I know my audience likes it.

27
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.650
And they do the same thing and I get exposure for it.

28
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.410
So it's a little more authentic.

29
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.670
The only time I ever think about paid is kind of at the very beginning when I just don't have enough

30
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.940
followers to justify doing Cher for shares with anyone.

31
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.540
If that's the case and yeah this can definitely get you out of a rut.

32
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.970
So how do you exactly do you find them and how do you qualify.

33
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.170
Which ones are worth it.

34
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.240
Well let's first talk about how you find them where you find them pretty much the same way we talked

35
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.170
about before finding share for shares.

36
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.010
You look see if they have e-mail address if they know that you look to see if they post other people's

37
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.650
stuff then you see if they're tagging people in their captions then you just contact in the same way.

38
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.370
And if they want page they'll just say page.

39
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.220
Sometimes it's just another item on the menu.

40
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.210
Sometimes they'll say you Sheriff show or you can pay for it.

41
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.090
And then sometimes that's all they want to offer.

42
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.340
So through the process of looking for organic shout outs you'll find a lot of these so you'll have the

43
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.690
opportunity to use them well outside of that.

44
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.130
So how do you exactly do you find more of them.

45
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.210
Well you probably have to use in an exchange.

46
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.820
So we'll look at three of the biggest ones so they're just basically Web sites where people who want

47
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.670
to monetize their accounts go on and give prices for shots.

48
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.370
Pretty straightforward.

49
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.750
I mean almost every single social media platform out there has these.

50
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.110
Just keep in mind that the people that made these accounts typically are not.

51
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.210
I mean they're not the best accounts out there to work with because they made them solely for the purpose

52
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.260
of monetizing.

53
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.200
Just remember that technology account we refer to several times.

54
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.150
That's all they do.

55
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.610
All they do is page shout out so you could tell because all of their original content never changes.

56
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.700
They just post the same paid stuff over and over deleting it deleting it deleting it so every time you

57
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.810
get the profile it looks the exact same.

58
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.630
They're just trying to make money.

59
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.030
OK so first of all look at those buy sell shout outs.

60
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.480
Now this place has a lot of stuff that you can use.

61
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.090
They try to sell your own software.

62
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.960
They have a whole bunch of some element analytics tools and some stuff that's a little black hat do

63
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.410
you focus on their shout outs.

64
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.220
You know look at those disco shout outs over here and we can start browsing now you can look at all

65
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.390
of them if you want to.

66
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.200
And if you want to start selling your own well there's that option too.

67
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.950
So they'll show you some of their more impressive ones usually and you can kind of just tell immediately

68
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.090
what they're going for.

69
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.260
A lot of fitness accounts a lot of motivational quote ones.

70
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.000
A lot of you know like fuzzy dogs and fuzzy cats kind of ones.

71
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.870
So specifically I'm in technology so let's just say I go to science and technology let's see if there's

72
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.770
actually any that might work.

73
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:05.890
OK so some of done nothing to do with with science and technology at all like what does this matter.

74
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.090
Permanent promotion.

75
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.010
Don't you know what that is but down here we have a philosophy of science.

76
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.590
OK.

77
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.270
Ranges from $10 to $40 and then we have shout out brilliant invention 60 to 100.

78
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.020
Now I might actually be interested in this one because I'm doing innovations like.

79
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.310
And most of them are new product inventions so so is interested in new cool inventions might be interested

80
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.910
in what I'm doing as well.

81
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.230
Sounds pretty easy.

82
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.720
So you can see right here the way these usually work is you literally just give them your and your user

83
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.390
name you give them the caption They don't even care.

84
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.690
And then you give them your e-mail address and the image and then you get to pick.

85
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.060
So this one specifically I could do a three hour future for 60 bucks 24 hour feature for 90 and then

86
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.710
a permanent post for two hundred.

87
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.330
Now the way that I would qualify this is the same way that we did it before.

88
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.780
I would just go and do some basic analytic searches on them.

89
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.060
So if I wanted to look at brilliant innovations.

90
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.880
OK here we go.

91
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.820
They have a rank of B.

92
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.890
Not bad but I can see here that they're losing followers.

93
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.520
Now that typically means that they're no longer posting organic content that means they're just doing

94
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.550
ads because usually you do ads they just don't work as well with your audience and people slowly start

95
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.100
to kind of leave.

96
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.970
But you can also tell they have so many followers to begin with that it's going to be a while soon to

97
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.660
be at least another year before they have to start pumping it back up again.

98
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.050
So that's really all we can pull from here be it kind of depends.

99
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.450
I think they're waiting.

100
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.380
They're ranking a lot by how many followers they're losing.

101
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.490
Now we could though use the auditor for Instagram.

102
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.070
This is much better.

103
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.050
And right here it's a bit of a shocker right.

104
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.250
So 32 out of 100.

105
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.630
That's quite bad.

106
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:53.070
OK.

107
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.180
So very low activity no suspicious likes or comments fallers numbers seem to be artificially increased.

108
00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.710
OK.

109
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.460
So they're not buying Lankes they're not buying comments that they just incredibly low engagement.

110
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.660
And it might be that some of their followers are fake.

111
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.270
Now we see up here they post nine or three times but this or that's engagement rate.

112
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.480
Now that's point 3 1 percent.

113
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.420
That's awful.

114
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.820
So if I go down to their comparison that poor I mean it's could be a lot worse.

115
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.970
But wow.

116
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.250
I mean the baseline for them is supposedly 1.5 5.

117
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.640
You can see these they really round out the bottom of the account.

118
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.260
Now of those point three one percent we see for the most part they're real people.

119
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.530
OK.

120
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.830
They're just not getting a lot per how many people they have falling.

121
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.690
And that's probably because remember we looked at this they haven't been posting real stuff in a while.

122
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.020
So if you're still engaging at this point it's kind of ridiculous.

123
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.090
You'll just probably engage with anything and there probably.

124
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:56.850
Well I'd say a lot of them are bots but this one says that probably 132 percent of that activity looks

125
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.080
like it's from a bot.

126
00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.340
Then we can look down here.

127
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.040
So I really only want to go after English speaking people because my stuff is all in English would be

128
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.020
really hard to understand if you don't speak English.

129
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.930
So 75 percent that's decent but still I mean you have to discount them 25 percent almost immediately

130
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.210
like and comment ratio doesn't really matter.

131
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.400
That usually is sometimes an indicator that people are cheating but that's about it.

132
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.160
So it's the reachability.

133
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.250
So this basically means that a lot of people following them just follow.

134
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:31.650
Way too many people so that also could partially explain their low engagement rate.

135
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:38.310
Here we see a lot are in India a lot are in the U.S. kind of same thing real people really only at 50

136
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:38.730
percent.

137
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.050
So then the question just becomes is that worth it.

138
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:49.320
I mean if you only have point three one percent engagement OK that means that not very many people are

139
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.090
actually going to engage with it.

140
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.250
Now you can just do the math on this right.

141
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.480
Point three of a percent.

142
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.330
And there's ninety nine hundred fifty eight thousand.

143
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:04.830
So we just said 958 thousand times zero point three percent.

144
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:11.570
And this would be point 3 of a percent that each post gets about 3000 engagements.

145
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.090
Now those could be spread.

146
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.510
You get commenters and post that's why you'd want to go look at the ratio of comments to post.

147
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:26.830
So if I did that you could guess out of 3000 people I might get say five hundred new followers maybe.

148
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:27.670
OK.

149
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.970
So out of 500 new followers.

150
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.220
Is that worth $90.

151
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.060
You can just do the calculation right there.

152
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:39.270
You say you're paying 90 by 500 so maybe 18 cents what you can do when you're researching these as you

153
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.920
can compile these into an Excel sheet and you can just kind of make a baseline guess.

154
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.680
And I first like to reduce it down to the price per follower.

155
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.870
I would expect because that kind of levels it out.

156
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.570
I'm more interested in getting the best bang for my buck Nessus not necessarily getting the most followers

157
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.710
per time I do this.

158
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.750
So what you would definitely want to do is just try to standardize everything let's say had BERLIJN

159
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.560
interventions into other accounts.

160
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:09.780
What I'd want to do is just take their total number of people right then divide and then times it by

161
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.430
their engagement rate then I get that expected amount and then I take it by a standardized amount.

162
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:20.250
So I'd say I'm going to guess 25 percent of the people who engage will follow me right or go to my profile

163
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.330
and then follow me.

164
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:26.580
So multiply that against each one and that's how you can figure out what is probably the best deal.

165
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.730
But again if you have the budget sometimes it just doesn't matter.

166
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.690
How quickly we'll look at two other places.

167
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.600
One is called Jump thaim dot com.

168
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.990
And you know they're kind of the same thing.

169
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:44.110
They don't have as many people but you can also do some targeting where specifically if you only want

170
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:48.460
to count in a certain area or a local business that can be pretty useful.

171
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.700
You can pick the language and stuff like that because are ones that give you a lot of junk sometimes.

172
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.770
Let's say I wanted to do technology Well OK I already selected technology.

173
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.630
I said that I want a specific number of followers I could do that.

174
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:06.080
This is pretty useful actually mostly active audience so if I know my audience is mostly active say

175
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:13.040
and like the evening OK I don't want someone who gets all of their likes from say a morning group.

176
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.770
Now the reason is because I want to concentrate my engagement in my posts.

177
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.690
I have my likes all spread out across my day.

178
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.700
That's not as useful as if I had them all at the same time that I post.

179
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.990
Ok now it's a little confusing because you could ask what time zone but you kind of just have to think

180
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.240
of it just as generic like.

181
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.760
Assume that this is all based on US West Coast or something like that.

182
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.500
Look at yours and then just base it off that relatively So if your evening then just base it off of

183
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.950
that it might be the case that you're in the US and you have a large European audience than it might

184
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.630
be the case that you have a nighttime audience.

185
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:52.800
OK so if I wanted to update my view and show me what their technology posts look like and I can kind

186
00:10:52.800 --> 00:11:00.210
of see if there's anything that matches what I would like so this is probably the only one technology

187
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:00.960
spot.

188
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.350
And then what I would do is I would do the same thing.

189
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.620
I would go and check them out.

190
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.240
You know from $10.

191
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.040
Kind of just depends what they want.

192
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.950
OK so here pretty straightforward it's nice We'll tell you the engagement rate up front.

193
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.860
Now one percent is three times better than brilliant inventions.

194
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:21.240
Sometimes these platforms don't calculate the engagement rate entirely correctly so before you spend

195
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.490
a lot of money make sure that you run it independently on the auditor and then the last one is just

196
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.580
shout cart.

197
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.160
Same kind of thing here.

198
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.710
I think they're probably the largest because they do other systems as well and they're kind of useful

199
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.300
because they give you things like this.

200
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.840
Look over here it can turn off Twitter and I can search for specifically.

201
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:46.380
I want someone who gives me a shout out but also lets me change their bio link for a certain amount

202
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.240
of time so that actually can actually work pretty well.

203
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.490
One of the things you want to try out and see how it goes.

204
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:58.260
But I could go here and say tack and then right here we could say OK tech inventions they've 104 for

205
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.160
15 bucks now and need to see what their score is and all their brand new.

206
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.730
So that's a bit of a risk.

207
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:08.220
So I'd probably have to manually do the calculation but it's still check them out to see what they are.

208
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:14.100
So but here I can have two hour shout out and I can change their bio link directly to at my account

209
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.410
and I can do that for two hours for 17 bucks.

210
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.250
Now whether or not that works kind of just depends on the account and how you do it.

211
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.630
But it's worth checking it out.

212
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.710
I don't know exactly how you give a permanent shout out plus a bioweapon that doesn't really make any

213
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.560
sense because when it was reselling anything else.

214
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.260
But again check it out and tell me how it works.

215
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:36.030
All right hopefully that gives you a bit of an idea of what the rough cost scale is for paid shout outs

216
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.040
why you might use them and then how to calculate.

217
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.620
Really the only metric that matters in the end of the day is how much you pay per expected follower.

218
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.200
And later on in the follow longs I'll actually test some of these out just so you guys can see it or

219
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:48.790
buy it.

220
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:55.300
I'll go through it and then we'll see the traffic spike and see if it matches what I've expected before.

221
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.580
And actually interesting because then I can use a real baseline I can try it with one of these and then

222
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.720
get a percentage of how many people actually end up following me based on who engage with the posts

223
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.670
that will actually help me a lot in the long term.

224
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.000
All right guys.

225
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.680
That being said.

226
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.770
See you in the next lecture.
