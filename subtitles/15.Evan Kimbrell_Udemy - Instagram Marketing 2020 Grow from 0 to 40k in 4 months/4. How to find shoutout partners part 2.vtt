00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.350
All right.

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.220
So after you've exhausted kick and telegram and again it's kind of like digging for coal.

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.350
You see everybody you had a kid you can't get rid of there's what you probably find 10 years in a time

4
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.830
you'd have to get to take a telegram and say hi is useful doing this.

5
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.110
Your accounts that people can reach out to you once you actually starting your account ward.

6
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.200
The last thing you can do and this is kind of your last resort is someone you really really want to

7
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.580
work with them so that you can do it well and solicit a shout out.

8
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.710
So what you do is you would take a post you would post it and you attack them in a photo you type into

9
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.860
the Captain whatever way it's good to notify them and then you tax them on chances are bull knows they

10
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.100
don't probably know every single follow every single line but they probably notice when they get tagged

11
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.850
to hey.

12
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.470
So that's one way of building a relationship really setting your attention after you've had that start

13
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.350
process once you know there's work to direct message.

14
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.860
See if that works OK.

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.330
And telegram doesn't really work.

16
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.710
You could actually find them and they ignore you in which case yes message again.

17
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.170
But it's just one way of getting their attention.

18
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.380
With larger hundreds of hours a day.

19
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.630
So it's a good guess that they might not actually recognize you or even notice that you message them.

20
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.680
So that's one way of doing it.

21
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.410
Again last resort though.

22
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.950
OK.

23
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.190
After you done that you got qualified list of people that actually are interested and usually only reach

24
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.410
out when you want to shout.

25
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.260
You don't really pre-qualify them beforehand but you could do it that way if you wanted to you aren't

26
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.790
all people that are actually interested in what you have to do is qualify them on your own.

27
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.680
Need to figure out once you actually contact your own doing a shout.

28
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.970
Figure out whether or not their account is good.

29
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.080
I don't know whether or not they have a good account.

30
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.830
I mean do they have followers.

31
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.560
They think that's a bad thing.

32
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.740
What's their engagement.

33
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.190
Why.

34
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.070
That's another thing worth looking at.

35
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.510
You don't really want to work with someone that has terrible occasion where they fall or even if they

36
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.660
have millions and millions of followers.

37
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.320
So the best way I know doing this is to use two different tools.

38
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.510
So the first one that you can use is called.

39
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.840
So sawblade.

40
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.310
OK.

41
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.430
So what do you do when you got home.

42
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.310
It's FREE.

43
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.730
So then what I would do is bring a username from their account and that is technology.

44
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.470
OK.

45
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.640
And then all you have to do is search.

46
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.260
All right then we have a thread here it's clearly not Bloomberg's not that.

47
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.100
That Let's say I want to do technology that 4.2 million so click that.

48
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.670
OK.

49
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.180
Here we go.

50
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.610
Now I hope they're right.

51
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.920
We have a rating very quickly.

52
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.740
Who obviously is.

53
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.020
How active are they.

54
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.350
How good is your engagement relative to other similar accounts.

55
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.700
Now do you see the pictures they upload it.

56
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.850
How do you deal with fallers it get to me.

57
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.150
You know here's a detailed breakdown to see how many they've gained.

58
00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.880
How long did he lie.

59
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.680
Knows.

60
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.620
And you can see how their trajectory growing.

61
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.380
OK so that's the free version.

62
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.990
Now if you wanted to really draw down on it and because this is not accurate 100 some of the time but

63
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.870
it's one data point I think we're using.

64
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.720
So go to heighth auditor dot com.

65
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.690
They already have an account at the Manor.

66
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.600
They'll give you something like 10 free checks on the site so when you use the search engine they generate

67
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.990
a report their report gives you things like a rating and it will try to guess how many they have that

68
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.870
are fake.

69
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.810
So I can type in technology here and will populate.

70
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.520
See that's the thing was a quick check OK.

71
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.650
That generates a report and you just kind of have to sit back and relax because the accounts actually

72
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.250
take a long time to generate.

73
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.340
All right so after it takes its time to gather the information we get this.

74
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.260
OK so this cut group technology 69 out of 100 hundreds as good.

75
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.870
OK.

76
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.120
But I like the summary right here a considerable number of followers with a low gauge minority.

77
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.550
OK.

78
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.120
I mean look their followers.

79
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:13.720
OK so 25 percent are from India 5 percent from Russia in Tunisia Brazil you'll kind of notice that U.S.

80
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.440
is the largest market currently for Instagram.

81
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.050
So those are going to show up pretty much all the time in India just the general has 1.4 billion people.

82
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.690
And these are the other big developing countries that are large populations.

83
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.730
You can also probably look at smartphone penetration and this probably matches that decently well.

84
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.340
So of their audience type it says close to 10 percent are suspicious.

85
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.270
So that means half a million of them are questionable accounts are dead and it is just not real.

86
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.570
Right.

87
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.540
Here we have mass followers.

88
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.500
So these are people that constantly follow other people.

89
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.590
OK a lot of businesses do this and it's something that we all do because that's the strategy we use

90
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.430
every time we follow some old rock checking out their account we're not actually a consumer.

91
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.190
So how many of them follow that category are about half a million so we can almost knock off point nine

92
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.780
million that's still a pretty big account though so real people at 3.3 million are still pretty big

93
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.580
baller is reachability.

94
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.480
So 87 percent of followers have less than.

95
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.640
OK so what this basically means is that all of the followers they have.

96
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.840
Do those followers follow a lot of people that follow other people that use of their feeds or an uptick

97
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.600
really quickly.

98
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.370
So your odds of reaching them just get harder and harder.

99
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.630
So this will just as average.

100
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.640
That is pretty much the average.

101
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.040
The quality of their followers says Very good.

102
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.650
Kind of just depends on your interpretation 77 percent I guess would be pretty good especially in larger

103
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.530
accounts and a smaller account then you'd be a little kind of curious where other suspicious accounts

104
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.460
came from.

105
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.940
Then we have things like engagement rate.

106
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.980
Their engagement rate is below 1 percent and that's bad.

107
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.710
OK so you can see right here that they give a similar account as 1.4 percent.

108
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.820
Now how they calculate that.

109
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.660
I'm not entirely sure but it's usually pretty accurate.

110
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.770
So that's something that we would be kind of concerned with they're kind of in the lower end of the

111
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.580
bucket as you can see here tapers off very quickly so some of the more elite ones are up here.

112
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:24.860
But other than that it looks like most of their account look likes and comments are not from bots.

113
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.370
They're usually pretty good likes to comment ratio.

114
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.720
That's you know you can get your own interpretation from that.

115
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.160
It just kind of depends on the call the actions are using the Post they're making but I don't usually

116
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.280
think a whole lot about it.

117
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.190
Then you can see the likers language.

118
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.580
So you can tell 66 percent is English.

119
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.400
So if you had an English account than my own but half of them follow that.

120
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.510
So.

121
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.650
So what I would say is you could probably glean from this that if you wanted to do a shout out with

122
00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:00.320
them and they give you a price or a number of shouted saying for you in return I would discount it a

123
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.530
little bit just because their engagement is not that great.

124
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.920
1 percent pretty low.

125
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:11.230
So I'd almost treat this 4.3 million person account more like a two and a half or two.

126
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.580
Still a massive account and it's still going to give you a lot of attention.

127
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:21.190
It's just that they're kind of punching below their weight to use in a phrase from boxing.

128
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.180
OK guys.

129
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.000
So that is pretty much the process you go through right.

130
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.080
You identify the ones that do shout outs.

131
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.170
Then you just kind of track down the list for how you contact them.

132
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.910
OK.

133
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.870
And then you just run them through a program like this to see whether or not they're worth it.

134
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:44.330
You use this in the actual conversation with them the negotiation and say you know beforehand whether

135
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:52.400
or not you really really want to pay for or trade for a shout out based on their stats or hey you can

136
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.450
find sometimes the ones who said Jonker pounce and that might kill the conversation for you.

137
00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.230
The point is you don't want to waste your time and waste your money working at accounts that just don't

138
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.660
work.

139
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.040
All right guys that's it for now.

140
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.070
We'll see you in the next election.
