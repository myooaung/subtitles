Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,130
All right.
2

3
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,500
Last lecture we talked about writing captions.
3

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,960
Now we're going to round that out
by talking about calls to action.
4

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,550
Yes.
5

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,310
Those things that we exhaustively talked about in the
profile section of the course are back, and like before,
6

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,990
they are muy importante.
7

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,360
So captions are great and all, right?
Real inspiring, change the world stuff,
8

9
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,120
So captions are great and all, right?
Real inspiring, change the world stuff,
9

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,590
but human beings, being humans, are rarely going to
respond just by themselves without any prompting.
10

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,850
It's like when you meet a stranger and you know
nothing about each other, it's really hard to start a
11

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,690
conversation if you have nothing to start with.
12

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,620
Now, what if you were talking to that stranger and
someone jumped out of a bush and said, "What's your
13

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,260
favorite movie?" or "Ever been skydiving?"
14

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,920
I don't know.
15

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,480
You can kind of tell I don't go on a lot of dating shows.
16

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,890
The point is that little spark right there starts the
process, breaks the seal, if you will, and makes
17

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,940
the likelihood of further conversation that much more likely.
18

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,530
That's what we're doing with our call to actions.
19

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,500
We want them to engage.
20

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,300
So if you were reading this post, what question
would you feel utterly irresistible to answer?
21

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,600
So, me, for instance, I have a
traumatically bad sense of direction,
22

23
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,640
so if the post said something like,
23

24
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,290
"Like this post if you avoid going to Target
because you know you're going to get lost,"
24

25
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,240
I would reach out from whatever phone coma
I'm in and hard press the *** out of that button.
25

26
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,750
Usually, when you do this, you want one of a few things,
you want likes, usually gathered by asking if people
26

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:31,050
agree with the post or statement, and to show it by
liking it, or you might get comments by asking them
27

28
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,820
a question that you want them to respond to.
28

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,820
Now, if you're really gutsy, you can
go for some advanced calls to action.
29

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,320
You can, if you're really good, get people
to tag others in your post comments as well.
30

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,430
Usually, you see this by asking something along the
lines of "Tag a friend if they blank" and the blank
31

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,780
corresponds to the post.
32

33
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,720
Now, it could be as simple as a product post that says
"Tag a friend that would like this or need this,"
33

34
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,480
especially if this something helps a friend out, or it's something endearing, or it's something that you both can laugh about.
34

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,100
especially if this something helps a friend out, or it's something endearing, or it's something that you both can laugh about.
35

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,350
You tag them if let's say you posted some app that
helps you remember things and you said "Tag a friend
36

37
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,620
that you love, but they can't remember your birthday."
37

38
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,590
Kind of saucy.
38

39
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,300
Someone else would probably do that. Now, you wouldn't
tag your friend to a photo of Viagra, on the other
39

40
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,730
hand, unless you're just a mean person.
40

41
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,800
Another angle would be like posting a motivational
quote and then saying "Tag a friend that lives this every
41

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,270
day," and then you get to tag a friend with
essentially a warm and fuzzy comment.
42

43
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,150
Think about it.
43

44
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,150
What would you tag a friend for?
44

45
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,360
Something positive that can be an indirect compliment,
45

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,670
something that's funny that just lets you reminisce
with a friend, something that's actually useful for a
46

47
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,680
friend because you're helping them out, or even just like tagging
a friend you think would agree with [blank statement].
47

48
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,100
friend because you're helping them out, or even just like tagging
a friend you think would agree with [blank statement].
48

49
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,190
People like agreeing with one another.
49

50
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,740
Now, why is this an advanced call to action?
50

51
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,360
Well, because it's like the bonus round, it's harder
to pull off, but if you do, it's double points.
51

52
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,730
Tags mean more views, more views means
more comments and more follows.
52

53
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,750
And these are friends that probably will like your stuff.
53

54
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,540
What's even harder than getting someone
to tag their friends in your post?
54

55
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,120
Getting someone to repost your photo
or repost their own version of the photo.
55

56
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,890
OK, this does happen, but usually it's only with bigger accounts that have been doing this for a much longer time.
56

57
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,010
OK, this does happen, but usually it's only with bigger accounts that have been doing this for a much longer time.
57

58
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,730
Reposting a photo takes a little bit of
know-how and quite a bit of motivation.
58

59
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,960
But if you have a really engaged audience, then it is
a great way to get your posts spread out, especially
59

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,340
if you remembered to always tag
your photos with your account logo.
60

61
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,890
Reposting their own remix is even rarer and usually
only works when you're running something like a
61

62
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,890
contest, so we'll focus on them
when we talk about that later on.
62

63
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,120
So that's the buffet of options.
63

64
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,230
Go for likes, go for comments, go for tags, or go for reposts.
64

65
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,720
This is really one of the easier parts of posting, and
if you spend enough time on Instagram, you'll start
65

66
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,200
to test out what works and see
what others are doing that works.
66

67
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,040
You want likes?
67

68
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,660
OK, well, here are some common templates. Like if
you agree. Like if you love [blank] - it could be like,
68

69
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,720
OK, well, here are some common templates. Like if
you agree. Like if you love [blank] - it could be like,
69

70
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,960
like if you love your mother, or like if you love ice cream.
70

71
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,430
Want to know more? Like the photo.
71

72
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,940
iOS or Android? Like for iOS,
72

73
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,450
comment for Android. Like if you want to [blank] in
five years. Like if you watched this show last night.
73

74
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,860
I like it personally when it says "Like if you don't do
[blank]" and then the blank is something terrible like,
74

75
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,020
I like it personally when it says "Like if you don't do
[blank]" and then the blank is something terrible like,
75

76
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:36,100
like if you don't forget to call your mom on your mother's
day, or you can imagine possibly worse things.
76

77
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,360
The more creative you get, the more successful you'll be with this.
77

78
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,270
There are some pretty hilarious ones where it's just an image,
78

79
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,290
and by liking it you'll give that person a weird face.
79

80
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,320
You can imagine that the post that said "Give
Donald Trump a frown" got a whole lot of likes.
80

81
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,670
You can imagine that the post that said "Give
Donald Trump a frown" got a whole lot of likes.
81

82
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,510
It needs to be relevant to your post and it shouldn't be generic, unless you honestly just can't think of something else.
82

83
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,650
It needs to be relevant to your post and it shouldn't be generic, unless you honestly just can't think of something else.
83

84
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,030
Some call to action though is going to be better than nothing.
84

85
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,050
If you're going for comments, well, here are
some common ones you'll see and they work.
85

86
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,390
Let us know what you think.
86

87
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,420
OK, it's kind of weak tea, but it's like the default.
87

88
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,860
Like I said, better than nothing.
88

89
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,540
Let us know if you agree.
89

90
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,350
Let us know if you think [blank], and the blank here is
going to be like a statement that was in the caption.
90

91
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:21,770
Let us know if you've had a similar experience, or comment
and tell us your favorite [blank]. Anything that
91

92
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,430
has to do with the user talking about themselves is usually gold.
92

93
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,010
Now, did you see this show?
93

94
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,090
What did you like or not like about it?
94

95
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,620
What's your favorite way a guy does blah blah blah blah blah?
95

96
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,330
Or hey, get people to write content for you with
96

97
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
"Tell us your funniest [blank] story in the comments."
97

98
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,140
Now, of course, you don't have to use a CTA for engagement
only, if you prefer a business interest, well then you
98

99
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,390
can use it to tell people to go to your website,
go to an e-mail address, or go buy something.
99

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,830
If you're trying to make money in your Instagram
itself, then you can say things like "Direct message
100

101
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,080
me" in your call to action, and say something like
101

102
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,360
"Business inquiries" and then put your e-mail
or just say "DM me for business inquiries."
102

103
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,060
It might look a little tacky, but it can get you a lot
of connections that will help you later on when
103

104
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,560
you need to share your account and get other people
to help you get followers. Now, in the resources,
104

105
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,100
as always, we've compiled a list of
call the actions that we think are great.
105

106
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,280
Use it if you're stuck or just need some inspiration.
106

107
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,360
We've also linked to some profiles that we think really do it well.
107

108
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,250
Now, I think this part is the easiest and
it just takes a couple of seconds to do.
108

109
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,510
Reread your caption and your post and just think to yourself,
109

110
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,080
"If I read this, what would I respond to?"
110

111
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,830
Don't be afraid to try something out.
If it doesn't work, then just move on.
111

112
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,640
How do you know if it doesn't work? Well, either
112

113
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:46,300
no one does it, or the comments or likes would be
considered under the Instagram average of that 2%
113

114
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,720
baseline engagement.
114

115
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,060
Or it could be more.
115

116
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:55,030
More accurately, under your average,
because it depends heavily on the industry.
116

117
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,410
You could have a better average and so
being under the 2% is just not a good gauge.
117

118
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,000
OK, guys, that's it for now.
118

119
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,910
Questions, comments, just post in the group discussion.
119

120
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,760
Make sure to screenshot posts if you're actually referring
to them. Otherwise, see you in the next lecture.
120

121
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,530
Make sure to screenshot posts if you're actually referring
to them. Otherwise, see you in the next lecture.
