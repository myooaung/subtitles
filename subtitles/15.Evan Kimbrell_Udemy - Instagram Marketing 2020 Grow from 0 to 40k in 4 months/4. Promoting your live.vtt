Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.870
OK so this lecture what we do is just go through a quick little routine for promoting your and scam

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.550
live so you can make a story really fast and then how to convert that into a post or the other way around.

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.330
Very simple.

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.110
Personally I think that I like to post these like an hour before just because if I posted the day before

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.750
it really just depends how important that is whether or not the person or members to come back to your

7
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.000
account at the time of I think if you do it like an hour or even 30 minutes or 20 minutes before well

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.430
not as many people will see your post breaks.

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.670
People aren't checking in on it.

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.760
The people that do see your posts are much more likely to stick around and check it out.

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.720
OK so what I'm going to do is just do a story post and then try to convert that into a regular post.

12
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:53.400
So originally I did a poll a story post where I asked people to tell me specifically what item they

13
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.830
wanted.

14
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.230
And so I gave them two options and there was an Amazon echo or instax camera and actually godsake is

15
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.440
cheaper for like 40 bucks.

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.440
So let's see the results were 52 for him the echo daunts 37 for the instax 6.

17
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.120
So that's pretty easy for me honestly.

18
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.840
What I can do now if I wanted to is I could share this result or I might actually do.

19
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.290
So I'll share this result to my story.

20
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.000
So I'll send it to my story there.

21
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.320
So now I have a little story Delia.

22
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.750
So people can see oh hey this is what people voted for and then the next thing I'll do is create a story

23
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.300
with just the Amazon echo and I'll say live in you know an hour or something like that.

24
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.100
So I'll say live in probably 45 minutes that might give me enough time to do this.

25
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.240
So find the original image I have the echo dot.

26
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.400
There we go.

27
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.450
Squeeze it.

28
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.890
Great.

29
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.360
Now what I'll do is just put give away in 45 minutes.

30
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.830
So double tap if you remember this from when we were doing stories.

31
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.240
It works pretty much sitting in an exact way I'll put live in 45 minutes.

32
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.940
Now as a story this might be a little confusing but whatever we'll do with it I'll put the time on it.

33
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.330
Sure.

34
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.800
I put the date right there.

35
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.370
See Amazon EKU dot great tennis and blue something that maybe fits with it for the most part.

36
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.720
Then I might just want to tag my account so people can go directly to it or at least know that that's

37
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.570
where it's going to be and also put this with a hash tag so i can get a little more exposure.

38
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.750
So I mean like any tech giveaway.

39
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.990
See that's the thing.

40
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.530
Give away.

41
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.130
Yeah.

42
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.830
OK.

43
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.180
I think it's probably small enough to that it's probably useful.

44
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.000
So I think that looks pretty good.

45
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.150
I'll save that then what I want to do is send to my story share my story.

46
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.000
There we go.

47
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.160
And then probably what I'll do is just convert this into a regular post.

48
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.250
So now we have this is a photo and as a post I'll just put it like this.

49
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.270
So there you go.

50
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.330
I mean it's not the most beautiful thing in the world but it gets the point across.

51
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.040
I'll put this as a regular post and then delete it pretty much immediately later so that doesn't screw

52
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.460
up the pattern on my page.

53
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.650
So we go next great Whatever next.

54
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.180
OK.

55
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.630
So at a location where I'm at a give away at is Eastern time as my standard.

56
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.610
All right great man all terrorism movies.

57
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.440
Nothing like celebratory but Santa Claus because that's funny.

58
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.590
OK then we'll hit OK.

59
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.360
And then pretty much that's it.

60
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.150
I get to share this.

61
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.990
And then I going to go and the comments of hashtags just tap tap tap tap on Echo whatever blah just

62
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.710
so I can bring more people to my page.

63
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.180
So here we go.

64
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.830
And I think that looks perfectly fine.

65
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.850
And then I'll put a bunch Hastur eggs.

66
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.690
I would add more.

67
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.420
But same time I'm a little concerned that I'm just me grabbing a bunch of freebie people that aren't

68
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.040
really going to follow the account.

69
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.830
So I'm going to keep it simple with this and I'll do my usual pressure with the mowgli's.

70
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.620
So that should be enough to get some people's attention.

71
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:22.020
They all have a story and a giveaway post and I should be ready to go live in 30 minutes 40 minutes.

72
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.220
We'll check in with you guys then all right before we're about to do this.

73
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.610
All right.

74
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.040
See you then.
