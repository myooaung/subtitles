00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.140
Herger is a about giveaways also known as sweepstakes right now generally speaking I think there are

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.840
three types of giveaways that you can run on Instagram or at least I've seen that have been successful.

3
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.150
These are not by any means a comprehensive list.

4
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.520
There's other ways you can do it.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.650
But generally speaking fall into three different categories.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.880
Number one stuff.

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.160
Number two intangible stuff like shout outs and number three promotional stuff.

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.560
Now explain the first one.

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.210
Giving away stuff.

10
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.570
Well it's pretty straight forward.

11
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.570
You can give away something that your audience potentially wants.

12
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.830
You're a fashion brand.

13
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.630
Maybe you give away makeup maybe you give away a bag maybe you give away something that you personally

14
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.200
like or have an affinity for.

15
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.470
If you're in tack maybe you buy something that you covered and give that away.

16
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.410
That's something that we add innovations Asian will probably do in the future.

17
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.840
Pick something that's under a certain price tag and give that away assuming that the post when we covered

18
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.830
it was actually interesting.

19
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.780
That's pretty much the simplest way you can get with it.

20
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.810
I think that you can also give away cash which I call this stuff but it's not nearly as useful.

21
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.580
You don't get the same participation.

22
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.100
Remember if you give away say an Amazon echo like we did the people who are going be interested in that

23
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.040
are going to be people who like technology.

24
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.470
If you're a technology account you'd benefit from that.

25
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.230
You just give away 50 bucks that people are going to interested in.

26
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.070
Are everybody and not just people who are interested in tax you have a lot of people have no interest

27
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.690
in tax.

28
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.710
And those are kind of worthless followers.

29
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.350
Those are the types of people that add to your follower account but they don't like your posts therefore

30
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.700
they lower your engagement rate which makes Instagram think that you have a low quality following.

31
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.980
Now you always have to have a mind towards making this sustainable one time.

32
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.490
Giveaways are not particularly successful.

33
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.610
Generally speaking accounts do giveaways frequently and get a lot of traction and attention for them

34
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.610
are ones that do it repeatedly on a consistent schedule.

35
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.080
That being said you have to make sure that whatever you're giving away is sustainable and worth it.

36
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.490
And that brings me to number two which is intangible stuff.

37
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.030
Generally speaking if you give away something that doesn't have a monetary value that's a great deal.

38
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.220
Even if you don't have people that are interested in it save versus traditional actual material stuff

39
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.890
it didn't cost you anything.

40
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.490
So you can use this strategy as often as you want.

41
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.000
I'll give you an example.

42
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.890
Some larger accounts will give away shout outs.

43
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.850
Now what they'll say is first person to do whatever or or tag a friend to get entered to do this or

44
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.900
like this photo or reposes photo in order to be entered to win and they get a shout out now that appeals

45
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.610
obviously to people who want to grow their account followings which there are a lot of people out there

46
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.030
who are really interested in growing their total follower account.

47
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.130
Now if you're a big enough account that's actually something that might be worth that tiny little bit

48
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.650
of effort to do whatever it is you ask them to do and for you shouting out to them does nothing.

49
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.250
I mean honestly it's not hard at all.

50
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.180
It's really easy to just throw up a story you can write it in text mode on Instagram and just go and

51
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.640
tag them really quickly and that's it.

52
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.620
It's not something that's detrimental to your account in any way because you're actually promoting your

53
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.660
fans which is what people actually like to see as long as you don't take it too far.

54
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.960
But there are other ways you can do this.

55
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.370
If you're a software company give away a free account to your software.

56
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.620
Right.

57
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.720
All the unit cost of that one account are really nothing.

58
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.780
So you give those away all day long.

59
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.620
You're an author.

60
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.670
Why not give away a free e-book to your book or you know even more specifically you get a signed version

61
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.710
of your book or something like that with a value that you're adding isn't necessarily the dollar value.

62
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.660
So that's number two.

63
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.710
The intangible stuff and that leads me to number three which I think are the all time best possible

64
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.340
giveaway you can do which is sponsored stuff now sponsored stuff.

65
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.640
Basically what you're doing is you're asking another company or account to give you something for free.

66
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.750
You can give away.

67
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.340
This is incredibly common.

68
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.230
The bit of it here obviously is that you get to give away something that could be very valuable to your

69
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.770
following and you don't have to pay for it.

70
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.120
That's the great part about it.

71
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.160
Oftentimes what you can do is if you are someone who does promotional deals like in the previous sections

72
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.860
where we talked about ways to make money on Instagram if you can't for some reason get someone to buy

73
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.040
a shout out or you can agree on terms.

74
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.980
Oftentimes you can just say why don't we do a giveaway for whatever it is the item that you're trying

75
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.730
to sell right now innovation station by negotiating with their account called my swag.

76
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.420
And originally they agreed to pay $150 for a post.

77
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.220
Now I realize that they're actually making a technology that could be interesting so maybe I'll just

78
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.100
ask them to give me one other square.

79
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.820
And I'll give that away.

80
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.210
So it's kind of a dual benefit.

81
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.910
I get to reward my followers and they get essentially very cheap promotion for their account I guarantee

82
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.570
their swag is not more than $50.

83
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.790
Now generally speaking with giveaways you still have to follow a very rigid set of rules attached and

84
00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.710
the resources will link you to where and Instagram says there are guidelines for how to run giveaways

85
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.520
it's a little tricky sometimes you have to make sure that you are very well-defined about your rules

86
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.800
to enter when it starts when it ends when they're going to get the prize if they win.

87
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.950
How are they going to know if they've won.

88
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.000
Like usual you always have to be prepared for people that no matter what will complain there's always

89
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.040
people who complain about lotteries being rigged and sweepstakes and giveaways very similar so they're

90
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.980
you know they're not immune to this type of complaint.

91
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.450
We did a giveaway with an evasion station.

92
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.480
I still have people complaining because they thought that they qualify better.

93
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.990
Right.

94
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.940
The rules were that you had to answer a riddle and you had to do it first.

95
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.430
And it was pretty funny because two or three people thought they answered first but they weren't even

96
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.970
close.

97
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.500
They were like number six or seven.

98
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.280
All they had to do is scroll up.

99
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.210
So don't underestimate the density of your followers.

100
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.460
All right guys that's pretty much it for giveaways.

101
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.510
Do you want to do this.

102
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.110
Try to go towards the higher R-N.Y side of this.

103
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.310
Personally I love sponsored giveaways.

104
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.190
There are a win win for everybody that is take a little bit of time to actually set up and then if you

105
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.880
can't do that trying to give away something intangible You can shout out if you're a large enough account.

106
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.370
Work out really well and then pass that if you want to you can give away stuff to make sure that you

107
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.080
don't have to do it consistently which means that whatever you're giving away needs to be within your

108
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.470
budget to be something that's sustainable that you can do consistently.

109
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:27.170
Also keep in mind just in general give away and you need to do these repeatedly before you actually

110
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.780
get a set group of people that routinely show up routinely give you engagement and comments that allow

111
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.580
you to then get more attention to your account which is ultimately what we're trying to do at the end

112
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.330
of the day.

113
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:44.360
Next year I'll show you the nitty gritty of one of the giveaways that we did and then we'll wrap up

114
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.080
this action.

115
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.360
All right.

116
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.870
See you then.
