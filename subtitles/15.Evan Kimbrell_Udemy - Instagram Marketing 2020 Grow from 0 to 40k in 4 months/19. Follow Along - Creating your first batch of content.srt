1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,710
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:01,980
All right.

3
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,780
So got to follow a long lecture.

4
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:10,590
What we're going to talk about in this fall along with my shoulder is I'm going to update you on my

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,930
progress with creating my first 10 posts OK so I talked about this before that you want to get at least

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,810
10 posts before you then go forward and start doing some of the growth strategies some of the follow

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,300
unfollowed things that we do later on.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,430
So that's kind of the goal the line in the sand that we want to go for I think nine is probably fine

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,480
because usually displays three in a row.

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,570
But either way that's kind of like the rule of thumb.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,890
So what I want you to follow.

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,250
OK.

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,330
So you want to me in another lecture create the Nano would video.

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:49,680
And I did that in Final Cut Pro and it took me about about 45 minutes to an hour or something like that.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,300
I had to go back and tweak it.

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,090
So I spent about 10 more minutes going back and tweaking it.

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,590
And for the most part it works.

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,850
I put music in.

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,810
I think that's perfectly fine.

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,550
But what I wanted to do is standardize my posts a little bit more and you'll notice as I go forward

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,910
my posts are going to evolve and to get more polished they're going to get more consistent.

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,610
I'm kind of experimenting a little bit with it right now and that's one of the big benefits of using

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,840
for instance like the dummy account.

24
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:22,980
OK it's a little bit of an update what I've been doing is I've been using Dropbox to store all of my

25
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,590
photos and videos for posts.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,870
And then I've been cataloguing them with a number right next to them.

27
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,300
OK.

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,150
So that's just for later on when we get to bringing in people to help us automate this.

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,020
Then we can just use code.

30
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:42,090
So if it's a video I can say for for video subscription video the five urpmi if I want to go to the

31
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,930
photos.

32
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,370
OK.

33
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,870
So that's pretty useful for just keeping track of stuff it also gives you a good easy way to take a

34
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:54,990
glimpse and see how much I have done so I can see whether or not the trough is full and I can start

35
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,940
posting or whatever.

36
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,920
All samples are a more complicated process.

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,350
Moving on later on in the lectures.

38
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,880
But for now I just got to get my 10.

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,400
So this is a pretty good preliminary structure now where I've been getting my content before I talked

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,160
about it a little bit.

41
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,460
But spring wise is probably the biggest one.

42
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,220
I sucked it up and has paid for a subscription.

43
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,820
Before that I was using their daily update emails because they do a curation of.

44
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,420
They select some of the technologies they like.

45
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,620
I've also been getting them from Mashable too because they've attacked in science section and they often

46
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,480
just have some quirky weird thing that has just come out.

47
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,100
So I've been flagging some of them there.

48
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,660
Most of using Business Insider.

49
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,770
Because they do the same thing over here in tech and you can also find some of them in life.

50
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,920
And between those three I found more than enough and I've started writing some of them down.

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,950
But I took some of the easier ones and then I just started going through the process of putting them

52
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,370
together.

53
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,660
I've been leaning a little bit more on images over video into my videos.

54
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,710
Right so my content strategy I'm sorry was going to be mainly videos and I'm going to try photos but

55
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,000
I was kind of pessimistic about how those are going to perform.

56
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,250
I think they're good as fillers.

57
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,670
So for videos I think that's going to be the gold standard.

58
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,360
And I think that's what I'm going to try to make most of my content out.

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,810
So if you see the intelligent jacket.

60
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,700
So this is one made it works pretty well right.

61
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,630
And this is an image and then it should cut to a video.

62
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,820
Yeah right so it's a video.

63
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,910
What I've been running into is just that when I cover something it's a question of whether or not I

64
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,530
want to use stock footage that's not very relevant but it's video which is more engaging or do I use

65
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,020
an image that's directly relevant to the company in the product and it's just not as engaging the way

66
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,850
I've been kind of getting around it it's just using more images but doing more of these like zoom motions.

67
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,010
I showed you to do that before in Final Cut Pro.

68
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,880
There's other really easy ways to do it there's even apps that do it for you.

69
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,890
So that's kind of what I've been doing.

70
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,840
Now you'll notice that the text on here is different from the Nano would one.

71
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,800
So if you pull up the Nano would see the new movie that was that one.

72
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,120
OK so I've been just trying different things out.

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,930
So what I did was this is what I first started with.

74
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:12,690
It was a little generic and I didn't think it fit the colors of my count so I actually just reach out

75
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,280
to a designer who have worked with before in the past.

76
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,320
If you ever see the become a product manager intro scene he did that.

77
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,250
He's helped with a lot of the promos.

78
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:31,400
And so we put together a set of templates for text that kind of have similar animations like this.

79
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,240
And that's kind of setting the stage for later on when I start to mass produce these.

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,410
But this will help me keep consistency with my posts and also just a little bit sharper.

81
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,460
You can see it kind of does this like outline then it pops up and then I kind of used a similar transition.

82
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,750
I can't remember the name of my head but see how it changes like it's like a flare.

83
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,600
It turns the next one.

84
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,250
I just liked it because it put the purple color in there and that's really useful because it matches

85
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,560
again my colors.

86
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,190
So if you want to do templates we're going to talk more about this.

87
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:13,010
But I just found this person on video Pixi a long time ago on one of my project video Pixi is just a

88
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,970
standard freelancing Web site but they dedicate themselves to videos.

89
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:23,900
So what I had done before was just asked to create a bumper to bumper is just a little three to five

90
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,280
second segment that shows at the very beginning of video and then at the very end because of like bumpers

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,210
on each end and you see them on YouTube all the time.

92
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,780
And so I just started working with that person so it worked out fine.

93
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,350
But if I wanted to find a new person I could just do that again and just post it again.

94
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:47,410
And I think we worked out a deal for $300 to do that plus an outro to the outro will look like this

95
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,110
when I actually get it working.

96
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,980
Now I say outro because it's going to pop up the very end.

97
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,530
So has that same kind of flash.

98
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,720
And then as a call to action and as a rocket it turns into the logo that rocket drives me nuts.

99
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,290
But we're working on that and eventually we'll get to a point where it doesn't look like it's a South

100
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:10,130
Park cartoon anyway so I think that will make kind of the branding part of this a lot easier and will

101
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,270
pop up and it will be a lot more useful now for the photos.

102
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,400
All I've done is just been using Draney quote.

103
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,310
So Draney Colo.

104
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:26,870
And then I just go to this and I type in innovation and I've been making these very quickly on Kanva.

105
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,050
So I want to get to my 10 quickly so I can just get a move on and start testing things out.

106
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,460
And so this is a one easy way of kind of filling in some of the gaps.

107
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,360
Right so I put this one by Steve Jobs and this one by Dean Kamen we made this one and one of the lectures

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,910
that Dean common one but these two and I'll probably make a couple more.

109
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:52,940
What I want to do with my lay out is do one photo two videos and then have the photos in the middle

110
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,150
so the middle section so it kind of actually looks like a visual pattern.

111
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,340
That's what I'm shooting for.

112
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,200
So right now I have two images and then I believe the readthrough seven are completely finished.

113
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,200
So I have seven and I probably need two more videos.

114
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,940
And then one more photo.

115
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,200
Right.

116
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,350
And then I should be able to post my 10.

117
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:21,080
And I've been just doing these in Final Cut Pro the templates that I'm working with were in what's called

118
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,210
after effects.

119
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,920
And I think later on when we get to automation We'll cover that a little bit like how if you have an

120
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,690
after effects template it's kind of obscure.

121
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,700
I mean there's a lot different ways someone can make a template for you.

122
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,060
So yeah I mean this is pretty much it.

123
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,820
I've been writing all of my content here in Bear.

124
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,000
So for the Nano would we sell that one before so like high moment.

125
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,000
So if you wanted to watch high moment this one.

126
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,190
So looks like this.

127
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:53,960
It's an app that I guess is for people posting things that they're grateful for and so used a lot of

128
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,820
the assets from the company itself.

129
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,020
But for the captions I had to write them out right.

130
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:06,080
So I just went and read about it and then I just kind of figured out what I wanted to say and a series

131
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,120
of six captions and then I'm kind of experimenting with different types of captions.

132
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:16,190
So there's about 100 words I'm trying to give a more like a bigger picture of what it is and not trying

133
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,260
to go too in-depth with this but I don't want to be the person who puts one sentence and the last thing

134
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,330
was a call action and this is going to be a total experiment till the last video in the entire course

135
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,340
because you just have to figure out what works.

136
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,190
So I think do you think an app can change a person's mood.

137
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,140
I think it's sufficiently broad enough that enough people will say yes or no.

138
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,650
OK.

139
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:42,560
Yes I've been doing that and then with the photos what I think I'm just going to do is put the top five

140
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:49,130
interesting facts about the person who post who made the quote and I put that into the full caption

141
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,900
to the actual caption.

142
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,410
Try that out.

143
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,610
See how it works.

144
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,740
We will know as soon as we get past our tenants are posting consistently.

145
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,210
But for now that's where I'm at.

146
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,350
I'll tell you guys later on when I get my test done.

147
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,700
