00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.710
Tigger is welcome back.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.740
So that's actually going to do is we're going to talk about two major categories of competitions and

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.620
I'm going to kind of divide a line between them and use that as a way to better understand what your

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.570
options are.

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.970
Now the last lecture I said we're going to break down the different categories.

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.620
And quite frankly if you spend enough time on in Sacramento they kind of fall into two different categories.

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.570
You have competitions and then you have giveaways or alternatively you will call those sweepstakes.

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.100
Now whether or not there is a huge difference between these two or without the overlap doesn't really

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.640
matter.

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.800
This is mainly just so that it's easier to conceptualize them.

11
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.650
Now competition is typically something where you ask your followers to do something in order to enter

12
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.900
into a competition.

13
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.430
And at some point it's like judged a giveaway.

14
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:56.130
On the other hand generally implies that there is some prize for a very minimal entry into it kind of

15
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.890
like a sweepstakes if you like a sweepstakes for instance.

16
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.610
Typically that's says like if you sign up or give us your name you're entered to win very low entry

17
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.720
but also very low possibility of winning whereas a competition would be the top 10 people to do the

18
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.920
best at blank will be entered to win or will win some prize.

19
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.840
What are the other primary differences between these two is that if you get into a competition you have

20
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.600
to plan this pretty much in advance.

21
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.290
It's very hard to do this upfront because you have to create enough Klammer or Baugh's in order to get

22
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.580
people to jump over that hump of doing whatever it is that you want them to do.

23
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.740
Whereas a giveaway.

24
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.700
Honestly you can do those kind of last second if you watch our Instagram live section and you saw I

25
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.370
did a giveaway and I planned it 24 hours in advance so it was literally it.

26
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.840
I posted a story the day before with a poll and then I just did it the next day.

27
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.660
Now there are relative advantages to both so you need to keep this in mind.

28
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.690
Typically speaking of the competition it's going to cost you more.

29
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.030
Whatever it is that you're giving away it's going to need to be higher value.

30
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.900
Why.

31
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.460
Well the threshold for someone to get into this is just going to be quite a bit higher give you an example.

32
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.850
You know I think a competition might be meant.

33
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.320
Dotcom did a competition where they wanted people to post photos of some financial moment in their life

34
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.020
and then put a hash tag.

35
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.450
OK.

36
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.870
Now contrast that to a giveaway where someone just gives away a pair of shoes and they post on their

37
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:36.320
Instagram account and the first person to tag friends wins or Tag a friend to enter.

38
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.730
So generally speaking competitions are a little more highbrow but they're harder to pull off.

39
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.430
And you have to put a little more money and effort into them.

40
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.590
Competitions also are great for what we call UGC user generated content.

41
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.240
Oftentimes at competitions.

42
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.780
People will ask their followers to make their own posts like that meant example.

43
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.020
Ask people to make their own posts showing them doing something related to finance.

44
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.890
This obviously has a side benefit to it which is that there are going to post it on their own feeds

45
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.710
which gets you access to their followers.

46
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.320
It's also pretty interesting because you can really use a lot of that UGC later on and you see a lot

47
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.410
of accounts like we covered FedEx before their entire count is primarily user generated content and

48
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.230
they get a lot of it through running these competitions.

49
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.450
Now give away on the other hand it's generally cheaper you can get away with doing it for literally

50
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.180
anything and you could do it for $10 20 bucks or even something that doesn't have a monetary value but

51
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.520
it's somehow valuable to your followers.

52
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.030
But at the same time you have to understand that the type of attention this is going to attract is generally

53
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.510
going to be a much wider group of people but they're not exactly people that are absolutely interested

54
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.420
in your account or what you're doing.

55
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.840
There's a tendency online that anytime you have a giveaway or sweepstakes people just will flock to

56
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.820
it regardless of whether or not they like what you're doing.

57
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.120
So you are a software for programmers you're in a competition where you gave away a really fancy keyboard.

58
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.960
A lot of people just go and enter that and you know you might get a follow or like from that person

59
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.550
which could be good for your engagement but is that person really someone that you want to follow your

60
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.240
account.

61
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.500
So it's a question oftentimes of quantity versus quality or in the next lecture what we're going to

62
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.390
do is we're going to dive a little bit into competitions.

63
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.110
The harder ones that have the more upside potential.

64
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.390
But in general are just going to cost you more money and have a higher threshold to enter.

65
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.410
All right guys see you next lecture.
