1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,890
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,990
All right we've got another one of those manual's sessions where I'm going to walk you through the user

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,940
interface of Instagram.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,960
This time to focus on the sections of the app where you can kind of create your own content.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,450
Really it's more for tweaking your own content but for some people who will be taking videos on their

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,590
phone or photos on their phone.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,930
They do have some embedded tools for doing a decent job with that.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,520
So that's we're going to talk about so that you're not clueless when it comes to the interface when

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,040
you get into posting actual stuff.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,170
No actually I'm talking about the posting page itself.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,190
So I get that later but we'll get everything up until that point.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,610
OK.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,670
Now if you have an Instagram account and you posted before PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD this lecture.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,970
If you get bored it is your own fault.

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,360
This is for people who are absolute beginners.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,470
I've said this several times.

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,330
OK so let's just open it up and ZERO go.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,700
So open up Instagram will do it on both Android and the U.S. So it'll open you up and the library is

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,520
optional.

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,450
Last photo that you took.

21
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,170
For the most part the user interface kind of the same here.

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,620
They call it a library in Iowa.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,440
And on Android they call a gallery.

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,510
I don't know if there's a difference.

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,800
OK so first things first.

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,200
At the bottom you have library photo video gallery photo video.

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,550
Well this is for as if you wanted to take an actual photo or an actual video.

28
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:29,400
So if I wanted to get an actual photo ID photo and look there's my camera with me.

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,270
I can do that if I wanted to.

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,900
And then I only get a video.

31
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:39,600
Same thing it just automatically sets you up to record audio and video and the interface is slightly

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,690
different.

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,730
So there's my cat cool.

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,030
And what will happen is after you take the video if you press that button you'll see the timer count

35
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,970
and then you can press it to finish it.

36
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,930
And the same goes for photo.

37
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,160
So let's go back to the library here for a second because no matter what you do if you take a photo

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,830
or video it's going to put it in your library.

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,330
But it's also going to them and it ex-friends That's all I'm saying.

40
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,740
So here up on this user interface you can tap it and then move it around.

41
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:14,250
You can see the grid which you have to hold it on iOS There goes to see the grid.

42
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,140
And on Android whatever it just pops up automatically.

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,540
That just helps you to understand things like the rule of thirds of we talked about before to see whether

44
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,870
or not you have space.

45
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,350
So right here we have three icons one looks like that infinity sign.

46
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,460
Now what that is is an app for Instagram called Boomerang and Boomerang.

47
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,220
And if you've seen this before it's Doo's animated images that look like just a little bit of motion

48
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,980
is happening and then it happens in reverse the way it works is you will take I think it's four or five

49
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,570
photographs of something in rapid succession and then stitches it together and plays it in a loop.

50
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,980
It's kind of a cool way of adding a little bit of spice to your photos.

51
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,960
We'll talk about it more later on.

52
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,120
I don't consider it generally consider it a large part of your content strategy on Instagram.

53
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,300
It's really cool if you can integrate them and it's a great way of spicing some up regardless it's not

54
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,580
something we're talking about now.

55
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,440
It's a separate app you have to download whatever next one is this little rounded off square section

56
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,870
off and in the sections.

57
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,970
This is called layout.

58
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,280
Same thing actually usually pushes you to a separate app called Lay out.

59
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,230
And what that is it allows you to make photo collages.

60
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:29,480
So what you can do is just pick multiple images and then select the way that they display and you can

61
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,890
do it with faces you can do it with events whatever.

62
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:37,430
So with collages it's another way of taking static content making you more interesting.

63
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:43,550
Let's say you're taking photos of an employee event can be cool to take photos of multiple employees

64
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,800
doing something or one doing multiple things or one in multiple.

65
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,940
Like first step second step third step and then stitch them together like that.

66
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:58,850
Personally I'm not going to use them because I think that collages are bound for comprehension.

67
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,280
It's harder to tell what's going on because you're starting with a very small reduced size of the image.

68
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,330
Once you slice it up several times it makes it that much harder to see so it's not something that I'm

69
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,720
going to use constantly.

70
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,180
It's not something you see a lot of accounts use but if you can it can be done decently well.

71
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,580
I'm not super optimistic about it though.

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,060
Another thing here is select multiple.

73
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,070
And what that does is it helps you make a carousel of images or videos.

74
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:30,200
So when that happens if I selected multiple It would put them into a list like this.

75
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:38,090
And then when I share them you'll see an image and what you do is you tap on these little circles at

76
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,090
the bottom and that's how it moves you through the images.

77
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,390
It's like kind of like a slide show but you use it for video.

78
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,410
So you might do that if you took a bunch of photos and it was like in a sequence you could do it that

79
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:48,970
way.

80
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:55,520
You also see people who will say which one is better and they'll do a video and then another video and

81
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,700
you can click between the two and then you know talk in the comments.

82
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,320
There's a creative ways that people have done it.

83
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,050
Generally more photos is better than less or fewer photos.

84
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,500
But again I personally to focus on one if I have ideas for multiple do that it good for me it's just

85
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,640
more content to make so I don't really focus on it.

86
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,260
What you can do then after you pick something that you own or you take something that you want as you

87
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:26,300
just hit next and are in the filter and now filtering works same way for both Android and iOS.

88
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,990
What is you know here is it just up there you click buttons and they apply different color dilations

89
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,870
to it and the they're called LUTs and that helps you add an effect to a photo.

90
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,420
Sometimes you take a photo and it doesn't look great.

91
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:49,730
So you can add on say the Edan filter and it might make it look retro or hipster or washed out or something

92
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,410
that you might be going for now filters.

93
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,330
Personally I don't use the filters in Instagram because there's so well know they're trademarked that

94
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,470
people can recognize them and they're overused.

95
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,790
So that's not what you want.

96
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,020
You want someone to look at this and go oh they made that in the Instagram app because it just looks

97
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,940
lazy filters actually though.

98
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,370
Interesting story enough are how Instagram got famous.

99
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,730
That's actually how they started is they started putting filters on it.

100
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,010
And that was basically the foundation of the app.

101
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,020
I think it started when the founders girlfriend was talk or was complaining about photos being posted

102
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,600
on Facebook saying that she doesn't post on Facebook as often as you'd like because her photos don't

103
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
look that great.

104
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,900
And then he said well we have a friend who posts on Facebook and that's the same thing and she said

105
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,380
well actually that's because he puts filters on his images so they always look good enough to post.

106
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,940
They go a.m. So like I said it's not really something that I personally use.

107
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,910
I also think that there's other apps that you can use that have better filters and will cover some of

108
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,290
those.

109
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,930
If you want to go that route your other options are here.

110
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:03,020
You can do the Lux Lux's kind of an odd way of saying brightness.

111
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,570
You can kind of tweak it a little bit.

112
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:11,810
It's not it's not necessarily brightness isn't necessarily like saturation or color but you play with

113
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,920
it you can kind of tell.

114
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,480
It just brings out certain colors and exaggerates the color profiles slightly again.

115
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:25,560
I mean I don't know it's not really something I generally focus on but if you're someone who's oriented

116
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,560
towards photography in general you can probably make better use of these.

117
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,160
Now there are things you can do is hit edit over here and you can do a lot of options.

118
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,190
You can adjust the photo so you can twist it like this if you want to.

119
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,300
It also zooms in.

120
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,500
Keep that in mind.

121
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,530
You do like that like you're zooming in on something that's an interesting effect.

122
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,880
You always reset it by just hitting that.

123
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,790
Over here when you could use add perspective so perspective basically bloats the bottom of the photo

124
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,070
or the top of the photo.

125
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,850
And that allows you to make it look like it's leaning forward or backward.

126
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,570
So if we want to make it leaning forward I don't really know why you would do this occasionally sometimes

127
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,890
you can make cool effects.

128
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,610
Well I have a sneaking suspicion that no one does this.

129
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,990
This would be the left or right distortion.

130
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,460
You know sometimes you can make somewhat cool effects kind it looks like a poster if you do it slightly

131
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,640
at an angle.

132
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,680
Also sometimes you can make up for bad photography.

133
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,840
Then you can move on there's brightness and it's pretty simple and it's the general rule with brightness

134
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,660
as you don't want to go past a certain point because it just becomes washed out.

135
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,530
We have the same problem with cameras.

136
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,230
The ISO is what it's called.

137
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,160
I don't know that stands for don't ask me but that's a make things brighter.

138
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,010
Typically the more you abuse it though the crappier the image comes out it actually starts to damage

139
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,730
the integrity of the image like the pixelation of it.

140
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,530
So I use that you know sometimes of the photos to dark.

141
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,810
But if the phone is too dark then just retake the photo.

142
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,570
My opinion.

143
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,520
OK moving on.

144
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,770
We have contrast.

145
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,170
OK.

146
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,840
Now this is something that you can play with too and the effect of making it look contracted or uncontracted.

147
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:03,060
So uncontracted it look kind of like that like it's a little bit duller and more contrast will make

148
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,110
it look like it's really kind of sharp.

149
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,030
I apologize.

150
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:13,470
The iPhone 10 because the camera is not great with low light as you can tell but that's it.

151
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,280
So there's a term called contrast.

152
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,490
You might see that sometimes sometimes people just put contrasts on everything they do.

153
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,890
And that's you know one way of getting a certain effect through.

154
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,640
Not again a huge fan but you see this on a lot of movies now as they make it contrast.

155
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,410
OK structure.

156
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,990
So its structure is honestly it's kind of hard to explain all the resources like a more technical explanation

157
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:46,770
of it but structure is it basically allows groups of pixels in the background to look more structured.

158
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,880
So if you structure it then it looks normal but you add structure then it essentially adds more definition

159
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,100
to objects in the back.

160
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:03,740
So if you had like say a triangle background in the back then if you unstructured it to look normal

161
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,240
the structure you would notice how more defined those shapes wore.

162
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,300
So again it's one of these kind of loose.

163
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,150
I don't really see that you notice this how it's blurry in the background but as you add in structure

164
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,800
it pulls out the brick outline.

165
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:25,390
So again you can tweak it and play with it but it's not generally something that I think is super useful.

166
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,910
Ok then we're move on warmth.

167
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,550
Warmth is slightly different than brightness brightness just brings up the dark values to lighter values

168
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:39,210
whereas warmth essentially takes like the yellows and the what we consider like the warm part of the

169
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:44,350
spectrum and then moves them up into like the orange part of the spectrum I could be wrong on this.

170
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,610
So people were actually photographers could correct me.

171
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,690
But that's what you kind of notice is it'll take like these cool bricks in the back and turn them more

172
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,620
orange.

173
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,850
And if I do like that it turns it more blue.

174
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,520
Very similar to white balance.

175
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,320
Do you guys use cameras.

176
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,970
This makes it cool.

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And this makes it warm like tungsten or like daylight's anyway.

178
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,820
And why do you want to do that.

179
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:13,500
Then we have saturation saturation they time at every saturation is in landscape photos of a landscape

180
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,910
photo up the saturation.

181
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,260
My God it looks amazing and makes you think like I could eat that mountain.

182
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,940
And that's how a lot of companies make their landscape photos look so good.

183
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,530
True story though with air B and B makes their photos look so great is they just jack up the saturation.

184
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,400
That's all they do.

185
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,060
That's what makes the colors really come out.

186
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,030
And that's what saturation essentially means is it just brings out the colors looks like crap and doors

187
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,710
are on.

188
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:46,470
People don't over oversaturate someone's face a landscape or a building or something like that you can't

189
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,020
go wrong.

190
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,400
OK.

191
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,950
And then we have color.

192
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,000
And honestly we're getting a little bit in the weeds with this one.

193
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,310
But essentially what this does is you have a color spectrum.

194
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:04,290
Any photograph should have pixels in all these different spectrums of colors from red green blue black

195
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,400
white everything.

196
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,300
So essentially what you can say is like shadows will be the darker end of the spectrum it will take

197
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,990
all the darker end of the spectrum pixels on your screen and then give them a hue or attend to it.

198
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:22,530
So if you want to give it like a purple hue on iOS then you go on and on and you know like a green or

199
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,150
an android.

200
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,800
Cool.

201
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,600
Same thing with highlighting of the higher end of the spectrum colors attend.

202
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,630
And yeah.

203
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:38,150
Anyway that's something I never work with but whatever fade is yeah I mean it's just a specific fact

204
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,620
to just kind of doles out the detail of the photo.

205
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,550
How that's different than a lot of the other filters can tell you.

206
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,780
Then we have highlights and shadows.

207
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,180
Now this just is for brightness of highlights and shadows.

208
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,190
People who work in video or photography know that usually you can just up the brightness of the darker

209
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,420
end of the spectrum or the wider end.

210
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,800
So essentially that's what they're trying to do or what you do on those two.

211
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:09,930
Now vignetting the big netting is when you create an effect that it blurs out on the corners of the

212
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,770
image which kind of has the visual effect of what you're focusing in on something.

213
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,000
So if I go like this.

214
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,040
Notice how it kind of darkens the outside ring it kind of focuses in on the what I'm looking at.

215
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,060
That's that effect.

216
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:30,810
That one I think you can use pretty well to make stuff make the viewer kind of focus in on the main

217
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,710
thing of your photo.

218
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,880
Then we have tilt shift.

219
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,510
This one is kind of like the vignetting but it allows you to.

220
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,040
As opposed to making it like a circle around it.

221
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:48,720
You can do radio or linear radio is like a vignette but it's you can I think you can change the area

222
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,730
so you can change where the blurring happens.

223
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,670
So this is on the radio.

224
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,150
I can move this around like say I want to focus on this thing over here I could do like that in blurting

225
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,540
out except for that and that is useful.

226
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,510
I don't know why in a linear it's like the same thing but I can twist it and I can.

227
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,240
Whatever.

228
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,930
OK.

229
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,280
Then the last thing is sharpen OK and then sharpen.

230
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,470
You can guess what it does.

231
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,920
It just sharpens your image.

232
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,090
It's sometimes hard to tell what that's doing OK.

233
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,470
That pretty much wraps it up for the walk through the user interface for filters.

234
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:33,750
A fax boomerangs collages carousels and everything like that if you want to create your own content

235
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:39,080
in the actual app that's perfectly fine although I suggest there's better apps out there for filters

236
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,940
and for taking videos and taking photos.

237
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,260
But it's up to you.

238
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,850
They have some cool features in here.

239
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,640
If you want to pay for another one then sometimes you can lean on these and that's perfectly fine.

240
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,140
OK.

241
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:50,850
Scenics lecture.
