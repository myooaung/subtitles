Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,970
Let's talk about hashtags. Now,
2

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,020
a lot of you know what these are and you
are more than welcome to skip this lecture.
3

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,110
If you don't, or you feel like you don't have a great
grip on them, then stay on for a little bit longer.
4

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,130
Please leave if you know what they
are and you don't want to hear more.
5

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,280
Please leave if you know what they
are and you don't want to hear more.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,790
What's a hashtag and why does it matter
so much for your posting success?
7

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,380
A hashtag is any word that's
preceded by the pound symbol.
8

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,470
A hashtag is any word that's
preceded by the pound symbol.
9

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,070
Now, why the pound symbol?
10

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,670
Well, the reason kind of makes sense.
Apparently, somewhere in the U.S. or Europe,
11

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:38,310
I don't remember where, this pound symbol is actually
called a hash mark, and it has a bunch of other silly
12

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:45,870
names, but hash mark is the one that apparently
lived on. Combining hash mark with the word tag,
13

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,150
and well, you get hashtag.
14

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,700
Brilliant.
15

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,930
The basic idea behind a hashtag is that it's a way
of quickly tagging or categorizing something.
16

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,980
It's different than just tagging something, because
you are doing it in line with the text itself.
17

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,340
Typically, when you organize documents, you use
folders to separate and delineate what's what.
18

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,390
You might even change the title or use
prefix or suffix codes to designate types.
19

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,150
When you're posting on social media, you can't do that,
20

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,700
so instead people hashtag it.
21

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,250
Now, this method of doing it has gotten so popular that
you even see it as a feature in non social media apps.
22

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,000
Now, this method of doing it has gotten so popular that
you even see it as a feature in non social media apps.
23

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,300
Now, if you use Bear, that app you
see me a couple times use it,
24

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,770
for instance, you can hashtag your documents
inside a document, which is kind of cool.
25

26
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,420
Now, you put some word that relates to
your post and then you post it as a hashtag.
26

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,000
If you posted a photo of your breakfast, you might put
#breakfast and #healthy and #dopeoplestilldothis.
27

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,360
If you posted a photo of your breakfast, you might put
#breakfast and #healthy and #dopeoplestilldothis.
28

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,670
If you posted a photo of your breakfast, you might put
#breakfast and #healthy and #dopeoplestilldothis.
29

30
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,130
If you posted a photo of Space X's Falcon Heavy rocket,
well, you might tag it with #spacex, #rockets, or
30

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,320
If you posted a photo of Space X's Falcon Heavy rocket,
well, you might tag it with #spacex, #rockets, or
31

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,820
#cool but I don't understand the implications.
32

33
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,410
Then, when people want to explore posts related to
some category, maybe Space X just did a big launch,
33

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,140
so, you know, they want to see the photos from it,
34

35
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,170
they might search for posts with the hashtag #spacex.
35

36
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,340
It's actually quite useful for curating what you see
by having users self-select what they think their
36

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,940
content is relevant to.
37

38
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,720
Now, on Instagram, hashtags are a big deal. If you're
just using Instagram for fun and you're not trying
38

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,540
to grow your account, then hashtags,
39

40
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,580
to be honest, are kind of pointless, unless you are
using them in like a weird snarky self-referential joke.
40

41
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,290
to be honest, are kind of pointless, unless you are
using them in like a weird snarky self-referential joke.
41

42
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,090
In fact, they actually look pretty tacky.
42

43
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,620
So it's really only something that businesses ever try to attempt.
43

44
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,280
You occasionally see other people do it but
I don't understand why they're doing it.
44

45
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,370
Next lecture, we'll talk about how
to do this without looking tacky,
45

46
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,250
but I want to get a couple more points across. Instagram,
46

47
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,880
as you've heard me say before, is pretty restricted as
a platform, restricted in what you can do, see, and
47

48
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,140
what information you get.
48

49
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,000
There aren't a lot of ways of super boosting your post to
49

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,870
every person that would ever want to see it.
50

51
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,230
Well, at least not at the moment.
51

52
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,910
So instead we need to use hashtags to automatically
put our posts in the category feeds that people might
52

53
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,060
be searching. When you normally post something,
53

54
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,340
it just goes out to all your followers.
54

55
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:10,560
Instagram might show it to people who are not in
your followers list, but you can't rely on that entirely.
55

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,790
You have to give your system some hashtag information
so they can throw it out there in front of new
56

57
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,620
followers that could potentially like your stuff.
57

58
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,390
Ok, I think it's fair to say that you know what a hashtag is now,
58

59
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,200
presumably - it's just a code symbol
that's used to categorize your posts.
59

60
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,480
They work differently on each social media platform,
but on Instagram, they're actually quite a big deal,
60

61
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,400
especially to business users.
61

62
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,470
We add them to our posts to increase our reach.
62

63
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,660
How you use them and pick them,
we'll talk about next lecture. Peace.
