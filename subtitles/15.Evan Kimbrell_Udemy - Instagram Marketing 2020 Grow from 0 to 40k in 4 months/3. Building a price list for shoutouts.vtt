00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.910
All right guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.770
We are continuing on what we talked about last lecture,
which is prepping your account to sell paid shoutouts
2

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.300
or paid promotions for companies, businesses, and services.
3

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.790
Now, this lecture, what we're going to talk about is something
that's really essential if you don't want to waste all
4

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.990
of your time, and that's building a price list beforehand
and then building a set of instructions or a
5

6
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.020
process flow for how you can easily get people to pay
you, and then you post whatever it is they have.
6

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.610
Now, first up, the price list.
7

8
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.420
Now, first up, the price list.
8

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.370
Now, I don't know if you've seen this.
9

10
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.820
If you've been following the follow along lectures, you'll see
this a lot actually, because we were doing paid promotions
10

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.820
at the very beginning of the account
and everybody's got a price list.
11

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.380
They'll just send you this copy and pasted text that says
"This is how much it costs for a two-hour promotion,
12

13
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.150
They'll just send you this copy and pasted text that says
"This is how much it costs for a two-hour promotion,
13

14
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.940
this is for a four, this is for a six, this is for an eight, etc."
14

15
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.350
Now, one thing I have to tell you is that
price lists are really trial and error.
15

16
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.960
Now, one thing I have to tell you is that
price lists are really trial and error.
16

17
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.450
Anytime I get a price list from a big account, I kind
of assume that this has been iterated on a lot,
17

18
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.910
but I wouldn't be surprised if this is the first time
they've ever even used this price list before, because
18

19
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.210
the industry is constantly changing, and so it's very
hard to tell what the baseline for charging should be.
19

20
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.930
the industry is constantly changing, and so it's very
hard to tell what the baseline for charging should be.
20

21
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.890
Now, what have we learned from buying
paid promotions with Innovation Station?
21

22
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.090
Well, if you're an account under 50,000 followers,
pricing is typically going to be anywhere from like
22

23
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.250
$10 all the way up to $50. I think under $10 it's not
even worth doing and you should just wait till you
23

24
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.730
are larger to start selling.
24

25
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.930
Now, for accounts that are, say, under 2 million, I've paid as low
as $40 and as high as, I think the most I've ever paid was $200.
25

26
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.010
Now, for accounts that are, say, under 2 million, I've paid as low
as $40 and as high as, I think the most I've ever paid was $200.
26

27
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.690
Now, the biggest two modifiers here are going to be
how long they share your post, how long they leave
27

28
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:50.360
it up for, and whether or not it includes a story
post or a temporary change to their bio link.
28

29
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.960
So let's look at some of the price lists that
we've gotten from accounts in the past.
29

30
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.680
So let's see.
30

31
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.440
OK, so this guy has an account that's 5.9 million
people, then he's got one that's 4.8, 1.6, 1.3.
31

32
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.600
OK, so this guy has an account that's 5.9 million
people, then he's got one that's 4.8, 1.6, 1.3.
32

33
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.710
Now, I only used his science account,
because the other ones just weren't relevant.
33

34
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.550
So he was charging $75 for a one-hour post, $120 for
three, six hours, $160, up to 24 hours, which was $240.
34

35
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.590
So he was charging $75 for a one-hour post, $120 for
three, six hours, $160, up to 24 hours, which was $240.
35

36
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.440
Now, that does not include any stories, just because
mainly I'm guessing he doesn't think they're worth it.
36

37
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.940
Now, that does not include any stories, just because
mainly I'm guessing he doesn't think they're worth it.
37

38
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.270
Here's another one.
38

39
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.400
They also have three accounts,
so one was @notcommonfacts, 7.7,
39

40
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.880
@horoscoptic, 5.9, and then another one for 3.3. I think
I only used their @notcommonfacts, so 7.7 million followers.
40

41
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.240
@horoscoptic, 5.9, and then another one for 3.3. I think
I only used their @notcommonfacts, so 7.7 million followers.
41

42
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.420
Now, they only have three tiers, there's $150 for three
hours, $210 for six hours, or $320 for 12 hours, and
42

43
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.440
then down here we have story posts, $70 per
100,000 views, and that's actually uncommon.
43

44
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.950
Usually, they'll just give you a flat fee for a story post,
because story posts automatically post for 24 hours,
44

45
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.260
there's no real negotiation about how long it stays up.
45

46
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.290
Now, this person went after 100k views, and
I don't know how effective that is, to be honest.
46

47
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.660
But generally speaking, we can see some patterns.
47

48
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.470
We usually see time breakdown something like this,
it's usually like a price for one hour, a price for two,
48

49
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.600
a price for four, a price for oftentimes six, and then 12,
and then 24, and then oftentimes you'll have a price
49

50
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.890
for a permanent post.
50

51
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.020
Now, why exactly is it important to
cater to every single tier possible?
51

52
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.220
And the reason is just because you want to cast as
wide a net as possible, you want to be able to cater to
52

53
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.240
as many people's budgets as you can.
53

54
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.450
A small account with a small budget can still get
promoted on your account but they're just going to pick
54

55
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.120
something that's a lower tier, like a one-hour or two-hour.
55

56
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.150
Also, big accounts often buy shoutouts,
56

57
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.720
and for them it's not worth it to do one hour or two hours,
so they would want something that's longer, like 24.
57

58
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.690
and for them it's not worth it to do one hour or two hours,
so they would want something that's longer, like 24.
58

59
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.440
The other reason why this tier system works really
well is because it's a really easy way to upsell people,
59

60
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.420
and I've noticed this just from a psychological
standpoint when I buy paid shoutouts.
60

61
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.900
What they do is they'll price it so
that you have your hour tiers,
61

62
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.710
and typically the first one is the baseline, and the second
one is double that, the third one is double that,
62

63
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.000
and the fourth one is double that, with the exception
of sometimes people do a 4, 6, and 12, or 4, 6, 8, 12.
63

64
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.550
and the fourth one is double that, with the exception
of sometimes people do a 4, 6, and 12, or 4, 6, 8, 12.
64

65
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.240
That's kind of the only area where
they kind of break that rule.
65

66
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.150
So what they often do is, let's say
you're charging $20 for one hour,
66

67
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.610
they don't then charge $40 for two hours, because
there's no reason why you as a buyer would do a larger
67

68
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.980
transaction to go for that two hour 
one, it's not really that tempting.
68

69
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.210
So typically what you'll see is people will increase
the price for each doubling of time by only 50%.
69

70
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.260
So typically what you'll see is people will increase
the price for each doubling of time by only 50%.
70

71
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.520
Some people actually do it even lower than
that, some people do it a little bit higher.
71

72
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.950
But it's never 100%.
72

73
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:50.070
So if you did, let's say, $20 for one hour, you could do $30
for two hours, and then a double of that should be $60,
73

74
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.550
So if you did, let's say, $20 for one hour, you could do $30
for two hours, and then a double of that should be $60,
74

75
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.420
but with the reduction, it's only a
50% increase, we do $45 for four.
75

76
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.010
but with the reduction, it's only a
50% increase, we do $45 for four.
76

77
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.830
Then you get rounded out by saying like $55 for six,
77

78
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.320
$80 for 12, $120 for 24. Now, you
can kind of see why that's seductive.
78

79
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.440
Like, if I wanted to pay $45 for 4 hours, and
it's like, wow, I could only increase my price
79

80
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.990
by $10 to get another 50% of exposure, that's pretty tempting.
80

81
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.270
by $10 to get another 50% of exposure, that's pretty tempting.
81

82
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.250
Now, it's entirely up to you if you want to offer
permanent posts. Generally, larger accounts shy away
82

83
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.620
from this because they take a very hard line
towards curating the posts on their account.
83

84
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.520
They don't want anything that's foreign to be
permanently on there, but smaller accounts
84

85
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.920
you see will do this.
85

86
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.440
There's also no baseline for permanent.
86

87
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.880
The most common pricing I've seen is you
take a 24-hour post and then double that.
87

88
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.680
Now, if it's permanent, it's on there forever.
88

89
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.730
Why is that only double, say, a 24-hour post?
89

90
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.350
Well, it's just the way that traffic works.
90

91
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.840
So if I post for a one-hour post, that's actually going
to get a lot of followers, and a two-hour post is
91

92
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.190
not going to get double the followers. It actually tapers
off pretty quickly, because when I post it, it shows
92

93
00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.010
up in people's feeds, and if it just stays up, then I'm
only catering to people who maybe didn't see the
93

94
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.840
post, but that came to my account.
94

95
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.020
So with that being said, if you did a permanent post, the traffic
on day 2 is nowhere even near the traffic you get on day one.
95

96
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.610
So with that being said, if you did a permanent post, the traffic
on day 2 is nowhere even near the traffic you get on day one.
96

97
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.680
Now, generally speaking, when you go to price your stories,
I like to see them priced just somewhere in the middle,
97

98
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.150
Now, generally speaking, when you go to price your stories,
I like to see them priced just somewhere in the middle,
98

99
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.430
Now, generally speaking, when you go to price your stories,
I like to see them priced just somewhere in the middle,
99

100
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.080
because stories, not everybody views them,
100

101
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:26.020
they're harder to act upon, harder to get people to
actually click through them to a page or to an account,
101

102
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.090
but they're easy for you to put up.
102

103
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:34.040
So I just generally say like, you know, if your
middle tier is $50, then do a story for $50.
103

104
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.830
Now, the rest of it is up to you entirely.
104

105
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.940
You can get really, really creative with this.
105

106
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:44.060
You can add in, say, "For the length of
your promotion, I'll change my bio link."
106

107
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.610
You can say "I'll add in a story post and make it like
a really small upsell," it's really up to you, there's
107

108
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.840
a lot of different configurations you can do, just keep
in mind, as you do this, you're moving farther and
108

109
00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:01.220
farther away from shore with regards to pricing numbers
that you can obviously see and establish somewhere else,
109

110
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.940
farther away from shore with regards to pricing numbers
that you can obviously see and establish somewhere else,
110

111
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.930
so you're going to have to start making it up, and
111

112
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.540
you might have to do a little more trial and error.
112

113
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.430
You might have to make a pricing sheet, send it to
113

114
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.310
some people, see how they respond,
and then adjust accordingly.
114

115
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.590
So once you settle on a scheme, write them out and
then just save them in Evernote or Notes or whatever
115

116
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.240
it is that you use, so it's very quick and easy for you
to copy and paste it to anyone who's asking about
116

117
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.680
doing a paid promotion.
117

118
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.440
Now, keep in mind, there is really no set pricing for
this, because it depends on a lot of things, it depends
118

119
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.350
on your niche, it depends on your engagement rate, it
depends how long you leave the post up, it depends with
119

120
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:38.810
the brand of the account, is it a very high production
quality account or is it just a repost account?
120

121
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.930
For Innovation Station,
121

122
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.200
we'll try selling promotions just because, to explore it,
122

123
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.510
but for me it's only going to be worth it if I can charge
a certain amount of money even for the most
123

124
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:55.730
basic posts, because I'm not going to just repost
something they give me, I'm going to make
124

125
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.680
it in the same style that we do our videos,
125

126
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:03.680
and since I'm using contractors to make this, I have
a certain baseline cost for me to make each one, it
126

127
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.720
ends up being like probably $15, something like that, 
127

128
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.220
because I haven't optimized it yet, I think once it's
optimized it'll be lower, down to like $10 or maybe $8,
128

129
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.280
so I have to make sure that's at least above that.
129

130
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.750
The last thing you'll want to do is give
them a set of basic instructions.
130

131
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.270
I like to ask for three things.
131

132
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.630
One, what is your caption going to say? Two,
132

133
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.560
when do you want me to post this? And three, please
give me a link to some videos or direct message me
133

134
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:33.830
videos, so that I don't have to spend my entire life just
hunting down the videos that you want actually posted.
134

135
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.400
Now, with regards to caption, this is entirely up to you.
135

136
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.130
I don't think there's a standard for this.
136

137
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.820
I generally think it's a good idea to let them control
the caption, because if it's just the post, then
137

138
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.080
it's hard to drive traffic to their account, and
we're concerned with repeat business, right?
138

139
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.080
So we want to make sure they see
an actual tangible benefit from it,
139

140
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.890
and it's hard to do that without the caption.
140

141
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:59.200
But of course, keep in mind, if you let them write
their caption, make sure you do a read over,
141

142
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.500
But of course, keep in mind, if you let them write
their caption, make sure you do a read over,
142

143
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:05.210
so it doesn't sound too out of touch with the way you
do your own captions, and to make sure obviously
143

144
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.920
that just doesn't sound spammy or low quality.
144

145
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.880
Now, for getting videos from them, I generally suggest
asking them for the videos, because... Now, if you're
145

146
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.930
doing one or two promotions, it might be easy for
you to go to their website and grab some videos, or
146

147
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.320
go to their account and grab some videos,
147

148
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.610
but it's going to drive you crazy if you're doing a
lot of sales, that's going to become a part time job.
148

149
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:22.930
but it's going to drive you crazy if you're doing a
lot of sales, that's going to become a part time job.
149

150
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.390
So I generally like to ask them "Give me at least three
clips." Now, the way you could get this from them,
150

151
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.280
So I generally like to ask them "Give me at least three
clips." Now, the way you could get this from them,
151

152
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.950
I like to use a tool called Balloon.io,
152

153
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.560
and so what that is, it's an add-on for Dropbox,
153

154
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.410
and then I can just give them a link, and that link takes
them to a page where they can just drag and drop a
154

155
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.640
video file, and then it shows up in my Dropbox.
155

156
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.650
That's pretty easy and it works with my workflow,
since a lot of the people that are doing the content
156

157
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.390
on the account work in Dropbox.
157

158
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.230
But alternatively, and this is actually probably simpler,
to be honest, is they can just send you the video
158

159
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.220
through Instagram direct message.
159

160
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.120
It's kind of a pain, because sometimes
it won't send, but it's directly there.
160

161
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.140
So when you go to post it, it's just, it's
already in Instagram, it's just a matter 
161

162
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.030
of finding that message thread, grabbing it, and posting it.
162

163
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:08.000
Now, the last thing was time, and the reason why you
want to have them say when to post the post is because
163

164
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.340
they have their own audience, and their own audience
has their own time zone, so it's important that you
164

165
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.130
hit the people that they want to actually get in front of.
165

166
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:20.750
It doesn't really make sense to only post during your
time, because, you know, if their account's primarily
166

167
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:25.300
people in South Asia and mine's
in the US, that's pretty heavily,
167

168
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.430
it's a really big difference in terms of time zones.
168

169
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.760
So if I post in my time zone, I'm not going to
get a lot of the people that they actually want.
169

170
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.260
And keep in mind, we're going to repeat business, it's
going to drive you crazy if you work with every single person
170

171
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:36.670
And keep in mind, we're going to repeat business, it's
going to drive you crazy if you work with every single person
171

172
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.420
only one time. We want to make
sure they're happy with the process.
172

173
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.050
That is just the basics of offering a good service.
173

174
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.030
OK guys, with that being said, make sure you make a price list,
174

175
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.530
shop it around to see how people respond,
175

176
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.920
also you can just message other people
to see how they price their stuff
176

177
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.200
if you need a baseline, and then come up with some
very basic instructions for getting the videos to
177

178
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.610
you, figuring out what you're going to do about the caption,
and then figuring out when exactly you want to post it.
178

179
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:02.530
you, figuring out what you're going to do about the caption,
and then figuring out when exactly you want to post it.
179

180
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.800
If you do those two things, this will
180

181
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.300
make this process a whole lot smoother, and
181

182
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.420
you won't go crazy trying to sell shoutouts and promotions.
182

183
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:10.990
All right, guys.
183

184
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.010
See you in the next lecture.
