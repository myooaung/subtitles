00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.010
Who goes back to the course in this lecture we're going to do is we're going to take a look at Instagram

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.580
post ads and walk you through how you can get started.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.220
So we talked about before post ads are the ads that show up in the news feed of Instagram.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.940
They can be a photo they can be a carousel and they can be a video.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.340
Now they pretty much have the same restrictions that you would find with a traditional Instagram post

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.580
meaning that you can make it say a landscape ratio or a portrait ratio.

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.380
But typically speaking a square one to one ratio is going to be best.

8
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.630
So there aren't any real rules that apply to Instagram ads that don't necessarily apply to posts.

9
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.600
The only thing I can think of is that you will try to rely less on embedded text if you do an ad just

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.300
because a Instagram post doesn't go through a filtration process whereas And and does actually have

11
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.170
to go through usually an automated system that looks at the ad and then says how much of the ad is text

12
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.300
and if it's too much text they might remove it.

13
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.310
So with that being said let's just dive in and I'll show you how you can set up ads.

14
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.940
Now as I've said before it's pretty much the same thing as Facebook.

15
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.900
So if you have experience with Facebook ads you're going to be bored to tears by this lecture and the

16
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.220
next lecture most likely so I would imagine just it's worth skipping.

17
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.690
But anyway.

18
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.220
So go to your Facebook and since we are using a business Instagram account because we set this up way

19
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.070
back at the very beginning we already have our Instagram tied up to a Facebook page.

20
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.600
Facebook owns Instagram.

21
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.540
Therefore this is the way that things must be done.

22
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.130
So go to your top right and click this all down arrow and then what you want to do is just go down to

23
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.670
manage ads and you should see under your pages whatever page you made for your Instagram account.

24
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.070
OK then you can do is click through to your actual ad account and it will take you to this screen right

25
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.540
here which shows any ads you've run in the past and you can essentially see that there's four tabs up

26
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.600
here you have account overview campaigns ad sites and ads.

27
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.630
Now you're account overview.

28
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.090
It's always going to be the same it's always going to run through your main accounts you don't have

29
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.810
to worry about that.

30
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.790
Now a campaign is something you would set up if you wanted to do a new advertising campaign.

31
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.770
Let's say you had a new item that you wanted to promote on Instagram so you might create a campaign

32
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.060
specifically for that.

33
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.260
Now in the next section the ad set so this is where you might say drill down specifically on who you

34
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.640
want to target in your campaign.

35
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.610
And in that case what you could do is let's say you had one campaign for a new toaster that you're selling

36
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.330
whatever.

37
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.070
Then in the next section you can do and sets and you could set it up so that you could test different

38
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.780
demographics.

39
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.260
Maybe you want to test us east coast moms and then you also want to test let's say people in Europe

40
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.560
between 18 and 25 whatever it is you can set those up and run those in tandem and then within that you

41
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.350
know adds and then within and you can set it up such that you can run different types of ads so you

42
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.730
can see how they perform within each and set and compare them.

43
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.230
Now I might be the case you want to run a single image and also a carrousel and also a video and if

44
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.610
you run those are separate ads you can tell very quickly which ones are going to perform the best.

45
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.650
One other thing I want to point out before we jump into creating some ads is that up here we're in what's

46
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.380
called the ads manager the click here you can actually see that's called the ads manager and click all

47
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.770
tools you see there's actually quite a bit more.

48
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.250
A lot of people will run ads through what's called the Power editor but we're not going to do that because

49
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.900
we're just going to be doing the basics of how to get in and do an Instagram.

50
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.920
And if you guys want to learn how to use power editors I'd suggest you take a Facebook marketing course

51
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.170
because Facebook Marketing is incredibly complex there are people who base their entire careers off

52
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.060
knowing how to use this tool set.

53
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.230
We're looking at right now.

54
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.390
So if you want to start a campaign make sure you click campaign here and create.

55
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.880
OK.

56
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.750
So right here what we have is called the quick creation screen.

57
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.610
I prefer especially if you've never done this before.

58
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.090
Go to switch to guided creation.

59
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.140
Same thing it just kind of pushes you through in a slower fashion and it's easier to understand.

60
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.930
OK now you've done this and asked me What's your marketing objective.

61
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.540
So you have a lot of options here.

62
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.780
But keep in mind that if you're doing an Instagram ad you don't actually have access to a lot of these

63
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.790
so catalog sales you don't have store visits you won't have.

64
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.540
I don't believe you'll have messages.

65
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.260
So just keep in mind that it might be the case you click something and you get to the end and you can

66
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.850
actually do it.

67
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.340
It just means you just go back over here to the objective phase and change it.

68
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.600
Let's say that we want to get traffic to our Web site.

69
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.310
Let's say we have a main web site that we use in tandem to our Instagram account we want to drive traffic

70
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.900
to it.

71
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.340
So I hear traffic.

72
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.860
Great.

73
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.020
Now what I need to do is name my campaigns so I'll call it Instagram traffic.

74
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.570
Now if you want to create a split test I think in the next lecture will cover how you do split tests

75
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.880
sliders and ways you can do it when really worry about it.

76
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.120
And then the same thing is budget it and you don't know what you're doing I wouldn't touch it yet so

77
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.970
it continue.

78
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.320
OK.

79
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.480
What was going to do is ask you to set up an ad set as you notice we're over here now in the traffic

80
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.360
section of Adsit.

81
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.630
So what we have is we can deem it an add set name up here.

82
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.100
And typically this is just to give us some type of reminder of who we're targeting.

83
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.080
So if we are running an Instagram post ad and we wanted to target let's say two different groups of

84
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.730
people then it would be really important that we change the name to this asset name and then later on

85
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.570
create another asset.

86
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.930
Right now we're not doing that so I don't really worry about it so I wouldn't really worry here but

87
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.930
if you specifically have two different groups you want to target then this is something you would want

88
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.140
to make sure the label correctly.

89
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.380
Now down here we have again trafficker's you know we chose so do we want to traffic go to a Web site

90
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.640
or traffic to an app or traffic go to Facebook Messenger.

91
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.040
Now I'm not entirely sure how messenger works but I believe the way that it works is if you do Facebook

92
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.690
Messenger let's say you're selling something in your store and you run an ad.

93
00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.040
Anytime someone clicks on it will do is automatically open up.

94
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.630
Facebook messenger the app on their phone and then create a thread with you.

95
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.070
If you're selling stuff and you have the bandwidth to actually talk to every single of your customers

96
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.450
that can be pretty effective.

97
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.540
So keep that in mind.

98
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:12.190
OK.

99
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.750
The next thing is driving marketers and creating an offer that's something you can do if you are directly

100
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.630
selling something.

101
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.940
Right.

102
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.570
If you're not just promoting a Web site generically for like brand awareness you're going for conversion

103
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.100
sometimes that can be pretty useful but keep in mind in order to run an offer you have to be selling

104
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.170
something that's on your Facebook page.

105
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.500
So it's going to be driving them to your page.

106
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.130
Not a lot of marketers are going to love that because a lot of them would prefer they send it to their

107
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.080
own page.

108
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.060
Either way that's something that we're not really going to play around with but it's an option.

109
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.970
And this is again something that Facebook marketers spend a lot of time worrying about.

110
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.200
Now let's get down here to audience so we want to do is create a new audience now a lot of this stuff

111
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.570
is just kind of junk.

112
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.920
You wouldn't really have to worry about it.

113
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.460
One is custom audiences.

114
00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:00.340
And essentially what a custom audience is as an audience that you have established elsewhere in the

115
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.890
audience insights section over here or I believe it's actually over in the asset section.

116
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.690
So what you can do is is the difference is you have a Web site you can use a Facebook pixel and then

117
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.770
you could say oh I only want to target people who got to a certain page on my web site and we know this

118
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.030
because we have Facebook pixel we don't worry about that since Graham doesn't have any of that so don't

119
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.420
worry about it.

120
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.330
Now location's it's kind of like we're boosting post.

121
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.610
Where do we want to target so we can say everyone who lives in a location is in the slip.

122
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.440
People who live in this location and people who recently were in this location are traveling this location.

123
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.110
The videos are relevant to you than that something obviously you would pick for us.

124
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.450
We want United States which is pretty dang simple.

125
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.650
And then I would probably just throw in Canada.

126
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.410
Those are primarily my two groups.

127
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.900
Now as you notice as we're doing this if you look over here you're going to have this it looks like

128
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.900
a little dial board.

129
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.430
And generally speaking as you have too many people.

130
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.500
So I added a U.S. and Canada and I haven't had any restrictions on my audience.

131
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.340
It's 260 million people.

132
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.430
Right so your skin is fairly broad as you'll notice just from the graphic.

133
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.880
There's two different corners one is too broad and one is too specific.

134
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.310
Typically speaking you want to keep it in the green area.

135
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.380
And the reason why is just because you have too few people than Facebook or Instagram's you to have

136
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.730
a troubled displaying all of your ads to meet your budget.

137
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.510
And also they're not going to be competing for enough spots which means they actually could potentially

138
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.870
drive up the price for every time you display your ad.

139
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:34.090
And then if it's too broad again it's just it's not good for targeting you're going to be going after

140
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.580
a big swath of people.

141
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.090
And that's just not good in general for conversion.

142
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:40.310
OK.

143
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:46.230
So if we wanted to drill down on what we could do is go over here and narrow the age range that we want.

144
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.580
Now we have obviously access to people as young as 13 and it's going to go lower than 13 but you can't

145
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.890
target them just because of the laws.

146
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:59.050
So I would probably go after the group of people that fits within my target demographic and as you notice

147
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.280
as I'm doing this it's changing this number over here.

148
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.790
So now I'm down to 76 million.

149
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.960
Still way too many people but it doesn't really matter.

150
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.590
So if hit men it's going to cut in half.

151
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.320
There we go about 38 million languages.

152
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:17.410
Generally speaking you know like English speaking so I'll say English and then I'll make sure to collect

153
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.740
all and not UK you ask of it will actually limit me specifically to those countries.

154
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.440
Then what I can do is detail targeting.

155
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:32.920
And Facebook is kind of crazy when it comes to how much they can target you so they track your actions

156
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:38.770
on Facebook outside of Facebook and they can link your Facebook page to your Instagram page.

157
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.640
So if you have an Instagram page in Facebook most people do they'll know.

158
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.610
And therefore they can associate information or that will just kind of blow your mind.

159
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:53.570
Like for instance Facebook can tell if you are planning to move your home soon.

160
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.820
Right.

161
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.520
So I could actually select that as a detailed targeting behavior.

162
00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.500
And they can tell that because they look at all the other websites you've been to outside of Facebook

163
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.780
by storing cookies on your site and by having other websites put pixels and they can see if you've been

164
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.280
looking for movers or searching for that or.

165
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:09.900
Yeah.

166
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:10.840
Anyway it's kind of creepy.

167
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.030
But anyway what we can do is you can add things like demographics interests and behaviors so specifically

168
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:19.330
for innovation nation we might want to go for like technology lovers so I can say technology.

169
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.650
OK.

170
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:25.000
So then right there we have technology information technology Educational Technology wearables military

171
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.760
attack.

172
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.740
You notice this is very similar to the list that we saw in India.

173
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.210
And we're boosting scream probably because they're pulling it from the same place.

174
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.660
Let's say we are going to look for wearable technology.

175
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.840
Let's say we are in on it and that was really really specifically just about that.

176
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.150
And if I was just wearables then wow there we go.

177
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.210
Sixty seven thousand.

178
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.400
That's how much smaller audience just became.

179
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.340
Other things they can do.

180
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.200
Could be like adding in demographics.

181
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.660
So for instance if it's suggested it will give me some things that things might be related.

182
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:58.980
So like a demographic could be people who openly identify as liberal or engage with political content

183
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.540
that is considered liberal.

184
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.580
So if I for some reason only wanted liberal American Canadians who are interested in wearable technology

185
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.560
it could do that other things like behaviors like so this has engaged shoppers and it'll give you a

186
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.050
description as to what that means.

187
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.570
People who have clicked on a call to action button shop now in the past week.

188
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:21.150
So that might be something if you're looking for people who have demonstrated an interest in buying

189
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.830
things already.

190
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.500
So that might be something you could try down here you can add a connection type if you want.

191
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.110
Basically what this means is you are going to try to target people specifically who like your Facebook

192
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.430
page and that's just not really what we're care about since we're trying to do placements on screens

193
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.020
specifically.
