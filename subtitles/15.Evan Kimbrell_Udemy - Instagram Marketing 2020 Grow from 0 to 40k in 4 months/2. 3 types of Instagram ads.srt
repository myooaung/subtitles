00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,560
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,710
So this lecture what we're going to do is talk about the three different types of ads that are available

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,180
to you for Instagram ads.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,540
Now you've heard me say this in The Last Lecture.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,040
Instagram ads are very much like Facebook ads.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:24,440
Really the only difference is that you have a couple extra formats that aren't available on Facebook.

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:31,320
But as far as advertising goes we kind of follow the same basic standards so if you know how to do Facebook

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,290
advertising or you know the basics behind advertising in general those are very easily extended to Instagram.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,380
But in this lecture let's just break down what the three main types of ads are on Instagram.

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,480
So the first thing we have our regular post ads are post ads are ads that are going to show up as if

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,130
it were a regular post in your news feed.

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,290
Obviously it's going to display to anybody that you target regardless of whether or not they've even

13
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,660
heard of you or follow your account.

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,120
Now we can see a preview of the different types of ads within that type of.

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,920
And we can do photo ads videos and Carousel ads.

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,050
Now I see regular post ads appealing to two different types of people.

17
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:16,080
One you don't have an Instagram account and you want to reach the Instagram audience which I don't blame

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,580
you.

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,800
Currently it's something like eight hundred million active users and of those eight hundred million

20
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,060
60 percent have displayed some interest in purchasing on the platform.

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,080
Facebook can't even say that the second type of person is someone who has an account on instagram but

22
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,380
they want to run an ad that doesn't really jive with their timeline or the regular post-comp position

23
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,950
that they've already established.

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,330
Now story ads are the second type of ads and these are vertical ads that are going to run in between

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,040
stories that a user would normally watch.

26
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,340
I remember at the very first screen in the homescreen of an screamy see at the top all the stories that

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,040
you can view in between those sets of stories that's when ads will run and these ads are typically going

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,870
to be 19:20 by 10 80 pixels and they're relatively new.

29
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:10,680
I mean like a story they're kind of low effort and they're designed to get people who are just kind

30
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,540
of mindlessly going through their stories list with stories you have to keep in mind that these are

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,710
new right.

32
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:23,400
So because they're new they haven't established a lot of traction or a lot of baseline information to

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,700
kind of work with with regard to how effective they are.

34
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,580
So keep that in mind because they're new they actually have really good click through metrics right

35
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,150
now.

36
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,940
But if you know anything about advertising it's that as people get more and more used to ads they become

37
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,620
less and less effective.

38
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,770
We call that the law of should click through.

39
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,470
So keep in line with stories you have to focus your content on being very engaging in the first three

40
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,520
seconds because unlike a regular post ad it disappears.

41
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:53,790
Right.

42
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,220
The person has to be really on the ball and they have to be really engaged in order to have the wherewithal

43
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,960
to click on your name or scroll up to do something with the ad or the post.

44
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,210
They can see it and then scroll back to it later.

45
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,160
They can sit there and stare at it all day long a story only lasts up to 15 seconds if it's a video

46
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,720
or 10 seconds if it's an image.

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,120
Now the last type of ad on Instagram will be called boosted ads.

48
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,920
And essentially what that is is when you have a post on your account you can boost it and you do that

49
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,200
inside the app itself.

50
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,060
It's actually pretty straightforward.

51
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,170
But what you do is you essentially pay for extra reviews for people to see your post.

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,580
Now the don't have a reason why you might do this one of them might be that you're trying to grow your

53
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,610
account and you notice that one of your posts did really really well.

54
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,910
That's a pretty common when you say OK well maybe I'll spend $5 a day to get this out there to get more

55
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,430
and more attention for my account.

56
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,470
The alternative to that is let's say you're running an ad right.

57
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,420
And as opposed to wanting to blast that ad to your followers over and over again you could boost one

58
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,810
of your promotional posts and use that as a way to essentially get more people looking at it and potentially

59
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,960
get more conversions.

60
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,330
OK so those are the big three.

61
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:12,030
Keep in mind we can boost our own post though we already posted on her Instagram account that can be

62
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,700
pretty useful if you have a really really good post that's doing really well and you'd like to extend

63
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,700
that or if you want to kind of slip in a promotional post and then advertise it that way.

64
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,280
We also have regular timeline posts which just show up as if it were a regular post.

65
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,650
However they're not going to be associated with your account.

66
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,330
So you don't have to worry about those people than seeing that post associated with your account.

67
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,650
Maybe it's too spammy Maybe it's to sales the Who knows they're great.

68
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,950
Even if you don't have an Instagram account because anybody can run them and use Facebook.

69
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,540
Targeting System to pick whoever they want to hit and then the last one were stories and those are relatively

70
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,610
new to the metrics are pretty enticing right now and for the most part they're cheap.

71
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,930
However we don't know how long these will last or if they'll stand the test of time.

72
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,730
So it's hard to say whether or not here is more valuable than say a dollar and a regular post.

73
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,710
All right so the next set of lectures will drill down into each one of these ads and then you'll watch

74
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,690
me run an ad of each type.

75
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,100
OK.

76
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:10,670
See you then.
