Hey guys.
1

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.860
Welcome back.
2

3
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:09.090
All right, so real quickly, I want to cover a topic that
you kind of need to understand before we move
3

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.930
on to the next lectures, and that question is,
you know, we're going to create an account,
4

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.910
so what type of account are you
specifically going to create?
5

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.350
Now, this doesn't have to necessarily be about the
content that you're going to create on the account,
6

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.100
doesn't matter if you're in this to create photo streams
of cats laying around piles of money, (it's a multi-million
7

8
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.130
follower account), it doesn't matter if you're trying to create
a photo stream of dads and their poor fashion choices,
8

9
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.860
follower account), it doesn't matter if you're trying to create
a photo stream of dads and their poor fashion choices,
9

10
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.570
and this one, I'm not even sure if this is funny or terrible.
10

11
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.260
It's an account for Stevie Wonder,
where every photo is just a black square.
11

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.520
It's an account for Stevie Wonder,
where every photo is just a black square.
12

13
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.280
Nah, I don't get it. What we do care about is what you
are promoting, and that determines which of the three
13

14
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.540
different account types we have.
14

15
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.400
Now, the first account type is your standard business account.
15

16
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.330
This type of account will represent your business,
have your business name as its name, and you'll use
16

17
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.500
it to keep people engaged with whatever it is you're
making and whatever it is your company is doing.
17

18
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.030
When you post comments, it'll be from your company,
that's who they assume is talking to them.
18

19
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.500
Now, there's roughly 8 billion of these on Instagram,
which is impressive, considering there's only
19

20
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.840
about 7.5 billion people on the planet.
20

21
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.030
The second type of account is a personal
or often called a personality account.
21

22
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.380
Now, you're going to promote yourself in this case, or in some weirder cases, you'll create a fake person, like a parody person,
22

23
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.510
Now, you're going to promote yourself in this case, or in some weirder cases, you'll create a fake person, like a parody person,
23

24
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.380
but those are the edge cases.
24

25
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.180
Messages from this account look like they come from you,
an individual, and the account is meant to promote you.
25

26
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.010
Messages from this account look like they come from you,
an individual, and the account is meant to promote you.
26

27
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.950
So whether it's because you just want to seem popular
and cool, or your actual business is yourself, whatever,
27

28
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.050
this is your account type.
28

29
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.650
Most of these accounts consist of like semi-celebrities,
average Joes, and, undeniably, some lizard people
29

30
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.760
in there. The last account type is what I call, at least,
other people have different names for them,
30

31
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.180
I call them themed accounts, and these are accounts
that don't represent a company or a person,
31

32
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.560
they just serve to cover a theme and then deliver
content that matches that specific theme.
32

33
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.460
This could be like a funny meme account, a motivational
quote account, I'm sure you've seen those, a tips
33

34
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.660
and tricks account, whatever.
34

35
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.530
It doesn't have a face on it.
35

36
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.410
There are accounts dedicated to the color yellow.
36

37
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.420
There's accounts designed to shame commenters
that post on photos from models.
37

38
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.800
That's actually one of my favorite ones.
38

39
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.410
I don't know if it's still up, it's called Comment Casanovas.
39

40
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.040
You can make a themed account on anything, but
generally the idea is that it tangentially supports your
40

41
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.190
business, and that you'll use it in some way to push
attention to your business or product at a later date.
41

42
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.640
business, and that you'll use it in some way to push
attention to your business or product at a later date.
42

43
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.640
So, have a think. You don't have to decide right now,
because after you create your account actually, you
43

44
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.050
can change virtually all of your details later on.
44

45
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.570
But you should think about it first, because tools,
ideas, and tips in the next set of lectures are really
45

46
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.480
just going to depend on what type of account you're making.
46

47
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.300
So, in each lecture, I'm going to say, if you're a personal account, do this, if you're a business account, do this, if you're a
47

48
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.900
themed account, do this.
48

49
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.880
So it really helps if you know this beforehand.
49

50
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.360
Got it? Okay.
50

51
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.050
Got it? Okay.
51

52
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.890
Be a business, be yourself, or be a theme. Pretty simple.
52

53
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.630
Be a business, be yourself, or be a theme. Pretty simple.
53

54
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.060
I'm going to create a theme account in the
follow along sections, and it will be glorious.
54

55
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.810
I'll see you then.
