00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.790
Hey guys.
1

2
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.630
Welcome back.
2

3
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.070
OK.
3

4
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.960
So this is the follow along, if you want to see what I did,
4

5
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.470
you can look at the list that I made for my direct,
indirect, and then just adjacent competitor accounts.
5

6
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:22.120
So I did 140-ish, maybe 135, I just did it from bouncing 
around from account to account to account to account.
6

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.580
Yeah, I got distracted by some accounts,
7

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.430
but I just kept using that "find similar" one,
8

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.680
and then occasionally I go to the search and search
for some keywords to see if I can find other ones.
9

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.740
I also looked at who the accounts were following.
10

11
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.330
Sometimes that helps, because a lot of times
people follow people who are in a similar space.
11

12
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.030
And this is what I kind of came up with, and it's not exact,
12

13
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.230
I think that anytime you make a decision to reach 
out to somebody or to look at their stuff, you'll
13

14
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.800
spend some time thinking about them.
14

15
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.380
spend some time thinking about them.
15

16
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.420
So there might be some in here that are not direct competitors.
16

17
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.390
I just thought these are the ones that are most similar.
17

18
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.850
These are the ones that are similar-ish.
18

19
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.530
And then the last ones are just ones that are in the space,
but don't really have that much to do with what I'm doing.
19

20
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.250
And then the last ones are just ones that are in the space,
but don't really have that much to do with what I'm doing.
20

21
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.200
So as you can see there's just a bunch, and over 
here I put followers, then I put daily posts.
21

22
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.000
Now, daily posts, again, not entirely accurate, because 
22

23
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.370
I was just basing it off of the last day they
posted, how many did they post that day,
23

24
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.130
but it does give you somewhat of an idea.
24

25
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.110
Although I did oftentimes see, if you said like three posts, 
I would think that was very active, but then I looked at it,
25

26
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.790
Although I did oftentimes see, if you said like three posts, 
I would think that was very active, but then I looked at it,
26

27
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.900
I would just say, oh, but they don't actually post daily.
27

28
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.320
They just posted three some other time. What's useful 
over here is I put them in links. Now, because
28

29
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.020
they're in links I can very quickly go and check them out.
29

30
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.050
So this one is a huge account, so we can go over to that. I can
30

31
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.020
just click it, I go to a new tab, and look at them - 2.2 million.
31

32
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.510
And I can just check it and then see what exactly is their thing.
32

33
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.130
As you can see, they kind of have bad aesthetics.
33

34
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.460
They really seem to switch between 
different types of text, lettering.
34

35
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.210
They also seem to use this really standard meme style, there's 
a lot of these meme generators out there you can use, and
35

36
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.510
they give you this white text, and you throw it on there,
and people, for whatever reason, are just used to it,
36

37
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.920
but I think it looks crappy.
37

38
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.750
You notice that they also do shoutouts.
38

39
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.440
So this is something we'll talk about later.
39

40
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.720
Shoutout is when you post something 
from someone else's account.
40

41
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.590
So like, right here, this is not theirs, 
because you can see @lylecoram,
41

42
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.570
and then they said "by Lyle Coram."
42

43
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.460
So whether or not they did that for money,
they did that for a trade or whatever,
43

44
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.160
we'll kind of explore that later on,
44

45
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.650
but that shows that they're at least 
open to posting other people's stuff.
45

46
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.940
The only issue I see here is that they have a lot of 
followers, so that's something that we'll have to kind
46

47
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.670
of figure out later on, if it's worth working with them, 
especially as our account won't be that large for a while.
47

48
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.780
of figure out later on, if it's worth working with them, 
especially as our account won't be that large for a while.
48

49
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.350
So, okay.
49

50
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.060
So, okay.
50

51
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.200
You know, you can check them out, and I can 
put links, I can put some comments here.
51

52
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:08.060
So for them I would say "low quality posts, 
meme based, do shoutouts."
52

53
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.380
OK, so that's useful later on.
53

54
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.480
I can come back to that.
54

55
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.770
Now, there's other ones that they just didn't 
have a lot of followers or they were just dead.
55

56
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.480
So a lot of times there are ones who are just not active.
56

57
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.810
I put them anyway, just because why not?
57

58
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.050
They're similar enough, I could go to them and check them 
out. If I can only pick ones that were active right this second,
58

59
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.180
They're similar enough, I could go to them and check them 
out. If I can only pick ones that were active right this second,
59

60
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.620
then this process would have taken a lot more
time. As I go and I notice that, hey, these don't,
60

61
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.060
these are not actually active accounts,
61

62
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.340
I'll start removing them and kind of pruning this
list a little bit more. So here's one that has 30 posts,
62

63
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:48.320
let's see when the last one was - 2 days ago. Okay, so 
surprisingly, they actually are active. Daily tech and business
63

64
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.730
motivation for billionaires in the making, I've this
one 101 times. And it looks like they're kind of
64

65
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.900
just posting the same stuff that everybody else does.
65

66
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.280
So this one is worth keeping track of as they grow.
66

67
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.450
They might be interesting and they might be doing 
something that might be interesting or worth following.
67

68
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.090
Now, down here, you'll notice those two ones I 
picked are really very similar to what I'm doing.
68

69
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.100
Innovations and technology, that was emerging tech, and that 
was Awesome Inventions, pretty similar. Let's say down here,
69

70
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.020
Innovations and technology, that was emerging tech, and that 
was Awesome Inventions, pretty similar. Let's say down here,
70

71
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.400
like if we went to @educational_innovations, I consider 
them indirect because they're actually more of
71

72
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.810
like a teacher thing, it looks like it's 
for kids who are in science class.
72

73
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.760
So it's very specific, and they're also not particularly 
aggressive about growing their account.
73

74
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.090
It's more like they're trying to just
promote this company website.
74

75
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.350
It's not like they're trying to make a themed 
account, doing the exact same thing I'm doing.
75

76
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.490
Yeah, and these are all just, "Hey, look at this 
funky thing that happens. Isn't physics fun?"
76

77
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.850
Yeah, and these are all just, "Hey, look at this 
funky thing that happens. Isn't physics fun?"
77

78
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.710
Right?
78

79
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.380
OK.
79

80
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.410
So that's a pretty good example of an indirect.
80

81
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.560
I definitely could possibly work with them for marketing,
81

82
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.030
but you'll notice as you scroll through it, I don't 
actually see they post anybody else's stuff.
82

83
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.230
It might be the case that they delete their stuff, but no.
83

84
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.270
So I can put over here,
84

85
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.380
"Probably not a business account."
85

86
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.490
I said "No sharing of other posts"-  that I can see at least.
86

87
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.160
OK.
87

88
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.480
Other ones I put, you'll notice, let's say, things like "mostly 
quotes." Quotes are fine, it's easy to work with that,
88

89
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.820
it's just that they're probably something that I want to 
balance out, because I'm only doing quotes every
89

90
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.690
now and then, and that's only because I use it as 
filler at the very beginning, and I'm probably going
90

91
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.900
to notice whether or not quotes get
good engagement pretty quickly.
91

92
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.530
So again, that's one thing that I'm kind of keeping in
mind, not really worth following a lot of the quote
92

93
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.050
makers. Other accounts in the space were just ones that 
I was kind of going off of "I think these people would also
93

94
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.980
be interested in what I have."
94

95
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.380
So like @letsdesigndaily, dedicated innovations and innovators 
that are creating change, challenging... blah blah blah.
95

96
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.100
OK.
96

97
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.880
These are more for specific design items.
97

98
00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.240
These are more for specific design items.
98

99
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.860
So this is something like IDEO or a company 
that makes product design innovations.
99

100
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.910
That's really just a smaller subset.
100

101
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.230
I generally think this is complimentary.
101

102
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:16.350
I'm talking about medical breakthroughs and new 
technology, like quantum computing and Bitcoin,
102

103
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.690
and this is more like, "Hey, look, an ergonomic chair!"
103

104
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:26.640
But still, these people probably 
are going to like what I'm posting.
104

105
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.510
So that's something worth keeping in mind.
105

106
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.140
They also seem to have good aesthetics.
106

107
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.990
So they do collage photos or carousel photos.
107

108
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.430
So there's just a lot of them, and they're very clean and nice.
108

109
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.940
Yeah.
109

110
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.480
OK.
110

111
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.790
So that's a pretty good snapshot of ones that are
very similar, almost doing the exact same thing,
111

112
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.090
ones that are slightly off, and then ones that I think 
have groups that are interested in what I'm doing,
112

113
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.930
like @entrepreneurship, for instance.
113

114
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:59.800
Not exactly the same thing, but there is someone that 
I can either learn from or collaborate with in the future.
114

115
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.390
Not exactly the same thing, but there is someone that 
I can either learn from or collaborate with in the future.
115

116
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.050
Okay, so that list took a couple of hours, to be honest,
116

117
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.720
to put that together, but it's incredibly useful, and
117

118
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.610
I'm going to keep going back to it later on in the course 
as we grow the account. Okay, see you next lecture.
