1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,490
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,490
OK so this is day.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,890
I have no idea.

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,480
I think after the fact we're gonna have to figure this out and label it.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,160
Greetings from New York City.

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,570
OK so I have an update on three different things so you can see we're at twelve thousand nine hundred

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,360
followers.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,030
I got a promotion from a large account.

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:27,020
They just picked up one of our posts kind of randomly and posted it so that one day we woke up and next

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,140
like 700 followers.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,160
That was nice.

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,610
I would imagine that will happen more as the account gets larger and we get more attention.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:41,120
We're going to show you this by e-mail looks like any other spike.

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,960
So right here and then it goes up like that.

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,880
Look at the table.

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,490
You pretty much always over 100 at least for the last week and then there was one period of time where

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,760
for whatever reason we just weren't growing very fast.

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,320
OK so some updates one we're going to try a new posting strategy.

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:58,700
OK.

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,820
So now we have 394 posts.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,960
And the thing is with Instagram's new algorithm update they just don't give any attention to nonperforming

22
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:10,910
posts.

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,630
And if you post something and it just doesn't do well immediately like let's see this one.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,980
378 views 52 likes.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,280
And then if you look on the actual app because you know they don't give you data on the web version

26
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,850
to get the insights.

27
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,250
Yeah.

28
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,860
So literally one less than one percent of the people it reached weren't following you and you can see

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:39,050
most impressions came from the home screen or from the home screen basically.

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,640
So that means that people who were following me already like they're not going to pop up in the home

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,810
screen if they don't follow you.

32
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,380
And then other would be you know that's where those three people went over who were knew saw it.

33
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,390
So you'll notice quickly that like it either performs or it doesn't.

34
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,650
So if we went and tried to find one that did perform well it's like this one.

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah 24 percent weren't following us.

36
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,130
That's good right.

37
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,440
So I actually pulled in some people that I hadn't before but then if you look at the next one I see

38
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,640
that one one did fine.

39
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,240
This one did fine over the suitcase one for instance.

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,120
Yeah terrible less than 1 percent.

41
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,460
Turl So it's pretty much open or shut within Syria now which kind of sucks but so what we're gonna do

42
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,850
is we're going to go to the 394 post and we're going to pick out the best ones the ones that did get

43
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,150
at least over 20 percent distribution and had the highest engagement rates.

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,290
Now I do that using iconic square.

45
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:47,610
And then also just some manual work just scrolling through and then seeing what exactly which ones obviously

46
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,110
did better you know off the top of my head already know some of them like that plane that can land in

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,000
the water.

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,600
One of my favorites was the upright seats on airlines.

49
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,240
That was a funny one because you got huge amounts and occasionally gets people does he hit which I understand.

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:09,000
So we're going to do is take those and then see how many we have and then we're going to do is we're

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,840
just going to post those repeatedly and delete them as we go.

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,820
So you know there's a lot of other ways to do it.

53
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,690
We're going to play around with that.

54
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:21,610
But my idea is that we're going to take the best winners let's say there's 20 of them and post them

55
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,900
in the same exact pattern as this post.

56
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:29,160
You know one after the other after the other and then once you get to 20 then we essentially start deleting

57
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,790
the beginning of that loop and then you basically at the end of whatever two weeks three week period

58
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,530
he to be back here.

59
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,380
So you have these three hand it might look for a second like we had been posting a lot but that's it

60
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,170
because we're going to start the loop over again.

61
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:52,710
And the idea here is just that if I can just only post one side to well then my per day growth rate

62
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,490
is going to be higher.

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,410
Now some accounts do this some of the multi million follower accounts.

64
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,730
All they do is post like the same three posts over and over again.

65
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,440
And all they do is focus on making their wall as high quality as possible.

66
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,750
They make sure that you know they post three that are really popular.

67
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,090
Someone sees it and then when they go to their profile it's already a wall of the best hits so basically

68
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,820
they're focusing on it seems like is conversion right.

69
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:25,170
Because you look at my account you'll see how many people click through to a post and then you can see

70
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:25,870
how many followers.

71
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,690
That's effectively like my conversion rate.

72
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:36,490
So like this one right this glowing there was was a company building selling lantern that runs and you

73
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,250
cool.

74
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,210
OK so 15 profile visits and out of that one.

75
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,140
OK so one out of 15 essentially is the conversion rate.

76
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,540
Now there's other ones that just have better conversion rates so we're going to focus on those.

77
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,960
See if we can find on this one for some reason.

78
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,790
Wow there was huge amounts of 173 Wow and 130 followers just from that.

79
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,480
So like that one for instance just does really well for whatever reason.

80
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,560
OK so that's all we're going to focus on upping our conversion rate and only posting the best.

81
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,680
And we should see that we're going to grow a lot faster.

82
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,780
The big question is one to insert new content because we still have a lot of content in the content

83
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,150
pipeline and how long is this leave going to last because if it only lasts like a week then people are

84
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,920
going to notice you just post the same stuff over and over again.

85
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,890
So that's probably going to be a negative.

86
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,600
So I don't know.

87
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,120
We'll see how that works and we'll kind of decide.

88
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,310
My inclination is that we're going to slowly kind of trickle in new content to see how it performs and

89
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,210
if it does perform we add it to the loop and if it doesn't well then it just kind of stays up on the

90
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:43,810
screen and it you know it'll get buried over time OK the next thing with the zombies we were running

91
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,760
into that problem where they all want phone validation all the time.

92
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,640
And what sucked was I was using alcohol burner and I was just annoyed because I had to pay credit every

93
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,720
single time and they only last a certain amount of time and you know so I get a burner account less

94
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,640
14 days and then after 15 days the count needs phone validation again.

95
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,660
So I don't want to do that.

96
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,340
So what I'm going to do is I'm setting up the person that does a lot of the project management virtual

97
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,120
assistants to be able to do it herself she's in different country though so she can't always use these

98
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,250
phone numbers.

99
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,490
So what it it is I found in a system called next mo.

100
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,880
You guys are familiar with Twilio.

101
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,030
It's basically just as a mass system.

102
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,070
It doesn't look like much to someone who's not a developer but it allows you to create text message

103
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,740
applications easily somebody and it's a lot of gobbledygook.

104
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,630
But what you can do really easily is you can buy numbers right here so you go to numbers.

105
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:46,470
You were number by numbers and then I can ask for whatever I want so I can say United States on this

106
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,120
mess mobile lines.

107
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,020
And then if I want to be really picky like I only want numbers that are in San Francisco which start

108
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,800
with 4 1 5 or 1 4 1 5 Yeah I know there's like 6 5 0 as well too but doesn't matter anyway.

109
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:06,160
So these are all like San Francisco numbers and I can pay sixty seven euro cents which is like I don't

110
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,580
know depends on the conversion it's something like 75 cents and 80 cents U.S..

111
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,190
So I can buy that and pay that per month.

112
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,450
That's a hell of a lot better than doing the burner with the burner on it being like fleeced like three

113
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,090
dollars a month per account to keep doing them over and over again.

114
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:26,200
So got a bunch of numbers right here and there what I do is I just take a number like this and then

115
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,690
I insert it into one of the accounts for phone validation like so.

116
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:39,580
So for six nine I have to write it down because I can't copy my clipboard over to the Microsoft remote

117
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,230
server and I go to my remote server.

118
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,710
Let's say we want to validate science of the world.

119
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,340
And I can do this I can do it easy and lazy.

120
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,890
But the number here.

121
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,690
One two three.

122
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,210
OK.

123
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,030
Now verify my phone.

124
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,120
Now check your phone verification.

125
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,740
Then I can do really easily just go here.

126
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:11,800
A mass and then down here search messages and it's kind of clunky because it's just like a log system

127
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,930
and display in live time.

128
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,480
But whatever.

129
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,800
So then I can just paste that number I had search and there we go.

130
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:24,250
So it's 4 6 7 5 9 3 4 6 7 5 9 3.

131
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,470
There we go verify with code and walla.

132
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,000
OK.

133
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,210
So it's not necessarily faster than the burner.

134
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,930
I think it's maybe a little bit faster but these are persistent numbers going on to keep buying them.

135
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,920
But also I can just hand this off someone else so they can do it whenever they need to be validated.

136
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,690
Now that's fine.

137
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:46,240
And if you notice they grow when they're valid when they're enduring the phone validation they disappear

138
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,060
so they don't grow.

139
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,970
So you can notice like they go down they lose followers when that happens so we're just going to focus

140
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,130
on making sure they're constantly validated while I spend some time and experiment with phone verified

141
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,420
accounts and aged account see if we can get around that.

142
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,140
We did take some time and go through these and change all the settings so that they weren't just posting

143
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,900
this one account my main account.

144
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:12,370
They're also posting from other accounts and also that they didn't have blatant like they didn't have

145
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,870
an station over everything.

146
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:20,500
Change it up a little bit and it didn't really seem to matter I think because these accounts are essentially

147
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,620
flagged as being probably Spammy.

148
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,850
So they're not really going to change their minds about these accounts.

149
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,420
We to create new ones and start from scratch.

150
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,210
But he didn't use phone validations.

151
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,440
I think it still should be worthwhile just to keep them constantly validated.

152
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,880
But because now we have a system that's faster it should be something easier.

153
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,750
I thought about making a new application for this and making it really simple.

154
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,740
What would happen is you put in a number of click verify and then you go to a u r l and it would just

155
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,590
display the numbers for all of them so you don't have to go to the log screen and then search the number

156
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,340
and then find it.

157
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,470
But you know it only saves you like two steps.

158
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:02,260
So it really wasn't worth having to figure out and then deal with that like do you store the messages

159
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,520
what framework do you use to post it.

160
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,640
Oh you need S-sh access on your server but I know it doesn't work that so.

161
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:09,170
Yeah.

162
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,330
Anyway that's hard to do now.

163
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,470
So these should be running a lot more smoothly.

164
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:19,470
The last change is that Instagram just released what are called Blake quote stories.

165
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:26,150
So the idea is that when you do stories a lot of people want to reference a post they have right now

166
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,920
when we do stories we've been doing that but we've been having to edit them independent Lee.

167
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,870
So we would make the video for like this suitcase right.

168
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:41,470
But if we go to this story we would have to do no because nothing we had to do a really short version

169
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,630
of it with a one sentence explanation.

170
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,820
Here's the suitcase and that was fine.

171
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:54,160
It's just that again if I want to go and see the account do I have to do like I have to scroll up.

172
00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:00,010
Well if you're an account you can scroll up because it'll say see more and then it'll take you to an

173
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,500
embedded browser to the Instagram account.

174
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,840
So it's just not it's not useful like that it's not going to get a lot of lot more engagement doesn't

175
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,250
stay within the app.

176
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:15,820
Now all we can do though is just share the videos themselves and it'll show it as if it's like a card

177
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,230
and automatically get the background.

178
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:23,770
So what you do is you go down here and click on this little paper airplane thing and then go and post

179
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,610
the story.

180
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,500
OK so then right here I have the post you know automatically does the background and then I have to

181
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,950
do is just put a quick description up here.

182
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:40,630
Click it and then I'll you know say it's a baby seat suitcase and then I'll put you know the face whatever

183
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:49,300
at the top and then you know the rest of it's up to you will probably do is put a tag for the account

184
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:55,340
down here so they can just click it if they want to do that and then maybe a hash tag.

185
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:55,690
Right.

186
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,720
Because remember these can show up and hash tag feeds.

187
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:05,170
So this one I don't like child innovation or like child technology or something might work so you can

188
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,520
do.

189
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,430
I don't even know there's a hash I would have to look at it first.

190
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,620
But you kind of get the ideas of child trafficking.

191
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:21,170
No child technician no tech child tech teltech whatever.

192
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,250
So there you go.

193
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,620
And be careful you don't delete these.

194
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:25,980
There you go.

195
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,760
So that's what the posts are going start to look like.

196
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,270
And then what can happen is if they want to see the post they just click it and it goes see post takes

197
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,000
him directly to my sis my account.

198
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,260
And that's way way better.

199
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,490
More people are going engage more often.

200
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,970
They think they also work better personally in my opinion.

201
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,500
But anyway so just following up with the trends that'll be a lot better.

202
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:45,810
OK.

203
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,970
Pass that one I'm working on I'm going to start working more on the aged accounts for the zombies and

204
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:58,140
then also spending more time getting these best hits kind of post like the post loop.

205
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,550
Correct.

206
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,290
And then I'm also starting to kind of conceptualize what some of the giveaways and the live video strategies

207
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:04,830
are going to be.

208
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,540
So those will be coming up.

209
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,010
All right guys.

210
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,610
Cool.

211
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,790
I'll see you next time.
