1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,750
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:08,430
So in this lecture what we're going to do is show you the truly automated way of doing outreach for

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,500
collaboration.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,640
We did do that using the tool called Jarvi that I explained in the zombies section and it might have

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,930
covered it in the advanced hashtags section.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,340
But either way you should have this set up if you haven't done this go back to the zombie section and

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,570
watch how to set this up.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,440
Jeremy if you forgot runs on a virtual server.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,700
Now if you have a Windows PC you can run it on your computer but you have to leave your computer open

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,850
the entire time.

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,710
That's not realistic.

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,010
We're trying to do a 24/7 strategy so I covered how you can open up a very three US account and set

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,110
this up very easily so it will just go to the account that I have automatically set up and it looks

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,820
like this.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,840
All right I don't get overwhelmed by all the options on Jarvi.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,750
It's a lot.

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,920
And we covered it a bit in the zombie section.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,320
So if you're unfamiliar I'd go and check that out again.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,730
Really kind of just breaks down in these sections right here at the dashboard just shows you that it's

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,600
working.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,930
Social profiles is where you hook up all of your accounts so we have a lot of zombie accounts on here.

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,000
And also innovation sation is on it as well as you can see right there.

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,600
And then you have things like tools Gobal tools settings proxy manages my account proxy meaning it doesn't

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,590
really matter because I'm using my main account settings doesn't really matter and I really could touch

25
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,490
that same with global tools where we care about here is tools.

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,450
OK once we are tools and we see all of our accounts just go to your main account which you should have

27
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,530
hooked up at this point if you haven't then go through the process we covered before and hook it up.

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,750
All you have to do is go to social profiles and then add profile you add your information and it's really

29
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,820
as simple as that.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,160
To go back to Tools click on your main account.

31
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,100
All right now here we have all of those tools at Jarvi gives us some it's kind of overkill iks can't

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,540
use them all.

33
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,840
But what we're going to do specifically is we're going to use the section right here called contact

34
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,110
right now in contact we have it set up into six different sections.

35
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,550
Now what contact is for is for automatically contacting people.

36
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,420
Right.

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,610
So as we covered it before in the lecture we hired someone to do this.

38
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:07,020
The whole idea is we need to find accounts to match a certain criteria and then we need to automatically

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,760
message them.

40
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,300
OK.

41
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,480
So the Jervy we're going to have their system automatically find them and automatically message them

42
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,770
we're going to set parameters such that it doesn't get out of control.

43
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,970
So what you do here is you always start over on the far left with extract users or auto extract and

44
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,290
then what's going to happen is then you're going to set the message that gets sent to them here and

45
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,060
they use extracted users and then work and ignore the send message you follow because that's not we're

46
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,340
going to find people and an auto reply to new messages.

47
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,910
Again that doesn't matter to us because we're doing an outreach strategy.

48
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,400
We're not trying to get accounts to follow us and then message them.

49
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,710
And then the last thing is send messages.

50
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,730
That's where he said all of your main criteria for how to run this.

51
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,550
So we'll go to extract users and extract users the way that this works is it's a manual tool.

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,300
OK.

53
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,720
What we do is we tell it how many accounts we want are out there and then we give it some parameters

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,610
for what to pull another way that this works is you type it in kind of programmatically.

55
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,700
So if for instance I wanted to pull all of the people who follow.

56
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,480
And so the example is Barack Obama I put following slash Barack Obama I'd hit extract users.

57
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,150
And then what would happen is they would start compiling them over here and use extract users.

58
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,990
So we would see total rate here start to increase.

59
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,950
You can also do it ways like through Leiker So people who like posts from Barack Obama people who comment

60
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,960
on his post.

61
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:31,680
But you can also do things like people who comment on a specific post or people that tag a certain post

62
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,220
or even just specific users if you know them or even if you want to target the people who watch your

63
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,330
own story views.

64
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,340
That's great but that's not how we're going to do it.

65
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,010
Now if I was trying to think where can I find a lot of accounts that potentially are the right size

66
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,300
that post about technology or innovation.

67
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:53,370
Well I probably go after hash tag search right so hash tag search meaning if I type in this hash tag

68
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,560
it can give me all the users either post or interact in that area.

69
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,030
And again it doesn't really matter because as long as they give it the criteria of the size of the account

70
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,410
it's going to get rid of all the random people that we don't care about.

71
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,070
So for us we're going to say hash search slash and then we're going to give it.

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,960
And then say innovation.

73
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,960
OK so that was one of our biggest ones.

74
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,390
So let's say yeah give me 50.

75
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
We're just in to this as a test to make sure we have it right.

76
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,720
Then we're going to the auto extract.

77
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,630
Now now here we have similar criteria that we can set that we set before when we are doing follow backs

78
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,480
and auto follows.

79
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,160
So do want to skip non-English names.

80
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,730
Yes.

81
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,300
Because we only want English speaking people in our account.

82
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,640
Otherwise there are going to be able to appreciate our content skill or engagement right.

83
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,050
There's a number of followers and it follows that a specific range.

84
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,610
This is essentially the jackpot.

85
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,760
This is what we really want to focus on and make sure you do it.

86
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,610
So right here it says the number of followers do we really care about followings.

87
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,030
Well I don't know that's kind of hard to say.

88
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:58,350
So what we'll do is the same criteria used before so we'll say minimum is 15000 and then the maximum

89
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,280
is going be that 75 in the range then for the wings.

90
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,870
Well we might want to keep this below a certain amount just to make sure it's a real account.

91
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,010
It's not an account that's just catering to mass followers.

92
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:15,410
So the ratio really we really actually do care about it so on the low end let's say if it's 15000 then

93
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:22,680
I wouldn't want someone of 15000 to have more than say 2000 followers and it's 75000 again 8000 followers.

94
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,800
Is that still pretty liberal.

95
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,230
If they have that many followers It means that they're clearly using follow boughts which is fine.

96
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,290
It just means that they're not doing a very good job of it.

97
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,140
Ok then I can look for things like user bio or must contain any of the following words I could do this

98
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,650
if I wanted to say something like technology like innovation like iPhones or something like that.

99
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:48,530
But for me I don't really care enough to do that because I'd have to put a lot of keywords to get a

100
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,720
good spread and I have to keep coming back here to figure out what keywords you've already exhausted

101
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,990
which I don't really want to do.

102
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,980
And then you can do some you know doesn't have certain keywords.

103
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,820
We can look for people with a minimum number of posts that could be important.

104
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,240
Right.

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,890
So I might say that one just because it might be the case you find an account that has 75000 people

106
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,060
on it but they only post it 10 times and that just means that they bought all of their followers so

107
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,780
we might want to be a little more discerning with this.

108
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,510
But again remember there are accounts that don't post that many because they delete them and repost

109
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,930
them.

110
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,150
But I think typically like 50 is a good low baseline to go for.

111
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,640
OK now down here we have other ones like Skipp business counts.

112
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,760
No it doesn't really matter.

113
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,260
Skip account to the Web site now again and we don't really care about any of these.

114
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,850
These are all perfectly fine extract only doesn't really matter.

115
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,810
We don't know and we care about his languages.

116
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,210
Great.

117
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:37,660
OK.

118
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,020
So now we're going to run the extraction just to see if it seems to work.

119
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,330
Then we'll extract users get it then it's going to post down here and it says The link is going we have

120
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,480
our search innovation it's a status pending.

121
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,850
OK so it says it's a system we just kind of have to wait for it to do it.

122
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,090
But in the meantime we can set up our auto extract.

123
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,210
We always go back and check that once it's done.

124
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,420
So with auto extraction we would do the same thing we did over here.

125
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,860
But again remember try to test this out a couple of times just to make sure that you're getting the

126
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,310
right group of people.

127
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:16,490
So we might say hash tag search ovation and then we can always add another one if we want to like hash

128
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:30,920
tag search so we can say like future is Twan Ashtar search could say like cool science maybe try that.

129
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,890
OK.

130
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:37,370
Now since it's automatic We just have to tell it when it needs Iran so we could say run extraction daily

131
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,600
at a specific time or an extraction every whatever.

132
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,200
And then how many do we want over time what time they extract it.

133
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,140
Well this is just something again you're gonna have to work on and tailor my experience.

134
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,300
You can have it run.

135
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,600
Let's just say run every 24 hours I that's perfectly fine and say get.

136
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,450
Well you could.

137
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,490
I'd say 50 is fine because it's going to pull 50 and automatically message 50 so is it OK to auto contact

138
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,950
50 people in a day.

139
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,810
Yeah that's normal if your auto contacting 200 there might be a problem unless you were really really

140
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,210
doing this laser targeted.

141
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,640
So again since we're doing the autocrats will use the same tools that we use before they skip on those

142
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,600
names on a set the same settings here

143
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,030
OK.

144
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:29,910
So now that we have that we can go ahead and start the extraction process and what it should do is start

145
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,590
compiling a list which we can then use and use extracted users.

146
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,220
OK.

147
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,800
So let's go ahead and run it.

148
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,320
All right so gives us the same message had before it says pending.

149
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,080
But it has three different ones this time.

150
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,460
OK.

151
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,220
While we're waiting on these to actually extract their users can take anywhere from 10 minutes to an

152
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,640
hour.

153
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,650
Not really sure.

154
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,100
Kind of just depends if Jarvi is doing other things at the moment so we can set up this section right

155
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,450
here.

156
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,690
So typically the way it works here is it'll say Click here to start attracting users.

157
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,570
So your group names should show up once these start extracting and then you can just select them then

158
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,720
you have to do is add a message like Should users.

159
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,750
Now it has this crazy thing called Spin tax and know what it is you can use these keywords right here

160
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,640
to make the message sound like it's much more personalized.

161
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:19,140
And also the more you use it the more different your messages will be which means that to Instagram

162
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,490
it looks like you're less likely to be a bot because bots just send the same message over and over again.

163
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:30,440
So I might just say like hey and then fullname is not good because he's a business account so doesn't

164
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,460
it make sense like a human wouldn't say that.

165
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,520
So I just say something like you know and then I'll say their username and then I might say something

166
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:47,950
like I think our audiences would enjoy each other's posts.

167
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:56,700
And I'll just say I want to do a story shout for a shout and then I want to jumpstart this process what

168
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,430
I could do is actually just automatically link them to a video that I would use for a story shout out

169
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,050
and then I can just say like here's the video.

170
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,200
So if they wanted to go ahead and do it that already starts the process for me so I actually kind of

171
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,090
like doing that.

172
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:18,100
So I'll go to my Dropbox and look at the story that I had before on and that was this one

173
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,120
which is moderately effective.

174
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,520
So I'll just try to use that one.

175
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,220
So click share and I'll copy my link over to here.

176
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,240
I'm going to throw it into a short answer.

177
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,710
Just for simplicity's sake doesn't look like gobbledygook of information although be careful with it.

178
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,220
With these you are as short answers.

179
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,460
It might look like you're spamming someone so just keep that in mind.

180
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,970
So go to him and say OK.

181
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,420
So then I can tell them like here is my story.

182
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,740
Maybe you're wrong.

183
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:05,170
I just put something in the very end that just says send me a video or a post I can use if you want

184
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,690
to do something like that and then obviously I will try to monitor this and improve this over time so

185
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,420
I get a message that's more appealing.

186
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,860
It might be even simpler just to send someone else for ass write articles to help her out.

187
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,500
Sure you know you can make it as simple as possible.

188
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,870
I'll try this first and then see how it goes.

189
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,140
Never want to I could just send them the video.

190
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,270
Now that is just kind of a pain.

191
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:34,660
I'm not entirely sure if I want to do that because automating it like that might throw off the red flags

192
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,160
of Instagram.

193
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,230
You're sending videos to everybody so just kind of keep that in mind.

194
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,150
You do things like send secondary messages so like for instance if after 24 to 40 hours they have not

195
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,340
responded.

196
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,110
So I say send only if the user has not replied.

197
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,390
Then it'll send a secondary message and if I want to set a secondary image it edit and it will just

198
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:52,920
be.

199
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,450
I'll just say look interested.

200
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,840
Just as a nice reminder.

201
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,560
If not no worries.

202
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,880
There you go.

203
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,970
OK so now I have a secondary message in automatically.

204
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,970
If they don't respond and then I want to make sure that I don't message the same people twice to remove

205
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,250
the selected user after they click send and then ignore users received the message up automatically

206
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:12,880
send messages.

207
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,340
You know I already know.

208
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:14,800
OK.

209
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,050
OK so that's set up.

210
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,450
So it's already started pulling names up here.

211
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:25,150
Looks like we have 6 and this is coming from the manual one we did.

212
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,980
And then all we can do is see this one only pulled three from Cool Science.

213
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,810
OK that's fine.

214
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,370
I mean it's we're using very strict criteria so I might have to add more and more to that to get enough

215
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,390
people so that I can just click select all and then I'll do add to send messages list.

216
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,670
OK so $9 them and sent to said message.

217
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,740
Now the last part is we go here to send messages and we want to set up our criteria so that it does

218
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,240
this correctly and then we wanted to make sure that we monitor how it works.

219
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,370
Sorry your queues up all the messages that are going to be sent.

220
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,300
That's great so we see that this is working now we just need to get our criteria appear correct and

221
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,140
then go from there.

222
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:08,320
So what I want to do is make sure that it waits between well only when X message say 40 to 50 people

223
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:08,890
a day.

224
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,430
So choice between 10 and 30 minutes.

225
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,470
Yeah it probably should message.

226
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,630
Assuming that I'm awake 18 hours makes me want to act like a boss because only bots and messengers every

227
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,520
30 minutes on the 30 minute mark.

228
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:31,670
So I think yeah 10 to 50 and I'll make a range in there and then send between 1 between message operation.

229
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,630
So I'm fine with that sending multiple.

230
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,320
That's fine just because I think Instagram is used to people doing multiple at once.

231
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,660
That's perfectly normal.

232
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,210
So I say 1 to 5.

233
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:47,030
The delay of an up this just because I have the luxury of doing that.

234
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,320
So I'll say like a minute to two minutes between.

235
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,090
Because the assumption is like well I would I'd have to go find another account look to their account

236
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,290
for I can message them and then message a maximum of.

237
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,930
Now this is important you want to start really low and then start cranking this up right.

238
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:10,320
So we'll start it way low like 10 to 15 and then increase each day by 5 until we get that maximum.

239
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,310
I don't want to over 50.

240
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,730
Right so that's a great way of easing into it and scream doesn't like it when one day you just show

241
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,500
up and you're sending hundreds of messages.

242
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,060
This is a good way of keeping this normal.

243
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,680
Ok I didn't even do things like a secondary reply.

244
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,660
How long should we wait when we're sending them back.

245
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,290
I don't think this is going to make a huge difference.

246
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:32,380
Just because you know it's only sending 50 a day so how many aren't going to respond and.

247
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:39,430
But you still use the same kind of criteria so I'd probably wait 20 to let's say 45 minutes in between

248
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:46,510
and when it sends these messages I think it's perfectly fine to send a lot at a time and then put the

249
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:55,330
delay will raise this up quite a bit and say whatever and then message a maximum and we'll do the same

250
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,410
thing here right.

251
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,460
So this is always going to be less than the other because assuming someone's going to respond so we'll

252
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:08,330
still lower this down though so we'll say 10 to 15 kind of the same thing and will slowly increase this

253
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,540
one three until it reaches 4 you don't ever want to exceed it.

254
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:13,990
OK.

255
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,500
Then it says pick a random member instead of the first from the list below.

256
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,740
That doesn't really matter.

257
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,000
Delete pending messages doesn't really matter.

258
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:25,140
That could just be help you so that you don't bog up your direct messages but at the moment it's not

259
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,950
a huge deal for me.

260
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,550
So I think if the messages are older than like let's say 10 days I think that's going to be well let's

261
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,880
say like five days I think is perfectly fine.

262
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,120
Keep the maximum how any message you have in the pending messages.

263
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,090
It doesn't matter.

264
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,130
I don't want to put a limit on that.

265
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,460
Shorten all your calls from messages doesn't really matter because I've already done that.

266
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,530
Ansen direct messages after whatever.

267
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,810
That's just one way of not looking like your spammy.

268
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:54,120
But again it's a very strange operation to do to consing go back and delete it and then it's just also

269
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,750
just looks very strange though if you have a system that's sending the message today and deleting 50

270
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,550
messages so it's not always something that I would try to do.

271
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:08,400
Now I typically like to add in the same intervals you expect from me being awake so you execute between

272
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:20,170
say 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. OK.

273
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,900
You could randomize it if you wanted to but again it doesn't really matter.

274
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,660
OK so I think that's perfectly fine of 9 messages queued up.

275
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,180
So once this does run I'll check back in with you and then we can look at how it happens.

276
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,640
Well it'll be pretty easy to notice once it starts working as we'll start getting direct messages from

277
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,320
people orrible least see sent messages that I sent to people who were not responding.

278
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,030
I also need to make sure that I check this to make sure that it's running as you can see 7 10.

279
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,730
I'm going to have to add more hash tags.

280
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,180
But other than that this is pretty much the basis of how you set this up.

281
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,420
Look at scenics Archer.
