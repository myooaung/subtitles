00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.810
Hegar is welcome back.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.530
OK so this section we're talking about Instagram stories now.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.920
Not familiar with them.

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:17.340
They are these little portrait sized clips that run on each person's account and they're basically stolen

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.150
from snapchat.

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.560
That's prolly the best way I can say it.

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.720
So they typically look like this.

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.210
Usually when you log in you'll see them right at the top and depending on who you follow and whose stories

9
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.370
you watch it will be automatically categorized based on who and scram things you like.

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:39.750
So if I were to watch Sky's story you just click it and you can see that while he's probably talking

11
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.790
if I click it I can move on to the next one now.

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.060
The next person moving on.

13
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.480
And this is essentially how it works.

14
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:53.470
Now the idea behind stories are that they're ephemeral content meaning that they only last 24 hours.

15
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.050
And because of that it means that the production standards or the production requirements for these

16
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.950
are much lower.

17
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.000
And the reason why Instagram roll this out is because what they call Bora-Bora or bust.

18
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.640
Now what they mean is traditionally before they only had post-ride and a screen was a place for people

19
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.200
to post whatever the best photos they had were.

20
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.410
So they're having this problem where people weren't posting very often.

21
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.350
And part of the reason was because Bora-Bora or bust they only wanted to post the best possible like

22
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.920
filming and Bora-Bora or nothing at all.

23
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.220
Right.

24
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.940
Because these are permanent posts.

25
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.590
It can be kind of challenging if you've set a standard too high and then all of a sudden you can only

26
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.470
meet that standard once or twice a week.

27
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.460
So they introduce stories and these are directly ripped off from Snap Chat.

28
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.620
But they're the automatically disappear every 24 hours so it's much easier to film say like behind the

29
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.550
scenes cuts to put something up with a quick message to your followers that isn't perfectly put together

30
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.480
or well-designed.

31
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.360
You can use it for a lot of different things.

32
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.970
They also will use it a lot of times for promotions.

33
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.280
So it might be tacky to put a promotion and the actual post permanently but they can throw something

34
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.980
up very easily for a 24 hour post.

35
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.170
It's really easy to use.

36
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.480
Now the actual technicalities of how this works are pretty simple.

37
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.100
Each individual story is limited at about 15 seconds.

38
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.370
Now if you have a video that you want to have longer than 15 seconds at the current moment 15 is the

39
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.770
limit.

40
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.430
But there's an app called Cut story what that will do is it'll help you say cut up a 45 second video

41
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.490
into three separate segments automatically for you so that you can display one big long one in continuity.

42
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.530
Now there is no limit currently to how many stories you can upload.

43
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.090
You'll notice this when you go to stories sometimes you'll see at the very top that there's a bar and

44
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.050
that's a progress bar to show you how far along that video or the story you're watching.

45
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.140
But you'll notice that some of them have breaks in them and that means they've uploaded multiple stories

46
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.940
every time I click.

47
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.710
I go to the next story now the way that people interact with them isn't immediately obvious.

48
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.850
So if you want to go forward you just click in the middle.

49
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.220
Right now I skip to the next story and you can see this person has three stories.

50
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.250
But if I want to go back I click over on the left side and it goes back to the one before it.

51
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.370
Then what they have is a bunch of basically really simple stuff.

52
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.870
So if I wanted to send someone a message based on this story like I say they posted something to a product

53
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.560
are really interested in I could message him saying hey I'm interested in that product.

54
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.100
The button right here that shows a paper airplane.

55
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.600
You use this to spin stories to someone else so a lot of times and you post a story.

56
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.250
You can go and click that and then send it to say some of your top followers or someone who maybe you

57
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.750
know specifically would be interested in this is a great way for people to share stories with their

58
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.580
friends that they found and they think are relevant now stories show up pretty much everywhere normal

59
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.920
post show up right here obviously right when you log in you'll have them right there.

60
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.940
Now stories are hidden pretty much all over the app sometimes and you search and explore page they'll

61
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.490
put stories mixed in with the photos or at the top sometimes if you add a hash tags they'll put them

62
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.770
at the top of the top stories.

63
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.600
But it kind of depends.

64
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.150
So sometimes Hashtags don't have enough stories that have been tagged this way.

65
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.930
So they're not going to put them at the top.

66
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.030
Sometimes they do just kind of depends on the size.

67
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.210
You will notice stories if you go to like search and go to places.

68
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.430
And so like I said near a current location say I'm in London I'm not up here.

69
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.590
You'll notice that this circle with a ring around it looks like a story.

70
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.980
So if I click that I can actually see the most popular stories that have been tagged with London.

71
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.950
So this is an interesting way to find people who post content based on that hash tag.

72
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.330
OK the point though here is that stories are pretty much being added everywhere.

73
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.800
They're really easy to make.

74
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.200
They're really easy to consume and for the most part the appetite for stories has not really reached

75
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.290
its peak it looks like it's a very very popular thing.

76
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.760
So expect to see these in a lot of different places.

77
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.200
No last thing you'll notice with stories when you make your own stories is if you go to your account

78
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.930
and click on your name you'll see right there that these are the stories that I've been sharing and

79
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.230
I can actually scroll up and have analytics for each one so we can show me how many people interacted

80
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.670
with it.

81
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.940
How many people watched it.

82
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.250
Where are the people who watched it came from.

83
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.030
So a lot of times I get new people typically stories just go to people who are following me.

84
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.370
But if I have I tagged them with the location or hash tag oftentimes they'll get new people and I can

85
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.000
just go through and then look at stats on which ones have performed well say versus other ones and I

86
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
don't even save them if I want to repost it later or if I want to say create a new post based on my

87
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.720
story.

88
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.560
All right guys in the next picture we're going to talk a little bit about the strategy of stories or

89
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.880
at least what I think of them.

90
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.880
And then we'll go through the nitty gritty of how to post them and then we'll look at how we've been

91
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.830
handling stories for innovation station.

92
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.130
All right.

93
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.570
See you then.
