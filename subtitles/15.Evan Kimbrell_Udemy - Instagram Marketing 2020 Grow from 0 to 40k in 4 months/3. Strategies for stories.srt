00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,770
Guys will come back.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:08,190
Let's talk a little bit about stories what your strategy for them can be and what other people use them

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:08,910
for now.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:16,020
First off let me point out that virtually every account has some Instagram's stories strategy you know

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,200
some smaller accounts don't but the whole idea behind stories is that they're easy to make and that

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,320
you don't feel guilty because whatever you put up isn't the best thing you've ever had.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,370
That's not really the point of stories.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,570
So for the most part any big account is going to have some story content strategy already.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,330
Now the main point of strategies is essentially when you break it down it's an engagement play meaning

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,040
you use in stories to drive people back to your posts to then engage on your posts that helps your posts

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,940
get more visibility that helps your account in general get more visibility because you really think

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,380
that stories aren't particularly useful for a whole lot.

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,300
Besides getting people to go to your page right because they can see stories that even being on your

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,120
page.

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,960
So you use it largely as like a boomerang to remind them every single day to hey come back to my page

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,290
and check out my posts.

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,230
No a secondary benefit of it I think is for promotion.

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,370
If you are going to be running promos selling stuff or promoting other people's accounts then they're

19
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,080
pretty useful because you can very easily crank something out throw it up and you don't to worry about

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,200
deleting it or really that people are going to care too much.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,070
So that's really how I think of these I think of these as a way to get people to keep going back to

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,950
your account so that your account followers can essentially snowball and as you post more and more and

23
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,200
more you'll have higher and higher engagement.

24
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,880
And that's how you kind of pick up momentum and start picking up more and more people.

25
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:46,950
Now there are obviously other benefits like you can put hashtags on them but as you saw before discoverability

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,300
for stories is a bit limited.

27
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:48,620
Right.

28
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,270
So you sometimes see them hash tag pages you see them on place pages but they're not really the main

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,880
focus.

30
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:00,480
It's debt little circle up at the top which only takes up 20 percent of the screen or something like

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,340
that so it's not a big draw.

32
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,040
Now some people actually have turned this up on its head and they have a story first strategy in a post

33
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,070
secondary strategy meaning that they design their Instagram account to make the best stories possible

34
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,460
and then posts are often just repeats of their stories or recaps or something pretty minor.

35
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,450
Now you notice this with a lot of like personal accounts say like Tim Ferriss right.

36
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,540
He doesn't post a lot of stuff all the time.

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,520
Usually it's just reminders that he has a new podcast but he posts a lot of stories and the reason why

38
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,610
is because stories are so flexible that you can use them for behind the scenes or whatever it is that

39
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,730
you're doing that day.

40
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,710
It's kind of like the mentality that you had with snap chat which is that hey this is something I want

41
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:49,160
my followers my friends to see but it's not so important that I would put it up permanently.

42
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,360
So should you do Instagram stories.

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,970
Well the simple answer is yes.

44
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,780
And the reason why is just because it's a really easy way especially if you already have a post content

45
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,690
strategy down to basically create a new hook for people to keep coming back to your account.

46
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,200
It's really easy to take your post and then convert them into a story.

47
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,840
Also keep in mind that Instagram currently as I'm currently speaking rewards people who post stories

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,030
and generally like the accounts that use all of their features so adding stories means to them that

49
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,720
you're even more active than you were before and you're someone that's probably worth promoting.

50
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,750
Now do I particularly care about the analytics on stories around me.

51
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,860
Not so much.

52
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,180
Typically what I do is I go to the analytics and I like to just look at how many people see them and

53
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,700
I like to make sure that that's going up over time.

54
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,370
Iconv Square has a section dedicated to stories and you can see that people you know over time more

55
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,620
and more people watch them.

56
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,590
If people are not watching them then it's a question of whether or not you're posting the right content.

57
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,630
So like I said I use them as a constant content reminder so I post this story every single time I post

58
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,990
a regular post and I tell people in the story to go check out the post now.

59
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:00,060
Like I said this does take a little bit of content conversion but I'll show you how an innovation station

60
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:07,320
we figured out a way to really minimize this using a share feature that Instagram has recently rolled

61
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,050
out our guys.

62
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,760
That being said take a look at stories see if it's something you can add onto your play.

63
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,690
I think it's worth doing because it's an extra 10 percent effort.

64
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,370
But it is a very effective way of getting people to come back to your account.

65
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,450
If you're a business account it's a really easy way to add some low quality behind the scenes.

66
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:30,720
Shoot some of your employees show a clip of some new product or even a comment on your page that you

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,410
liked.

68
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,310
There's a lot of things you could do that you wouldn't really roll out for a regular post.

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,470
Are an individual it's even better because people like to follow you and see what you're up to.

70
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,990
So use it as that separate space where it's OK to post stuff that's not perfect.

71
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,350
All right guys.

72
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,880
That being said in the next hour let's go over how to post stories.

73
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,350
See you then.
