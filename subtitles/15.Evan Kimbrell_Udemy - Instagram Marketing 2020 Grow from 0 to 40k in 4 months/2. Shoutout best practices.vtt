Hey guys, welcome back. Last lecture, we introduced you to the
concept of a shoutout or its similar brother, shout for shout, that's
1

2
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.480
the reciprocal version of it. What's a shoutout?
2

3
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.430
Basically when someone reposts something from your account
and then gives you credit, thereby pushing some of their
3

4
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.240
traffic towards you.
4

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.630
Typically, we see these in a one for one exchange. So, this lecture, we're going to talk about how to follow the best practices of doing shoutouts
5

6
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.640
so that they work for you.
6

7
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
It's pretty easy to get burned on this,
especially if you don't know what you're doing.
7

8
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.210
I see this a lot.
8

9
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.410
People will post something and screw up the post or they're just out of sync with the person they're supposed to be working with,
9

10
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.780
People will post something and screw up the post or they're just out of sync with the person they're supposed to be working with,
10

11
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.310
or they just don't understand how the system
of trading works, so they're just not successful.
11

12
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.080
Now, later on we'll talk about how to get them, how to
12

13
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.850
reach out and find people to do it,
13

14
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.690
but this lecture we're just going to focus on the actual
posting of it and how to make that go smoothly.
14

15
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.620
So I'm going to go over five different tips I think will help. Now, the first best practice is that you need to understand that shout for shouts
15

16
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.810
are a game of reciprocity.
16

17
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.710
Okay? I scratch you back, you scratch my back.
17

18
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.750
But sometimes the relationship is asymmetrical.
18

19
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.230
OK.
19

20
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.810
The value of a shout is only as good as
how many followers you have.
20

21
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.170
So does that mean that you can only work with people
who have the exact same number of followers as you?
21

22
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.810
So does that mean that you can only work with people
who have the exact same number of followers as you?
22

23
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.860
Well, no, actually. The way you can do this
is you can modulate your offer.
23

24
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.600
So let's say you have 50k followers and they have 100k followers. Typically, what will happen is they might ask you for a 2:1 share,
24

25
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.470
meaning you do two posts and they do one.
25

26
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.170
That only makes sense considering that
they have 100k, which is double yours.
26

27
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.340
That only makes sense considering that
they have 100k, which is double yours.
27

28
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.190
So keep that in mind when you reach out.
If you reach out to a larger account,
28

29
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.790
well, don't be surprised if they ask for some asymmetrical
sharing agreement. And now, remember, there's
29

30
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.260
other ways of modulating this.
When we covered types of shoutouts,
30

31
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.990
remember we talked about pros and cons, and some of
those types are more valuable than others, so it could
31

32
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.110
be the case that if you're working with a really big account
and they don't want you to do 10 for their one,
32

33
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.880
you could trade by doing, say, a timed post
on your account and a caption post on theirs.
33

34
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.620
Whatever it is, sometimes it's easier to get better
value this way because you know what the relative
34

35
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.350
value of the different types are and sometimes people
don't know that or they'll just kind of let it slide.
35

36
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.840
So get creative, but you've got to understand that
no one's going to give you a break when it comes to this.
36

37
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.130
They want to get the same amount of value
out of you that you want to get out of them.
37

38
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.330
The second tip I'll give you is that when you do shoutouts,
you will notice some people screw this up,
38

39
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.890
you don't tag only in the photo.
39

40
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.000
You tag in the caption.
40

41
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.370
People don't generally look at the tags on the photo.
41

42
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.950
You have to click the photo and then see the tags pop up.
42

43
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.930
It's just very uncommon that someone is actually digging in the photo to find that stuff. Typically, we use tags in the photo to get people's attention
43

44
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.070
by tagging them.
44

45
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:20.400
But it doesn't really drive a lot of traffic to them, so that's why we put them in the caption. Typically, you will also change your caption so that
45

46
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.360
you have a call to action pointing towards your account,
you have to give them some context, you don't just randomly
46

47
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.990
tag them. Also, keep in mind, if you're doing long form
47

48
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.360
captions, well then you need to put
their reference or their tag at the top.
48

49
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.890
Right?
49

50
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.790
If you have to hit "See more" to scroll to the bottom, it doesn't make sense that you put their tag at the very end, not as many people
50

51
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.490
see that, they would be kind of annoyed if you did that.
51

52
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.720
Third tip is that you just need to understand the general
process for how this works. If you want to do a shoutout,
52

53
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.230
you're probably going to negotiate through direct
message or through some type of chat system.
53

54
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.050
you're probably going to negotiate through direct
message or through some type of chat system.
54

55
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.980
It's a very standard conversation.
55

56
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.910
You establish that you both want to do it,
56

57
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.190
You establish that you both want to do it,
57

58
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.600
you have similar content, similar audiences,
58

59
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.280
then you set up the terms. The terms will be
when do you post and how often do you post,
59

60
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.580
and who should go first?
60

61
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.070
You also decide on things like how long
are they going to be up, when to delete them, 
61

62
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:20.250
and who writes the caption. If you forget to cover one of these,
well, you'll have a bad time. For instance, you both do a timed 
62

63
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.100
share for share, okay? What happens if you post it and you
leave it up for a week and they leave theirs up for 2 hours?
63

64
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.330
share for share, okay? What happens if you post it and you
leave it up for a week and they leave theirs up for 2 hours?
64

65
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.740
You're just not going to get the same amount of attention
and traffic from it, so you need to make sure that you have
65

66
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.800
an agreement. If you don't have an agreement on when to
take it down, sometimes they'll cheat and just drop it down.
66

67
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.710
an agreement. If you don't have an agreement on when to
take it down, sometimes they'll cheat and just drop it down.
67

68
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.700
The other thing is that captions are really
important, the call to action next to the tag
68

69
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.030
is almost as important as the tag itself.
69

70
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.550
So you need to decide, are you going to write the caption
for their post and then they edit it and change it
70

71
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.310
for their voice, or are they going to write it and you approve it? Either way, it's something you need to decide upfront, it really just depends
71

72
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.190
on whether you think you can do a better job of speaking
to your audience, and therefore drive more traffic to them,
72

73
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.970
or you would rather have the other person have a shot at it. Typically, in asymmetrical shares, you have less leverage on this,
73

74
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.680
so if you're doing, say, like a 2:1 share, you might
not be able to get them to have a caption that
74

75
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.190
you specifically wrote, they'll probably
want to write something themselves.
75

76
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.130
Number four tip is that don't be surprised if you're
76

77
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.380
having trouble finding people to work with for shoutouts.
You have to build a relationship with accounts. Now, 
77

78
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.790
another one of the reasons why we made that list of direct,
indirect, and adjacent accounts is that we want to track them.
78

79
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:38.940
another one of the reasons why we made that list of direct,
indirect, and adjacent accounts is that we want to track them.
79

80
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.770
We want to make sure we're keeping up with them and
marking the people that we think we can potentially
80

81
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.160
work with in the future.
81

82
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.630
Then, what you want to do is you just want to interact with them, you want to comment on their posts, like their posts, follow them,
82

83
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.790
and even sometimes give them
unsolicited shoutouts in advance.
83

84
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.680
So sometimes you just take something from them,
something that obviously fits your brand really well, you know
84

85
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.490
your audience would like it anyway,
85

86
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.590
and then you tag them, and you can use that
as leverage to get their attention. Sometimes, they
86

87
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.710
immediately repay you, but sometimes it just means that you
can then direct message them and they'll actually respond.
87

88
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.690
So don't be surprised if your cold
outreach doesn't work immediately.
88

89
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.650
So don't be surprised if your cold
outreach doesn't work immediately.
89

90
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.510
Sometimes you have to warm up to them,
especially with large accounts. Large accounts,
90

91
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.700
they get a lot of messages, so it's easy to get drowned out.
91

92
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:28.830
And the last tip I'll give you is when you're doing a shoutout,
make sure that you pick one of their posts that is
92

93
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.650
both popular and also on brand visually and tonally.
93

94
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.440
both popular and also on brand visually and tonally.
94

95
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.570
So, one, you obviously want to make sure it's popular.
You don't want to take their worst post and then post it, because
95

96
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.410
your audience isn't going to like that, and it's also
not going to convert so many people for them.
96

97
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.130
Right?
97

98
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.140
But also, you want to make sure you're not taking one
of their ugliest posts or one of the ones that has a tone
98

99
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.360
that just doesn't make sense.
99

100
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:57.620
Maybe they have a sarcastic, kind of crude tone,
and yours is more sophisticated or intelligent,
100

101
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.560
I don't know if that exists on Instagram, but that would be
a mismatch. Generally, the risk of doing that incorrectly
101

102
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.600
means you might lose followers. Sometimes,
102

103
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.410
the bottom falls out and you lose them faster than you gain them.
103

104
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.510
So how exactly do you find a matching photo?
104

105
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:19.290
Well, the way I generally like to do it is, one, I like to go to
Iconosquare and then add them as a competitor, it takes 
105

106
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.130
about 15 minutes.
106

107
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:26.850
But if you scroll down to the bottom of the page, it will show you
their most popular posts by views, likes, and comments.
107

108
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:27.930
But if you scroll down to the bottom of the page, it will show you
their most popular posts by views, likes, and comments.
108

109
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:34.010
You just click it and then look at all the
other ones that sort by the most popular,
109

110
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.160
and then you can find one that matches your brand.
110

111
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:41.010
Alternatively, if you're not paying the $7 a month
or whatever it is for Iconosquare, you can use
111

112
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.180
a website called Popsters,
112

113
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:48.990
and honestly, if they change the way they work by the
time you see this, I'm sorry, but right now they
113

114
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.880
have a free version, you could type that in, and
they'll calculate it and show you a list of their posts.
114

115
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.430
All right, guys, that's pretty much it.
115

116
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.870
Keep these in mind as you go forward.
116

117
00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:58.730
Shout for shouts,
117

118
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.390
they work on a reciprocity basis, sometimes they're
asymmetrical and you have to adjust for that.
118

119
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.970
Make sure you tag them in the caption.
119

120
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:12.690
Make sure you decide on all of the terms before you go
ahead and post. Understand that you can't go in cold
120

121
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.700
Make sure you decide on all of the terms before you go
ahead and post. Understand that you can't go in cold
121

122
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:19.830
with a lot of big accounts, sometimes you have to give them
some love before they even recognize you. And make sure
122

123
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:27.610
what you're posting looks the same caliber of quality
as something you'd post, visually and tonally, and
123

124
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.880
obviously make sure it's one of their more popular posts.
All right, guys, with that being said, see you next lecture.
