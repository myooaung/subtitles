00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.710
Think over is Volcom back.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.880
OK this lecture we're going to go over another tool that you can use online to quickly create photos.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:16.300
This is going to focus more on quote's motivational quotes or just text overlaid on an image.

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.320
It's really simple but it's set up in a way that makes it.

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.960
You can get high quality photos made very quickly with cando.

6
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.500
It just takes a little bit more time.

7
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.960
Almost too much to deal with.

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.670
This one's optimized specifically for making photos on Instagram and then putting text on them.

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.590
OK so go to Pablo Bufford.

10
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.580
Come now somebody might recognize buffer we'll probably use them later Graham for scheduling our post.

11
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.410
But they made this as a side thing and it is completely free.

12
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.970
So how this works is exactly as you expected to of your canvas right here.

13
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.920
You have images to choose from over here you can upload your own.

14
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.270
Over here you can pick sizes.

15
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.360
Here are the filters.

16
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.670
And this just gives you the three most common places to put your text and then you also insert a logo

17
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.570
or a graphic.

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.050
Cool.

19
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.890
So what you would do is just take that on Instagram.

20
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.320
That's And about identity and then you could change or you put the text or go.

21
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.750
OK.

22
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.240
So I don't know let's say that we were making you just pick something that looks good.

23
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.930
Like that.

24
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.780
So we have coffee beans now and then you could just throw in something for you and usually put it in

25
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.560
the middle.

26
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.480
But at the top if you want to just drink coffee coffee coffee.

27
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.280
OK.

28
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.130
And then let's get the caption get the header ok.

29
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.100
Then you can just use your filters over here and they give you the best filters for posting on social

30
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.580
media.

31
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.650
They don't give you tons and tons and tons of filters the only ones that really make this work.

32
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.460
So like I was talking on the can a lecture contrasting the background makes it easier to read hatting

33
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.040
blur makes it easier to read and gray scaling is another one.

34
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.890
So what you can do is add a heavy contrast and so Durkin's that and then any white text you have here

35
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.340
is going to make it fit much more easily.

36
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.700
They also have optimized fonts which is a big one too that's really helpful.

37
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.090
They just give you fonts that they know look good on social media already.

38
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.320
All right.

39
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.650
These are relatively newer fonts which is great.

40
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.570
And if you don't have strong brand guidelines yet then you can just pick one here or you can find a

41
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.020
font that you like and just copy that for everything else you do.

42
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.890
So what I can do let's say I know they have dark contrasts I can up the size you just double click or

43
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.840
touching the little controller box they can change the color here change the layout.

44
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.250
Here is how I increase the size to that.

45
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.550
So that's the largest they'll go I can a little bit differently so it actually goes out the line.

46
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.180
OK.

47
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.880
Checking out the other filters you can just see the same kind of effect here with a blur.

48
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.580
OK.

49
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.170
That's great.

50
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.680
If you have something that just doesn't have detail in the background so you can kind of get the gist

51
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.650
of it and then put text right if you're talking about living a great life and you put a beach in the

52
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.150
background.

53
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.560
Even with heavy blur we'll know what it is now like Burr lur is if you actually need to see what is

54
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.280
there.

55
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.160
Same thing goes with light like contrast.

56
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.940
If you already have a dark image using the light contrast Well the other things they have are like grayscale

57
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.870
which I don't generally suggest using on Instagram.

58
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.530
I mean it makes it look like it's more serious.

59
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.950
That doesn't generally work on Instagram.

60
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.220
They usually like things with colors.

61
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.370
Now is not the case that hundreds.

62
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.110
That's true.

63
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.080
But I just rarely seen people use a greyscale effectively.

64
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.860
Other things here you can put a tent on it.

65
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.470
So this is pretty common people put like a blue or red or green tent on it just makes it stick out a

66
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:50.280
little bit especially in the album or wall section like you're looking at all the photos in that 3 column

67
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.580
row.

68
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.640
I mean one thing down here is you can just say we're going to throw on our logo I could throw in the

69
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.620
innovation Station want if I wanted to.

70
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.820
So you could just pick that text.

71
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.560
I want it to be simple and I can put it where I want and then size you just tweak over here so you go

72
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.680
and you can use the same center line to get it right and walla.

73
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.200
OK.

74
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.660
There you go.

75
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.260
I mean that's Pablos extremely simple That's the whole idea.

76
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.250
What is cool though is that they have 600000 images.

77
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.670
Canada has millions.

78
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.820
But again if you know you to make a clone you need to do it quickly.

79
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.970
This is an easy way to crank something out and just do it like this.

80
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.260
You can upload your own images.

81
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.920
That's cool.

82
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.740
And also if you use buffer you can directly post this onto your scheduling app.

83
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.710
Again talk about scheduling apps later.

84
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.070
Anyway this is what we're checking out.

85
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.280
I think it's a pretty easy way to make stuff that looks pretty sharp.

86
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.130
It's optimized for Instagram I think that's probably the biggest part about it.

87
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.620
It's a big time saver.

88
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.460
So the next larger.
