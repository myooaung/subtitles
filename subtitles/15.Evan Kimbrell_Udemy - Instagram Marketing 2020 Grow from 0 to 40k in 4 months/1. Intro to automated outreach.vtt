All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.350
So we are still in our advanced strategy set of sections and in this section we're going to talk about

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.750
automated outreach.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.150
Now before we talked about automating a lot of your content production Well there are outreach and marketing

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.620
and grooves tactics that you can also automate with enough effort.

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.690
This is a relatively short section.

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:28.740
It's just covering the best practices of how we can tackle getting shared for shares and how to manage

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.190
these collaboration posts and then how to effectively link that up with the virtual assistant skills

9
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.800
that we had set up before and how to get this rolling because shouts are a great way of growing but

10
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.310
not great if you have to constantly be on your phone managing these random people to try to set up these

11
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.940
posts.

12
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.410
So this is an advance strategy I don't know if it's necessarily for everybody but now it's worth dabbling

13
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.830
in the next lecture.
