Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,220
Just wanted to give a quick note on how
to protect your account on Instagram.
2

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,500
Now, one thing that's worth pointing out is that Instagram 
heft is a thing that actually happens quite a bit.
3

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,010
Now, one thing that's worth pointing out is that Instagram 
heft is a thing that actually happens quite a bit.
4

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,980
You'd really be surprised how many times people get
their accounts hijacked, and then one day they try
5

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,500
to log in, and guess what, some Ukrainian
person took your account. Why do they do that?
6

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:32,450
I mean, it's just because Instagram as a platform
has more natural monetization to it.
7

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,490
I think that's probably the reason why.
8

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,710
I mean, there are accounts out there with millions
and millions of followers, and all they have to do
9

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,680
is post a photo of a product, that's
a great way to make money.
10

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,880
There's also a pretty lively market for selling accounts,
so a lot of times they steal them and then
11

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,230
just immediately sell them.
12

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,780
So the way you protect yourself against that kind of
theft is actually pretty simple and it really only
13

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,370
comes down to two things.
14

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,230
The first thing is that when you sign up for your main
account, make sure that the e-mail address you
15

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,350
use is an e-mail that people don't actually e-mail you at.
16

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,520
So one of the most common ways someone steals your
account, and really anything, is they get access to
17

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,270
your e-mail address, and that's something you respond to,
and then what they do is they send you a fishing
18

19
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,560
e-mail, so they keep trying to e-mail you over
and over some type of attachment or,
19

20
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,740
I mean, there's a lot of different strategies for phishing,
and eventually you screw up and that's how they
20

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,810
get your password and then they log in and they take it.
21

22
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,660
So in my case, I use an e-mail address
that I have but I don't use it.
22

23
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,830
Like, it's just a Gmail that's always been there.
23

24
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:43,140
I don't usually use Gmail, so someone
just can't guess that one.
24

25
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,170
The other thing I would say worth doing
is using a password manager.
25

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,740
What I use is I use Dashlane.
26

27
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,040
I don't really like Dashlane, so I wouldn't suggest it,
27

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,820
but there's other ones like Last Pass,
28

29
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,510
there's 1password.com.
29

30
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,270
Basically what happens is they create logins for you,
30

31
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,260
you can just go to their page and then
tell it to generate a password for you.
31

32
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,450
That's pretty easy.
32

33
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,760
And then whenever you log in, you can actually
have it automatically fill that information in for you.
33

34
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,100
On Android, it's even easier, because in Android you can
save your passwords to your keychain or what they
34

35
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,510
On Android, it's even easier, because in Android you can
save your passwords to your keychain or what they
35

36
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,600
call, what Apple would call a keychain,
and then you can just log in.
36

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:35,640
The last thing I'll say is, in the event of someone taking your account, there's only one thing you can do to get it back.
37

38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,020
The last thing I'll say is, in the event of someone taking your account, there's only one thing you can do to get it back.
38

39
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,240
So one thing I always suggest once you actually have set
up your main account is to connect your Facebook to it.
39

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,780
So one thing I always suggest once you actually have set
up your main account is to connect your Facebook to it.
40

41
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,770
Now, you don't have to post to Facebook, and people on Facebook don't need to know that you have an Instagram,
41

42
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,370
it doesn't matter.
42

43
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,210
They don't communicate between the two
unless you explicitly tell it to do that.
43

44
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,270
The reason why is because when you lose your account,
and you're going to talk to Instagram, and they
44

45
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:03,930
notoriously don't care, you can just say, "Guess what?
It's attached to my Facebook, here's my identity.
45

46
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,660
I can show you that this is my Facebook," and
that is the fastest way to get your account back.
46

47
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,080
All right, guys, that's all I have on that topic.
47

48
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,350
Otherwise, I'll see you next lecture.
