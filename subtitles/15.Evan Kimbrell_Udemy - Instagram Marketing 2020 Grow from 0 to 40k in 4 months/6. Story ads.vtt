00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.760
You guys will come back.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.840
OK so this lecture we're going to do is we're going to round out the three types of and scream ads with

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.680
stories adds story ads.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.450
So basically as we said before these are the ads that display in between other people's stories they

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.250
say promoted up at the top and you've probably seen them if you spend any time on Instagram or buying

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.540
the rights to run a law.

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.680
I see a lot of ads for like we work.

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.370
Oftentimes it's going to be tied to accounts I have looked at before or demonstrated some interest and

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.400
now with story ads they're really the same thing as to feed ads it's just that we don't have as many

10
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.820
options for what to display.

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.320
And we have stronger or more strict limitations on the parameters of the video so the video itself needs

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.490
to be in the story's ratio.

13
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.050
I always you shoot for 19 19:20 by 10 A.D. because that is going to guarantee that it displays correctly

14
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.730
on both the web and your mobile and it allow you to downsize if you have to.

15
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.200
The other thing is that it's going to limit a and a story and video to 15 seconds and a story and image

16
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.370
to 10 seconds.

17
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.100
So keep that in mind.

18
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.940
Now the advantage just stories ads so they're relatively new.

19
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.940
For the most part they're pretty cheap with the post and you'll pay rates that are very similar to Facebook.

20
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.650
You might pay 50 cents a click or even up to a dollar a click if you're not actually doing your targeting

21
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.260
well or spending time fine tuning your campaigns.

22
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.580
But with a story it's quite a bit cheaper it's usually a fraction of that just because Instagram can

23
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.080
display more stories ads and get away with it because they don't really come off as that spammy because

24
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.670
you click through them rapidly.

25
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.670
So there's really pros and cons to it cheaper but you really have to spend a lot of thought a lot of

26
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.680
time making sure that your video is immediately appealing and catches their attention and the with the

27
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.140
golden rule is the first three seconds.

28
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.070
Sure it's 15 seconds long but you have to get their attention the first three seconds so whatever video

29
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.060
you're going to make you need to make sure that you front load it with the most interesting thing you

30
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.590
can in the first three seconds.

31
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.060
OK now the actual what is running story ads is very very simple we can just literally go back to that

32
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.970
same campaign we may last lecture and we just to change one thing which is in placements now we wouldn't

33
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.710
change any of our demographic targeting or anything like that because stories are just going to spoil

34
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.340
the same exact type of people the format doesn't change who you're targeting.

35
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.280
But we want to use Yoda and edit placements and instead of running a feed and we're going to run a story

36
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.180
and so make sure you uncheck feed.

37
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.510
All right great then what we can do is say all mobile devices ball the ball will set the budget the

38
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.900
exact same because this isn't anything different then we'll select our account again and then it gives

39
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.890
us three options.

40
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.420
One is the single video one single image and one is a carousel.

41
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.430
So the carousel is almost kind of kind of display as if it's multiple stories so they swipe through

42
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.550
it.

43
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.600
But really it's kind of the same motion.

44
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.990
So as it currently stands this is probably the best or A-Y especially if you're trying to promote multiple

45
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.080
things or at least show them that hey whatever this Web site or app I'm promoting has lots of different

46
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.130
faces to it.

47
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.900
So at this you generally will get people to see more of it but it also could be annoying because I have

48
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.520
to click to get through it.

49
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.710
Now images are pretty static.

50
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.460
I mean it's just this is great if you have something really simple and easy to understand.

51
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.360
I would only Pictus if for instance you just didn't have any video video.

52
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.800
Typically performs a lot better in a story and that's why most people will opt for a single video.

53
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.040
This is kind of a lazy man's story and so I generally speaking just try to avoid it unless for some

54
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.660
reason you know you have a static add static image that performs really well.

55
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.410
All right down here it gives us the specific recommendations again has to be up to 15 seconds 9 by 16.

56
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:54.300
Is the aspect ratio you can choose on or not have sound enabled and other than that you're Max you max

57
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.380
out at 4 gigabytes for the file size for gigabytes 15 seconds.

58
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.360
That's way larger than even a for video so I wouldn't be morally worried about that.

59
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.040
You'd have you uploaded four gigabytes they would totally downsampled that to a much much smaller video

60
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.170
size so don't really worry about that.

61
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.240
So what Onsen here is you can just upload your video directly or you can browse your library of videos

62
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.110
you've had before.

63
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.420
It is great if you're making multiple ads or going back and retesting new ones where you have some kind

64
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.760
of cyclical nature to the things you use.

65
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.920
You can also use templates which is relatively new.

66
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.720
So they give you some templates here that you can run in your story.

67
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.560
And this is great if you don't want to make something.

68
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.540
I mean I typically say make your own.

69
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.780
And but these have already been tested to make sure that they do actually work.

70
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.790
So right here we have square templates and typically you don't want to use these just because they don't

71
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.190
display correctly.

72
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.920
Right.

73
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.960
It's they're going to have bars up at the top and bottom.

74
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.910
So really we want to a good vertical templates if we wanted to do that this way.

75
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.530
So one thing you could do is promote a product here's Dr. product discovery saw multiple products show

76
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.630
product benefits so we could say let's see how say promote a product.

77
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.360
So click that and it's usually a short video which hey nothing wrong with short.

78
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.280
You don't need to use the entire 15 seconds if you don't have to.

79
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.400
So let's say I will use this template now it's going to do is push me through his video creation kit

80
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.980
right here.

81
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.450
So in the background I can set an image or I can just set a color just kind of depends on what it is

82
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.240
that you're going to be playing as your logo.

83
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.410
So the way this works is it shows your logo first then it cuts to whatever it is that you're selling.

84
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.750
So this is kind of the basic template to have you set up.

85
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.890
So if I wanted to do this I could do innovation station and use that logo.

86
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.100
So if I wanted to you I could put my logos in like that and then I should probably you know pick a background

87
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.850
that works well with you know whatever my logo is.

88
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:53.200
Unfortunately you can't upload any images that have backgrounds that are blank like a PMG which is probably

89
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.930
ideal really.

90
00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:02.800
So really you should probably rely on using some of their stock images or for instance you can just

91
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.680
go and Google stock images go to all the free stock and pick something in the background anyway so you

92
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.000
can use this to put together something really quickly it gives you the automatic text overlay which

93
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.860
is pretty useful to not only describe the product so I could say it's super interesting product or whatever

94
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.680
it is I need to get them to click it to go on to the next thing.

95
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:32.260
But it also has limited my text right here and the length and the size of the ad such that I don't have

96
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.640
to worry about Facebook approving my post which is actually an issue.

97
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.790
If you put too much text on your video just in general they might not approve your post.

98
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.910
That's a pain down here we can say things like your font.

99
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.290
You can change your text color your background color or you can add your change the image for the actual

100
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.300
product you're selling and yada yada yada and then you can have a sign out here just as well.

101
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.980
This is something that if you honestly just didn't want to spend time making it in making a video and

102
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.910
say a final cut pro or designing your image somewhere else this is an auction.

103
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.570
And keep in mind they make these templates available because they're very good.

104
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.190
They've tested these before they're very simple to the point and they work.

105
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.800
So keep that in mind don't think that you're just being lazy by using it.

106
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.250
It actually can be a way to actually get conversions that you otherwise wouldn't have.

107
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:25.660
All right so pass that I just need to upload a story file or video that would actually fit the 16 by

108
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:32.440
9 ratio and the rest of it is the same as we saw before we can set the Web site you RL So you can set

109
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:44.170
it for your station and then ever you know product 2 or whatever it is called the action will change

110
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.960
the way that it displays at the bottom of the story.

111
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.880
Now that is uploaded see this it was one of the old story promotions that we use.

112
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.600
This one wasn't terribly useful.

113
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.060
Too much text is happening too quickly kind of turns people off and we didn't really make use of these

114
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:03.340
bars up here on the top so that was isn't what I really run with but you can see this is this the correct

115
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.020
format and size.

116
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.220
Now up here you can customize further and it gives you some tools to add text overlays if you don't

117
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.070
want to go back and add it into your post itself.

118
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.480
You can also add things like captions that people can watch without sound keep in mind or remember something

119
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.810
like 40 percent of people will watch it without sound.

120
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.820
So if your video doesn't make sense by itself then you need to add captions.

121
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.380
Also choose your video thumbnail but it doesn't actually make sense because stores don't have video

122
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:27.900
toenails.

123
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.100
I don't know why it says that.

124
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.070
It Right here.

125
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.450
So you can choose your thumbnail.

126
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.440
Again that's not actually going to change anything for your stories that's just a hangover from the

127
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.800
feed post theory can you generate automatically.

128
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:45.320
And what that does is it will auto generate captions if anybody ever used captions on say like YouTube

129
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.120
or here on YouTube.

130
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:51.110
Sometimes you notice that they're pretty good although I'd say maybe 10 percent of the time they get

131
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.840
words off.

132
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:56.540
And if it's enough that it could actually confuse the viewer then you need to make sure that you are

133
00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.070
review it.

134
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.490
You can also let Facebook review it.

135
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:03.290
And again that's up to you does it not have a lot of experience with whether or not Facebook themselves

136
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.720
can do that correctly.

137
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.230
And the last thing is you can upload your own caption files when they have to be SIRTF files so if you're

138
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.500
not familiar with that extension then this is probably not something you want to try.

139
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.590
All right guys that's it pretty much for Instagram stories.

140
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.550
They work the same ways feeds do.

141
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.670
The difference is you're posting these in a different place on Instagram and people typically will consume

142
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.290
this at a different time.

143
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.440
But really it's just not that much different as far as markers are concerned.

144
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.380
This is just a different way of displaying the same things.

145
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:37.430
If you don't have an ad strategy built out already or a product that you need to promote then there's

146
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:43.480
nothing particularly interesting about Instagram's stories versus boosted posts versus Pheed post.

147
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.990
It doesn't really matter it's just whatever fits whatever it is you're trying to promote.

148
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:51.130
At the moment certain ones have certain features that others don't.

149
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.390
So that's about it.

150
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.860
Other than that it's really just a matter of learning how to use the Facebook and platform to do things

151
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.190
like targeting and pick interest.

152
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:06.170
And then it's just following up and making sure you watch your campaigns and see whether or not you're

153
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.430
getting the results you want and then modifying them if you're not.

154
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.050
That's really the quote unquote magic to Facebook advertising it's just paying attention and trying

155
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:20.240
multiple things starting with a very small budget trying something seen how it goes and then iterating

156
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.090
and implementing the things you learn from each test.
