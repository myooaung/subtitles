00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.650
Hey everybody will come back.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.770
So this lecture we're just gonna do a quick update to tell you where we're at with the account and this

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.870
is a good day we've passed sixty thousand guys it's been a while since I checked in last I think last

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.760
time I checked in was when we hit a little bit past forty thousand and that's when I had shifted into

5
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.330
a fully automated regiment where we were using Javi for almost entirely everything.

6
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.740
Now if you look at our growth there was a period of time where we were kind of struggling as we switch

7
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.130
to the new Javi system.

8
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.880
Javi has a lot of functionality but doing complex things on it quite difficult.

9
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.910
I think you remember me talking about how hard it was to get the right aesthetic profile where we would

10
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.610
have two videos and then an image that was something I was really hard we had to figure out.

11
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.530
We also just had issues with reposting captions and trying to customize them so they weren't the exact

12
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.090
same thing over and over again.

13
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.470
So if you look at our growth numbers back and we were switching we were really really low to thirteen

14
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.770
six thirty eight 10 negative three.

15
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.290
It took us a solid two weeks I'd say to get to the point where everything we were doing was pretty much

16
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.050
fully automated and we were happy with it what we were doing was we're just reposting our original content

17
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.270
if you remember we created something like 400 or 500 different unique pieces of content so we just sort

18
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.830
of cycling through them with the understanding that occasionally someone might notice that it's the

19
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.360
same thing but for the most part it wouldn't really matter okay.

20
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.160
So we did that and doing that through Javi was fine as long as I saw positive growth numbers which for

21
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.180
the most part I did was very rarely negative.

22
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.060
Aquino occasionally we get a negative three.

23
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.360
I think the highest we ever had was a negative 20.

24
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.870
What that was is probably just you know we posted something that everyone had seen before and for whatever

25
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.840
reason it just was a bad day where we posted unpopular things.

26
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.450
And if you kind of remember before the distribution of our videos was such that maybe one out of 10

27
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.870
would hit the Explore page or had a bunch of hashtag pages and I would drive primarily all the growth

28
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.950
and the other nine really would just go to our followers and I was about it.

29
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.890
So if you look at our growth it's got to a point where we were you know low 30s maybe high 60s.

30
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.050
And that seemed to hold for a while.

31
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.940
We went through a couple patches where it slowed down again as you can see here had a negative 9/11

32
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.070
but still overall we were still growing at a pretty high.

33
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.300
I say a decent clip.

34
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.410
I mean after about a month with this fully automated it would maybe grow a thousand.

35
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.740
Now I need to say this again.

36
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.890
I grew this account for the course.

37
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.330
I didn't grow this for myself.

38
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.400
I wanted to do it to show you guys this is how you go from zero to 40 thousand didn't really have any

39
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.340
interest in growing it past that point.

40
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.440
I don't have any interest in fully monetizing an account.

41
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.320
So once we hit 40 K I just kind of put my foot off the gas and it's been a dollar on it except for the

42
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.790
software's and that was it.

43
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.600
I just kind of watched it to make sure nothing was exploding I wasn't getting my account shadow banned.

44
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.710
I was pretty much it.

45
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.020
But I wanted to check in and just show you what's happened since then because we did hit a period of

46
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.840
growth in the last 10 days where for whatever reason we've accelerated quite a bit.

47
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:29.370
So around oh let's see this is about a month ago started picking up and most of our gains were between

48
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.330
100 200 and 300.

49
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.070
Then for whatever reason starting about two weeks ago we picked up into three hundreds.

50
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.980
As you can see we have some six hundred nine hundred eight hundreds.

51
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.370
And then for the last 10 days it's just been a dead sprint and it's the lowest.

52
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.830
Looks like we had with a 600 but pretty much anything other than that was above six hundred of thousands

53
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.380
eight hundred eleven hundred was a big day and yesterday we grew about eleven hundred as well.

54
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.890
So if you look in the last seven days we went from fifty four thousand to about sixty thousand which

55
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.000
is fantastic.

56
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.230
That's about a rate of thirty thousand followers a month.

57
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.170
And you know about two hundred and fifty thousand a year.

58
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.180
So a lot of you might be wondering if anything's happened to our engagement.

59
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.120
Yes absolutely.

60
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.160
Our engagement went down.

61
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.560
Why.

62
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.510
Well I wasn't responding to our post anymore so I wasn't getting people hooked in conversations and

63
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.760
driving up the comment posts.

64
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.640
I also just wasn't putting anything new out there.

65
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.910
So a lot of people who've seen it before just didn't feel the need to comment.

66
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.560
So what ends up happening is our engagement rate crashed quite a bit.

67
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.420
Now this is not something I would expect if you were actually putting time into this.

68
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.360
So if we went and pulled our report I'm sure it would be considerably lower than what you guys are used

69
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.720
to.

70
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.350
So this would see March 16th that's today.

71
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.030
Yeah it's a forty nine.

72
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.100
So it ranks us as pretty much average.

73
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.600
Now one thing to point out about hype auditor is that they recently changed some of their algorithms.

74
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.050
So if you look at the individual factors it's all pretty much good like reach ability.

75
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.060
Meaning we're not catering to a bunch of massive accounts and aren't looking anything for the most part

76
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.340
it looks like everybody's real.

77
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.920
This is what actually was hurting at the most and for the most part Javi has been doing auto follow

78
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.530
follow but we've turned it down to the point where it's pretty much negligible maybe 5 to 10 followers

79
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.960
a day come from that tops and so that right there hurt your score quite a bit.

80
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.850
That's probably 20 points in their thing because if you look at everything else you know it says let's

81
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.710
see zero point eighty eight.

82
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.980
Yeah.

83
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.630
Obviously that's pretty bad.

84
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.460
One thing to keep in mind is that they can't figure out what grouper and so it says one point five three.

85
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.910
But if I check back next week the baseline for them might be zero point five.

86
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.960
It might be three if you look up here it kindly confuses us.

87
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.540
Like for instance it thinks we're in an art category or a design category business category.

88
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.390
Anything or in a science category.

89
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.470
Now if you look down here like spread this as too high.

90
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.840
Now that's not really a sign of saying like a bad cow.

91
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.290
This is a sign of what happens with our our account.

92
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.250
I mean we have home runs and then we have strikeouts.

93
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.580
Like I said out of 10 one blows up maybe three to OK and then six just do nothing.

94
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.640
So this is why you see this spread like this.

95
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.690
And the biggest problem is that we have a big one.

96
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.310
It gets seen by two hundred thousand people and a bad one will get seen by three thousand so of course

97
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:34.210
the like spreads can be pretty bad comments authenticity likes and comments ratio all pretty good advertising

98
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.280
performance well yeah.

99
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.390
Because we don't advertise post frequency they like that we post 16 times a week and we don't post it

100
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.530
very often at all brand mentions you know sometimes they'll mention brands but it's only when we're

101
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.320
highlighting a service that actually has an Instagram account so we'll tag it then.

102
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.460
So yeah.

103
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.320
I mean hype auditor can't obviously take in that context.

104
00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.030
Now of course keep in mind like when it says are gauging rates like a little bit below 1 percent on

105
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:07.600
a good post it's like 6 or 7 percent on an okay post it's probably 2 percent and then the really bad

106
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.910
ones it's it's way below this even.

107
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.510
So this is kind of a function of what's happening with the account.

108
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.660
I'm not trying to grow it.

109
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.020
I'm not engaging with it I'm not creating new content.

110
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.750
I'm not running contests.

111
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.940
We are still doing our stories but that's because we can automate that.

112
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:30.550
So to demonstrate this I'll show you some of the posts that we're we've been doing that have done well.

113
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.410
So if we go and let's see.

114
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:40.270
So like this flying airplane thing if it view insights 866 profile visits and out of that 600 followers

115
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.640
just for that person see 93 percent weren't following us.

116
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.180
So that one clearly hit the explorer page and page and just exploded from there.

117
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:54.010
Now look at this one this VR goggle thing is probably the middle one hundred twenty nine visits and

118
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.710
about 46 follows.

119
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:02.220
Instagram has added a really interesting feature which is really useful if I click go back to that insights

120
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.520
page as I was looking at.

121
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.760
So this is the original post sixteen thousand.

122
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.470
If I look at this paper airplane says one hundred forty four people sent this to other people.

123
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.130
Now it used to be the case that they would just lump this up in from other.

124
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:20.380
So from other words people direct messaging your posts but now it just tells us directly how many people

125
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:20.860
did that.

126
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.400
That's incredibly useful and that's a big driver of growth in this account.

127
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.710
Someone sees something they think is interesting or ridiculous or related to their friend.

128
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.140
They send it to them.

129
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.810
So here's one of the ones that just blew up and this is again we've done this one before.

130
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.270
I think this is probably the fourth time we've posted this.

131
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.800
It was a bike without a chain.

132
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.230
I mean it's really nothing super cool about it.

133
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.580
She's got a cool video.

134
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:47.470
And if you look at the view insights you know one point four thousand people sent this to friends.

135
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:52.810
The Reach was foreigner thousand and ninety five percent weren't following us and out of this we got

136
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.700
eleven hundred followers just from one post.

137
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.000
Now let's see if we can find a junk post.

138
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.320
Let's see this one.

139
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.620
So this was pretty bad.

140
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.210
I only wanted ten thousand people so eighty four set of this one I got twenty three followers.

141
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.610
This one always does really well because people just hate it.

142
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.830
They're always freaking out about airlines making their seats more uncomfortable.

143
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.930
This one really got about a little bit 300 follows.

144
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:17.750
You know this one.

145
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.860
OK so this one automated delivery robot seven seventeen forty three views.

146
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.080
Right.

147
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.880
I think we probably at one follow from it.

148
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.540
So that's kind of the spread that I'm talking about.

149
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:32.110
Right so the last thing I'll say is that we ran into some pretty serious issues with Javi.

150
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:37.390
Javi again great system has a lot of potential it's great for doing zombie accounts for us for the most

151
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:37.920
part.

152
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.410
I dropped my zombie counts down to something like five.

153
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.330
So any growth coming from the zombies are gonna be pretty limited.

154
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:49.570
Most zombie strategies they're successful are when you do them over 30 or over 50 even again I've told

155
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.010
you about how other accounts have thousands of them.

156
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.890
So we've kind of dropped that down and we stuck with it just because it had the most robust posting

157
00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:57.700
system.

158
00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:02.820
But what was happening was this is partially why we had such a negative growth for a period of time

159
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.480
or not negative.

160
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:11.220
Just bad growth was that with Javi it was tripping a lot of Instagram security wires and was also happening

161
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:15.480
during a period of time or Instagram is getting a lot of flack through their parent company Facebook

162
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.850
for its privacy problems.

163
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:24.050
So Instagram tried to crack down a little bit on some of these automatic posting tools and they announced

164
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.520
that they were going to block third party systems that were using automatic posting.

165
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.550
This is probably the tenth time Instagram said this.

166
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.010
They never really do.

167
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:37.110
They crack down on the ones they think are in bad faith or doing a bad job or are you being used by

168
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:44.550
those spammers and then they just ease up usually about a month later and those tools really just resurface.

169
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.120
Case in point later dot com to be called later Graham.

170
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:54.750
They during this period or they said no more third party posting announced that they could now do video

171
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.420
posting.

172
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.540
So that doesn't really make any sense.

173
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.510
Really it's just Instagram is treating different accounts on a case by case basis.

174
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.620
They like later.

175
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.370
It's well put together and it's used by a lot of legitimate people so they probably supported it.

176
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:16.740
So what we've largely done is switch to later and once a week I'm just having someone a virtual assistant

177
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.360
come in and load all the posts and since it can do auto posting that's great.

178
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.230
Now it obviously doesn't have the same functions as Java.

179
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.390
Like we can't automatically tell it to post hashtags in the comments.

180
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.350
So we've been posting them occasionally in the actual caption itself.

181
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.190
Is that ideal.

182
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:32.690
No.

183
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.800
But again I'm not trying to spend time on this.

184
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.310
This is the first time I even looked at the account and probably a week.

185
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.320
So yeah that's a wrap.

186
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.020
Javi not working at the moment.

187
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.090
I will reassess in probably a month or so.

188
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:50.940
We are still using Javi for the like exchange it still delivers probably 300 likes per post now it's

189
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.530
obviously less because we don't have as many zombie accounts running and again Javi is having trouble

190
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.410
so the zombies aren't as prolific.

191
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.940
So really we've moved on to later for now.

192
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:05.580
I would still like to go back to Javi because it has so much potential for growth but I'm going to be

193
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.720
kind of paying attention to it and we'll see where it goes.

194
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.840
All right guys that's it for now.

195
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:14.640
If you have any questions about the account check it out yourself and scram dot com slash innovation

196
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:21.350
station if you have any questions that I can answer post in the Q and A or the slack group.

197
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.980
Again I'm not running this really aren't really doing anything so I can't answer a lot of them.

198
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.020
Why is it growing like crazy for the last week.

199
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.650
I honestly don't even know Instagram's algorithm changes constantly.

200
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:40.790
Now when I say that don't freak out and go oh they change the algorithm is your course important anymore.

201
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.080
I need that crap Instagram changes their algorithm twice a week.

202
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:52.380
OK so they do major changes every month but we need to keep in mind is they never change the core fundamentals.

203
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:58.660
The core fundamentals are likes their comments the click through rate when someone sees the post.

204
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:05.520
All of those things stay the same what they do do is they'll change what they look for in certain behaviors

205
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:11.130
so they might look for people who comment on their thing too much and they might wait that more or they

206
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:17.310
might start waiting likes more or comments more to the end of the day everything that's valuable is

207
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:23.100
still valuable they just like to move the weight around so potentially we could be getting a boost from

208
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.900
people who are sending it to their friends and maybe before they weren't valuing that as much.

209
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.480
I'm not entirely sure it's also worth pointing out that a lot of people think that if you do duplicate

210
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:40.080
content that your engagement or your reach or your shares are going to be lower than the first time

211
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.670
you post it.

212
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.390
Now this is kind of case in point that it's not really the case.

213
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.930
It's sometimes it's just luck.

214
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:50.100
Sometimes you post a certain set of hashtags and for whatever reason you get the timing right and it

215
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.990
just takes off and sometimes you post the exact same thing even with the exact same hashtags.

216
00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:59.190
The wrong timing the wrong people look at it within a certain period of time and it just doesn't take

217
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.330
off with their algorithm.

218
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.340
So keep that in mind.

219
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:07.130
Some of our posted terrible the first two times we posted it and then it blew up the third time.

220
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.540
So you never really know.

221
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.990
All right guys enough for now.

222
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.300
See you guys in the course.
