Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.180
All right so in the section we can have a little bit of a short section but we're going to focus on

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.690
Instagram ads now specifically ads are sponsored post and you see them on your feet when you're scrolling.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.400
And also a sponsored at the top.

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.730
It comes from someone you are not following and it has different rules for what type of content and

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.330
what type of buttons and cold actions they can actually put in.

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.940
Personally I think Instagram ads are kind of just an extension of Facebook ads.

8
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.040
However we just kind of have to take the twist and flavor Instagram and apply it to the same best practice

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.770
principles that we'd usually use with something like Facebook.

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.410
So if you don't really want to focus on your organic traffic strategy or hey you just want to maybe

11
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.220
boost your account or just pay to throw an ad out there because you know the audience on this platform

12
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.350
work for you well OK.

13
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350
That's what we're going to do in this section.

14
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.570
All right.

15
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.500
Without further ado.

16
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.810
See you in the next lecture.
