All right guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:07,390
OK, we're finally in the "let's make some stuff" section,
and that's exactly what we're going to do.
2

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:07,770
OK.
3

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,250
Hopefully, by this point, you know roughly
what your content strategy is going to be,
4

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,540
so that now it's just a matter of
putting those thoughts into action.
5

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,460
Now, when I say first batch of content,
why phrase it like that?
6

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,920
Well, because when we first start our accounts,
we're going to be at a significant disadvantage.
7

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,980
We have no followers,
8

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:32,070
we have an untested account, and not really a lot of
media at all to look at. In order to get more followers,
9

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,310
we need to do some marketing and promotion,
10

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,090
but in order to keep them on the page
in the first place, we need content.
11

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,610
It's a little like the chicken and egg problem, so what
I generally propose is that you just first start
12

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,040
by making your first 10 posts. Now, why 10?
13

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,820
Well, because 10 will cover the screen in any phone horizontally, and will at least look like you have a wall of content.
14

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,180
Well, because 10 will cover the screen in any phone horizontally, and will at least look like you have a wall of content.
15

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,620
It's really the best that you can do right now.
16

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,000
Also, for whatever reason, accounts with more
than 10 get more followers. If you only have three,
17

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,880
Also, for whatever reason, accounts with more
than 10 get more followers. If you only have three,
18

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,720
you're losing a lot of people that could be clicking Follow.
19

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,040
There have been studies on this.
20

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,230
I don't know why you would do a study on this, but 10,
for whatever reason, is kind of like the optimal point to hit.
21

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,280
I don't know why you would do a study on this, but 10,
for whatever reason, is kind of like the optimal point to hit.
22

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,010
So that's why I say, let's just do 10. Ten, also, for
our purposes, is enough to get the hang of what
23

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,800
we're doing and to clearly see what exactly our
long term content strategy is going to look like.
24

25
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,450
You might have had an idea that "We're going to
make this" and then you get in there, and on the fifth
25

26
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,490
one you make, you realize it's not going to work. You'll
get an idea of whether these posts are interesting
26

27
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,570
or as interesting as you thought they'd be,
27

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,930
and if they were a lot harder to make than you thought.
You'll use that knowledge then to help tweak your
28

29
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,430
efforts later in the course when we cover automation
and getting someone else to do all of this for you.
29

30
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:47,690
efforts later in the course when we cover automation
and getting someone else to do all of this for you.
30

31
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:47,960
OK.
31

32
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,640
So we should be set to get the show
on the road and start posting.
32

33
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,170
Make sure that you know going into this
what your content mix is going to be.
33

34
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,160
We talked about that in a previous lecture.
34

35
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,620
Now, you don't have to make videos
and stories now if you don't want to.
35

36
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,140
In fact, it might be a little easier to just start with
photos, and as you grow, experiment with videos,
36

37
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:13,440
or you can do it all at once, it doesn't really matter.
We'll cover how to make both in this section.
37

38
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,460
OK, let's do it.
