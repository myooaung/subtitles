00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.010
Hi guys welcome back.

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.520
Like I promised I don't know two lectures ago.

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.740
We have five main things that we need to get done in this section.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.730
We need to get you a user name a account name and profile photo a bio and a call to action.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.840
Now first up your user name.

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.040
Now I've said this before and we'll continue to say this in the future.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.870
Everything on Instagram is changeable.

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.000
You can change any of this anytime you want to.

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.710
You are not locked into your name your user name your photo really anything.

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.140
And that's why we just kind of screwed around in the last lecture and we just got used to the user flow

11
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.420
because nothing's permanent.

12
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.900
What's your user name again.

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.950
That's that thing that shows up at the top of your account.

14
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.300
It's what you're going to be known as it'll be the thing that people generally type in if they want

15
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.660
to find you directly.

16
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.980
And it's a thing that's going to show up every time you post or put a comment.

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.570
Now the rules of the game when it comes to picking an awesome user name depends on what type of account

18
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.420
you're creating.

19
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.110
If you're a business that has a brand and you're just making an account that's an extension of that

20
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.630
brand then we have a set of rules.

21
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.160
If you're promoting yourself or your personality then we have different rules.

22
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.010
And if you're doing something not directly related but you're still you know leveraging this to benefit

23
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.380
your business in some way.

24
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.340
Again different variation of the rules.

25
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.890
Now if you don't know which of these three you want to be a brand personality or again what I'd call

26
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.060
themed accounts don't really worry about it.

27
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.040
We're gonna talk about that first thing in the content strategy section and the next section.

28
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.510
You don't have to commit anything at this point.

29
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.760
OK let's say you're a business or a brand and that's why you want to get an Instagram whether you should

30
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.490
even be in Instagram is not for me to judge.

31
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.930
In this case you will want to get the name that's closest to your actual business name really simple.

32
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.280
You need consistency across social media accounts.

33
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.830
If I go to your Instagram page and can't tell this related to your Web site you did something wrong.

34
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.670
If every name is different.

35
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.640
While you won't be able to get a cross platform following Just because people won't be able to find

36
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.600
you and they'll just stop trying that is no bueno.

37
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.970
Right.

38
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.630
So first off try your company or brand name and if it's available then hooray you're done.

39
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.410
Make sure to use a lower case and upper case and the same exact way that you do it on your Web site

40
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.860
or wherever and you should be all good.

41
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.430
Now how do you check if it's available.

42
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.300
Well there's three different ways you can do this.

43
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.880
One is actually to go back to that very first screen when you're creating an Instagram page and then

44
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.790
just try typing it in and you'll either get an x or a checkmark depending on what it is.

45
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.410
You could also go to the dummy account that we created then go to your profile section and click Edit

46
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.460
edit profile.

47
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.930
Now now what you can do is just change your user name but you'll have to try to save it each time just

48
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.510
to see it.

49
00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.900
So it's one extra step.

50
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.860
So what is best.

51
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.950
Well personally I just like going to a Web site called name checker.

52
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.720
It's name checker with Justin R. because you know misspelling things is cool

53
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.950
it will tell you if it's available and if it's available on other platforms as well and I'll do it all

54
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.020
instantaneously.

55
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.300
You know own the other ones please just do yourself a huge favor and buy them all now.

56
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.580
OK.

57
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.480
Now what happens if your brand name isn't available.

58
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.840
Someone took it.

59
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.820
Well that's super annoying but it could be because you have a common name.

60
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.850
Unfortunately if your name is social media marketing company then yeah someone probably has that name.

61
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.260
Also get a new name.

62
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.340
That's a terrible name.

63
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:52.740
It's kind of like if you're an alien or a you know insert a stoic and unemotional nationality here and

64
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.290
you wanted to figure out what human emotions were and what they do and say you decided to name your

65
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.900
account great product that you want to buy.

66
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.750
Your options are less optimal but still doable.

67
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.300
Now try a variation in this case.

68
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.170
Now my personal favorite is just to get the dot com version of your username.

69
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:17.430
So if you were awesome properties and that's obviously taken then you could be awesome properties dot

70
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.320
com.

71
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.810
Now why is that an awesome name.

72
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.990
Awesome because you get to plaster your toe main everywhere.

73
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.140
Anyone who sees your post or page will see your domain and in some cases they'll go to your Web site

74
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.280
for example.

75
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.640
Friend of mine runs forever jobless dot com.

76
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.270
OK.

77
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.270
He posts on instagram under 4 I've heard jobless dot com net means that he can put that link virtually

78
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.860
everywhere and yes it does actually give him a lot of traffic outside of that.

79
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.870
I'd prefer that you just add like insta or Instagram to your name because that would kind of make sense

80
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.160
immediately to a customer who recognizes you from somewhere else.

81
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.320
Same company but this is our Instagram account.

82
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.040
You also try things like adding your location instead of awesome properties you can be awesome.

83
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.570
Orlando properties or awesome properties Orlando.

84
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.820
You can also put your brand subtitle instead.

85
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.180
So let's say your theoretical or real estate subtitle is great properties on demand.

86
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.710
Now that could be effective as an actual user name.

87
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.340
You can also generally put your niche in as a differentiating factor.

88
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.600
So you sell clothing and your focus is like petite wearers.

89
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.560
Well then you could go with petite clothing or clothing for petite.

90
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.140
I think the plural for the deed is actually a tie but whatever.

91
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.340
OK.

92
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.250
So it's easy for you as a brand to get a name get your actual name.

93
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.980
If that doesn't work then just add the dot com extension.

94
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.330
That doesn't work or you just have a really crappy like dot net domain.

95
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.260
Then try adding Instagram or a location or even your niche.

96
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.170
If your business focuses on a subset of your market which intent you probably do.

97
00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:01.380
Now lastly if your brand's subtitle or catchphrase makes sense then try using that doesn't always work.

98
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:07.290
Now between all of those options it's gonna cover like ninety nine point nine nine percent of business

99
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.570
accounts right now so what do you do if you're just a person and you want this to be your personal account.

100
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.560
Well similar rules try first to get your actual name which unless your name is like John Smith you probably

101
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.340
have a decent shot at getting it.

102
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.330
My name for instance is free but please don't buy my name.

103
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.140
I don't negotiate with terrorists.

104
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.330
Now if you can't get your personal human name then.

105
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.360
Well you know does your main Web site use your name if that's the case.

106
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.590
And you can try and at dot com variant that doesn't work then well you're just going to go down a slightly

107
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.140
different decision tree.

108
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:47.790
I don't generally like seeing names plus locations or names plus your niche.

109
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.050
Now why is that.

110
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.680
Because it's limiting and it makes the scope of your account seem small.

111
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:58.350
Now why would I follow Evan Kimbrough S.F. if I don't live in S.F. it just doesn't feel right in this

112
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.650
case.

113
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.120
What I prefer to do is use your first or last name plus an adjective.

114
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.080
So what's an adjective that describes you or more specifically your content.

115
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:13.210
Don't put evil Evan if you're an online course instructor obviously unless you hate me.

116
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.940
What are you selling specifically selling a lifestyle.

117
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.620
Use positive adjectives.

118
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.320
Awesome.

119
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.180
Great.

120
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.630
If you think you're a guru then use master expert.

121
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.290
Do you think you're good at saving people money then put money saver whatever.

122
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:36.570
Now protip the best accounts with this strategy are one or both of these a liberating and rhyming now

123
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.170
a liberating means you start each word with the same letter.

124
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:50.160
Sell cupcakes cute cupcakes fruity flower decadent delicious dessert or damn diabetes rhyming is you

125
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.800
know I'm.

126
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.320
You know rhyming is right and the resources will linked to things that you should know of.

127
00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.930
One is a thesaurus and the other one is a rhyming dictionary incredibly helpful especially in English

128
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.380
as a second language.

129
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.320
Have fun with that.

130
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.310
Now if this doesn't work then just try your best to summarize yourself or what you want people to think

131
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.330
of you in the shortest possible title you can.

132
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.070
If you're a personal brand and what are you known for.

133
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.870
Mind be like I teach business or my jokes aren't funny.

134
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.010
Lastly if you're doing a themed account your options are wide open.

135
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:28.000
Personally I suggest picking a name that tells people what they'll get when they follow you.

136
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:33.200
I posed puppies every day for your business ideas millionaire motivator.

137
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.820
Same rules apply alliteration and rhyming are extra good.

138
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.910
They make it sound better and they're easier to remember.

139
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:46.830
People for example are 20 percent more likely to remember a name that illiterates vs. one that doesn't.

140
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:53.510
OK let's take a break and if we have our phones next to us let's try coming up with some names and see

141
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.020
what's out there when you get a list of possibles you think might work.

142
00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:02.970
Then go the next lecture where we'll do one more quick check of do's and don'ts for your title.

143
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.010
That'll help you narrow down your list and the resources.

144
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.850
We have lists of more ways that you can add a variation to your name.

145
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.400
We've listed off some of our favorite names for real accounts.

146
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:19.970
There are some sites that literally list off 900 unique names that are available and we've linked you

147
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:25.070
to at two different paid services that will come up with a name for you.

148
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:29.620
If you've really really stuck spoiler ones called Crowd spring.

149
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.000
I once called squad help.

150
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.560
All right guys you know your homework is.

151
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.380
See you next lecture.
