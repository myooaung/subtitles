00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.540
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.170
OK so this lecture we're just checking in on how the Jarvi automated outreach is going for the most

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.900
part yes it is showing that it is scraping names and I've added a bunch of hash tags to the audio scorekeeping

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.210
system and it is forwarding those to the send messages system.

5
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.670
And for the most part it's running now.

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.150
The way that you can essentially verify that it is in fact working it's pretty quick.

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.880
Just go to your direct messages.

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.540
And as you can see as I scroll Yeah it's message a lot of people.

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.560
Now it's kind of makes me think I might want to start simplifying the message just because I don't know

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.220
might be a lot.

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.160
But it looks like I said maybe two or three people respond it's only been running for a day.

12
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.550
Right.

13
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.940
So this guy clearly doesn't understand what I'm talking about.

14
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.650
That's great.

15
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.290
It might be the case that a lot of these get sent to the other speil.

16
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:59.160
See that typically people who you haven't interacted with will show up in that section.

17
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.080
So that could also be limiting some of our outreach effectiveness.

18
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910
But yeah for the most part it's sending it out.

19
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.560
You can see that almost every 30 minutes it's just blasting people.

20
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.650
And we can kind of check to see see fit forever.

21
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.090
Couple this must be in the motivation category.

22
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.900
Yeah I think motivation and weight loss.

23
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.710
Sure that happened at c tech junction OK so this one clearly worked.

24
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.380
So yeah it's like I said I think that the accuracy of using the automated system is always going to

25
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.080
be limited.

26
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.540
So it just kind of keep that in mind there's going to be a lot of tweaking.

27
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.900
So you get them using hashtags so it's like who knows who's posting on the hash tag and but isn't any

28
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.720
system for checking of an account.

29
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.940
So it might just be the case that we have to go through and maybe every now and then check or block

30
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.070
certain people or hey sometimes we don't really care.

31
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.110
I mean we send a message.

32
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.330
It doesn't work out because it's not the right account.

33
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.450
They don't have to respond.

34
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.190
Right.

35
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.080
It's really just up to you if you want to spend a lot of time trying to make this as accurate as possible.

36
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.390
Again it's fully automated so it's kind of a shotgun strategy.

37
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.150
So mindset for greatness.

38
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.780
Let's see.

39
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.510
Yeah this is a motivation account.

40
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.810
OK.

41
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.990
So that would be a pretty easy one to get a deal with.

42
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.050
Let's see if finding miracles that works.

43
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.550
And they looks like they post.

44
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.930
Yeah.

45
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.440
Again more motivational science inspiration kind of stuff.

46
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.480
It is perfectly fine.

47
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.190
It's adjacent to what I'm doing but audiences might be interested in inspiring innovation.

48
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.610
So yeah.

49
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.880
Anyway that's what it kind of looks like.

50
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.830
It will take some tweaking to make it better.

51
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.670
But if this is the way that you want to go and this is how I would suggest you do it and just make sure

52
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.220
that you're spending time checking in and tweaking it so that your system doesn't go rogue and send

53
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.750
too many messages at once.

54
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.130
Like I don't know how many ended up sending.

55
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.050
Let's see.

56
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.640
Like maybe yeah maybe 30 or 40.

57
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.110
So that's pretty good considering that you have to do anything.

58
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.100
I just had to wait.

59
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.420
So anyway it's up to you.

60
00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.060
I personally I'm going to pursue the strategy of using an actual person to outreach.

61
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.470
I just think that it's there's not that many accounts to reach out to maybe a couple of thousand.

62
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.080
So I don't want to kind of have a robot send it to them it just comes off like it's a little cheesy

63
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.610
So I mean use a person.

64
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.040
But again up to you guys if you want to do this strategy this actually with some fine tuning could work

65
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.130
out really well.

66
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.690
OK.

67
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.410
So in the next picture.
