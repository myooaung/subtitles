00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.740
Is welcome back.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.260
OK.

3
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.600
So what we really do in this lecture is we are going to work on creating accounts for our zombie strategy.

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.600
Now in the previous lecture or the two lectures that I remember we talked about what goes into creating

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.690
an account.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.320
And just to refresh you you need to have a separate IP address.

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.890
You don't want the IP address to use here zombie's be the same as your main account.

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.240
Why.

9
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.500
Because NCM could block your account down.

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.940
You also need a set of names that are available on Instagram and preferably you need to write a bunch

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.110
of BIOS beforehand just to save you time.

12
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.850
It's pretty innocuous if you create an account have to write a bio then do that over and over again.

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.200
All right so surf one if you decided to go down the zombie route is to decide on whether or not to use

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.300
what's called an aged account.

15
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.730
Now what age account is is an account that was created in the past and may or may not have had some

16
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.180
type of activity on it in the past but now it's inactive now.

17
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.420
Why would we consider using an aged account for something like this.

18
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.210
Well Instagram uses a lot of different criteria to determine if one of your accounts is doing something

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.990
suspicious or just generally something they don't want happening on the community.

20
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.770
Generally speaking bots or zombies are things that they kind of frowned upon.

21
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.680
I've told you this way back when we said talking about how this is very much so a black hat strategy.

22
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.440
Well if you want to make sure that your account looks less suspicious.

23
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.950
The best thing you can do is not open up an account today brand new and then start reposting posts from

24
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.830
your main account to any algorithm or even a human operator that's going to look pretty fishy.

25
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.590
So typically what I suggest is you make an age to count now.

26
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.380
Can I quantify the benefit of using an aged account.

27
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.170
Not really.

28
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.460
It's kind of hard to say.

29
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.390
I think if you guys make a bunch of zombies yourself you'll see hey my aged accounts tend to get shut

30
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.930
down less.

31
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.940
They'll tend to ask for phone validation Lasser e-mail validation less and that can save you time.

32
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.840
Now the way that you get an age to how honestly you just started Google.

33
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.480
And that's usually what I almost always do is I just look for aged Instagram accounts.

34
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.000
Now I can't really tell you with 100 percent confidence.

35
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.800
This is the best place to buy an age to count because most of these are really small sellers.

36
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.510
There's no main platform for buying Instagram accounts.

37
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.720
If it got too popular then typically they're going to have to go underground.

38
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.440
So what ends up happening is you just have a lot of smaller accounts that are below the radar.

39
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.670
So generally when you just google it you can see people talking about it in a forum and you might just

40
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.650
see some sites that are dedicated to creating an Instagram account or specifically social media accounts

41
00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.670
in general.

42
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.480
So let's look at a couple.

43
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.670
Here's one called accounts market a s.c.s market.

44
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.490
They do all sorts of different social media and what you can see here is that you could buy a different

45
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.210
variety of aged accounts.

46
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.540
So they have cheaper ones.

47
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.950
And then more expensive ones.

48
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.010
Generally the difference here is that more expensive loans are going to be older and they also might

49
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.370
have pre-built some activity into them in the past.

50
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.390
Generally speaking the older the account the more you can get away with because it's just kind of assumes

51
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.310
that older accounts are probably more likely to be authentic whether or not that's 100 percent true.

52
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.590
I don't know what their algorithm does definitely give you some benefit of the doubt.

53
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.990
The other thing is whether or not it has activity on it and if it's posted in the past.

54
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.730
Well yeah I mean that generally also will look better to an algorithms on the site for instance we can

55
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.030
get some minimally aged accounts for 18 cents each.

56
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.230
So six months all these versions and say e-mail cannot be verified.

57
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.900
No interest is included in the package and then you can confirm it for yourself.

58
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.750
Now that might seem like not a big deal but what they're basically saying is they created these account

59
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.370
six months ago but they didn't confirm the e-mail address whether it's an outlook or a G-mail or whatever

60
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.040
you might think that's pretty easy let's just log into our G-mail and confirm it but actually it can

61
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.350
be kind of difficult because then all of a sudden you have to make sure that you don't trip up any red

62
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.260
flags on the e-mail account which would lock it down and then you can't actually get access to the e-mail

63
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.160
to confirm it.

64
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.390
So that actually creates a lot more problems than it solves.

65
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.590
The other ones that are more expensive typically will be verified.

66
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.120
You also notice that some places will say that the e-mail address is not included.

67
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.390
Meaning that if your account does get locked down you can't really get access to the e-mail account

68
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.340
to reconfirm it.

69
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.410
It's also kind of just hard because if you for instance want to sell your account later on and you don't

70
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.360
have access to the e-mail yes you kind of can't sell it.

71
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.250
I mean you can try to sell it but people are not going to be as enthusiastic about something that doesn't

72
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.710
have complete control.

73
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.570
So these are things just generally keep in mind.

74
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.600
But in general they're not particularly expensive.

75
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.280
I mean the nicest accounts you'll get.

76
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.150
So here are like three box.

77
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.380
There's an other one so here's another account.

78
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.640
This is one of these ones that probably the fly by night if you guys search for this one it doesn't

79
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.000
exist.

80
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.490
Wouldn't be surprised.

81
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.300
So let's see.

82
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.790
We have Instagram accounts that are three to seven years old.

83
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:41.360
See and no pre Lander basically means that they haven't been set up before in the past to like sell

84
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.650
something.

85
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.460
So oftentimes you're going to run into new words and vocabulary that are just pretty noxious.

86
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.000
So in this case what you can see is they say.

87
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.160
I mean they say bulletproof for all of them but that doesn't really mean anything.

88
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.760
Then it says zero to point P Al.

89
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.620
And that actually means what email address provider they signed up with.

90
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.770
This is Yahoo.

91
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.890
And Rediff kind of just depends Lhotse rediff.

92
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:07.180
OK.

93
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.450
So there's an e-mail provider called rediff.

94
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.640
Generally speaking there are there's a hierarchy of e-mail addresses out there.

95
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.200
Generally speaking G-mail is considered the most secure because they have the most security features

96
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.460
baked into their system and then it kind of goes down to like Yahoo.

97
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.670
And then even lower like Outlook dot com than it is in lower to things like Hotmail and Hotmail.

98
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.120
You know why is that considered a lower quality well because they don't verify a lot.

99
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.500
They don't even ask you to verify a phone number.

100
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:47.180
They don't even really care if you sign up with a really low quality IP address or if your account shows

101
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.880
weird activity in general.

102
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.260
They just don't really care about that stuff.

103
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.800
So in general that kind of cascades farther along and creates problems for you.

104
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.550
Let's look at one other place.

105
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.780
This place is just one to three accounts calm and pretty much the same thing.

106
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:09.250
So we have six to seven months on these nine to 10 months 14 months whatever.

107
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.720
What PVA means is phone a verified account.

108
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.410
Now when you create an Instagram account they generally suggest that you attach a phone number to it.

109
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:18.900
Why.

110
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.740
Because if you going to log in or gain access to have a good locked down having a phone number is very

111
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.730
helpful.

112
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:33.260
Now generally speaking accounts at RPV phone varified are going to look more legitimate to Instagram.

113
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.660
So that's why you might Paille extra for those.

114
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:44.710
So what's the most expensive one they have is a dollar 25 cents it's 14 months old and it's a PV a count

115
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:45.880
out.

116
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.870
So it comes with five account so that's actually not bad.

117
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.540
And ends up being like a buck 25.

118
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.580
That actually is a pretty good deal.

119
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.210
OK so once you decide about whether or not to use an aged account you go and you by some accounts the

120
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:04.410
next thing to do is to get an IP address and an IP address for those you are non-technical.

121
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:10.200
Just means it's a number that's associated with the location of your internet.

122
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.910
So if you attach to your Wi-Fi right now you have an IP address.

123
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.290
We switch to your phone you would probably have a different IP address.

124
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.710
You go to the Starbucks down the street.

125
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.060
That's kind of a different IP address.

126
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:26.780
Generally speaking these accounts want to see you logging in from the same IP address with the same

127
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.520
range of IPs.

128
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:34.220
And if it sees that you logged with an IP address in San Francisco then the next day in Russia and the

129
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.560
next day in Belarus and the next day in South Africa it's going to get suspicious like the algorithm

130
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.150
is going to start punishing you at some point.

131
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.870
So that's really something you want to avoid.

132
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:48.080
But more importantly we just want to make sure that we have IP addresses that are only associated with

133
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.410
one account and that those IP addresses never touch our main account.

134
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.770
Why.

135
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:57.860
Because if they go and shut down one of your accounts they could easily roll up any account that has

136
00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.090
also been associated with that IP address every time you log in.

137
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.540
It's going to keep a record of your IP address.

138
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:10.100
So if you use one that you also were using for some of your shadier accounts that could be a very big

139
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:10.830
problem.

140
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.010
That's probably the worst thing that could possibly happen.

141
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.620
OK so now if you want to get an IP address and get three different options again there's millions of

142
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.610
these providers out here.

143
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.720
Now the first one is h m a.

144
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.190
Called Hide my ass probably bleep that.

145
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:31.240
Now what they are is you pay ten bucks a month and they give you access to something like 250 IP addresses

146
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.860
they randomly cycle.

147
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.610
That's a good thing.

148
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.330
You also just pick based on location.

149
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.400
They have a lot of software that makes it easy to log on your phone and log in on your computer.

150
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:45.830
Now the question with these guys is should I use these for Instagram and generally speaking this is

151
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.750
for the people who are the most risk tolerant.

152
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.690
It could be the case that since they share these IP addresses with a lot of other people.

153
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:58.700
But let's say I log into an IP address in Belgium and that account that IP address could be being used

154
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:04.240
currently by other people if any of those accounts are those people are also using it for Instagram

155
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:10.090
then it could potentially taint your account because Instagram doesn't want to see one IP address associated

156
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.300
with like 50 accounts.

157
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:19.480
We don't know for sure if that happens but in general I think it's worth taking precautions so that

158
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.920
you don't double up on your IP addresses or crossed wires with somebody else.

159
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:29.710
So I don't generally recommend this unless you are incredibly risk tolerant and or you find it really

160
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.960
important to save money because this is probably going to be the cheapest option.

161
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.320
Then the next one is shared proxies dot com.

162
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.740
This is what I've used in the past and the general idea is just that you pay a very small amount at

163
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:47.830
something like 50 cents a month per IP address but they're shared right now why I'm giving this is a

164
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:53.620
middle option is because they're not open access to everyone like hide my ass.

165
00:10:53.650 --> 00:11:00.310
These are going to be ones that you know worst case scenario 10 20 other people are using at any given

166
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.980
moment so you lower your risk.

167
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.150
And in exchange it just doesn't cost you as much.

168
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.890
But still you do run the risk potentially of someone else using them.

169
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.600
Generally speaking their accounts I think are pretty easy to use you can recycle your IPs if you want

170
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.560
new ones.

171
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.290
They're very quick to fix anything that's wrong.

172
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.820
That's something I think is worth probably checking out and you can kind of see their prices like if

173
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.430
you get 40 it's $26.

174
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.650
So it's barely over like 50 cents.

175
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:30.780
I think that's pretty good now.

176
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:36.930
The system that we use with our zombie's renovation station is a company called High proxies dot com.

177
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.990
Now high proxies Well they're kind of expensive.

178
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:41.810
Right.

179
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.970
And the reason why is because the proxies that you're going be buying from them the IP addresses are

180
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.640
using from them are only used for Instagram and also their private meaning every IP address I get.

181
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.170
I know for a fact no one else is using it.

182
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:01.590
Now what does it mean that an IP address is dedicated to Instagram so I can say by proxies by encrypt

183
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.480
proxies.

184
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.790
Well it's kind of hard to tell sometimes.

185
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:12.280
Generally speaking they've done some legwork to make sure that these IP addresses are not doing things

186
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.700
that Instagram specifically as a platform does not like.

187
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:21.220
It also makes sure that when they recycle their proxies they don't keep giving them to other Instagram

188
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.870
providers so a lot of times what will happen is I might use this and after a while I might say I don't

189
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.010
know this IP address anymore.

190
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:27.760
Refresh it.

191
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.650
They'll take that IP and they will not sell it as an Instagram proxy again.

192
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.690
They'll probably just sell it as a generic proxy or they might actually just give it away.

193
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.010
So OK downside with these is they're expensive like three bucks each.

194
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.510
You buy in bulk it's a little bit cheaper but not that much like $2.

195
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:49.210
Eighty cents that can be a pain if you're doing say like 100 accounts.

196
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.620
Will that be like $300 a month.

197
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.480
So that's not great.

198
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.670
This is a great option if you have a little bit of money to spend and you have the lowest risk tolerance

199
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.750
profile.

200
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.830
You really really really don't want your accounts to get flagged and taken down.

201
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.210
It's not the end of the world if they get flagged and taken down.

202
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.770
But if you just want to avoid all of that noise.

203
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.400
Well here's kind of like a premium option that you can take.

204
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.090
I use this for our account just because I don't want to deal with constantly finding new IPs and figuring

205
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.370
out why they might have gone down or whatever.

206
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.350
So I pay a little bit more but once I think my strategy solidifies I'll switch to one of these cheaper

207
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.120
providers.

208
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:24.520
OK.

209
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.690
That's it for now.

210
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:31.530
We covered aged accounts and then we covered how to get proxies or IP addresses in the next lecture.

211
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:38.020
What we'll do is we'll talk about creating accounts figuring on account names and pre-writing some of

212
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.770
your BIOS.

213
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:39.190
OK.

214
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:39.610
So you then.
