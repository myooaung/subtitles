1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,210
Hey guys welcome back OK.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,010
This lecture what we're going to do is I'm going to show you how to use an online video editor to make

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,170
videos pacifically for Instagram.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:17,940
Now the software that I need to use is called Final Cut Pro 10 and it's specific to Mac computers only

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:25,490
if you have a PC there is a complimentary software called Adobe Premiere.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:32,190
It's actually a lot better than Final Cut Pro 10 but it's made for professional videographers or video

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,120
editors whereas Final Cut Pro is kind of dumbed down for the rest of us.

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:42,360
I use both of them but Final Cut Pro I can get the same thing done and last time that's why I'm going

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,510
to show you guys that software in the resources will attach some guides on how to do roughly the same

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,540
thing with Premier Premier is great.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,110
I use it for a lot of different things.

12
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,950
If I'm trying to do something really fancy or really professional it's great.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,300
It can also do the basics but it's like using a 32 piece Swiss Army knife if you only need a spoon.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,530
That's kind of the problem.

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,760
If you guys are also familiar with eye movie you're on a Mac.

16
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,400
That also is incredibly easy to use.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,380
Actually a lot of Instagram video makers use the movie that's about as simple as it gets personally.

18
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,980
It's too simple for me.

19
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:25,320
I like a little more functionality so I kind of go in the middle with Final Cut Pro 10.

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,200
But if you are in Windows you also have Windows Media maker which is essentially the equivalent of a

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,720
movie.

22
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,630
So we're going to do is spend one lecture getting used to the user interface of Final Cut Pro.

23
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,590
How does it work.

24
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,190
What's the timeline.

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,860
How do you make basic transitions and create a project how do you make the framing the right size and

26
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,930
then in the next lecture it will go into the follow along lecture where you can watch me make an actual

27
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,420
video that I'll post on the Instagram account later.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,650
So without further ado let's jump into it.

29
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,190
OK so this is final cut pro It doesn't say 10 at the top.

30
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:03,750
It usually says an X for whatever reason Final Cut Pro is no real there's no difference between that

31
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,030
and Final Cut Pro 10 so don't really worry about it.

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,650
There's two different ways of getting this one.

33
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,170
I think you use pay out right.

34
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,470
The second one is there is usually a subscription service you can pay for.

35
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,460
And the third one is how Like I say it out loud.

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,570
Look at me look at me.

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,250
I'm the captain now anyway so the way this works is you open it up and you have a workspace kind of

38
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,320
like this.

39
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,980
Over here we have your libraries now.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,780
A library is generally thought of as like a project right like I have a library usually for all of my

41
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,670
course production.

42
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,180
Why.

43
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,290
Because in that library I didn't store all of my clips all of my scenes and things like that.

44
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,830
I generally get to keep it in one.

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,280
So what ends up happening is every time I read reference an image or a video that I've used before it's

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,990
easy because it's in the same library.

47
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,540
If you want to create a new library you go up here to file and then you go to a new library.

48
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,840
One thing I will suggest doing is if you're going to use this a lot get an external hard drive and attach

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,640
that to it and save your library to your external hard drive.

50
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,130
That way as your library gets larger and larger and it will it will balloon like no other.

51
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,330
It doesn't freeze up your computer and take up all your space.

52
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,160
That's usually what I do.

53
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,350
But in this case I'm going to be using a really small library so I should be fine.

54
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,110
OK.

55
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,140
So once you have your library set up then you go over here which is where you're going to list off your

56
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,370
projects.

57
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,040
OK.

58
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:40,140
The way that they call the hierarchy of file types in here is you have libraries and then individual

59
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,150
projects and then clips now clips are just little chunks of video.

60
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,560
That's it.

61
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,600
They're not polished they're not finished.

62
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,030
They're things you put into projects so a project could have 20 different clips a project.

63
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,010
The easiest way to think of it is a video.

64
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,350
OK.

65
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,420
So if I was doing lectures then one lecture would be a project want to do one video for Instagram.

66
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,740
That's a project you want to create a new project and do the same thing up here.

67
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,190
New project.

68
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,850
Or you could use quick key which command in it was you create a new one.

69
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,400
Once you have that done now let's look at the other parts of the user interface rest of it's pretty

70
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:17,820
simple.

71
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,620
So this is going to be your actual preview screen.

72
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,050
So this is what's going to show you what's actually happening now down here is the most important part

73
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,620
and it's called the timeline.

74
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,880
You have haven't edited before or used anything that has a timeline.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,640
You never use Flash or like the Photoshop timeline editors or anything like that.

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,170
This can be a little confusing at first but it's pretty easy once you get the hang of it the way that

77
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,710
this works is it's a literally a time line.

78
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,350
It starts from the left and goes to the right and you appear this is the time stamp.

79
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,350
So in the video whatever is right here like the objects I'm going to throw in here it's going to happen

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,010
around zero point zero and in about 30 seconds it's going to be here in a minute and 15 it's going to

81
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,780
be here.

82
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,460
I'll throw in some clips just to show you what this looks like so it makes a little bit more sense.

83
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:07,710
OK.

84
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:14,760
So I threw in some trees that if I were to hit command plus intellectually zoomie and you can also just

85
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:22,440
use the zoom buttons down here and then what I can do is notice how this is the time stamps two minutes

86
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,850
and 10 seconds.

87
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,350
That's where I am in the timeline if it's space.

88
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,950
This is what I'm actually viewing right now right here.

89
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,050
As we go through.

90
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,420
And then it hits the end and it's over.

91
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:39,030
So that's essentially the timeline works and that's how you manage when elements come onto the screen.

92
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,280
Does you manage how long the clip is that you're making sorry that the clip the project that you're

93
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,410
making.

94
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,500
And that's pretty much everything happens if I wanted to throw something on top of this like an overlay.

95
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,150
I would just draw drag and drop it onto the timeline and it would show up on top of it.

96
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,830
I'll do that here in a second.

97
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,890
Up here we have the inspector window.

98
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,860
And this is just where you can do a whole lot of different things to the clips that you put in your

99
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,670
timeline.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,830
You can edit virtually anything.

101
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,330
And it gives you different types of controls on it.

102
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,790
All of these are kind of complicated or not really worth worrying about.

103
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,780
But some basic stuff in here like you threw in a video and it was large enough.

104
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,310
Here's your scale button right so I can scale it.

105
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,110
And notice how as I scale it above the size of these outer frames.

106
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,530
Anything out there I cannot see because this is the frame.

107
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,090
OK so if I return this back there you go.

108
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,780
It gives you cropping you can just store you can that image stabilization.

109
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:42,210
I don't prefer using image stabilization in Final Cut Pro I prefer actually using Adobe Premiere for

110
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,820
that one but it still works decently well.

111
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,960
You'll also notice that the inspector window is divided into video audio and info.

112
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,610
Now depends on what you're clicking on here what element or clip or whatever.

113
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,860
It'll change.

114
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,570
But for this time I'm in the video inspector section for status of trees.

115
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,100
It's going to give me everything that would apply to the actual visual of the clip.

116
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,700
You're not going to find anything about shaping the noise or anything like that or like the metadata

117
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,360
in here.

118
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,560
Now if you wanted audio then we can actually start talking about the audio because this one actually

119
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,410
has audio attached to it.

120
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,080
I don't know if you actually heard that but I can actually work with the volume here.

121
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,040
I want it to.

122
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,300
There's also quicker ways of doing it in the timeline.

123
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,090
And here they also give you some easy like audio enhancements that you can use to quickly get some kind

124
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,640
of effect on your sound.

125
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,420
And then the rest of it kind of gets complicated way too quickly and then info's just metadata just

126
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,460
notes and some stuff that would be pretty helpful if you were working with an editor or you could print

127
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:44,870
those off.

128
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,660
That's about it.

129
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,280
So if you wanted to just change the audio and this clip really all you have to do is go down here click

130
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,890
it and then hover over this line.

131
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:59,130
Now it says zero D-B DB just means decimal decimal is just a way of counting how loud something is.

132
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:06,920
So zero to them means that the volume is the exact same as the volume on the clip when you imported

133
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,360
it right.

134
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,840
So if I just play the clip well know if you can hear that but it has a certain level of audio.

135
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,210
But if I go back here.

136
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:20,290
So zero is what we just heard and if I wanted to drop it I could go lower and I could go higher.

137
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,100
I can also just killed the audio entirely by just going like this right clicking it going detach audio

138
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,770
right there and then just deleting it.

139
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,830
It's really quite simple.

140
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:35,430
OK now the rest of the user interface is over here and it's just a combination of a lot of different

141
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,820
things.

142
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,940
It's generator's is transition's it's text effects it's music it's it's images and it's a whole bunch

143
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,160
of random things.

144
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,180
It just honestly you could have entire course on this.

145
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,900
It takes an hour or two to explore all of them.

146
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,780
I honestly suggest you do.

147
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
And it's pretty useful.

148
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,160
So let's say right here is the effects browser.

149
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,690
So if we click this it's going to give me all of the video and audio effects that automatically come

150
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,770
with Final Cut Pro.

151
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,170
They have a lot of effects that just come with it.

152
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,590
So that's actually quite useful and that's one of the bigger benefits.

153
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:12,850
Final Cut provers say like Adobe Premiere version of that come with as many built in presets like this.

154
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,510
So the way that you would apply one of these video or audio effects would be to just find whatever it

155
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,850
is that you want to say we want to go to the basics and these look like filters for the most part.

156
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,090
And this is like a what's called a mask.

157
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,570
So as you put a bubble somewhere be a negatives that reverses the colors.

158
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,380
There's a lot of goofy things.

159
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:39,480
But they also have a lot of more advanced things so for some reason if I wanted add vibrancy all I have

160
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,250
to do is just click it and drag it over onto my video and then drop it.

161
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:49,290
If it were an audio effect all I would have to do is do the same thing except I would need my audio

162
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:49,980
to be showing.

163
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,860
So I remember when I detached the audio and you saw it there and I deleted it.

164
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,840
Same thing you just draw.

165
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,640
You go and drag and drop it onto the audio.

166
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:56,890
OK.

167
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:03,470
Now that I drag and drop that on there that will add a additional option appear in the inspector window.

168
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,310
If you get a video.

169
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,470
Now we have vibrancy and effects.

170
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,700
Now if I wanted to turn off the effects.

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,170
So right now it's just vibrancy.

172
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,710
But if I had multiple ones you'd see multiple I could just click this and it turns them all off.

173
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,930
I wanted it back and I wanted to play with that effect.

174
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,360
Here is where you screw with the amount and you kind of see in the preview window how it's changing

175
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,500
and you go OK we want it back at the euro.

176
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:35,460
So it goes down to one of if I just want to turn that one off the nuts like that and found it throw

177
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,550
another one on.

178
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,220
See I could find you probably get a look.

179
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,810
So these are very common so I can make it look like a 50s television.

180
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,520
OK.

181
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:52,950
So if I wanted to either go and vibrancy back the next section in the effects little panel over here

182
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,830
is this and it's not particularly useful.

183
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,180
This is just helpful for pulling clips.

184
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,280
So essentially this does exist pulls all the photos off of your computer or phone or wherever.

185
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,670
I didn't know then that's one easy way of pulling clips over here as audio.

186
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:16,680
Now they give you a lot of audio clips that you can use they have a lot of sound effects and jingles

187
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,250
and strange movie sounds.

188
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,290
I personally don't use it.

189
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,210
But occasionally you can find something that's kind of useful.

190
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,760
I don't know if you can hear that but that's an airplane landing.

191
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,530
Burkham super useful OK.

192
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,950
Over here is the transition browser so you can kind of tell it looks like a transition least that's

193
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,760
all that icon kind of represents.

194
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,280
Now transition is essentially how do you go from one clip to another.

195
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,650
Right.

196
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,630
So let's say that we have another clip in here and who is a lab.

197
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,230
OK.

198
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,890
So this is a clip of a lab and this is a clip of trees.

199
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,710
How do we go from here to here.

200
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,130
Because if I don't have a transition it just looks like this.

201
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,130
But there you go.

202
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:11,330
So it just was literally one frame on the trees and then the next frame on the lab and that's just not

203
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,780
going it's not great.

204
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,920
There's a lot different ways of doing this.

205
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,260
That's just up a cold hard cut.

206
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,580
You see this sometimes in like YouTube videos.

207
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,610
They don't put any transmissions on it at all.

208
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,030
But personally I don't suggest doing it.

209
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:31,220
Now a lot of your branding in a lot of your style comes from how you set your transitions cross dissolve.

210
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,430
Let's take for example the way you do this you would just take it and then drag and drop it on.

211
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,220
I'll show you how it works.

212
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,900
You can also scrub through.

213
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,830
This is really helpful because a lot of the things they have don't really make sense and only throwing

214
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,670
them on over and over again just to figure out what they are.

215
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:51,470
So if I took this over here and I just drag it into the two like right at the intersection of where

216
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,820
I want this to happen and drop it it'll either just do it or sometimes it'll tell you you don't have

217
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,860
a media pass to your edges to make that it doesn't really matter.

218
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,290
It just has to do with how long your clip is.

219
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:11,180
Typically what happens is it starts before the end of your clip and up here it's going to start after

220
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:17,660
the end of the clip because that what it's doing is effectively making this start before this one is

221
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,650
ended.

222
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,900
You can actually do this manually but this is probably the fastest way of doing it.

223
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,990
Now this here is what actually determines the length of the effect.

224
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:32,310
So as we watch crossed as all the Basically this faded out this faded in.

225
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,440
And it gives you that look.

226
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,120
Now if I wanted to change this.

227
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,320
Let's say I wanted a really short cross is all I can go over here and hold it in.

228
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,820
See how it's shrinking.

229
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:48,410
So watch the different screen that and let's say this because it is a lot faster and you can keep doing

230
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,020
that pretty much all the way down here to the point you don't even really notice it anymore.

231
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,230
See OK now if you want to do say move this transition.

232
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:03,460
So if you wanted to say make this transaction start sooner on this clip or later on this one.

233
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,910
You can grab these two vertical lines over here on either side.

234
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,840
And now I can kind of move it in relationship to the right clip.

235
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,350
I can move this in relationship to the left clips you I just kind of overtakes it.

236
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,260
It's kind of a lazy man's way of doing it.

237
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,330
So there's a lot of transitions in here that I like.

238
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,030
The ones that are really like over the top like that.

239
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,720
OK.

240
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,470
Why the hell you don't do that.

241
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,660
But there's also ones that are pretty subtle or just pretty things were just useful.

242
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:38,150
So like one of my favorites is slide slide just what it does is it slides in.

243
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,350
So it's right here.

244
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:46,120
And if I just drag so you have to get rid of this transition first drag slide and slide.

245
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,140
You can either do slide in or slide out.

246
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,740
So what happens I threw that in and now I have modifiers up here.

247
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,290
So this is the controller I can control which direction it slides from.

248
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,670
So we take this and move it.

249
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,680
See how it's changing where it's going to come in from.

250
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,470
Now another way of doing this is just to go over here and change the direction.

251
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,060
So that's a custom direction.

252
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:15,560
I can change it to up or right and see that looks like see it slides in instead.

253
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,260
Alternatively we could do is slide out.

254
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,580
Now sliding out essentially instead of the second clip coming in the first clip we use and the second

255
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,540
one is just underneath it like this.

256
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,040
OK.

257
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,590
Other than that there's a couple other settings there's like a push which I don't ever use it's just

258
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,910
too much motion.

259
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,660
Notice how it just kind of like rotates the whole thing once.

260
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,740
That's perfectly fine but that's a very useful one really just takes all of time to play around with

261
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,100
these.

262
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:47,470
There's some interesting like Blur transitions there's a lot of I don't know some pretty classic ones

263
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,750
that you can find and use and you see them on Instagram all the time.
