Hello everyone and welcome to your data frame project exercises overview lecture in this lecture we're

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,800
going to just be discussing him briefly walking you through the final project or the exercises for this

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,210
section of the course.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,580
Let's go ahead and jump to the data frame underscore project that Skala script which is in the spark

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,060
data frames folder and walk through the project.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,880
So the key here I am at the data frame underscore project that Skala script file.

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:37,200
And basically what you're going to be doing is using some stock data and specifically it's going to

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,320
be Netflix's stock data from 2011 to 2016.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,100
It's in the form of a CAC file and it's actually stored already downloaded for you in the spark data

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,300
frames folder and what you're going to go ahead and do is answering completely common to tasks below.

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,700
And this will consist of your project and we should have done some variation of form of all these tasks

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,960
as you go along.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,220
So if you ever need a reference or a computer on anything go ahead and revisit the previous lectures.

14
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,710
We're going to start off with the basics such as asking what the column names are how to print the schema.

15
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,930
Check out the head and then later on we'll go more and more advanced such as how many days was a close

16
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,170
lowered to 600 dollars.

17
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,300
What percentage of the time was the high greater than $500.

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,620
What's the max high per year.

19
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,760
So if you're confused on that you can check out the date and time stamp lectures etc..

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,400
So go ahead and just answer all these questions.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,140
Best of luck on the project.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,610
And coming up next is going to be the solutions walkthrough for this project.

23
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,780
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
