Hello everyone and welcome to the project exercise lecture for the regression with SPARK section of

2
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.020
the course.

3
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.180
For this project you will be given a dataset containing customer information for a typical e-commerce

4
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.840
company.

5
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.930
This is just artificial data but given a set of features for a particular customer I want you to create

6
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.030
a regression model to try to predict the yearly amount expenditure how much money this customer will

7
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.910
spend in a typical year.

8
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.030
Let's go ahead and explore the data and take a look at your exercise script.

9
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.890
All jump to the text editor now and open up those files.

10
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.310
Here I am at the editor under your regression folder the files you'll need to actually grab are the

11
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.080
Lin Regg exercise thought scul a script that should look something like this will just be a bunch of

12
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.440
comments and then the data file will be working with the e-commerce customers file and note that it

13
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.080
may or may not show an extension of CSP.

14
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.440
More likely than not it won't show that that CXXVI extension.

15
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.000
So keep that in mind when you actually read in the file.

16
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.230
If we take a look at this if customers are e-commerce customers file you'll notice that basically it's

17
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.450
a list of emails addresses some avatar information and then some numerical information.

18
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.950
How much time they spent on a Web site.

19
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.510
How much time is spent on an app.

20
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.800
The length of their membership and then their yearly amount spent which is how much money they actually

21
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.870
spent in a year.

22
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.350
This is what you're trying to predict given some features that are on the left here.

23
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.790
You will go ahead and grab this Liberec exercised Skala and complete the commented tasks below.

24
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.000
Now I don't expect you to have all the tasks memorized.

25
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.010
As far as how to actually import Linaria Russian object how to set up your data frame correctly.

26
00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.730
So what I would advise you to do is to open up the line Reg walk through that Skala script the script

27
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.370
that we've been going over in the past two lectures and use that as a template or guide to help you

28
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.030
fill out the tasks in this Lendrick exercise that Skala.

29
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.940
You also have a full solution script under underlain.

30
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.860
Exercise solutions that Skala and that script is what we're going to be going over in the next lecture.

31
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.780
If you have any questions feel free to post to the Q&amp;A forums and I'll be happy to help you out.

32
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.740
I hope you enjoy this.

33
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.340
This is your first exercise using Spark's machine learning capabilities.

34
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.510
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
