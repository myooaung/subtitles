Hello everyone and welcome to the booleans comparison operators lecture.

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,260
This is going to be just a brief lecture on Bullen's and how to use comparison operators and Skala.

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,410
Let's go ahead and chumped the Scala interpreter to get started.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,680
OK so here I am at my Spark's shell I have the SQL interpreter running.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,790
Let me go ahead and show you how to do a boolean in Scala.

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,150
For a true it's just lower case true.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,400
And then for false it's just going to be lower case false as far as comparison operators.

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,830
It's going to be basically what you would expect.

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,110
So we can say one greater than two that's going to return the ball in true or false.

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,590
Less then it's just that Leston symbol.

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,710
You can also do greater than or equal to or less than or equal to.

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:53,160
So is one greater than or equal to one that's going to be true is one less than or equal to 30.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,750
That's also true.

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,360
And then we can also do checks for equality with two equal sides.

15
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,790
So it's going to return true.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:06,980
And then it can do checks for any quality using exclamation mark and an equal sign so as to not equal

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,340
to four that returns true.

18
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,010
And that's really all you need to know as far as the basics of booleans and comparison operators.

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,670
Something else I wanted to quickly note is the motter modular operator and that's going to allow you

20
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,720
to check the remainder based off of arithmetic operations.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:34,310
So for example if we say something like 4 percent sign 2 we get the result of zero sets for Matu which

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,870
basically means when you divide four by two.

23
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,480
What is the remainder in this case it's going to be zero.

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,640
But if we do 5 mod 2 we get remainder 1 or an integer result of 1.

25
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,530
We're going to be using this later on the course for simple things such as checking if a number is even.

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,330
So you can check the numbers even just by saying the number mod to never return 0.

27
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,430
Then he notes even when you can also do things such as check for prime numbers using that sort of modular

28
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,320
notation.

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,050
And again that's just the percentage sign as it is in many other languages.

30
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,650
All right.

31
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,270
That's really all there is for this lecture.

32
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,750
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next one.
