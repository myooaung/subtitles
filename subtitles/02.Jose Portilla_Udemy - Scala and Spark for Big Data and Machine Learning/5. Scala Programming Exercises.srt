Hello everyone and welcome to the overview lecture for the skull a programming assessment test for the

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,360
assessment test of this section of the course you're going to be given some problem statements and you'll

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,100
have to write some code in the form of a function in order to solve the problems.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,800
Let me go ahead and just walk through the general problem statements now.

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,140
All right.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,250
Here I am with the assessment test.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,770
So basically we are going to have to be doing is creating functions to solve these following questions.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,990
It's not a huge assessment tests or just five questions.

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,150
The first one wants you to write a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean indicating whether

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,170
or not the integer was even.

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,860
And I also want you to see if you can write this in one line.

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,860
That's not necessary but see if you can figure out how to do that as a little bonus.

13
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,820
You may want to refer to the notes on the function section in order to do that.

14
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,420
Then the next one is to check for evens in a list.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,740
So building off of that last question I want you to write a function that returns true if there is an

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,270
even number inside of a list.

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,970
Otherwise return false.

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,140
Then the next question is known as lucky number seven.

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,730
We'll go ahead and taken a list of integers and calculate.

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,360
There are some however sevens are lucky.

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,900
And so they should be counted twice.

22
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,410
Meaning their value is actually 14 for the sum.

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,790
And you can assume that the list that's passed into the function is an empty next question.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,450
Can you balance given a non empty list of integers.

25
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,730
Return true if there is a place to split the list so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal

26
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,920
to the sum of the numbers on the other side.

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:37,370
So for example given a list of 1 5 3 3 you were to return true because you can actually split that list

28
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,780
right in the middle where one plus five is equal to six and three plus three is also equal to six.

29
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,850
As another example a list of 7 3 4 would also return true because you could split that list at seven

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,330
and then three and four added together is also equal to 7.

31
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,750
So just the idea is there somewhere in that list where you can actually split it and have the sum of

32
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,580
both sides equal to each other.

33
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,890
And remember you just need to return the boolean not that split index points and then finally just a

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,800
quick question here the palindrome check where if you're given a string return a boolean indicating

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,590
whether or not that it is a palindrome which just means it spelled forward and backwards the same.

36
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,810
And you can try exploring various methods to help you out here.

37
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,480
OK.

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,230
Good luck on this assessment test.

39
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,480
It shouldn't be too hard but it should be a little bit of a tick up in that challenge versus some of

40
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,660
the other assessment tests you've had in the past.

41
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,300
Okay.

42
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,090
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture where we will coach through the solutions.
