Hello everyone and welcome to the windows setup section of the Course.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,760
As I mentioned the section is just for Windows users so go ahead and move past this section if you're

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,320
not using Windows.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,120
Also make sure to check out the resource links for written guides and download files throughout the

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,350
lectures in this section of the course.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,810
Coming up next we're going to go ahead and start off with installing Skala and Sparc and making sure

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,980
you have everything set up as far as the languages and programs on your computer.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,770
Then after that lecture we're going to go ahead and discuss development environments or ideas for Skala

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,250
and Sparke.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:34,820
OK.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,680
So let's go ahead and get started with installing everything onto your computer.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,970
I'll see you at the next lecture.
