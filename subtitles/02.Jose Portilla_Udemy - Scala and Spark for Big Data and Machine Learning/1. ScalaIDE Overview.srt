00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,540
Hello and welcome to the Scala and sparked development environments lecture in this lecture we'll be

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,940
discussing development environment options for school and Sparke.

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,200
We will also explain how we actually progress through them throughout the course.

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,920
If you asked 10 different developers what the best development environment is it's likely that you're

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,080
going to get 10 different answers.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,660
So keep in mind that personal preference plays a large part in choosing a development environment.

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,190
It feels right to you in this course.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,870
Will progress through several development environments so that you can get a feel for them and choose

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,400
the one that feels right to you.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,870
There are three main types.

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,660
Development Environment options for Skala and SPARC.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,450
Those are text editors full ID ease or integrated development environments and the notebook systems.

13
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:57,640
Let's go ahead and discuss them text editors are simple environments that allow you to type text formatting

14
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,920
and save a specific extension.

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,890
In our case that Skala they also support extensions and plugins for syntax highlighting Sublime Text

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,260
and Adam text editor are very common examples of text editors used in development environments.

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,600
Then there's full ID is a complete or full integrated development environment is usually language specific

18
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,680
unlike text editors which can be used for a multitude of languages.

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,990
These ideas include things such as code completion syntax highlighting package poor etc..

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,370
There are much more expanded to a specific language as far as our capabilities Intelli Jay and Skala

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,540
the free clips are the most common examples of full ID IIS for Skala and spark.

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,500
Then there are notebooks systems notebooks provide an interactive environment for developing code.

23
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,740
They allow you to see the output directly into the notebook by separating code into cells.

24
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,420
The Jupiter notebook system and the Zetlin notebook system are the most common notebook environments

25
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,480
available for Scala.

26
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,070
So let's discuss how we actually approach development environments in this course and this course.

27
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:06,450
What we're essentially going to be doing is as our knowledge increases we'll be leveling up to a more

28
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,610
advanced development environment.

29
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,650
So we're going to start off by simply using the ripple or the revaluate print loop which is just a single

30
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,780
command line interface for Scala.

31
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,700
Then once you learn more about Skala will progress to writing full Skala scripts in Adam which is a

32
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,040
text editor and we'll add some Skala plugins to make Adam easier to use afterwards.

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,660
Then we'll show you the Intel Ejay IDC which will allow us to use a full ID with Skala.

34
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:38,540
Then when we move on to distributed datasets we'll actually move to a notebook set up keep in mind that

35
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,170
all the Skala and spark code right write works for any environment you want.

36
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,610
So if you feel you found your favorite Go ahead and feel free to stick that development environment

37
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,190
throughout the rest of the course.

38
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,150
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
