Hello everyone and welcome to the Scala collections section of this course.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,050
We've already discussed tuples as a method to hold various objects.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,430
And now we're going to actually discuss four more basic collections objects and that's going to be lists

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,920
sets maps and arrays.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,820
So we're going to go ahead and do is get started here this section of the course.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,560
We're still going to be using the spark shell and then putting one line above the time into the Skala

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,430
interpreter.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,080
But this will be the last section we're actually going to be doing that in the next section of the course.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,660
First color programming we're going to actually then move on to use a text editor and write out multiple

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,040
lines of code.

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,540
Okay.

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,900
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
