00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone and welcome to the Intelli Jay I-T lecture.

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,010
Now that we're approaching the machine learning topics for this section of the course you may want to

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,100
begin thinking about switching to a fool ideally from a text editor.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,090
In this lecture we're going to briefly go over the installation process for Intelli J.

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,370
It's actually quite simple so we won't show it for all the operating systems because it's basically

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,720
just downloading a file and then running through the installer.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,700
However I wanted to note that we're actually going to continue using atom for teaching purposes in the

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,230
section used to its display being better suited for it.

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,360
So the Adam text editor has a larger fought display in the terminal lines up nicely so that it's actually

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,210
better suited for teaching and for screen casting but I highly encourage you to explore using the Intel

11
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:58,020
g idea anyways as you may find it a much more powerful option rather than just using Adam's text editor.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,460
Also make sure to check out the resource links in this lecture for more information on how to really

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,730
utilize Intelli J to its full capabilities.

14
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,560
So I want to note that even though I'm going to be using Adam text editor it's really only because it's

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,690
better suited for my screen casting.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,910
If I were to actually write my own Scala project I'd probably be switching to either Intelli J ID or

17
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,130
switching to a notebook which actually to discuss later on in the course lets go ahead and jump to your

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,390
browser to show you how to download until Ejay ID and walk through the installation process.

19
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,020
OK here I am on my browser at dot com.

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,010
Go ahead and search for Intelli day ID.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,260
Thats going to be Intelli J.

22
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,010
Id.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,990
And you should see the very first link its from Jepp brains that com slash ID CA

24
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,630
go ahead and click on that link and then you should see until the G idea or the integrated development

25
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,120
environment then go ahead and click download scroll all the way down and there is an ultimate version

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,540
and you have to pay for that so lets go ahead and download the community version.

27
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,460
I've already downloaded it so I'm going to go ahead and jump to my downloads folder so I can open up

28
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,210
that download.

29
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,940
Should we just say that executable file or if you're on a Mac it's probably not the AMG file.

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,230
Let's go ahead and get that file.

31
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,140
All right here I am at my downloads.

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,600
My very first file here this ID.

33
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,490
I see.

34
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,020
Go ahead and double click on that.

35
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,290
It's the application.

36
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,590
So we're going to go ahead and open that up and then walk you through the installation process.

37
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,420
There's really one main thing that I want to make sure you set up correctly in that setting up until

38
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,730
Ejay idea in order to use Skala.

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,950
And it should automatically prompt you to do that.

40
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,440
So go ahead and just click next here choose install location go ahead and choose the default that's

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,160
fine.

42
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,530
Then depending on what you want you can have associations so if you have java files and you want to

43
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,230
use until day or Java you can go ahead and do that association.

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,600
I'll go ahead and leave these blank so I don't want to stop short either.

45
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:05,120
Go ahead and just say install and install Intelli ID are going to go ahead and jump forward in time.

46
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,620
This finished installation OK it looks like the installation finished.

47
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,510
Let's go ahead and run the community.

48
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,000
And then show you how to set up the Scala plug in for Intelli Jay.

49
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,650
Go ahead and click run and then you'll notice it says you can import your settings from a previous version

50
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,660
of Intelli J.

51
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,850
You don't have a previous version just go ahead and click.

52
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,790
I don't have a previous version and then hit OK there.

53
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,370
Privacy Policy go ahead and accept that.

54
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,300
Otherwise you can't operate this.

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,390
And then you can set a UI theme either.

56
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,790
Basically light or dark.

57
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,590
I personally prefer dark.

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,160
So will go ahead and click next year and then you'll see that it says there's build tools version controls

59
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:50,750
seeing Android etc. We want to click next on a feature plug ins and you should see here a scholar.

60
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,150
So we want to install plug in first gulling which support.

61
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,460
So make sure you install that.

62
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,520
That's basically the key thing I want you to make sure that you click on when you're installing Intelli

63
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:00,850
J.

64
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,380
Ideally on your first run through you should get this feature plugins.

65
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,160
If you don't find the feature plug ins you can go ahead and go back to the vault plug ins or if you

66
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,110
still don't find it there you can go ahead and click on the resource link for this lecture which has

67
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,910
a fool your L description from intelligence.

68
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,460
How to do this all manually but this should be the simplest way to do it just under feature plug ins.

69
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,280
Go ahead and install the skull plug in.

70
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,690
Now if you're them editor user maybe you like the them editing environment you can go ahead and install

71
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,300
idea them which emulates of them.

72
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,660
Editor environment inside of this Intelli J.

73
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,820
A.J..

74
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,260
All right.

75
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm going to go ahead and jump forward in time for this finished plug in instillation right now that's

76
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,450
done.

77
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,010
Go ahead and start using an Haly idea.

78
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:52,420
Go ahead and click on that and then it should start up the ID for you then you can go ahead and create

79
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,700
a new project import a project or open up a new folder.

80
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,160
You go ahead and click on Create new project.

81
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,560
All right.

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,210
Once you've started a new project you'll go ahead and come over here to where it says Skala click on

83
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,560
that and you'll note that it says Skala.

84
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,000
There's also options here for Datti and SBT.

85
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,680
We'll discuss later on what those actually are.

86
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,760
These are basically going to be ways to actually package a group of Skala scripts and dependencies all

87
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,600
into a single it's in a jar file and then call it from the command line.

88
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,610
But right now we're going to go ahead and just say Skala it next.

89
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,420
And then you can call your project whatever you want in this case.

90
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:34,300
I've already called it my first project and what we need to do is point Skala to where the SDK is for

91
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,320
our project as well as where the skull STK is basically just a point to where you installed a Skala

92
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,270
in Java.

93
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,110
Let me go ahead and show you where that should be.

94
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:51,640
Review the installation lecture her Skala and Sparc and Java in case your memory is a bit fuzzy on where

95
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,260
you actually save these.

96
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,310
So the project SDK if you follow along with me on the windows installation lecture at the beginning

97
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:04,510
of the course you just go ahead and say new Slik home directory for JDK and it should take you automatically

98
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,590
to brains.

99
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,240
What we need actually do is fine under program files.

100
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,570
Java so the on version of Windows you're running.

101
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:21,450
For me my giallo files are actually under C. Program Files and then go down to where it says Java and

102
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:28,470
open up my program files scroll down to Java and then click here on JDK 1.8 point zero underscore one

103
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,230
to one.

104
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:35,350
I want to go in and click ok there and that's going to let it know that my Java version 1.8 is located

105
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,080
there.

106
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,530
So that's my project X.

107
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,000
OK.

108
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,400
Now I want to go ahead and finalize Skala SDK.

109
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,760
So go ahead and just click on Create here.

110
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,860
And depending on where you download this it may be a little tricky to find through the browser.

111
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,380
So if you want you can actually just download one so you can click download here download Skala version.

112
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,750
The latest should be fine.

113
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,840
Click OK and it will download Skala of course here.

114
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:04,480
Now we should have already had Skala set up depending on how you actually install it.

115
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,320
It may be difficult to find everything.

116
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,380
So I encourage you just to go ahead and download Skala instead of using browser because you may have

117
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,780
to look at your head and folders and make it tricky.

118
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,400
The easiest way to do this is just click download and then download the latest version of Scala.

119
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,230
OK we're going to go ahead and fast forward to this finished downloading and installation.

120
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:23,520
All right.

121
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,420
So that has finished downloading and we have a Scala SDK ready to go so that you can just go ahead and

122
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,940
click Finish and you'll have your new project open up.

123
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,380
You'll get some tips you can go ahead and just not show tips on startups you want up to you.

124
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,020
Go ahead and then click close.

125
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,710
And then it should eventually look like this.

126
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,900
Once it's done indexing you'll see a little index timer go away here at the bottom and you can expand

127
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,140
this.

128
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:54,670
Check out the idea the source file and then right click here go to New and you can do a scarlet worksheet

129
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,760
or a Scala scripts.

130
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:04,100
We've been working on a script so let's just go ahead and use that file name and say My first it OK.

131
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,200
Once you have that open you can just begin to type out scul code as we've been before so you can say

132
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,470
something like ballocks is equal to 23 and then you'll notice as you begin to play around these values

133
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:20,140
you can say X dots and you'll see that you actually start getting a lot more options and code completion

134
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,660
help than we did in a normal text editor because as a rule ID you have all these options.

135
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,300
You go ahead and explore.

136
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:27,910
All right.

137
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,560
Now let's show you how to actually create what's known as a Scala worksheet which is an awesome tool

138
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,770
to use when you're typing out Scarlette code for Sparc.

139
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:42,350
So go ahead and Right-Click click on my first project folder it myu and then go to Skala worksheet ask

140
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:42,950
you to name it.

141
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,050
We'll go ahead and call it my work is OK.

142
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,200
And then you notice that you get this my work.

143
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:57,180
SC So basically what a worksheet is is it's going to allow you to continually compile your Skala code

144
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,360
and see the output in another pane.

145
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,120
Let me go in to show you what I mean by that.

146
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:11,810
I'm going to say vowel x is equal to 10 and then say Val Y is equal to 20.

147
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,990
And I have an interactive mode right now which means it's auto saving and it's actually showing me the

148
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,850
output in this right hand tab here.

149
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,900
And then I can do other things such as create an array.

150
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:32,250
So say valpré is equal to array will say one two three and then I can begin to write a for loop to print

151
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:42,210
all the numbers in the erase all say for let's go in and say and U-M are now will say print.

152
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,090
Alan numb.

153
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,850
And notice I'm getting a lot more code completion help there.

154
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,120
But notice what's really interesting is I'm actually getting the results so here one two and three.

155
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,450
So this is an interactive environment that you can see the output directly as you type it which can

156
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,560
be really useful.

157
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,130
Now I've been guilty of deliberately hiding these worksheets from you because they can almost be crutches

158
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,500
for you when you're first starting out how to learn how to program in Skala and spark.

159
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,400
But now that you've learned how to program in Scala how to use Sparke data frames it's time to give

160
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:21,690
you the full access to all the tools you need in order to really create full functioning programs.

161
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:27,430
All right so I really encourage you to explore the full power of this fool idea in Intelli J.

162
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,840
Now as I noted we're going to keep using atom text editor just for the purpose of screen casting because

163
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,220
the font in the terminal looks a little nicer.

164
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,270
We set it all up.

165
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,880
But as you fall on I would actually encourage you to create worksheets in Skala these C files.

166
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,120
So you go ahead and fall on my videos and in case you ever want to run this in the terminal you can

167
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,420
actually do that in intelligence.

168
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:55,560
You just come down here to the left and then select terminal in a terminal here for you.

169
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,840
Again I'm going to be using Adam text editor.

170
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,750
Not because it's better than the Intelli J ID just because it works a little better for a screen casting

171
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,740
purposes.

172
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,300
OK.

173
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,480
Thanks everyone.

174
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,350
Hope you enjoyed the lecture and I'll see you at the next one.
