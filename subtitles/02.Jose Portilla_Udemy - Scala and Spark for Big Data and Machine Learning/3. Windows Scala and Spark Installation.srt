00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:11,080
Hello everyone and welcome to the installing Skala and Sparke lecture for Windows.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,820
Go ahead and skip this lecture if you're not using a Windows computer.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,130
If you are make sure to follow each step exactly as shown in this video lecture there's quite a few

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,720
steps in order to make sure everything works properly.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,930
So make sure you have enough time set aside in order to fully watch this video and follow along.

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,580
Also make sure to use the referenced link in the resource for this lecture for written instructions

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,750
for this video.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,050
Let's go ahead and get started by opening up our browser.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,080
All right here I am at my browser at Google.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:46,520
The first thing we need to do is actually install a JDK which is known as a Java development kit you

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,210
can either just google search for Java development.

12
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,180
Kids enter and the first link should be the one we're looking for.

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,790
Or you can just go ahead and click the direct link in the resource lecture.

14
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,960
All right you'll go ahead and scroll down a little bit until you find the correct package here.

15
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,800
Well go ahead and accept the license agreements and then I'm using a 64 bit computer.

16
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:15,290
If you're using a relatively modern Windows machine 64 bit should be fine for you.

17
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,510
So go ahead and just click here and install will download that XP file.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,380
Ok this is about a 200 megabyte file so give it some time to download.

19
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,270
I'm going to go ahead and jump to the finished download.

20
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,020
All right so now that that has finished downloading the next thing we need is Apache SPARC itself.

21
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:44,550
You can go ahead and go to spark the Apache dot org or just google search Apache Sparke should take

22
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,520
you to this page and you're going to want to go ahead and click the download.

23
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,740
And then we want to download Sparc and we want to make sure that we get a pre-built for Hadoop SPARC

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,690
version.

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,680
I'm going to go ahead and use the latest release which is 2.0 0.1 at this time of filming.

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,780
Go ahead and use anything that's above 2.0 any version of that should be fine.

27
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,310
But make sure that you have pre-built for Hadoop 2.7 and later then we're going to go ahead and say

28
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,150
direct download and you'll go ahead and click here to download Sparke.

29
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:21,590
It should be a TGV file which is basically a compressed file format and I've already downloaded it.

30
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,100
It's actually here already.

31
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,820
Again it's a pretty large file so it may take some time for you to download it.

32
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,410
Once we have that let's go ahead and go to those files locations and they'll probably be under Downloads

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,930
so you can click here and say show and folder and we see here that we have Sparc and the Java development

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,690
kit.

35
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,530
Let's go ahead and install the Java development kit.

36
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,670
I'm going to go ahead and double click that

37
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,950
and then will say next go ahead and choose all the defaults.

38
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,650
Click next and let it run.

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,920
And make sure I remember where this was actually saved to the default.

40
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,670
It should just be saved to under your C-drive drive and I'll show you how to find that later on.

41
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,440
Well let's go ahead and jump to this thinnish installation.

42
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:13,840
OK.

43
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,100
Eventually it's going to ask you about the destination folder.

44
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,530
Go ahead and choose this default one but remember where it is.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,260
So I have under-sea program files Java and then this Gerry file.

46
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,550
So make sure you write that down somewhere or just remember where it is and then go ahead and click

47
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:37,100
next and then it will continue to install Java and I'm going to go ahead and jump to this completed

48
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,350
installation OK.

49
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,390
It looks like it finished installing I'm going to go ahead and close this.

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,030
All right.

51
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,430
The next thing we need to do is actually extract the contents of this TGT file.

52
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:56,710
Go ahead and write click it and then you're going to want to open it with some sort of unzip program.

53
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,130
In this case I'm going to use 7 dashes zip or 7 zip as my program and other program you may want to

54
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,850
use is when rar w i n r r.

55
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,380
There are some links in the resource.

56
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,480
In case you don't have a program but let's go ahead and just extract here.

57
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,660
So as I mentioned go ahead and check out the resource for this lecture.

58
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,540
In case you need to download one of these sort of files as a quick note for some extraction programs

59
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,830
you may just get a tar file.

60
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,610
If you end up getting a tar file.

61
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,400
Go ahead and Right-Click it and then using your program extract it a second time.

62
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,430
So go ahead and extract that again.

63
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,550
And eventually it should give you a folder that looks like this.

64
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,670
This SPARC 2.0 been Hadoop 2.7 So this is what we're looking for here.

65
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,840
Have the downloads right now.

66
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,750
Go ahead and either use the resource links or use when rar or 7 zip or some program like that in order

67
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:59,110
to extract the contents of this TGT file if it gives you a tar file instead of this direct folder.

68
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:05,840
Go ahead and just extract that again and then it should give you the folder of the contents.

69
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:11,750
All right the next thing you want to do is go ahead and move this SPARC folder to a different location.

70
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:18,110
That way our programs can find Sparke later on we're going to go ahead and do it under our C-Drive OAC

71
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,740
right click and say new folder and we're going to name this folder.

72
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:31,370
SPARC all right now that you have this spark folder created we want to go ahead and copy the contents

73
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,130
of that spark download.

74
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:40,490
So go back to your downloads double click on this Sparke folder and then go in and copy all of this

75
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,160
or cut it and go to that spark folder and paste it all there.

76
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,310
All right there it is.

77
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,080
And that's exactly how we want everything.

78
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,620
So let's go ahead and move onto the next step.

79
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:05,230
The next thing we need to do is again under your C-drive right click Create a new folder and this folder

80
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:11,590
is going to be called when you tildes all lowercase.

81
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:21,180
And in that folder I want you to go ahead and create a new folder and call it Ben and inside this bin

82
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,180
folder we're going to go ahead and place the when you tills start X-Sea file which is downloaded as

83
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,990
a resource.

84
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,610
This is basically going to allow us to work with Hadoop and windows together.

85
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:39,340
So go ahead and go back to your Downloads folder and as a resource link go ahead and check it out.

86
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,540
But we're going to download this when you Tilse file.

87
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:53,430
Go ahead and cut it out and paste it back to when you tildes been and then pasted in here.

88
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,000
All right.

89
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,640
So now that's set up we're going to go ahead and continue on with the rest of the setup.

90
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,150
All right.

91
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,360
The next step we have to do is actually add user variables and paths to those user variables in order

92
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,850
for Windows to know where to actually find everything that we just downloaded installed.

93
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:18,160
So go ahead and go to your Windows menu and find your control panel by just saying control panel.

94
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,290
Click on that.

95
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,780
OK so here we have the control panel.

96
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:30,820
Go ahead and click on system and security then click on system and then we have advanced system settings.

97
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:37,340
Over here on the left go ahead and click on that and then I'm going to move this over a little bit so

98
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,930
you can see it clearly.

99
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,920
OK.

100
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,090
And then what we would need to do is go ahead and click here on environment variables.

101
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,870
And then we need to add some new environment variables.

102
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,250
So go ahead and click new here.

103
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:57,130
And this variable name the first one is going to be in all caps Sparke underscore home.

104
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:05,810
We can go ahead and then type in C call and slash Sparke because that's where we saved spark.

105
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,550
Go ahead and click OK.

106
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,220
And we want to create another one so click new again and this user variables are going to be in all

107
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:14,770
caps.

108
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,500
Java underscore home.

109
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:23,490
And this is going to be where we say that JDK in this case we can go ahead and find it.

110
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,440
So if you want you can type in the whole file path if you remember it but you can also just browse through

111
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,580
directory for it go ahead and click on browse directory.

112
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:39,890
And then go ahead and click this piece see the C-Drive and then we're going to go ahead and look for

113
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,890
under program files Java.

114
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,700
So Program Files.

115
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:50,360
Scroll down to you see Java right here and then select that JDK folder.

116
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:50,960
OK.

117
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,990
So basically it's going to be C. Program Files Java and then that JDK folder that we installed earlier

118
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,540
go ahead and click OK.

119
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,080
That's your Java home.

120
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,390
And then finally we need to set the Hadoop home so click new this variable name is going to be in all

121
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:12,060
caps a dupe underscore home and then Hadoop is actually going to be that when you Tilse full or remade

122
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,430
so you can again browse directory for it.

123
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:22,720
But if you're falling long it's actually just under C so c when you tills and then click OK.

124
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,660
All right the next thing we have to do is edit our path variable.

125
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,300
So you should already see something here that says path.

126
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:35,980
Go ahead and select it and click at it most likely if you've done other courses or download other things

127
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:42,440
or have a bunch of environment variables here or paths under this path User variable go ahead and select

128
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,460
new.

129
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,090
And here we're going to add the spark home path.

130
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,120
So it's going to be percent sign.

131
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,360
SPARC home.

132
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,890
All caps here.

133
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,900
Percent sign.

134
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,250
And then backslash been enter for OK.

135
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,650
Now we're going to add one more and it going to be for the Java home.

136
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:11,890
So percent sign Java underscore home per cent sign backslash been and then OK.

137
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:19,060
And there we have it let's go ahead and hit OK and hit OK again an exit out of the control panel.

138
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,380
All right.

139
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,330
Now it's time to make sure that everything actually worked.

140
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,500
Go ahead and open up your command prompt.

141
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,910
You can actually just type in CMD D in it's a search for your command prompt.

142
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,540
Go ahead and click on it.

143
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,130
You should get something that looks like this and then we're going to go ahead and change the directory

144
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,990
to the spark folder.

145
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:47,180
So go ahead and type in CD for change directory and then say See Colan backslash Sparke hit enter and

146
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,820
now we're located at that spark the rectory and you can actually type in d i r for Windows users in

147
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,640
order to see all the folders here.

148
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,800
So let's go ahead and clear this screen by typing C L S And We have a clear screen or in Sparke.

149
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,190
We'll go ahead and get started by just typing in Sparke dash shell enter.

150
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,370
And you should see a little bit of Spark's default log for Jey profile.

151
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:21,510
We'll talk about that later but it should start up with the spark shell OK.

152
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,460
There we have it.

153
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,510
Welcome to spark.

154
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,750
Let's go ahead and type in our first line of skulker.

155
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:34,850
Just our Hello world line will say Prince l n for Prince line open parentheses.

156
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,100
And then with double quotes.

157
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,140
Say hello world.

158
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,190
Close quote.

159
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
Hit enter.

160
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,460
Then you should see Hello world pop up.

161
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,990
OK so that's it for this installation lecture.

162
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,700
Later on we'll talk about possible ideas and text editors in order to build out programs that are more

163
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,200
than just a single line of scarlet code.

164
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,200
If you have any questions.

165
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,840
Make sure to check out the resource link or post the Q&amp;A forum member.

166
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,910
There's a lot of steps here and you have to follow them exactly in order to make sure everything worked

167
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,590
out OK.

168
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,630
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
