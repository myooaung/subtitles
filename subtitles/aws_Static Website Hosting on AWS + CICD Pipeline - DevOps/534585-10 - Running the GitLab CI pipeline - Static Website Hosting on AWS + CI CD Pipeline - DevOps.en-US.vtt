00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
So now that we have our pipeline in place and my hope that everything is good,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.000
otherwise we'll debug it later.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.620
Cannot simply committees and say add pipeline.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.890
And I'm going to push the changes were soon as I did that.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.125
If I go back to the project page,

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.275
you should be able to see something like this here,

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:24.840
like pipeline is running in originally.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.360
If you don't see it here or something is happening,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.760
you can go here to CICD pipeline.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.760
This is the first pipeline that is currently running,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.920
and you'll see it has two stages.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.385
So the first stage is simply the build stage,

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:42.055
and the second stage is the deployment stage.

00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:44.840
See here the job build website has started.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.760
So if you want to see exactly what's going on,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.380
can simply click on it.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.750
It'll show you're like what's doing currently.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.505
It's practically starting this node Docker image.

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:57.050
After this has been started,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.270
it starts going through the commands that we have.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.055
So I'm gonna go here to the overview page.

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:06.425
I'm going to leave it for a few minutes to run.

00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:10.265
Typically shouldn't take more than two or three minutes.

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:12.530
Here, coming back a few minutes later,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.105
you're looking at your pipeline.

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:16.100
In this case, something went wrong,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.390
so that's not a problem.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.375
It's going to be a good example of trying to understand like what's going on.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:24.215
And anytime you're writing any scripts, things may go wrong.

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:26.195
And what happened here is you can see

00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:29.675
the first part with the belt that work without any issues.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:35.000
So we'll see here that all the commands have been executed, including gets rebuilt.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.350
And we can even here,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.760
take a look at a job artifacts.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.530
So if you click here on Browse,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.484
you will see here that we have a public folder

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:45.710
to practically contains the entire website.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.600
But we doubt, though, for example,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.610
a good lab CI pipeline and things like that.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.770
So only the public folder has been added here.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.080
So that definitely looks right.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.855
Now let's see what happened with the second part of the pipeline that is to deploy to S3.

00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:04.415
And I cannot stress how important it is to have this ability of

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:08.825
looking over the console logs and to try to understand like what's going on here.

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:11.330
So we'll see in this step and in this case

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.265
typically the last thing that failed is also the reason for our, all our troubles.

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:19.925
In this case, you will see that no AWS is running

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:23.780
in the sense that the CLI is available it right here,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.875
which is the version.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:26.210
So that's a first step.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.475
Okay, we know that we have the right tool.

00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:31.130
And then as soon as we try to do something, so for example,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.010
we try to remove all the files from the bucket.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.780
We'll see here something like invalid bucket name and says empty.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.875
So essentially it says,

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:42.420
hey, the bucket name is empty.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.450
So it is empty because I was a bit fast when trying to do is,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.510
and I have forgotten to define this variable.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.590
So as you remember,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.170
we defined other variables here in Settings,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.800
the ICD, but I didn't really find the bucket name.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.800
This is also variable that is required here.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.530
So I'm going to simply click here on Add variable.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.040
And the way you name it, it's totally up to you.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.600
It's not one of those variables that really matters how you call them.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.590
It just, they have to match with what you're using in such a script here,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.410
the value that I'm using is this one.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.015
So this is the name of the bucket.

00:03:19.015 --> 00:03:21.805
So normal, simply click here on Add variables.

00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:26.420
And because it hasn't been a problem with the pipeline script itself,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.555
I can simply go ahead here on the pipeline,

00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:33.575
on Deploy job and click here on this retry.

00:03:33.575 --> 00:03:36.560
And you can even follow along if you click now,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.950
you'll be able to see exactly what is happening.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.115
This only took a few seconds to run.

00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:46.715
I will see this time the job itself has passed,

00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:48.665
so everything is looking properly.

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:52.190
Essentially, we have removed everything and it's telling you

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.760
exactly what has been removed and then starting uploading.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.270
So it will go through each individual file and upload.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.490
And so from just by looking at a number of

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.595
the files that have been uploaded here does look like,

00:04:04.595 --> 00:04:06.395
like everything worked properly.

00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:10.955
We can go back to our domain here and click on the refresh button.

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:13.880
And you should be able to see the website.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.280
So this is the website that I was trying to deploy.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.945
It's also a good idea like to check to see if all the pages are working properly.

00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:24.470
This is it, this is how it is supposed to work.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.420
We now have everything set up through our continuous integration pipeline here.
