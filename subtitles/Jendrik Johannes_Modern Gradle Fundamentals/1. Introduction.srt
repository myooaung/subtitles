Hey.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,240
Welcome to this course about Cradle.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,100
Cradle.

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,740
It's one of the most advanced build tools for Java and other JVM based languages like Kotlin, Groovy

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,490
or Scala.

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,390
I'm Hendrik, and I worked on Gradle from version three to version seven.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,470
I not only know most cradle features by heart, but also helped to develop best practices to structure

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,850
great builds such that they build efficiently and are maintainable.

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,580
In this course, I share my knowledge with you so that you can structure your software project with

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,890
Gradle and get the most out of it.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,540
This course is hands on.

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,450
Together we will build up a project from scratch.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,910
Learning greater features one by one.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,670
We will do all this on the example of a Java project, but all the knowledge can be transferred to any

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,920
kind of software project built with Gradle.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:56,130
So whatever automation task you would like to tackle this course is for you to learn how to unlock the

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,420
full power of Gradle.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,450
No prior great knowledge is required and we will use the latest features and best practices of Gradle

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:03,930
seven.
