1
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,540
[Autogenerated] and this little look at the action center,

2
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,080
The Action Center is without a doubt one of the most important

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,510
new features that Windows 10 brought to users.

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,860
The action centers actually located within the notifications area,

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,640
which we've looked at it in another club.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,850
We have a small icon down here that lets us know if there

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,440
are notifications we've not looked at.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,220
If we select the icon, we can open the action center on that screen device.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,590
You can actually just swipe in from the right the actions

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,560
that is divided into two principal sections.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,990
The upper area is a scroll herbal list presenting

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,340
notifications that originate from APS on your device.

13
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,110
While the lower area has a series of _______ that are called quick actions,

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,950
quick actions are shortcuts to important settings that

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,670
affect how you device functions.

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,420
But as you glance through this group of _______,

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,120
you'll see that some quick action _______ include sightings

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,220
like screen brightness for a laptop or tablet or controls a

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,340
switcher WiFi to airplane moment.

20
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,760
Most quick action _______ are simply an on off button when enabled will

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,270
see the button has the accent color that windows uses on your device like

22
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,060
this one for location service is on color.

23
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,130
_______ are currently not enable, so I select location.

24
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,010
It loses the color and actually states that it's off.

25
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,220
Location service is air used where many APS to show

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,530
information relevant to you APS for weather,

27
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,990
travel or shopping when that work is intended

28
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,940
without access to location service is.

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,890
If someone wanted to disable the service for privacy reasons,

30
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,500
they would otherwise have had to dig in the

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,140
settings to prevent location tracking.

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,620
So having a quick action button that pulls the setting up

33
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,680
in the action center is a good example of how these

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,640
_______ could be very practical.

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,170
There are some _______ they're gonna have a few options when enabled.

36
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:47,830
Generally,

37
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,410
each click will allow you to cycle through additional

38
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,350
options if there are multiple settings,

39
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,770
and yet other _______ may actually launch in action

40
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,230
or open a settings pain this area.

41
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,850
Quick actions can be expanded or collapsed,

42
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,940
and we'll stay in whichever configuration you select until you change it.

43
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,490
Returning to the upper area,

44
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,640
we have those notifications that originate with our wraps.

45
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,610
When does 10 uses banner notifications to briefly bring

46
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,230
events to our attention by means of a small text field down

47
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,770
here above the notification area.

48
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,070
These are only on the screen for a short time by

49
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,060
the fall for about five seconds.

50
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,350
And we may miss some of them,

51
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,660
especially if we've stepped away from our device brought convenience.

52
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,040
These banner notifications are collected in the action center.

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,990
So what we are actually seen here is a recent history of banner

54
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,640
notifications that we may not have looked at yet.

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,750
Once we have seen them, most of these notifications will have disappeared.

56
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,730
The next time we open the action center and I don't feel

57
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,120
like you need to clean this area up,

58
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,380
the notifications collected here will roll over.

59
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,840
They will not just stay here forever.

60
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,110
Notifications are grouped by the application that generated them,

61
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,470
and we might have a few notifications here so you could

62
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,730
actually scroll through the list.

63
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,540
If you're looking for a specific notifications,

64
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,750
notifications can come from a variety of sources and APS

65
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,810
reminders and alarms new emails that human updates from a

66
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,650
smartphone mentions in a social media app.

67
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,140
Little just some examples of types of notification you might see here.

68
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,950
Selecting a notification will open the app that triggered that

69
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,640
notification and will take us right to that email,

70
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,170
news item or picture that was the focus of that notification.

71
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,340
Most no vacations that you see.

72
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,420
The Action Center will also allow you to perform actions

73
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,670
without envy and open the app e mails.

74
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,570
A good example, right?

75
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,400
If all you can see options to archive an email message or a

76
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,690
set of flag to take care of it later,

77
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,980
these actions could be displayed right in the notification

78
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,530
by means of _______ and touchscreen.

79
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,770
Devices may also include the ability of swipe left or right to take action.

80
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,440
Notifications could be tackled individually or as a group.

81
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,390
The APP name includes an accident.

82
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,470
I want you to clear all the notifications from that particular out.

83
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,730
Also, don't hear the top of the quick action _______.

84
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,070
There is a link to clear all notifications that wants.

85
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,560
Generally,

86
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,040
APS have their own default settings when they're installed that

87
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,100
determine how notifications they're generated.

88
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,750
If you're seeing notifications from an app that you don't want to have appear

89
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,780
as banner notifications and accumulate in the action center,

90
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,440
you can actually manage how those notifications appear and where they appear.

91
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,260
We're gonna look at all of those options for

92
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,540
managing notifications in another clip.

93
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,040
In this clip,

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:26,000
we've looked at using the action center you for watching and forward is he knew in the next clip.
