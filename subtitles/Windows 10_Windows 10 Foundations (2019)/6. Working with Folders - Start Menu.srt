[Autogenerated] in this clip will look at using folders in the START menu.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,340
The Windows has long used folders as a tool to organize files and other content.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,040
It's a concept we're all used to seeing and pilots poor,

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,140
and we even see folders in are all APS navigation menu.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:17,530
Recently,

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,240
Windows added the ability to create folders right in the start menu itself,

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,070
too great a folder.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,740
Just select and hold a tile and then drag it onto another tile.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,710
Make sure you're directly over the other tile.

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,800
Otherwise it will just try to reposition,

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,440
thinking you're simply rearranging your tiles.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,700
Want your Tyler's position directly over the other one?

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,960
Go ahead and release it.

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,640
The two files will now be grouped into a folder.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:41,830
No,

16
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,920
this will be a very familiar concept to anyone that

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,420
used an Android and IOS device.

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,740
Both allow for similar grouping of APS to conserve space on their home screens.

19
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,900
What you've created a folder.

20
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,640
You can continue to add additional tiles to it,

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,410
toe open an app that's in a folder.

22
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,000
Just select the folder and you'll see it expand to display

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,910
full size tiles within While expanded,

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,310
the folder looks pretty much just like a group,

25
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,530
and you can rename an expanded folder now,

26
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,240
while the folders expanded, live tiles will work and display live tile content.

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,600
When the folders condensed, you won't see any lifestyle functionality right.

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,960
Clicking in a folder lets you resize it so you could make a larger

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,970
where he could reduce it to even a small tile.

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,640
The folder time will display small icons for all of its content.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,970
But if the size doesn't allow all the contain icons to display,

32
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,690
it'll simply show the quantity of tiles that size permits.

33
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,140
To remove a folder,

34
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,300
you need to drag the tiles out of the fold and

35
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,540
relocate them back in your start menu.

36
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,740
When the last tiles been removed, the folder simply ceases to exist.

37
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,010
Now folders are great solution for finding seldom used APS,

38
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,810
especially if they're often used for a related tasks

39
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,440
so you could group them together.

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,560
For example, you may only occasionally use games on your device,

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,540
so throw them all into a folder.

42
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,120
You'll know where they are when you need him,

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,070
and you won't have to sacrifice and he start menu space.

44
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,850
Perhaps you occasionally use a few different taps for editing your photos again.

45
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,300
A folder that you keep them all together and you'll know

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,740
right where they are when you need him.

47
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:24,000
In this clip, we've looked at using folders on the start menu. Thanks for watching and look forward to see new in the next clip.
