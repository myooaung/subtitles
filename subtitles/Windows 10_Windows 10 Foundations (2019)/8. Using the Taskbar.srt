00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,250
[Autogenerated] in this clip will look at the Windows taskbar.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,640
The taskbar has long been a essential feature of Windows,

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,570
and while Windows 10 doesn't present a lot of changes to the desk bar,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,440
the taskbar itself is home to some new features.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,130
Starting here on the left, you have your start button,

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,040
which opens your start menu.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,320
You have a search field, which could also be represented by an icon,

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,910
and you have a few icons that already pinned there.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,390
So, just like your start menu, you can pin APS to the START menu.

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,750
You can pin APS to your taskbar as well.

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,500
That makes him highly visible and easy.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:33,660
Tow.

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,310
Launch by default.

14
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,070
You'll see a few that are already pitting here.

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,560
For example,

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,900
you have your task view Microsoft Edge File Explorer and the

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,260
Window Store and you're off to the right.

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,600
We see our notifications area, and you can launch the action center from here.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,240
Well, look at those and other clips.

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,600
When you have open applications running on your device,

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,810
you'll see a narrow horizontal bar at the bottom of the icon on the test bar.

22
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,040
However,

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,440
your curse over one of these icons to get a live

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,140
thumbnail preview of that open application.

25
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,080
We have multiple instances you'll actually see

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,020
multiple thumbnails for each open window.

27
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,020
Now there's a few things you can do.

28
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,830
Customize the taskbar.

29
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,620
You can relocate it by selecting and dragging the taskbar

30
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,700
to a different border of your screen,

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,480
and you can select the exposed edge of the task fire.

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,840
To resize it right,

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,370
click an open area of the taskbar and select task Marcel aliens.

34
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,560
This will open the settings up directly to the settings related to your task.

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,790
For you can see there's quite a few switches here that you

36
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,740
can use to manage your task for lock.

37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,010
The task for the switch prevents it from being

38
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,140
relocated or resized as we saw earlier.

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,180
You can use these switches to automatically hide the

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,850
task fire and notice that once,

41
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,370
which is for desktop mode and the other for tablet mode by default,

42
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,340
this has turned off for desktop mode and enabled for tablet mode.

43
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,440
Of course, you can change either of these settings if you need to.

44
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,530
The switch used small taskbar _______ as the name implies enabling.

45
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,590
This will use smaller sized icons or _______ on the task for which

46
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,670
will allow you to see more information on the task.

47
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,310
For some people, like depend a lot of applications to the taskbar,

48
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,910
so they're easy to find that describes you,

49
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,560
then this may be a good setting for you to enable the switch used.

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,140
Peak to preview the desktop prefers to a tool that's

51
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,940
located on the far right end of the taskbar.

52
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,830
One enable you can hover over it to temporarily see the desktop.

53
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,440
Or you can select the peak tool to minimize all of your applications at once.

54
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,790
Show badges on taskbar _______ will allow badges to be used down here.

55
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,570
The Avengers can indicate status for an open application,

56
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,060
or they could display numbers indicating new emails or messages.

57
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,180
Just give you a couple examples below this.

58
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,130
Our menus that allow you to manually manage the taskbar location on

59
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,960
the screen and to allow _______ to be stacked.

60
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,280
When you have multiple instances of the same application open,

61
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,000
for example, you might have several spreadsheets open an excel.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,310
Now the switch will allow them to.

63
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,120
Either stack is a single button,

64
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,320
taking up less space braking force them each have their own button,

65
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,440
which could make it easier to jump between open files.

66
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,240
Well, look closer at the notification area in a separate clip.

67
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,340
So for now we will jump down to multiple displays.

68
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,340
Now, if you have multiple displays, you can make a few changes here.

69
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,610
First,

70
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,990
the switch allows you to display task bars on all of your

71
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,890
displays or just the primary or main display.

72
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,170
The next menu is again related to _______.

73
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,440
You can choose to show _______ for open applications on all of your displays,

74
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,440
just on the display that the APP is currently opened in,

75
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,020
or the main display and the current display again,

76
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,740
you could manage whether _______ are stacked on any of your task bars

77
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,740
beyond the main one that was managed from up here.

78
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,750
Well, look at the people up in a separate clip.

79
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,460
So for now,

80
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,000
we'll also skipped the taskbar settings related to the people out in this clip,

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:00,000
we've looked at using the taskbar on windows. Thanks for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip
