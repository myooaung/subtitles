00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.040
[Autogenerated] in this clip will look at connecting to WiFi.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.260
Now we live in a mobile world.

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.480
We move around a lot,

4
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.740
and we expect our devices to be able to connect to the Internet.

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.680
We want to check those Facebook updates.

6
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.160
We want to see our email.

7
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.540
We want a stream video.

8
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.940
So connecting to WiFi is a pretty essential task when using a mobile device,

9
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.400
you understand makes it pretty easy to connect to WiFi.

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.490
It's a pretty straightforward process, however.

11
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.560
There are some settings and some features you should

12
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.940
be aware of when using my fight.

13
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.420
My default in the notification area,

14
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.080
you'll see an icon which lets you know the status of your network connections.

15
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.240
The appearance of the icon itself can change to pay on what you're connected to.

16
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.640
Currently,

17
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.390
my devices connected to a network using an Ethernet cable Ah WiFi

18
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.240
connection would have a different appearance here.

19
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.200
And if there were some limitations or issues with my connection,

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.780
I would also be able to see that visually,

21
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.940
right here on my network, I can.

22
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.270
In this case, the icon tells me that I have an Internet connection.

23
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.940
If I hover over the icon, I can see.

24
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.240
This is confirmed by the message that appears here.

25
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.540
I will mention here that Microsoft has been testing some

26
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.300
new icons for network connections.

27
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.240
So in the future, you may see different icons altogether.

28
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.940
But this same technique of hovering over the icon will let you

29
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.920
know both the type of connection you have.

30
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.730
And it will let you know if you're only connected to a local network or

31
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.940
if you're actually connected out to the Internet.

32
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.120
Since we're focused on WiFi in this clip,

33
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.940
I'm going to lose my Ethernet connection and watch what happens.

34
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.590
Unfortunately,

35
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.440
this device is able to roll over to a known WiFi connection pretty quickly.

36
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.700
The current icon indicates a WiFi connection,

37
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.640
and hovering over it again confirms an active Internet connection.

38
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.360
An exclamation point over the connection would usually alert me

39
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.320
visually to a connection that doesn't have Internet.

40
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.390
Although sometimes in practice, this device may not right away,

41
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.440
see that my Roeder has lost an Internet connection.

42
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.720
So sometimes the icon may not indicate right away the

43
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.940
actual state of your connection.

44
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.770
If I select the network icon, it'll actually show me more information here.

45
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.960
I can see the current active connections up here at the top says,

46
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.130
I'm connected, and it indicates that my connection is secured below this.

47
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.780
I can see any other WiFi networks that are within range and notice.

48
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.560
The additional information is showing about them as well.

49
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.420
But secured WiFi network means that a password or some other

50
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.230
means of authentication is required to connect to that

51
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.750
network networks that are unsecured.

52
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.810
We usually have some indication using exclamation Point to alert you to the

53
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.970
potential risk of connecting to an unsecured network.

54
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.320
These are the types of network she'll commonly see in public areas,

55
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.070
coffee shops or hotels.

56
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.430
But even when a business has a secure network and

57
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.040
they require passwords connected,

58
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.920
why did you remember that their public networks,

59
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.640
essentially you're potentially connected to other devices on that network

60
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.220
that are being operated by people you don't know so well,

61
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.240
we'll talk about that again in the future.

62
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.270
Signal strength is also indicated by the icon itself.

63
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.690
The closer you are to an access point, the stronger the signal will appear,

64
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.690
and the more stable your connection.

65
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.740
Connecting to a WiFi network for the first time is again rather straightforward,

66
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.280
from the available traces that are in range.

67
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.790
I can select a network.

68
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.840
As you can see here, you can expect to see a button to connect,

69
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.640
but also a check box to connect automatically.

70
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.120
Leaving this box checked will tell your device to just

71
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.190
automatically connect in the future when you're in range at

72
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.090
your office or visiting a friend's home.

73
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.340
That would be places where this would be a good idea to leave a check.

74
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.990
Sometimes I don't want my device automatically connecting to certain networks.

75
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.560
There could be security reasons,

76
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.000
but it could also have to do with bandwidth or other

77
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.440
devices and in particular network.

78
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.700
You may want to connect to a smart TV to stream

79
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.220
content from your Windows 10 device, for example,

80
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.940
or connect to a WiFi printer.

81
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.070
Now you need to be on the same WiFi network to work with those types of devices.

82
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.020
So when multiple networks are available,

83
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.280
connecting automatically should be used accordingly.

84
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.590
After selecting connect,

85
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.230
you device will query the network to see what's required here.

86
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.580
I'm asked to provide a network security key,

87
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.690
which is just simply another way of saying it wants a password notice.

88
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.240
It also says I can push the button and the rotor.

89
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.890
WiFi rotors often have a W.

90
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.430
P S button, which stands for wireless protected.

91
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.590
Set up the GPS button lets the broader know you're trying to connect the device,

92
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.250
and it will send out a signal inviting a connection for

93
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.240
several seconds after the button's been pushed.

94
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.620
Generally,

95
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.650
there is a pin number provided by the road er that you can type in

96
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.140
your device when it's negotiating the connection.

97
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.310
Although there are variations in the way W.

98
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.210
P s is employed on different Rogers and devices once connected,

99
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.290
the two devices will remember each other in the future.

100
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.190
For this connection, I have a password, but I need to take them now.

101
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.700
WiFi passwords are case sensitive password Security itself

102
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.300
could have multiple levels to encrypt data moving between

103
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.690
your device and the router, and we'll look at security closer and other clips.

104
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.080
But generally you're only gonna be prompted to supply the password.

105
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.670
The device in the rod or no, the other settings that expected,

106
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.440
and it's really simplifies WiFi connections with Windows 10.

107
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.910
If you do have trouble connecting and the password you're using is correct,

108
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.740
he's the first check with whoever manages that WiFi network,

109
00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.770
they may have some particular settings enable,

110
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.060
and they would likely be familiar with whatever problems you're

111
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.740
having connecting to that particular network.

112
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.890
Here.

113
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.730
I'm all set, so I'm gonna select next,

114
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.370
and my device will send the password to the rotor for verification.

115
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.420
Not once has accepted.

116
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.540
I'll be connected.

117
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.540
Usually, we'll also see a prompt asking you to identify the network type.

118
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.640
Is it a public or is it a work or home an hour?

119
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.740
Now?

120
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.470
This is really related to security.

121
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.820
If you select home or work,

122
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.660
your device will allow connections from other devices,

123
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.320
and those other devices will see your device that it's connected to the network.

124
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.540
If they look,

125
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.670
this makes it possible to connect two devices like printers and to share

126
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.640
files between devices that are on the same network.

127
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.850
You know, if you're connected to a network at a coffee house or hotel,

128
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.400
you should select public.

129
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.070
The device will be invisible,

130
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.840
and Windows will not accept connections from other devices on that network.

131
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.920
Now, if I select my network,

132
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.240
I kind here I can see that I'm connected to this new WiFi network,

133
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.850
selecting the networking Internet settings link down here opens up

134
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.770
the settings that I can see links and information about my

135
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.780
connection currently reminisce like WiFi over here to jump right to

136
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.970
our sightings for WiFi connections.

137
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.540
Again, I see the current WiFi connection here it shows connected and secured.

138
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.010
And from here,

139
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.340
I can actually select that connection to manage some additional details.

140
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.700
If you recall the check box from earlier to connect automatically here,

141
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.340
we can enable that same setting with a switch.

142
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.770
We can have it enabled or disabled.

143
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.840
There's also an option here for random hardware dresses.

144
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.250
Now, we're gonna look closer at this feature in a separate clip.

145
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.440
But for now, I would recommend you just leave this unchanged.

146
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.740
We're also gonna look at the sitting below metered connections in another clip.

147
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.670
It's really known to the bottom.

148
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.800
I can actually see details about my current WiFi connection,

149
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.310
the network name or S S I.

150
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.750
D security settings.

151
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.040
The I P address of my device and other details are all here.

152
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.290
This could be useful information.

153
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.870
If you ever troubleshooting issues and you're asked for some of these details,

154
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.090
you can even select copy and paste all of this into an email

155
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.740
and send it to whoever is helping you.

156
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.840
I'm gonna like the back girl and I'm gonna select manage known networks.

157
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.440
This is where I can manage what my device knows about wireless networks.

158
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.700
I can manually put information here about a wireless

159
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.640
network by selecting add a noon hour.

160
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.920
Now, it's rare that you would actually need to ever do this,

161
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.110
But there are times especially for increased security.

162
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.370
When a WiFi network is left invisible,

163
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.610
it won't appear as an available network you can connect to.

164
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.910
But if you have the right information saved to your device,

165
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.200
you can actually connect to a network like that blew this.

166
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.400
You're gonna see all the networks that your device knows,

167
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.280
and this could be a rather long list.

168
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.360
By default, your device will connect to any of these save networks.

169
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.540
The next time they're in range,

170
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.860
you may no longer want your device to connect to certain WiFi networks.

171
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.090
Or it could be that the network itself has changed and the remembered

172
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.280
information just keeps failing to connect in those cases,

173
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.100
