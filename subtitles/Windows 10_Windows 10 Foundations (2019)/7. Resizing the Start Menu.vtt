[Autogenerated] In this short clip,

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.640
we're gonna look at re sizing the start menu as you

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.870
begin to add content to your start menu.

4
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.630
New APS, New tiles,

5
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.160
new groups You may start to feel that you're running out of space.

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.280
Well,

7
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.800
there's actually a couple different ways that you can resize your start menu.

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.680
The start menu itself shares some properties with the way windows function.

9
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.270
If you hold your cursor right over the edge of a window,

10
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.240
you can usually select and dragged the border of a window to resize it.

11
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.760
We can do the same thing with the start menu the upper and write Most

12
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.350
borders of the Start menu will behave the same way.

13
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.980
If you hold your cursor right over the edge, notice the chorus or changes.

14
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.640
Now I can select and drag and resize my start menu.

15
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.300
You can, of course,

16
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.760
they're the same thing if you want your start menu

17
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.310
to be smaller and less intrusive,

18
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.300
but for the most part we tend to want it to be bigger and hold more content.

19
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.660
Of course,

20
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.590
this isn't really an issue if you're working in tablet mode because your

21
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.460
start menu would actually be full screen by default.

22
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.340
But if you're working in desktop mode,

23
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.340
you can actually make your start my new full size.

24
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.430
Also,

25
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.120
to manually make your start menu full screen while working

26
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.330
in dust up mode over your settings out.

27
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.150
And so, like personalization.

28
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.190
Select start and turn the switch on to use.

29
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.600
Start full screen.

30
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.440
The next time you open your start menu, you'll have a full screen start menu.

31
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.470
Now you may find that working with a full screen

32
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.790
start menu has some disadvantages.

33
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.850
The navigation menu here to the left is compressed.

34
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.860
You may find yourself going through some extra steps to get to the folders

35
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.600
that normally appear in this area of the start menu.

36
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:42.000
In this clip, we've looked at re sizing the start menu. Thanks for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
