00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,800
[Autogenerated] and this little look at some of the options

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,940
you have to personalize windows with color,

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,320
central concept and design.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,890
The Windows operating system has always been to provide you with

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,140
options that enable you to personalize Windows.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,050
Windows 10 allows you to customize the colors that are used throughout

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,530
the menus and toolbars so you can really make Windows.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,100
Your own Hollis ability is especially useful for small

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,820
organizations and businesses that prefer to have their own

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,840
branding and color schemes reflected on their devices.

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,330
Of course,

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,380
larger organizations and businesses generally will use tools

13
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,370
like group policy that allow them to centrally managed these

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,440
settings on all of their devices.

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,140
To see the options you have related to colors open up the settings out.

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,330
There's actually a keyboard shortcut you can use.

17
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,630
Open it like the Windows Key and the Letter I the same time where you

18
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,670
can just select the Settings icon from the start menu in the settings

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,040
at select personalization from here, select colors soft to the left.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,210
No, this large preview gives us an idea of the current color choices,

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,170
and it will update and reflect any changes we make.

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,310
There's a check box here that lets windows dynamically pick a color that

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,640
complements our current desktop background or wallpaper.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,210
This could be a good option if we want a specific wallpaper

25
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,020
you're no is concerned about the accident.

26
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,220
Color itself in a separate clip will look at options

27
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,630
related to desktop backgrounds, But for now,

28
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,310
I'm gonna leave this unchecked.

29
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,940
Let's roll down to the palate of colors we see under windows colors.

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,320
So from here,

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,910
I can select a color from those presented and notice

32
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,750
what happens when I select a color.

33
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,860
Some of the changes that take place immediately not

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,560
only the preview displays changed,

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,340
but there's also subtle color changes to icons in the taskbar text.

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,140
Even selected items like the colors Time over here.

37
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,590
You can just select color from the palate if you see when you like.

38
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,140
But if you want a very specific color, select custom color.

39
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,980
Now here we can see there's some great tools.

40
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,840
First, the current color has shown, and we can tweak it using the slider here.

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,970
Or we could select from the color spectrum up here, down below.

42
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,980
We can also see some examples of how this accident color would be used

43
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,960
and I can actually see a helpful warning down here that text me not

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,840
display while with this current choice.

45
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,000
If we select more,

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,630
I can be very specific about using RGB or H S V values for my color and I.

47
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,120
Also, I really like this.

48
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,640
The option import Hexi decimal values.

49
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,360
Returning to the main colors pain.

50
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,640
We also have additional options.

51
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,940
Transparency may already be on by default,

52
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,120
but this basically just make some of our menu slightly transparent,

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,140
which has a nice effect.

54
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,670
There's also check boxes to use our selected accent color and then apply

55
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,340
this color to the Start Menu Taskbar and Action Center.

56
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,160
We could also use the check box to apply it to all title bars.

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,910
And when his borders again looking up here to a preview,

58
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,140
we can get a good idea of how these color traces will look.

59
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,080
Finally, there's a setting related to the default app mood,

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,120
but we only have two choices.

61
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,640
Your light or dark.

62
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,540
Currently, I prefer the dark moon myself.

63
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,920
The choice we make here will apply to many of the core system

64
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,040
maps that are included with Windows 10.

65
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,490
However,

66
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,140
one make changes to other APS that we might install from the Windows Store.

67
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,030
The default color mode you select manages the overall backgrounds,

68
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,300
the menus, that title bar of those APS.

69
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,640
And in a future update, Windows will get a much better light mode.

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,610
That's a lot better than the simple white background that's currently enabled

71
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,390
by default in Windows 10 anchored you to experiment of it.

72
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,140
Find the combination you like after the right.

73
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,960
You can also see helpful links to other settings.

74
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,640
It will impact your color choices, and we'll consider these later in other clips.

75
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:54,000
In this clip, we've looked at personalizing windows with color. Thanks for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
