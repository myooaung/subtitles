00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,810
[Autogenerated] in this clip, we'll look at using the start menu.

2
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,470
The START menu has received a lot of thought and attention,

3
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,040
and it's far as how it functions and peers in Windows 10.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,590
A lot of elements will be familiar to you from Windows X,

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,870
P Windows, Vista or seven.

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,320
It also includes elements from Windows eight.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,370
When you open your Start menu,

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,300
you'll see it's basically broken down into two sections off here to the left,

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,810
you have a navigation area, and to the right you'll see tiles.

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,030
Obviously, with the tiles,

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,160
they kind of grab your attention because many of them are life tiles.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,840
Lifestyles are designed to provide you with information from within the app.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,710
So at a glance you can get important information such as weather or news,

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,420
and you also see things that are designed to catch your

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,910
attention and encourage interaction with the zaps.

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,960
This area of tiles could be organized and rearranged to suit your needs,

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,390
and we'll look at how to do that in other clips.

18
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,340
Here to the left, you have a navigation area,

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,300
and you'll see things like most used APS you'll see recently installed.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,870
APS entered the bottom of the navigation or you see a few shortcuts.

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,800
The start menu can be resized by simply selecting

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,340
and dragging one of the borders.

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,730
And there's a few key settings with the start menu should

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,440
be aware of the open your settings, app and select personalization,

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,320
and here we're gonna look at this.

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,680
Start options so you can choose to include most use

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,710
APS or also recently added APS.

28
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,640
I recommend you leave those on.

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,560
You can choose to have your start menu just appear as a full screen menu,

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,220
and another clip will look a tablet mode and we'll see that.

31
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,510
That's how that actually works by default.

32
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,160
You can also choose to use jump lists or not on your start menu.

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,690
I recommend you leave that I'm well, look,

34
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,470
a jump lists in another clip as well Friendly.

35
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,870
You can choose which folders appear on start.

36
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,390
If you select that, you can see file Explorer and settings are on by default.

37
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,810
You can also add other key folders, such as documents or downloads,

38
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,430
or maybe some of your libraries.

39
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,540
So they're right there at the Start menu.

40
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,950
We're actually going to look at a lot of the features of the start menu

41
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,600
in more detail through quite a few different clips.

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,720
So I encourage you to watch those as well.

43
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:24,000
In this clip, we've looked at using the start menu, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
