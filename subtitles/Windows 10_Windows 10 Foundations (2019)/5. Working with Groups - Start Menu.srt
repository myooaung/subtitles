[Autogenerated] in this clip,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,480
we're gonna look at working with groups on the START menu.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,270
Does your no doubt noticed by now is you start to pin APS

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,140
and applications to your START menu.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,380
It starts to look a little bit like the Wild West windows will

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,250
just pin new APS to the bottom of the start menu,

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,680
and even if you rearrange them, it still can look a bit chaotic and disorganized.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,110
So when does 10 really has some good tools built in the hope you

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,340
keep your start menu under control and organized?

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,420
One of the best ways to do this is actually through the use of groups.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,790
When you first open your start manual actually noticed that there

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,940
are some groups already created by default.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,300
Here you see one of those groups,

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,240
and I've been adding APS to that and playing Explorers,

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,820
another group that was included with Windows 10.

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,770
Now creating groups on the fly is really easy to do.

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,770
Rather than just moving an app from one group to another,

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,270
notice what happens if I take this app and drag it

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,640
jin area below one of my groups.

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,910
Notice the spacing that's given to this new app.

21
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,940
Location.

22
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,510
Harold, grab another app and notice.

23
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll drag it between two existing groups.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,520
And again,

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,380
we can see that the way things rearrange and move is

26
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,680
actually allowing space for a new group.

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,990
Now, here I have a few APS already grouped kind of by category,

28
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,750
So I would consider these to be news oriented APS.

29
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,840
And another nice feature about groups on the START menu is that

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,740
you can actually name these whatever you want,

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,940
and you can rename ones that are already there.

32
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,900
If I hover my cursor over the top of the group knows

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,260
there's actually a place holder there.

34
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,690
That's his name group.

35
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,580
If I select that, it actually turns into a text box,

36
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,520
and I can now type in a new group name.

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,370
I'm gonna call this news so I can continue to add other APS.

38
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,210
Maybe that are related to news to the same group,

39
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:47,120
and I can create similar groups for gaming for photos for social media.

40
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,280
No,

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
the other nice thing about using groups is that you

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,820
can actually move groups as a whole.

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,690
So here, in my case,

44
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,860
I don't want my new zaps toe all a sudden be down out of

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,900
sight where I have to scroll down to find him every time I

46
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,040
want them right at the top.

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,120
Somebody selecting drag my group of new zaps to the very top of my start menu,

48
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,400
and that's all there is to it.

49
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,080
It's really very simple Dragon drop method of keeping

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,020
your Start menu organized in this clip.

51
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:22,000
We've looked at working with groups on the START menu. Thanks for watching and look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
