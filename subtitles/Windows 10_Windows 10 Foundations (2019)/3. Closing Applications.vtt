00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.950
[Autogenerated] in the short clip will look at closing applications.

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.440
If you're long time Windows user, you're very familiar with the title bar,

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.190
and it's important tools, including the ex,

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.710
to close your application.

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.800
So for those using Windows 10 devices in desktop mode,

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.760
you'll find that this continues to be the most

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.420
practical way to close your applications.

8
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.360
The Windows 10 has a lot of features that really are designed to work

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.660
well with touch screen displays and another clip.

10
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.580
We're going to look closer at the idea of tablet mode,

11
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.110
but basically a touchscreen display with Windows 10

12
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.010
will normally run in tablet mode,

13
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.650
which changes the way that open applications work on your device.

14
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.060
When your touch screen devices in the default tablet mode,

15
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.690
you'll find that you can simply swipe down from the top of the screen.

16
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.670
Your finger will catch the app that happens to be open,

17
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.330
and as your finger travels down the screen,

18
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.550
the apple shrink.

19
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.880
And if you continue to drag it all the way to the bottom of the screen,

20
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.840
you'll see it moves to the task bar.

21
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.090
At this point, the APP will close if you release your finger.

22
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.450
So with touchscreen devices.

23
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.370
Closing an application is simply a matter of Dragon from the

24
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.640
top of the display all the way to the bottom,

25
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.310
and that app will be closed.

26
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.430
Now,

27
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.900
if you have multiple APs visible on your display just swept

28
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.120
down where the app that's open happens to be,

29
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.970
make sure your finger catches that app to drag it down and close it.

30
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.500
In this clip.

31
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:29.000
We've looked at closing applications. Thanks for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
