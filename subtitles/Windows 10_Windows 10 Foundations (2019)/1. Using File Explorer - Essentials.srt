00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,240
[Autogenerated] in this clip,

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,740
we're gonna consider the essentials of working with File Explorer.

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,280
Now, File Explorer is a very important application that's built into Windows.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,140
It helps you to work with your files and folders they're located on your

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,200
device or any networks that you may be connected to.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,900
Now there's several ways open file explore.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,430
The easiest is that if it's pinned to your taskbar,

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,040
you could open it from there.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,460
If you select the start button,

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,340
you'll also see File Explorer listed there by default.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,740
When you first opened File Explorer,

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,230
there's some basic features that are important to understand.

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,780
We're gonna take a moment to consider those first of all off here to the left,

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,340
you have an area that's called the navigation Pane.

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,010
Now the navigation pane is basically an important tool that

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,530
helps you to get around quickly on your device or other

17
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,230
places you may have access to.

18
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:56,790
In addition,

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,810
you'll see that there may be more than one way of presenting some of

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,770
the same files and folders on your device now,

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,630
anything that's selected over here to the left,

22
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,970
the contents are displayed here to the right,

23
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,020
so I select this PC I can see some key folders and different drives

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,770
that are connected to my device are enlisted.

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,420
If I select a folder, I can see files and folders that air within that folder.

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,990
No, you'll notice these arrows over here in the navigation pane,

27
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,890
and these allow you to expand or collapse folders to view their contents.

28
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,440
Now the contents could be displayed in different ways.

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,200
For example, this is a detailed view,

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,010
and this gives me columns that I can actually use to sort my information.

31
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,330
You can use things like list view, or you could use thumbnails,

32
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,510
which is helpful when you're looking for maybe images or videos.

33
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,280
I'll show you how to change views really quick.

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,760
Here in just a second above the Syria, we have the address bar.

35
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,820
Now the address bar shows me where I'm at in my navigation and again in

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,080
the address by you'll see these same little arrows,

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,280
and I can use those to expand or collapse the contents of those folders.

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,590
And again,

39
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,670
I can jump to those folders right from there to the left of my address bar.

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,020
I have a few other arrows that are good to know.

41
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,700
I have a forward and backward arrow,

42
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,700
and these let me step forward or backward in my steps of navigation.

43
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,100
The up arrow will let me to go up one level in the Iraqi.

44
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,420
So if I'm in a sub folder,

45
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,820
I could hit the operator and jump up to the main folder.

46
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,210
This little arrow here shows me the history of places I visited while this bile

47
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,640
explore has been opened here to the right of the address.

48
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,430
But I see a search field I could type in a file or folder name or a

49
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,610
keyword that may be associated with one of my files,

50
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,100
and the search will be running the folder I've

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,700
currently selected in my navigation pane.

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,350
Above this, we have the ribbon.

53
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,160
We're gonna look at the ribbon and more detail in another clip.

54
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,270
But I just want to show you the View tab and from the View tab,

55
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,520
we can control our layout that we see down here below.

56
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,500
So besides the navigation pane and my main pain that

57
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,130
shows the contents of a folder,

58
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,020
I can also enable the preview pain or the details pain and I can change

59
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,260
the layout of the contents by using different size icons on list or a

60
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,230
detailed view now here above the ribbon,

61
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,210
we have another important tool that sometimes has overlooked easily,

62
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,590
and that's the quick access toolbar.

63
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,820
Now the choice is listed here are related to common tasks within File Explorer.

64
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,490
I can enable additional ones here and you'll see the checkmark

65
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,450
appears that lets me know that they've been enabled,

66
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,100
and I'll see there's a button that appears on my title bar.

67
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,550
So these again are for common tasks that I use.

68
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,740
Maybe quite often.

69
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,150
For example, there's several ways you could create a new folder,

70
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,780
but the button here lets me create a new folder with one simple click.

71
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,920
Finally, down at the bottom.

72
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,740
We have our status bar.

73
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,130
Now the status bar will give me information about the folder

74
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,660
immune or any files that may have selected here.

75
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,040
To the right,

76
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,400
I have to shortcuts again that affect how things are

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,130
displayed in the contents pain.

78
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:52,000
In this clip, we briefly looked at using File Explorer. Thanks for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip
