00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.920
[Autogenerated] in this clip will look a understanding.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.630
Sinan options.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.810
We live in a world that requires us to be security conscious.

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.980
We lock up our doors when we're away from home.

5
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.910
We lock the doors of our vehicle when we park in an unfamiliar area,

6
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.800
and most of us recognize the need to have our devices.

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.410
Are computers and tablets secure?

8
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.000
And this could be it.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.730
For practical reasons, maybe we have young ones at home.

10
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.280
Perhaps we work with information that sensitive or confidential in nature.

11
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.240
Or maybe we're just nervous about identity theft.

12
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.890
All of these air good motives to have reasonable security in

13
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.040
place when it comes to our electronic devices.

14
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.810
And with Windows 10 we now have greater flexibility than ever before.

15
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.300
When it comes to signing in tow our tablets and computers.

16
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.310
When you first set up your computer or tablet,

17
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.740
you increase to put in a user name and password.

18
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.410
There's a good chance you use the Microsoft account,

19
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.570
but let's take a moment and let's review some of our signing options and some of

20
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.460
the flexibility that Windows 10 brings to our devices toe.

21
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.580
Look at your seinen options.

22
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.060
Open the settings out and then select accounts here in

23
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.590
your accounts will go to signing options.

24
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.750
And now the available options you'll see under Sinan options will vary

25
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.730
depending on your device in the kind of account you're using.

26
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.770
Now we may be using a Microsoft account,

27
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.960
which is a cloud based account with a password,

28
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.300
or we may have a local account, which has a password and so is expected.

29
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.180
We can work with our passwords from here,

30
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.300
but Windows 10 brings us some additional options from our sign it options.

31
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.620
We can add a pin now.

32
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.600
This is a short sequence of numbers.

33
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.870
Most often, this is a four digit number.

34
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.610
The avenge of a pin is that we can quickly and easily sign

35
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.900
into our device or authenticate our identity when we make a

36
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.340
purchase in the Windows Store.

37
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.990
From our signing options, we can add a pin number,

38
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.990
and if we already have a pin number, we could make changes to that pin number.

39
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.440
To add a new pin, simply select add.

40
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.200
You'll be prompted to put in your cramped password.

41
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.660
You'll then see the set up a pin window appear.

42
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.540
Enter your pin number and a second time to confirm it and then select okay.

43
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.200
In the future,

44
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.680
you'll have the option to use your pin number when you sign into your device.

45
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.960
One thing to be aware of when using a pin with your devices,

46
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.280
you simply enter the numbers.

47
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.340
There's no need to press enter to finalize that input process.

48
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.660
Another innovative SINAN option you have with Windows

49
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.740
10 is to use a picture password.

50
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.250
This is really targeted for tablets and touchscreen devices.

51
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.350
A picture password is simply a picture that's put up on the screen that

52
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.240
requires you using touch to repeat the same gestures each time to unlock

53
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.950
your device to greet a picture password.

54
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.740
Select, add And here you're prompted for your current password to proceed.

55
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.080
Next,

56
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.930
you're going to want to select the picture that will be part of your password.

57
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.040
So it's gonna have a picture picked out or in mind ahead of time.

58
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.770
It's like the picture you'd like to use confirmed.

59
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.950
This is the picture I want to use by selecting used this

60
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.600
picture where you can choose anyone.

61
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.080
I'm gonna use this picture,

62
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.050
and now I have to repeat three gestures and notice the note.

63
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.940
The size the position and the direction of our gestures has to be

64
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.840
repeated the same way each time and in the same sequence.

65
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.790
So I'm gonna create a little circle here.

66
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.290
We'll make a line here and let's do another circle over here.

67
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.700
I just have to confirm my three gestures.

68
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.590
Have a circle a line, another circle, and now I can select finish now.

69
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.210
In some cases, you may see other options,

70
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.740
depending on the hardware that's attached to your device.

71
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.190
For example, Windows 10 includes support for Windows Hello,

72
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.680
and this allows you to use biometrics to sign into your device.

73
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.200
So device has to have a compatible camera that can use facial recognition.

74
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.430
Or you have to have a fingerprint scanner that's compatible with Windows.

75
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.690
10.

76
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.590
In another clip will actually look at setting up a

77
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.440
fingerprint scan using Windows.

78
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.910
Hello, any of these methods that you've set up our alternatives to your password,

79
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.800
but they really don't replace your password,

80
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.900
and so you'll see you have the option to change.

81
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.440
Remove these alternative signing options.

82
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.370
You also notice when you first sign into your device here in the

83
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.780
lock screen that the default Sinan method is presented but you can

84
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.980
always select from other signing options,

85
00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.960
and this is always useful.

86
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.070
If you forget the gestures needed to use a picture signing,

87
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.370
for example, or if you forget your pin number,

88
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.330
you can always fall back to your password.

89
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.800
And then after you've signed into device, you can reset those other options.

90
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.110
No one.

91
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.810
Last thing I want to mention with regard to signing

92
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.010
options is that in some circumstances,

93
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.140
not all of these Sinan options will be available to you.

94
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.920
Your organization may have security in place that prevents

95
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.240
you from using a pin or picture password.

96
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.910
These air considered weaker Sinan options in this clip.

97
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:40.000
We've looked at understanding your sign in options. Thanks for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
