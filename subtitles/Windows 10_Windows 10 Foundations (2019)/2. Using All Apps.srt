00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,670
[Autogenerated] in this clip will look at all APS elapses.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:11,340
The list that appears to the left of our start menu while we're in desktop mode.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,660
When we was 10 was first released,

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,080
there was actually a link that took you to a full

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,820
list of all APS on your device, but with updates.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,380
The Windows 10 The Elapsed List is now present at all times here,

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,040
off to the left while you're in desktop mode.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,530
In a later clip will look a tablet mode and how the start menu especially,

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,440
is laid out differently.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,880
For now,

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,470
it's enough to say that tablet mode is ideal for touch

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,440
screen interaction with Windows 10.

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,870
While desktop mode is the default screen,

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,840
lee out for keyboard and most interaction.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,730
So what exactly is all APS When we were looking at the Start menu,

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,860
we have this great navigation tool over here.

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,480
That's a scroll herbal list off.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,270
All the applications are installed in your device.

19
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,940
This list is presented in alphabetical order,

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,130
and we'll look more at the differences later.

21
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,760
But the applications on your Windows 10 device I generally installed as

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,490
either APs from the Microsoft store or their traditional desktop

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,140
applications that are installed from an installation disk or downloaded

24
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,010
installer now with desktop applications.

25
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,380
This kind of a big effect on where the application appears in this

26
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,630
alphabetical list because many desktop applications air actually installed

27
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,270
into a folder that can appear in your all APS list.

28
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,670
Just to give you an example of one well known application

29
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,330
for video and audio playback is the V.

30
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:23,750
L C.

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,040
Media player.

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,130
Now, if I scroll down to V, we don't see the V l C media player listed here.

33
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,380
However, notice this folder Video land.

34
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,580
I can expand the folder, and there's the V L C media player,

35
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,740
along with a few related tools.

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,710
Now, if the application were named ABC Media Player,

37
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,790
it would still be here under V if the folder was installed.

38
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:49,030
Two was video LAN Desktop applications don't have to be installed in a folder,

39
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,150
and many aren't.

40
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,010
But developers often choose to do so when there are multiple

41
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,640
tools or applications that installed together.

42
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,800
It does help to keep things a bit more organized,

43
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,440
and clutter can really become an issue in this list.

44
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,590
Now,

45
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,430
another set of folders that you will find in the all APS list

46
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,200
our system related applications under W.

47
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,770
We can expand Windows accessories.

48
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,900
There's some great tools in here and to be aware of their kind of hidden

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,740
because few people would know to look in this folder.

50
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,240
No pad is in here.

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,110
WordPad,

52
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,740
which is a free document editor included With Windows 10

53
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,040
The old paint application is in here.

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,800
Quick assists and steps recorder.

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,160
Those were a couple of tools that can be used when working

56
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,570
with someone remotely for troubleshooting.

57
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,370
Even the older Internet Explorer, which is still installed,

58
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,500
that many Windows 10 devices will be found in here.

59
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,180
So I encourage you to expand folders.

60
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,440
Look at the application's installed in your device in the all APS list

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,530
and other clips will look at ways to keep your often used applications

62
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,420
easier to access and even share some tips to make it faster to locate

63
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,340
those seldom used applications.

64
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,810
Over time, the amount of applications installed in your device will tend to grow,

65
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,640
and scrolling will just become less practical.

66
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,240
An important navigation tool included in the all APS list

67
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,640
is the ability to select the letter,

68
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,560
which brings up this condensed menu and then jumped

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,240
to a separate letter in list.

70
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,310
Now that's a pretty useful feature in the slip.

71
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:25,000
We've looked at the all APS list. Thanks for watching Hamlet forward to see New in the next clip.
