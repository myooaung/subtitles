00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,300
[Autogenerated] in this clip,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,330
we're going to look at snapping windows to the screen.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,560
Snap was first introduced with Windows seven,

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,960
and you may have used in Window seven or Windows eight with Windows 10.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,890
Snap gets some new features.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,630
Snap is designed to help you manage the windows that appear on your screen.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,990
As you can see here, I have a mess of different windows that are open,

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,690
overlapping one another.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,400
Now the taskbar can help me to jump between windows.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,750
Or I could arrange these in a way that maybe it makes it easy

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,700
to jump to windows that I want to work with.

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,470
But you'll find Snap really is useful in Windows 10

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,020
Snap works by grabbing the title bar, which I simply select,

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,440
and then I can drag a window around.

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,690
If I take it to the top of my screen,

16
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,420
you can see a faint outline that lets me know that

17
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,300
this app will now be full screen.

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,770
If I take the toolbar and I drag it to one of the left

19
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,320
or right side of my screen noticed,

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,010
the outline shows that that will occupy half of my screen,

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,060
and this is where a new feature snap assist comes into play.

22
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,870
The remaining part of my screen could be used by different app,

23
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,680
and snap assist lets me choose from available APs that are currently open,

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,750
and I can simply select the app that I want to use for the rest of the screen.

25
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,290
Now, with Windows 10 and dependent on the display that you're working with,

26
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,020
you're also able to snap windows to the quadrants of your screen.

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,210
In this case, if I dragged the title bar up to a corner of my screen,

28
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,790
noticed that it now just takes 1/4 of the screen and snap a system again,

29
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,940
let me select which app can occupy the remaining quarter.

30
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,050
Well,

31
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,890
this way of snapping windows obviously would be a lot more

32
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,610
effective in the screen with a much higher resolution.

33
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,470
So even though you may be able to snap multiple applications to your screen,

34
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,280
it may not be a very practical arrangement,

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,090
given your resolution, Tablet mode also will use snap.

36
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,820
However, you cannot currently snap applications to the corners of your display.

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,260
So again, now I'm in tablet mode.

38
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,080
If I take my app and snap it to the left or the right.

39
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,800
You can see that there is a central border that

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,390
appears snap assist appears again,

41
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,170
and I can select the app to share the rest of the screen with.

42
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,510
And now we can grab this vertical border in dragon,

43
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,760
left or right to change the percentage of screen

44
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,280
that each application will share.

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,610
You'll also notice that a small vertical bar lets me see

46
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,950
which application is currently selected.

47
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,540
I'm gonna return the tablet mode,

48
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,840
and let's look at some settings that affect how snap functions in your device.

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,240
Hair minutes.

50
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,980
I've been snapped.

51
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,520
You know, there's a few settings related to snap that appear.

52
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,560
Any of these will take me to the system portion of the

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,290
settings up to the multitasking pain,

54
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,700
and here the upper section will see is labeled snap.

55
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,600
So let's let me turn some features on and off so you can see on by default.

56
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,310
Is the ability to trigger the snap by dragging the window

57
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,040
itself to the corner or edge of your screen.

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,070
On by the fall again is the ability to snap a window to fill in the

59
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,330
available space and snap Assist is enabled lets me see what else I

60
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,560
could snap next to a snapped window.

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:37,900
Oh, snap.

62
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,800
Also confused with your keyboard.

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,280
If you have a selected window,

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,520
simply hold your windows key and use your arrow keys to indicate

65
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,200
which direction you want that window to snap.

66
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,210
Generally holding the windows key and selecting left or right,

67
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,240
we'll put it the left or right side of your screen,

68
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,660
and then you can use the up and down.

69
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:53,870
Aargh!

70
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,960
Next didn't get if you wanted to go to the upper or

71
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,970
lower corner on that side of the screen.

72
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,090
Snap works with multiple displays,

73
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,940
and if you work a little bit with re sizing the

74
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,240
windows after they've been snapped,

75
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,100
you'll find there's quite a few configurations you

76
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,370
can come up with a plan created,

77
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,240
experiment a little bit with snap and see how it could

78
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,590
be useful to you in your routine.

79
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:22,000
In this clip, we've looked at snapping windows to the screen. Thanks for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip
