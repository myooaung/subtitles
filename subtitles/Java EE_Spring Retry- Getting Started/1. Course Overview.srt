00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,201
(Music) Hi everyone.

2
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:08,910
My name is Tyler Griffiths, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,459
Spring Retry: Getting Started.

4
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:14,114
If you love Spring, you'll love Spring Retry.

5
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,472
It's a great way to alleviate some of the pain points

6
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:18,003
associated with microservice environments,

7
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:22,025
and it's painless to implement in your existing application.

8
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:22,637
In this course,

9
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:26,294
we're going to add retry to an existing microservice application that's

10
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:29,951
probably very similar to applications you work on.

11
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:32,855
Some of the major topics that we will cover include adding

12
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:35,351
retry to Spring's venerable RestTemplate,

13
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:40,489
configuring custom retry policies such as backoff and max attempts,

14
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,016
fine tuning retry by specifying specific exceptions to retry,

15
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:47,872
and pain points that retry can help you avoid.

16
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,600
By the end of this course,

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,470
you will know the basics of Spring Retry and be ready to implement

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,860
Spring Retry in your existing microservice environment.

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,599
Before beginning the course,

20
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:57,946
you should be familiar with Java and have a basic

21
00:00:57,946 --> 00:01:01,946
understanding of microservices and Spring Framework.

22
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:04,531
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn Spring Retry,

23
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:13,000
with the Spring Retry: Getting Started course, at Pluralsight.
