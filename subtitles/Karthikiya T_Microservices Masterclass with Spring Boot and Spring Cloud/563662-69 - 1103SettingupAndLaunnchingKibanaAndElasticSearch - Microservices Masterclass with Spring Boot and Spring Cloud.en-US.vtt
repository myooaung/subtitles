00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.460
Let's see how we can download

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.665
and set up all the
required tools.

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:06.510
And we leave and go
ahead and launch

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.089
Elastic Search as
well as Kibana.

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:10.875
With a quick Google search,

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:15.520
I came across this link,
download Elastic Search.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.940
Make sure that this link
belongs to elastic.com website.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.380
That's the official
website for these tools.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.310
Once you are there, choose

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.020
development platform,
in my case,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.385
it's Windows, and download
the relevant file.

00:00:34.385 --> 00:00:36.890
You need to do the
same for both Kibana

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.180
as well as Log Stash.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.995
Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:45.935
You can say download Log Stash.

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:51.350
Click on this link and you
would see a similar page.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.770
Just choose the platform
and download the file.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.885
Same as the case
with Kibana as well.

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:03.980
Go to elastic.com
website and then

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.600
download Kibana
on your platform.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.805
I've already done that.

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:14.225
And I've even unzipped
all those files.

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:17.030
And these are the
folders which I've got.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.490
Now I'm going to
leave everything to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.015
the default for Elastic Search.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:25.220
I don't have to
make any changes.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.290
I want it to run on local host.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.760
But in case if you
wanted to change

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.215
board number or something,

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:33.635
you can get inside the
folder, go to config.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:36.140
You would spot the file with

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
the name Elastic
Search dot YAML.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.180
Just go inside it

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.455
and you can change the
configurations here.

00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:47.300
For example, you
can change the port

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.225
to something else by
uncommenting this line.

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:52.835
I want to leave it to default,

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:56.015
which is mine to double 0.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:59.580
It is a board where
Elastic Search would run.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.340
Not to launch Elastic Search.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.920
Let's get inside the bin folder.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.115
And I'm going to
open the PowerShell.

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:13.939
I press the Shift key on
Windows and then right-click.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.090
Then you get this option
to open PowerShell,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.980
this directory or folder.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.605
Once you're there,
just run the script.

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:27.320
Elastic Search dot bat for

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.005
windows are simply
elastic search.

00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:32.310
If you're using Linux.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.384
Now you need to have
a lot of patients.

00:02:37.384 --> 00:02:39.620
It takes a while. Before we

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.210
see the silver getting started.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.875
I'm going to go inside
Gabbana folder conflict.

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:59.700
We're going to open combine
r dot Hamelin file.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:15.629
Let us search for Elastic
Search. The host.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.860
Let us uncomment this line
that we're Kibana is ever off.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.960
We are the last two
searches running so

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.005
that it knows where to
query and extract the data.

00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:35.180
Now let us go ahead and
launch Kibana as-built.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.770
But before that makes sure that

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.220
Elastic Searches up and
running, it's not mandatory.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.185
You can still launch Gabbana,

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:45.650
but let's follow
some good practices.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.980
The way you start Kibana
is by going inside

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.920
the folder bin and
then second launch the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:03.010
PowerShell and

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.830
run Kibana dot FAT file.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.945
Obviously this is going
to take lot of time.

00:04:10.945 --> 00:04:14.440
So let me pause the
video and then get back.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.210
Once these servers
are up and running,

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.120
we now have these
two up and running.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.850
Let us go to browser
and Fido axis.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.430
Then let us first try back to

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.360
this Elastic Search
and trans on port 92,

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.560
WE DO localhost
mine to double 0.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.640
You should be seeing
this response.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.835
Let us try to access
Cabana as well.

00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:53.490
It runs on port 5601,
localhost 5601.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.745
If you're able to see this UI,

00:04:58.745 --> 00:05:01.310
that means we have
been up and running.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.780
I'll see you next one.
