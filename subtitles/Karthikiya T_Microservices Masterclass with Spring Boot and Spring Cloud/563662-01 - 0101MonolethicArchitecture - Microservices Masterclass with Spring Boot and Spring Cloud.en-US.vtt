00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
In this video, we'll
try to understand

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.080
what are microservices.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.710
But before that, it's
necessarily that you understand

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.855
what someone or
lithic application

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:12.540
or monolithic architecture
is all about.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.160
As per the definition,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.790
a monolithic application
has single code base with

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.945
multiple modules and has a
single deployable binary.

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:23.355
What does this mean?

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.065
A real-world example of

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:27.825
monolithic application
could be a flight.

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:31.890
Our airplane flight in
itself is a single unit,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.005
but it can have
multiple modules.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.029
For example, it
can have cockpit,

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:37.830
That's where pilots would sit.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.395
It can also have crew cabin.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:42.325
That's where people would sit.

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:44.360
And it can have jet engine.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.515
It can also have

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:49.084
a cargo bay to keep all
the languages, etc.

00:00:49.084 --> 00:00:52.205
In a similar fashion
in software world,

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:55.385
we can have a project
with multiple modules.

00:00:55.385 --> 00:00:57.350
Think about an
e-commerce website.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.780
It can have the
following modules.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.150
We could have auto
management module

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.475
to manage the customer orders.

00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:07.130
We could also have
product management module

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.500
in order to manage the products.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.440
You can also have product
recommendation module

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.515
to recommend relevant
products to the customers.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:18.395
And we can also
have admin module,

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:21.080
which would let the
admin to log in and do

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.560
a variety of things like
uploading new products, etc.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.905
Although we have multiple
modules in the end,

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:29.270
we're just simply
going to create

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.270
one binary and deploy
it onto the server.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.450
This is called
monolithic architecture.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.750
Since we're deploying one
single application in one go,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.330
That's from where the
word mono comes from.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.920
In monolithic architecture.
