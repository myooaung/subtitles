00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.805
Let's talk about the steps
involved to configure

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:08.145
ELK Stack and let
you log aggregation.

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:11.100
The first and foremost
thing we need to do is to

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.600
download all the required tools

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.700
from the respect to websites.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.775
We're going to go to each and
every individual website,

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:19.245
download the zip file,

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:21.285
and then we will unzip them.

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:24.525
Next we're going to launch
the elastic search.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.010
Unless you wanted to change

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.030
the default configurations
like port's IP address, etc.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.350
You can keep a routing to

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.765
the defaults and
launch the server.

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:35.910
Now how do you launch
this over is dependent

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.950
on the operating system that
you're using, of course.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.930
Next we're going to
configure Kibana to point

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.150
Elastic Search so that it knows

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.700
where to query and
extract the data.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.115
And then we're going
to launch it as well.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.470
Next, we'll go
ahead and configure

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.065
the source and destination
and Log Stash.

00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:55.820
And like I said before,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.860
the source can be anything.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.600
We have multiple options here.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.175
In our example though,

00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:04.025
we're going to be having
a file as a source.

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:07.550
And destination is going
to be the elastic search.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.685
That's where the Log Stash
would send the data to.

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:14.405
Then we're going to launch
the Log Stash as well.

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:16.040
Finally, we're going to

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.170
configure individual
microservices.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.730
Now it depends completely on

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.725
the scenario that
you won't execute

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:23.810
and the kind of source and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.315
destination that you are
configuring Log Stash.

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:27.875
In our example though,

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:29.900
we're not going to
be needing a lot of

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.015
configurations from
service front.

00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:34.130
In other cases, you
might be required to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.605
do some additional
configuration.

00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:38.540
It's not applicable
on local hosts.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.300
Sometimes it can be applicable
on Cloud enrollment.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.085
But what we're going to look at,

00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:45.860
it doesn't require too
much of configuration.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.870
Now, I'm trying to
keep things very

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.360
abstract here because
there's a lot going

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.640
on here and there a
lot of components to

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.580
it that I couldn't
discuss right now.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.150
In fact, yield gets tagged
as ASA course on its own.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.785
But you don't have
to know everything.

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:02.910
I'll see you next one.
