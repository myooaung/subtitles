00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
In this video, we're going
to take a look at how to

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.220
create this Spring
Cloud conflict server.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.930
And we will even populate

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.760
a sample configuration to see

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.040
if everything is
working as expected.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400
Just as with URAC and the
gateway given convicts,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.235
I would come as just as
another microservice,

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:19.080
which means we need to create

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.450
another Spring Boot
application with

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.920
some added dependencies and

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.320
maybe a couple of annotations.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.235
I'm going to go to New
Spring starter project.

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:38.170
I'm going to name
this as config.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.870
Hit Next.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.030
I'm going to need the
dependency Spring Web.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.060
As you might guess.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.550
I'm also going to need
the conflict server.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.170
Finally, I'm also going
to include the actuator.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.855
If we wish. We can also add

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:13.250
Spring Security to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.605
enable authorization
and authentication.

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:18.435
But for now, I'm not
going to do that.

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:20.700
Finish.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.360
Once it's done, I'm going to
get inside its main file.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.190
And explicitly mentioned
that we wanted to

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.684
enable the conflict silver.

00:01:36.684 --> 00:01:47.120
That's enabled config server.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.160
Once it's done, to just
add a few properties

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.535
describing where the contexts
of I would be running

00:01:57.535 --> 00:02:00.550
amine on which port,
the source from baby.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.530
We want to pick the
configurations.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.360
By the way, although
the current fixer is

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.300
meant to solve the
configuration,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.290
it doesn't necessarily mean
that it is the one which will

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.544
store the information
of each service,

00:02:12.544 --> 00:02:14.060
the actual config file.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.880
So distort in either a
version control system like

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.315
SVN, get file system.

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:21.950
In this example,
I'm going to use

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.890
file system to store
our conflict files.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.420
And then we have our convicts.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.610
I would act as a
mediator between

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.900
the file system and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.155
the calling service to
solve the configuration.

00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:36.275
We're not going to use the
application dot properties.

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:38.330
We have a special
file specifically

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.865
used with convict server,

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:43.430
and that's called bootstrap dot

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.950
properties or bootstrap
dot YAML file.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.000
I wanted to get inside it.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.970
Specify the port number where
we want the server to run.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:07.700
Server port equals
wanted to say 9002.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.770
Next we are going to
specify the location

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.305
where we're going to
store the conflict files.

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:14.855
For this purpose,
I've actually created

00:03:14.855 --> 00:03:19.955
a folder under a directory.

00:03:19.955 --> 00:03:22.655
Created a folder with
the name file system.

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:24.920
And this is the location
that I'm going to

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.740
specify inside this properties.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.570
I'm gonna say a spring cloud

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:40.895
config dot native dot.

00:03:40.895 --> 00:03:43.610
Such locations.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.350
We're asking the
conflicts over to

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.790
search in these locations.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.585
Since I'm using file system,

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:52.775
I'm going to say File.

00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:55.865
And then the location,

00:03:55.865 --> 00:03:57.994
that's file double slash.

00:03:57.994 --> 00:04:01.445
You would specify the
location that's inside

00:04:01.445 --> 00:04:09.665
the E Directory File
System. The file.

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:13.160
But in order to see if
things are actually working,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.310
let us populate a
sample config file.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:27.090
When you create a new file
name, config dot properties.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.670
To get inside it. I'm just

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.445
simply going to specify
key-value pair.

00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:45.720
I'll say name equals
config, whatever.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.430
And that's all there is to it.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.610
Let's launch our convict
Silver Spring Boot app.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.570
We seem to be having an issue.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.725
It says if you're
using good profile,

00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:10.715
you need to set the get
URI in the configuration.

00:05:10.715 --> 00:05:13.010
What this means is by default,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.560
the conflict Silver assumes
that we're going to

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.960
store our conflict files
in Git repository,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.645
but that's not what
we're doing now.

00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:23.180
In order to tell convicts over

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.150
that we're storing the files
inside our file system.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.660
We'd actually activate
one of the profiles.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.975
Spring dot profiles.

00:05:32.975 --> 00:05:40.460
Dot equals nato is the
profile we want to activate.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.010
The conflict server can now

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.920
actually look into
the file system.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.770
Let's relaunch our solver.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.500
Now this as well.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.695
Let's go to the browser.

00:06:03.695 --> 00:06:13.670
Let's enter the URL,
localhost, colon 9002.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.130
That's where our
conflicts our is running.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.665
Slash name of the file,

00:06:18.665 --> 00:06:22.955
config slash name
of the profile.

00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:25.640
Right now we don't have
any profiles configured.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.620
We're going to talk about
how we can configure

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.675
profiles in future lectures.

00:06:29.675 --> 00:06:34.820
But for now, let's say default.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.870
This as shown the configuration
that will just populated.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.530
Next, we're going to see how we

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.170
can store specific
configuration.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.000
And so then to services.
