00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.930
I just realized that
we have actually

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.180
left a bug which we need to fix.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.230
Otherwise it will have

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.375
negative consequences
down the line.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.015
And you try to
identify that bunk.

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:15.640
It has something to
do with product list.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.640
Well, every time
there is a request,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.800
we are trying to
populate this list.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.585
If there are ten requests,

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.820
then would have ten multiplied

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.490
by three elements
added to this list,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.950
which is not what we
intend to happen.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.345
In order to fix this issue.

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:38.870
I'm just simply going to clear

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.615
this list every time
we call this method.

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:43.760
This should fix the problem.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.140
Alternately, you can just make

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.495
this part of the constructor.

00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:49.265
That's even better.

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:51.050
Well, ideally we
should be having

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.240
a database which
will do the job.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.950
But since we don't
have a database,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.855
I tried manually populating.

00:00:56.855 --> 00:00:58.310
We didn't pay too much attention

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.215
to this section of the code.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:03.450
We left a bug.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.640
If we had followed
test-driven development,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.535
this book could have been
identified much earlier.

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:12.260
And for that reason,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.620
I'm actually thinking to
introduce a chapter where we

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.480
talked about
test-driven development

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.250
in the context of Spring Boot.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.610
Similar flux needs
to go here as well.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.549
Inside the price and service.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.440
You need to do the same inside
the exchange service has,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.020
well, we're good to go.
