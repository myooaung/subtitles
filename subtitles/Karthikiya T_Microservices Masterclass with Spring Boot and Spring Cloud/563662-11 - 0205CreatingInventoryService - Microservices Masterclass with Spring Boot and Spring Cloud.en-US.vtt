00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Okay, let us go ahead and
create the inventory service.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.310
It's pretty
straightforward as well.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.400
So I'd like you to take
it as an assignment.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.040
Take no more than five
minutes to create

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.480
an inventory service
that's going to

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.460
accept the product ID

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.250
as part of the request
and then get back

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.840
some kind of response that tells

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.820
whether the stock is
available or not.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.280
The inventory Porter
would basically have

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.040
just three fields,
the inventory ID,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.625
product ID, and the field stock,

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:31.680
which is a Boolean value.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.649
So we'll set a flag whether
it is true or false.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.960
True would mean that
there is stock available.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.940
Pilots would mean
that is no stock.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.770
So feel free to pause the video

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.320
and take care of the assignment.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.780
If you just want to
follow along with me,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.380
you can just going to
create another project.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.670
Let's name it as
inventory service.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.420
Spring starter web dependency.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:17.130
We're going to copy the
controller from here to here.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.600
Of course, we also need
the lumbar dependency.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.180
Refresh the project.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.630
Let's get inside the controller.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.430
This is going to be inventory.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.790
Create the class.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.120
Private, long. Hi.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.130
This is going to be
product ID that tells

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.110
us which product does this
inventory belonged to.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.240
Then finally, Boolean field.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.190
Laptops, if the stock
is available or not.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.510
Add lumbar OK, annotations,

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.840
data, no arcs constructor.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.760
And finally, constructor.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.190
Let's go back to the controller.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.850
Mentally detailed

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.570
info.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.130
Open it and went to the list.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.390
In list.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.770
Let's populate

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.510
this list with one
entry objects,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:11.220
entry, price ID, and
then the Boolean flag.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.560
Let's give a unique
identifier for

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.200
all the inventory items.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.010
Let's set this to false.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.645
That's all there is to it.

00:04:41.645 --> 00:04:43.490
Let's launch our application.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.920
But again, before that,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:55.145
change the port number 03.

00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:57.785
Let's launch an application.

00:04:57.785 --> 00:05:04.020
Of course, we need to change
the path to something else.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.029
Let's launch that application
drawn a springboard.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.510
Go to

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.260
Postman

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.730
request.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:41.375
Okay. Supposed to be 003.

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:44.820
We got the results.
