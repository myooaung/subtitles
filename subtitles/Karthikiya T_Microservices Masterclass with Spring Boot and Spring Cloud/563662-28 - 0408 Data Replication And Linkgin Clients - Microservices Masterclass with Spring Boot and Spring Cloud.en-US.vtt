00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.585
Right now, each one of
our sovereign stances

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:05.985
are able to detect
the replica nodes.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:08.010
And so we're able
to see this list.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.360
But at the moment, we don't
have anything under instances

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.370
that's obvious because none of

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.415
our microservices are
aware of these instances.

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:19.935
But of course we are
seeing one entry.

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:24.270
They just listed themselves
because they know each other.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.075
But what we want though,

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:31.440
is we want our microservices
to be listed in here.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.130
Let's go back to Eclipse and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.390
let's make them be aware
of these instances.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.320
Maybe I'll choose the,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.630
choose this link right here.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.535
You can choose any
one of these nodes.

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:59.370
I'm going to target us node.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.020
Let's open the product service,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.210
go to its application
or properties file.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.250
Let's replace this with

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.120
the new instance
which we created.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.770
We're going to do the same

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.770
for other two
microservices as well.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.200
Replace this, and we do the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.385
same for inventory
service as well.

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:41.400
Time to launch these
microservices.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:51.800
Product service,
pricing service,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:59.810
as well as inventory solvus.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.910
Going to take awhile.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.500
Go back to browser.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.020
If you notice, even
though we've just

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.189
pointed to one instance
of those servers,

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.735
what you're going
to notice is that

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:23.780
you can actually see
dozen stands is getting

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.825
populated in all these servers.

00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:29.285
The server instances.

00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:32.360
That's because of the
replication that is

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.060
happening between the
several instances.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.160
But we have one problem though.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.755
We're just pointing to
one of these instances.

00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:45.455
And if that instance
goes down, obviously,

00:02:45.455 --> 00:02:49.095
we don't have any servers
to register with.

00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:54.175
When you to actually populate
the entire list of servers.

00:02:54.175 --> 00:02:57.170
We have used Solver.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.820
We're going to copy
the other two.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.130
Have them in here.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:13.720
Copy the same for other
microservices as well.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.820
The file service,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.200
pricing service.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.050
Finally, inventory service.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.510
You're not going to
see anything different

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.310
than here though.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.075
Let's also quickly
desktop application.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.060
Let's go to Postman

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.930
and send the request and
we got back the response,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.230
which means everything
is working as expected.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.210
Let's also try
putting down one of

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.480
the instances of
those eureka solvers.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.010
We now have only two
instances running.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.960
Actually, I'm going to put
down a couple of them.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:46.350
I mean, why not?
Let's go to browser.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.800
We no longer should be
able to access this.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.270
By the vagus does
supposed to be JP.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:16.649
Oops. Sorry for the mess.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:29.550
That's supposed to be us.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.020
We have these two
sovereigns stances down.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.075
But only Japan
stands is running.

00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:46.190
Still send the request.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.510
Let's go to Postman.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.830
And it worked as well.
