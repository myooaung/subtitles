00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.070
Let us go ahead and
install a message broker.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.390
In our case, I'm going to be

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.850
using RabbitMQ for this purpose.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.970
In fact, that is one of
the popular choices.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.510
But before you install it at
the time Cue went to install

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.960
Erlang because RabbitMQ
is written using Atlanta.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.925
If you tried to install RabbitMQ

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:22.650
without installing a blank,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.140
then somebody in the
middle you'd get

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.185
a prompt asking you to
install at length first.

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:29.580
Only then will you be able to

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.745
continue with
installing RabbitMQ?

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:35.220
Let's first install
that link with

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.785
a quick Google search
regard the download link.

00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:40.110
Click on that link.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.440
Then depending on
the operating system

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.180
you're using to follow

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.440
specific instructions and
install the software.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.630
In my case, I'm using Windows

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.290
and I can download the
installer and install it.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.820
I believe I don't have to walk

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.155
you through how to install this.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:00:58.685
It's pretty straightforward.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:00.905
In fact, I've already done that.

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:05.465
Once you install it, you
need to install RabbitMQ.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.670
Pretty much the same way.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.530
You go to the download link.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.470
Download the
installer, install it.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.720
Like any other software.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.665
Once you are done,
go to this top menu.

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:26.690
And they should not be
able to see these icons.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.250
Just click on Tab,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.825
attempt to service stopped.

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:33.950
Alternatively, you can
also expand and go to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.290
the rabid empty
command prompt and

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.839
run the command to
start the service.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.690
You might get a
prompt to accept,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.200
just accept it, and you
should be good to go.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.045
It's going to take
a couple of seconds

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:56.825
and rabid them
gears now started.

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:58.715
Next thing we're going to do,

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:01.085
which is completely optional,

00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:04.925
is to enable RabbitMQ
Management plugin.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:09.500
The way we do it is we
need to go to RabbitMQ

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.810
command prompt and
type in the command.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.120
Rabbitmq.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.570
Hyphen plugins

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:32.280
enabled RabbitMQ
underscore management.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.710
It's going to take
a few seconds.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.670
Let me pause the
video and then get

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.685
back. Here we are again.

00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:49.400
So the management
console must be

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.715
running and by default
it runs on the board.

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:58.805
15672. We're going
to go to localhost.

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:06.890
5672 is the port
number. By default.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.830
Guest gas disease
and admin password.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.800
Here we are. That's all

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.305
for installing the
message broker.

00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:20.820
I'll see you in the next one.
