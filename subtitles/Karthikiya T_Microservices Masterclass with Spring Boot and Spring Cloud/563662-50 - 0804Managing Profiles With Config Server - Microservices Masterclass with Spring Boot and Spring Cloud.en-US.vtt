00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
Let us see how we can manage

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.095
profiles in case of
conflict silver.

00:00:04.095 --> 00:00:05.775
Without the conflict server,

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:09.420
we used to have an extension
with the profile name.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.805
For example, this
could have been

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:17.220
application hyphen or something.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.195
And this value would correspond
to the Dell profile.

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:25.035
But how do we manage profiles
with conflicts over?

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:27.280
Let's take a look.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.175
It's the same methodology
which you need to follow.

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:36.250
I'm going to just make
a clone this file.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.845
I'm going to append the
profile name with the hyphen.

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:45.360
Let's say the name of
the profile is dev.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.210
Inside this file. I just
would like to change

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.710
the port number to something

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.080
else which was not used already.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.505
Now, we can get inside the
bootstrap dot YAML file.

00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:07.385
We can specify our profile.

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:12.210
Spring dot, profiles dot.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.295
I'm going to act to it.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:21.155
The Dell profile. Save the file,

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:24.210
and let's try relaunching
the application.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.790
If you notice, this

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.180
time our application
and started on port 89.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.055
This would no longer work to
change the port to add 009.

00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:55.930
And it works, which means
our profile got activated.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.260
We can also send this property

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.545
while launching the application.

00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:05.800
Let me demonstrate that as well.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.435
Going to go to Run
Configuration.

00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:19.530
Here. I'm going to say
spring dot profiles.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.170
Like to add the Dow profile.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.655
The application was
already running on 8009.

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:41.700
Let's try to stop it
for the time being.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.520
Configuration.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.030
And sure enough, it has
started on port 8009.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.210
Del profile got activated.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.475
If you using YAML file though,

00:03:16.475 --> 00:03:18.425
it is straightforward as well.

00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:20.195
You can define all your profiles

00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:22.620
under a single file itself.
