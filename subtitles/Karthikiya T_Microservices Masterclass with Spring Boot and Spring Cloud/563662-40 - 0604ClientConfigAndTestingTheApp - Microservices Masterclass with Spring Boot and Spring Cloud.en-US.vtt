00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.025
We now have the gateway.

00:00:02.025 --> 00:00:03.630
We've also doing it
some intelligence

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.165
on how to route the call.

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:10.335
Gateway is also discoverable
over the network.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.330
It's now time to make
necessary changes

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.560
on the service client.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.185
And instead of pointing
to a specific service,

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:26.320
would now say Gateway
Service went to copy this.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.130
Same goes here as well.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.030
Gets various invest template.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.905
It's pretty straightforward.

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:37.320
You just replace
the service name

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.700
with the gateway service.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.450
But if we launch our
product service now,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.060
this would cause an error.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:01:00.230
Let's take a look. We've
got another that says,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.900
I've been with that
name has all been

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.734
defined and all
writing is disabled,

00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:09.650
which means both of our
clients are actually

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.075
having the same name at the
moment, writing as disabled.

00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:15.890
They've also shown
us a solution.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.390
We just have to
copy this property

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.940
inside the properties file.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.980
And this would
allow all writing.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.240
Let's relaunch the
product service,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.525
but before that, to also
launch the gateway.

00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:40.880
Let's do that real quick.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.300
Product service.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.440
Let us now go to Postman and
try to send the request.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.020
We got an editor.
Let's take a look.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.030
Lb does not have available
servers get way.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.620
This might be a naming issue.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.620
Solvus.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.429
Same.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.260
Let's make sure

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.760
that everything is
configured well.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.730
Is it the same name here?

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.570
It is.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.740
It won't now. Maybe it
might just take awhile.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.760
It's working. What
has just happened?

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.650
We've sent the request
to the product service.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.290
The request has landed here.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.530
And inside here we're
using Fee client to

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.190
send requests to pricing as
well as the natural service.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.860
While it sends a request,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.740
the URL would look
something like this.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.280
Let me open up

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:23.980
a notepad gateway

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.880
service slash.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:37.940
This path right here. Like so.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.130
Of course this will be replaced
by the IP of the gateway.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.790
With Eureka.
Ultimately, the request

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.859
would land in gateway.

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:54.700
Inside gateway, we have
the route configured.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.700
If we have a request that
matches with this pattern,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.980
this matches, then we'd like to

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.520
route the call to the pricing
service in this manner,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.250
same as applicable for
inventory service as well.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.480
We can even send
this request to get

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.910
with itself if you have
the routing configured.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.120
By the way, can also check
the available routes.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.135
We have the springboard
actuator in place.

00:05:26.135 --> 00:05:28.800
Let me just quickly
include that.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.410
Went to the actuator.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:43.175
That belongs to arg Spring
framework Boot Project,

00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:45.545
Spring Boot,

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:51.600
starter actuator,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.130
update Maven dependencies.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.520
Before launching it, we

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.770
actually do enable
all the endpoints.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.595
By default, all the
endpoints are not exposed.

00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:22.830
Will get inside the gateway
properties file and set it.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.135
Management.

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:28.770
Endpoints.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:43.040
Exposure include, I'm
going to say style,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.720
meaning I would like to expose

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.029
all the endpoints of actuator.

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:50.520
Let's relaunch our gateway.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.440
Let's go to Postman.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:18.725
And I'm going to
say local host 01.

00:07:18.725 --> 00:07:28.740
That's what I'll get, is
running actuator slash slash.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.730
There you have it.
