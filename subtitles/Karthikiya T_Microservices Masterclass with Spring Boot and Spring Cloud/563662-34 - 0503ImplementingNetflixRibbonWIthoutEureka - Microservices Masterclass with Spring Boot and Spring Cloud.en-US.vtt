00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.465
Right now we have Utica
client in our project,

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:05.550
and we already know
that this comes

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.355
with load bands and
feature from ribbon.

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:11.520
But there might be
instances where we might be

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.355
needing the load balancer
feature from ribbon,

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:17.775
but we don't want the discovery
feature from your'e camp.

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:20.825
In which case, we might
want to get rid off uric

00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:24.299
altogether and just
use ribbon library.

00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:27.225
Now there are a couple of
ways we can get rid of Utica.

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:29.190
Number one is you

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.735
just get to drop this
dependency from here.

00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:38.150
And you would instead use
ribbon library like so.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.740
That works.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.260
Or alternatively,
we can just add

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.600
one property inside
the properties file.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.670
And it would have
the same effect.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:59.690
I'm going to say ribbon
dot, dot enabled.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.060
And we'll set this to false.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.440
Let me launch the
product service.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.575
Now if I try to
send the request,

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:27.360
we're going to get an exception.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.240
It says Load Balancer

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.550
does not have available silver

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.295
for the client
inventory service.

00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:42.335
That explains it all.

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.915
Discover it didn't
happen at all.

00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:48.240
And that's because
of this property.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.030
Since we now got it off
service discovery to do

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.130
something that would let

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.000
our application pint the
inventory service instances.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.125
The way we can do that

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:06.800
is by just adding
one more property.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.320
That property corresponds to
this inventory Fee client.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.875
I'm going to copy this string.

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:24.215
Go back to application
not properties file dot,

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:29.900
ribbon, dot list of solvers.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.430
That's how you define.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:40.430
Going to add URLs to
list off servers.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:49.775
In this case, this is
going to be at 0039006.

00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:51.950
This would correspond to

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.500
the inventory and stances
that we're running.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.895
We have those two instances.

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:04.560
One is running on 8003
and the other 15006.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.685
Now since we're using,

00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:10.940
we can just use this name.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.980
But if you're using
rest template,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.235
we have to add an
additional annotation.

00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:23.605
Let me get inside main class.

00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:28.330
We have to have
another annotation

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.010
that says ribbon client.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.880
You're going to have
the same attribute.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.660
Like so.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.940
In addition to that,
you also need to

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.760
explicitly mentioned
that we wanted to load

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.880
balance traffic by using the
annotation load balanced.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.980
Now we can just use

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.460
this template as we
would do normally.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.330
Went to undo those
changes, save the file.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:12.680
Let's relaunch our product
service. This time.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.120
Our application works and

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.000
Load Balancer would take effect.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.150
Like so. How many above

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.370
fee clients you may
be having you and to

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.410
have configurations
corresponding to all of them.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.230
But of course, if you
have Eureka server,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.640
you don't have to do all that.
