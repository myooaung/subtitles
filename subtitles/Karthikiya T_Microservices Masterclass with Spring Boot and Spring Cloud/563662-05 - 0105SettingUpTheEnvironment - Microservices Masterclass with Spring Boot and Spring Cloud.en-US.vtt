00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
Okay, let's take a
look at how to set up

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.970
the enrollment to start
working on microservices.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.225
First of all, you had been
needing JDK installed.

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:11.040
If you reach to a
point where you want

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.080
to learn spring microservices,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.824
then I assume that you know
how to write Java programs,

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:17.550
which also means I assume

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.905
that you know how
to install JDK.

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:22.605
You're also going
to be needing ID.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.285
That's where we will
write our code.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.310
And I use Eclipse,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.195
which is the most popular idea
out there in the industry.

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:32.190
If you have any
other preferences,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.600
feel free to use that.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.460
As long as you are
familiar with the tool

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.610
that you're using,
we're good to go.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.965
Next, we need to install
spring tool suit.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:41.750
This comes as a plugin
which we need to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.480
install on our ID spring tools.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.300
Food is available for
all the popular IDEs.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.475
So depending on the
idea that you're using,

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:51.079
you need to install
its corresponding

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.940
plug-in spring tools that will

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.960
make our life a lot

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.824
easier to create
Spring Boot projects.

00:00:56.824 --> 00:00:59.210
You will know what I mean
as we progress through

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.980
the course next week to
install a the Maven or Gradle,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.620
both or project
management tools and are

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.575
necessary to work
on microservices.

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:13.055
Eclipse has a built-in support
for both Maven and Gretel.

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:14.510
But if you want
to be able to run

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.279
commands from the
command processor,

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:18.725
went to install them
separately on our computer.

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:21.560
Finally, we will also
need Postman client.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.510
This used to be a Chrome plugin,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.640
but now it's a
standalone application.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.505
We need this tool to
test our application.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.770
Basically, postman
will allow us to send

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.475
a HTTP request and receive
some form of a response.

00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:37.460
That's pretty much
what we need for now.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.500
And as we progress
through the course,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.780
we'll not really
understand these tools,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.730
but we'll also explore
any other tools

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.785
that we might be
needing down the line.

00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:47.390
Next, I'm going to
show you how to

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.610
install all these
tools are of course

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.244
I'm not going to
show you literally

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:53.360
all the steps
involved in storage.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.205
Just show you at
a very high level

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:57.170
how to setup the environment.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.695
First, let's take a look
at how to install JDK.

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:03.245
Just search for download.

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:07.010
Jdk. Misspelled it.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.180
Click on the first link
which points to Oracle.com.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.890
Download this file.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.300
It's an executable.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.340
And you'd install Java

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.024
just as you would install
any other software.

00:02:19.024 --> 00:02:21.509
Once you install,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.280
would see a folder that looks

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.200
something like this in Windows,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.675
it's inside Program Files, Java,

00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:31.565
click on the bin directory,

00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:35.690
copy this path, and make
it part of pop variable.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.040
Inside Windows, you go inside
the enrollment variables.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.995
Choose path, click Edit.

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:46.985
You would add that path
in here by clicking New.

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:48.965
And then like so,

00:02:48.965 --> 00:02:50.405
I've already done that.

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:52.430
I don't have to do it again.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.480
You can also create
Java home environment

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.980
variable that points to

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.180
the Java home directory,
which is this.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.300
Then use that enrollment

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.080
variable inside the
path variable, like so.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.350
This would install Java and we

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.155
should now be able to
run Java programs.

00:03:15.155 --> 00:03:18.480
Next went to install an ID.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.790
In my case, it's
going to be Eclipse.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.740
Download Eclipse.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.090
Click on the first link.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.790
Make sure it points
to eclipse.org.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.925
Download it, and install it

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:40.339
just as you would install
any other software.

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:41.915
Pretty straightforward.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:44.720
You may be prompted to
choose the workspace,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.765
in which case you have
to create a directory.

00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:51.480
Then 0.2, it should
be good to go.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.135
If you're new to eclipse.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.655
This is how it's
going to look like.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.350
Next, let's take
a look at how to

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.615
install spring tool suit.

00:04:02.615 --> 00:04:05.720
You would install it
as an Eclipse plug-in.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.480
You go inside the help menu.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.760
Click on Eclipse marketplace.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.194
Search for spring to suit.

00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:20.010
Simply spring tools.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.830
Here's the one which
you need to install.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.600
Since I've already installed.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.820
It is showing as installed.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.835
In your case, you might
see Install button,

00:04:31.835 --> 00:04:33.920
just click it and
install the plug-in.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.810
It should be good to go.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.730
Next, let's take
a look at how to

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.350
install Maven or Gradle.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.630
Just say download.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.110
The steps are similar
for me even as well.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.300
You would install Gradle just
as you would install JDK.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.900
Click on this link that
points to Gradle.org.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.930
Scroll down a bit.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.340
You should be able to
say this link that says

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.265
binary only. Click on it.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:09.395
This should download a zip file,

00:05:09.395 --> 00:05:12.290
copy that zip file
in some directory.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.950
My case, it's inside
the directory Gradle

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.590
Once you explored it,

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.260
this is what you would see.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.710
Go inside the bin
directory, copy the path,

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.189
go inside the Windows
enrollment variables,

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:35.020
and add it as part of
the path variable.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.630
Just as I did in here.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.280
I created this
environment variable that

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.705
points to the Gradle home
directory and then slash bin.

00:05:46.705 --> 00:05:49.510
That's going to be
our path variable.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.755
We can now run Gradle commands
from the command line.

00:05:53.755 --> 00:05:56.470
The installation
steps for Maven are

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.295
similar in case if
you're using Maven.

00:05:59.295 --> 00:06:03.350
Next, let's open up

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.750
the command processor and make
sure things are installed.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.269
Well, I'm going to say
Java hyphen worsen.

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:13.370
This should print the washing

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.410
of the Java that
you've just installed.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.485
And then Maven hyphen we,

00:06:18.485 --> 00:06:21.720
I'm sorry, it's
supposed to be Ambien.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:29.405
Similarly, Gradle grid.

00:06:29.405 --> 00:06:34.100
We're going to store all the
tools required except one,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.560
which is going to be Postman.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.820
Again, let us go to browser
and say download Postman.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.720
Look on the first link that
points to postman.com,

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.960
download the software,
and install it.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.765
And here's how it's
going to look like.

00:06:52.765 --> 00:06:56.425
Don't be intimidated looking
at the user-interface.

00:06:56.425 --> 00:06:58.255
This is a very simple tool

00:06:58.255 --> 00:07:00.760
that will allow us to
send an HTTP request.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.000
A browser would allow us
to send only GET requests,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.030
our post requests when
you're using HTTP form.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.220
But here, we get to send

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.760
requests using various
different HTTP methods.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.865
That's why we need
a tool like this.

00:07:15.865 --> 00:07:17.800
You will be familiar with

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.085
all these tools as we
progress through the course.

00:07:21.085 --> 00:07:25.010
Lastly, let's go
inside the eclipse and

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.450
make sure we're able to run

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.750
a simple Java program
like helloworld.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.760
That way you will
know that everything

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.990
is configured well.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.605
But before doing so, go
to Windows preferences.

00:07:36.605 --> 00:07:39.950
Make sure 100 install GREs,

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.400
it points to the
right JDK directory.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.890
Otherwise just click on Add,

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.830
choose the dedicate directory,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.680
and then click Finish.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.620
Also make sure the
compiler that you're

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.560
using is pointing to
the right version.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.290
Once you do that,
go to File New.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.800
Then search for Java.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.140
I'm going to create a
simple Java project.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.340
The name that you wish to view.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.000
Let's go ahead and
create a glass.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.140
We're going to be needing
public static void main method.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.090
Let's also make it as spot off

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:46.230
some land and package. Finish.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:55.669
Let's say Hello,
universe or whatever.

00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:58.620
Let's run our program.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.315
Make sure you're
getting this message.

00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:07.460
With this, we have all the setup

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.760
required to stop working
on microservices.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.530
By the way, we don't need this.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.700
Let's delete this.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.460
Hope it makes sense.
