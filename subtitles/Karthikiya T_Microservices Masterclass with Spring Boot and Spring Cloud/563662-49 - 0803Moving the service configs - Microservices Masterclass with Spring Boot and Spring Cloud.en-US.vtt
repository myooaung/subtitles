00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.700
We have our conflicts
are running.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.360
It's now time to move out the
conflicts from each one of

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.700
these individual
microservices to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.710
our file system that

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.125
the conflicts over can
actually solve them.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.890
We're going to start get
the product service.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.560
The first thing we
need to do is to add

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.470
one dependency that it

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.170
can become a client to
the conflict server.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.135
To copy this, have it in here.

00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:39.690
And this is going to be
Spring Cloud starter config.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.420
Let's quickly
refresh the project.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.815
Once done, I'm
going to get inside

00:00:57.815 --> 00:01:02.930
the application dot properties
file of product service.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.420
And I no longer would

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.820
like to have the
conflicts in this file.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.770
I'm going to move them
to our file system.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.425
I get inside the file system.

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:18.650
I'm going to create a
new properties file.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.600
And it should have the exact

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.160
same name of the application.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.199
In this case it's
product service.

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:29.525
So let's end product service.

00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:36.720
Dot properties. Inside here.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.799
We're going to cut and
paste the content.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.750
At the moment, our
products services

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.269
not aware of the
conflict server.

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:52.340
That's what we're
going to do next.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.170
I'm going to create
another file,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.389
the name bootstrap dot YAML.

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.400
This can be a properties
file as well.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.610
And inside here, I

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.415
went to mention the location
of our conflicts over.

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:17.780
But we also need to set the
name of the application.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.990
I've removed it from the
application or properties.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.315
I'm doing it in here.

00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:26.285
By the way, what are the
conflicts you have inside

00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:29.600
the bootstrap dot
YAML file will have

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.585
higher precedence over
the configurations

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:36.440
that are available as part of
application or properties.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.570
If you have the
same dropper to set

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.475
in both of these files,

00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:42.470
then the one that is inside

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.860
the bootstrap file will
have the President's,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:55.560
I'm going to say Spring
application name.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.320
And this is going to be product.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:12.240
I'm also going to specify
the Cloud config.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:23.130
Cloud config dot URI.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.000
Here is where you would specify
the convict silver URI.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.625
We're going to say GDP,

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:39.620
colon double slash local host.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.680
And are convicts over
dt is running on port

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.595
nine zeros 0 to save the file.

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:52.235
And guess what? That's
all there is to it.

00:03:52.235 --> 00:03:56.520
Let's relaunch the
product service.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.635
Let's try sending the request.

00:04:15.635 --> 00:04:20.970
And it has walked
without any problem.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.410
Let's also get
inside the browser.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:37.290
This term is going to be
product, the default profile.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.070
And this has populated all
the contact information.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.110
Nowhere in product
service haven't mentioned

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.300
the port number or the
location of eudicots over etc.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.760
They're also by the
conflict silver.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.635
Way to do the same with the
other two microservices.

00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:07.860
And this is something that you
can take as an assignment.
