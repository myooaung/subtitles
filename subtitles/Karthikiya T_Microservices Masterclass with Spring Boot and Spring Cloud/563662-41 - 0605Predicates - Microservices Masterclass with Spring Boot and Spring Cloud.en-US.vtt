00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.255
We have configured
routes and at the moment

00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:06.614
there are combination of
predicate and the URI,

00:00:06.614 --> 00:00:09.840
pretty good deltas on
what condition two,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.080
we want to route the
call to a given URI.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.740
At the moment, we're
just using path,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.015
but we're not limited
to just that.

00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:20.600
We have a variety of

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.615
methods are predicates
that we can use.

00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:28.370
For example, we have cookie.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.350
This is going to accept
a couple of parameters.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.810
The name is the
name of the cookie.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.060
And the regular expression

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.165
will allow us to specify
the regular expression.

00:00:41.165 --> 00:00:43.775
Basically, this will
allow us to check if

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:49.295
a cookie value matches with
the given regular expression.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:51.980
Likewise, we've got a bunch of

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.815
other methods we have after,

00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:58.310
which will allow us
to check to see if

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.360
a request was made
after a specific time.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.070
We have between to check
to see if a request was

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.400
made between a
certain time period.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.999
To take a look at the
source code of this.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.630
Essentially,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.550
we have a class file

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.310
that's path, route
predicate factory.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.720
And if you click on it,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.630
it is where we have the logic
for the path predicate.
