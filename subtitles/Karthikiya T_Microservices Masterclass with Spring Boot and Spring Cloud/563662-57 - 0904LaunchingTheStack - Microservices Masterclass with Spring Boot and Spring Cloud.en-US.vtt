00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
Okay, let us launch
that application.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.660
I already have all these
microservices running.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.130
But in order to demonstrate

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.960
the feature of Sprint loud buzz,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.385
we supposed to have

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:14.670
multiple instances
of same service that

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.350
we know that the
configurations are getting

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.515
reflected across all instances.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:21.030
Now since we cannot have

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.310
multiple instances
running on same board,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.470
let us launch
another instance of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.410
product service, 100
different board.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.195
The way you do it in Eclipse
is by right-clicking on it.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:36.490
Go to Run Configuration,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.670
then you can create
a new configuration.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.080
I've already done that.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.015
This is how it looks.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:55.115
You're going to choose the
project and the main class.

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:56.810
But inside the argument,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.635
make sure that you provide
the port number and do it.

00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:02.480
That wasn't being used by

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.760
any other Microsoft is instance.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.070
But before you do that, make

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.260
sure that you set

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.275
these properties inside
the conflict file.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:19.460
That this port that you
mentioned inside Eclipse will be

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.420
ordered by what's already
there, the conflict file.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.470
Once you do that, click on Run.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.220
And you would launch another
instance of product service.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.370
By the way, since we
have added a dependency,

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.945
make sure that you do Gradle
the fresh off the project.

00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:51.895
Gradle, and then click on
Refresh graded project.

00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:53.770
And you won't have any surprises

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.330
while testing the application.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.830
We have a couple of

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.095
instances of products
service running.

00:02:02.095 --> 00:02:04.060
In the next lecture,
we're going to see how we

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.940
can see everything in action.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.500
I'll see you in the next one.
