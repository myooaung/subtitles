00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
You can actually
customize the way

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.675
the ribbon load balancer works.

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:06.360
And here are the
various parameters

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.415
which you can configure.

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:12.120
Just check the list that
is under the bean type.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.235
For example, we have idle,

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:17.085
which tells us the mechanism
for load balancing.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:18.690
I mean, how do you want to send

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.450
the request to
multiple instances?

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.060
By default, this is
round robin fashion,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.480
and we've already taken a
look at an example of that.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.550
Then we have i pink,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.610
which tells us how do
we want to determine

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.420
whether a particular
instances up or down.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.700
If you take a look at
the documentation of

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.695
these two interfaces,
we have idle.

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:47.605
We have multiple
implementations of I rule.

00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:50.380
We can choose one
of these or we can

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.010
actually create your
own implementation.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.110
Just implement this
interface and provide

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.840
your own implementation
for load balancing.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.164
Round robin dual is the
one which is default.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:06.085
And then we also
have random rule,

00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:07.705
which will just send the traffic

00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:10.420
randomly to all the instances.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.275
Then we have weighted
response time rule.

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:16.525
This is bit more complicated.

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:19.390
It will wait to each
one of the instances

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.020
depending on its availability
and stuff like that.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.750
You can use one of these.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.670
Even for i pink,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.665
we have multiple
implementations.

00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:32.300
And again, you can also write

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.460
your own implementation
if you wish.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.980
Let's go back to eclipse.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.650
The way you use those interfaces

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.990
is you just have to
create a conflict file,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.760
a standard class file.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.900
And then you would define
the begins in this manner.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.370
This one right here
is going to return I

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.855
rule and we're returning
one of its implementation.

00:01:56.855 --> 00:02:01.685
Similarly, I've done the
same for hyping as well.

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:03.875
Once I have this class,

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:11.225
I'm just simply going to define
it as part of the client.

00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:13.355
Or if you're using
the bank client,

00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:17.240
you will have similar
attribute which you

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.590
can add. Once you do that.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.645
This would take effect.

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:27.095
Instead of round robin,
which is the default I rule.

00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:30.920
We would now be having
the random rule.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.960
Same as the case with typing.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.890
Have actually tried
running this application,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.495
but we are getting an error.

00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:42.455
It seems like that is something
that we cannot handle.

00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:44.915
And it might have
something to do with

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:48.680
the free Client Library
raised an issue on the same.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.885
And by the time of
this recording,

00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:53.810
as of today, there is no fixed.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.330
Maybe by the time you're
watching this lecture,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.560
this might be working.
