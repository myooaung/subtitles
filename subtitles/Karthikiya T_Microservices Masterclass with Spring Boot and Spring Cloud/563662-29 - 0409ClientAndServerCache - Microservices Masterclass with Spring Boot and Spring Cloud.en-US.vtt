00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.750
I wanted to show you
something really interesting.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.145
Right now.

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:07.560
We just have one of these
novel instances running.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.840
The other two are down.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.960
Went to put this down as well.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.040
Let's go back to Eclipse

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:24.630
and select Record
JP and turn it off.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.300
Just to make sure it
indeed got turned off.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.940
Let me reload the page and
you're not going to see

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.425
anything. Hope you
are convinced.

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:44.915
Now, let me go to Postman
and send the request.

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:46.910
What is the result
you're expecting?

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.190
Are we going to get an error?

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.635
You'll be surprised.

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:55.140
Still going to see the response.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.740
Why is this happening?

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.950
Well, whenever the Utica
client sends the request to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.720
the server and gets back

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.820
the location of a
particular service.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.485
It will not only use it,

00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:10.205
but will also store that
information in client cache.

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:12.845
That for all the
subsequent request,

00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:14.210
it doesn't need to send requests

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.620
all the way to the server.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.450
It can just use the
information that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.445
is present in its cache.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:22.580
This will of course
improve the efficiency.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.790
I'm actually going to show you

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.950
few properties that we
can use. Head all day.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.360
The first one would say
eudicot server dot response

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.800
cache update, interval
in milliseconds.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.440
Well, just as we
have client cash,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.540
we also have silver cash.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.560
This property right here
tells us how often should

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.750
the silver dump its
register information

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.280
to its cache memory.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.025
And I think this defaults
to thirty-seconds.

00:01:55.025 --> 00:01:57.830
But of course we can
configure it as we wish.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.630
This goes on the server side.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.240
This property goes
on the client side.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.935
What this says is,

00:02:06.935 --> 00:02:09.020
how often should the
client sends a request to

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.285
server in order to fetch

00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:13.715
the latest set of
registry information

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:16.235
and store in its own cache.

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:20.135
And I believe this also
defaults to thirty-seconds,

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:22.235
but it is configurable.

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:23.855
Every thirty-seconds,

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:25.655
client would send a
request to server,

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:27.395
fetch the registry information,

00:02:27.395 --> 00:02:30.185
and then store it in its cache.

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:32.480
The last argument would say as

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.140
lease expiration
duration in seconds.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.355
This is again, that is
configurable on the client side,

00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:43.610
what this says is, how
long should the server

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.440
wait before it can conclude
that the instances down?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.135
Let's see, You said this to

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:52.880
maybe two minutes
or 130 seconds.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.180
If the silver doesn't receive
any kind of a response from

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.585
this plant for 120 seconds,

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:03.900
then the cell would conclude
that the instances down.
