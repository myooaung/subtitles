00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.969
Now that we have the gateway,

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.480
let us give it some intelligence
by configuring routes.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.940
Now a couple of ways
we can do that.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.485
We can edit, do it through a
class file, but Java code.

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:17.850
Or we can do it inside the
properties file or YML file.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.465
I'm going to go with this
option with Java code.

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:24.130
I'm going to create a new class.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.705
Spring Cloud config is
what I'm going to call it.

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:32.530
Finish.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.780
Going to annotate this
with configuration.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.790
Let's do import it.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.240
Now I'm going to define
a route locator.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.485
Going to accept a
buildup parameter.

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:21.780
Locator. Builder. Let's all
sounded this method with.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.475
We can now use this builder
object to build the Outlook,

00:01:30.475 --> 00:01:32.155
which will have bunch of routes.

00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:34.975
You will know what I
mean in just a bit.

00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:38.155
Route dot.

00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:41.490
I'm going to create a route,

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.935
is going to accept a
lambda expression.

00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:47.990
Dotplot.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.205
I went to specify one pattern,

00:01:51.205 --> 00:01:56.150
that's price slash star star.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.800
Essentially what this
means is whenever we have

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.470
a request that matches
with this pattern,

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.375
we want to route that call,

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:07.499
the request to a specific URI.

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:10.280
This is going to
point to the location

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.310
where the price
services running on

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.020
localhost port 800 to

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.230
do similar stuff for
inventory as well.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.220
Except this is going to be
running on 03 and this has to

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.239
be inventory dot built.

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.980
This is what would build
the route locator.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.840
Finally, we're returning it.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.430
Return the route. Look at.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.845
The next thing we're going to do

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:04.594
is instead of pointing
to a specific service,

00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:07.685
we would now point to Gateway.

00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:10.220
But in order for it to work,

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.520
our gateway has to
be discoverable.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.105
Let's introduce necessarily
configurations.

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:20.870
Gateway. I'm actually going to

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.260
copy them from the
existing services.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.330
All I wanted to do here,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.505
I'd like to change the
port number, the name,

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:35.390
as

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.810
get

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.740
this or

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.010
get will be running on 9001.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.690
And it will register with

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.640
the record server
with this name.
