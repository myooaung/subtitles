00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.840
I just realized that
we have actually

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.120
left a bug which we need to fix.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.170
Otherwise it will have

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.300
negative consequences
down the line.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.955
And you try to
identify that bunk.

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:15.580
It has something to
do with product list.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.580
Well, every time
there is a request,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.740
we are trying to
populate this list.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.525
If there are ten requests,

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.760
then would have ten multiplied

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.430
by three elements
added to this list,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.890
which is not what we
intend to happen.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.270
In order to fix this issue.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.810
I'm just simply going to clear

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.540
this list every time
we call this method.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.685
This should fix the problem.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:45.080
Alternately, you can just make

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.435
this part of the constructor.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:49.205
That's even better.

00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:50.960
Well, ideally we
should be having

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.120
a database which
will do the job.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.890
But since we don't
have a database,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.795
I tried manually populating.

00:00:56.795 --> 00:00:58.250
We didn't pay too much attention

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.035
to this section of the code.

00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:03.360
And we left a bug.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.580
If we had followed
test-driven development,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.475
this book could have been
identified much earlier.

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:12.185
And for that reason,

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:15.560
I'm actually thinking to
introduce a chapter where we

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.420
talked about
test-driven development

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.190
in the context of Spring Boot.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.525
So similar fixed needs
to go here as well.

00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:28.569
Inside the price and service,

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:34.100
as well as the inventory list.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.800
As well as the
inventory service.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.640
You need to do the same inside

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.740
the exchange service as well.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.450
And we're good to go.
