00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Let's launch us our instances.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.935
But how are we going to do that?

00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:07.650
Well, when we are
launching an instance,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.670
we just need to specify

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.130
the profile that we
want to activate.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.870
A couple of ways to do that.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.800
We can either do it from
my Eclipse, run a command.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.430
First.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.865
Let me just show you how
we can do it in Eclipse.

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:23.130
And then I'll show you
the command that you

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.364
can run on a command processor.

00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:27.540
To accomplish the same.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.095
Right-click on the project, run.

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:34.270
Choose Run Configuration.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.800
Then we're going to create
a new configuration.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.800
I'm going to name
this as you rake.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.624
To choose, you take a
solid as the project.

00:00:52.624 --> 00:00:55.700
Click on Search. This
would automatically

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.340
search for the
main method class.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.770
Then in here I went to
specify the profile.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.320
This is basically
the string that we

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.515
appended after the
name application.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:20.120
This should ideally act
with the India profile.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.930
Apply. And let's
launch an application.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.780
Essentially whatever
we have in here.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.860
Inside application hype
and n dot properties

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.230
is what would get activated.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.730
The solver has been launched.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.270
We're getting
exceptional because at

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.410
the moment all these bit
nodes are not accessible.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.350
Let's make them
accessible as well.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.380
Run configuration went to
make a duplicate of this.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.400
You recall us
instance changes to

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.220
us and then run it.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.220
Let's do similar stuff
for Japan as well.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.290
Runners run configuration.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.700
Then make a duplicate of

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:40.310
this one to call this
as JB stands for Japan.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.160
Apply and run.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.870
It's time to go to
browser and see if

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.110
everything is
working as expected.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:14.090
Minus 0 is 0123.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.695
All the servers are
up and running.

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:20.470
But if you scroll
down a bit under

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.319
the DS replica section

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.200
is where you would
see the Vietnam.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.500
At the moment it's
showing us local host The

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.300
supposed to be it
like two silvers.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.740
Well, the way this
replicas module would

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.480
walk is when you have

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.670
multiple instances
with same host name,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.860
it would just show
one host name.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.485
And this is not what we wanted.

00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:48.545
In fact, this is not expected
behavior in production.

00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:49.940
In production we would probably

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.070
have multiple instances with

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.590
their own host name and they

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.340
might be running on multiple
geographic locations.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.650
Let's go back to Eclipse.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.230
We're going to add one
more key value pair.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:18.475
That's Eureka dot instance
dot, host name equals.

00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:21.460
This is going to be whatever

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.485
the name that you wish to deal.

00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:28.855
We're going to have the same
four other two as well,

00:04:28.855 --> 00:04:32.680
except we want a unique name,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.915
JP and this is going to be us.

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:42.580
Let's now use this host names

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.280
instead of saying localhost.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.890
So this supposed to be JP,

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.410
this supposed to be us.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.930
This supposed to be

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.215
supposed to be JP.

00:05:30.215 --> 00:05:32.345
Save the files.

00:05:32.345 --> 00:05:38.645
And let's relaunch
our instances.

00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:41.915
You can actually
do it from here.

00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:44.810
Went to launch India,

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:54.840
silver, Japan, and
United States.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.069
Let's go back to the browser.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.540
And local hosts would
no longer work.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.590
Went to change this
to its host name.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.760
But it won't work.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.920
Can you try to make a
guess white won't walk.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.915
When to copy this,

00:06:25.915 --> 00:06:32.480
go back to browser
and have it in here.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.355
Why is this not working?

00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:40.480
Well? That's because we don't
have any DNS server that

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.145
can resolve this host
name to an IP address.

00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:48.985
In order to simulate the
behavior of having a DNS server,

00:06:48.985 --> 00:06:52.750
we can actually tweak
our ETC host file.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.840
Let's go to that file.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.750
You need to open
up a notepad with

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.130
administrator privileges and
then go to File menu open.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.740
Go to this directory.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.155
That's Windows
system that you do.

00:07:09.155 --> 00:07:11.975
Drivers and ATC.

00:07:11.975 --> 00:07:18.485
Choose all files, and then
select host, open it.

00:07:18.485 --> 00:07:20.390
And this is the file you get.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.060
Here. We're going to
add those entries,

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.810
1270 dot 0 dot one.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:37.550
That's for Eureka
hyphen IN hostname.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.400
Going to have a couple
of more entries,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.700
one for Japan and
the other four us.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.980
Save the file, go back to

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.275
the browser and reload the page,

00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:53.330
and this time you see it.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.820
You'll also notice that we

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.010
now have a couple
of replica nodes.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:08.370
Reload the page and
works as expected.
