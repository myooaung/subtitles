00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.180
Let us take a look
at how to create

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.415
multiple instances
of your records over

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:06.720
and have the registry

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.305
information replicate
amongst themselves.

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:12.090
But in order to do that,

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.205
we need to first
create profiles.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:15.630
I'm not sure if you're aware of

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.670
profiles. If you
do, that's great.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.460
Otherwise, just try
to follow along with

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.270
me and you'll understand
what I mean in just a bit.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.835
Since I'm using dot
properties file,

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:29.820
the way I go about
creating profiles is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.120
by making a copy of
the properties file.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.785
I'm going to say hyphen
IN stands for India.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:49.525
And similarly I'm going
to create one for Japan.

00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:52.550
That's hyphen JP.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:00.050
And another one for maybe US.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.610
What I'm trying to do here is

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.205
I'm actually creating
multiple properties file.

00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:09.565
Each one of these would
correspond to one profile.

00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:13.600
That when I launch the
instance of Utica server,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.040
actually get the chance

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.125
to mention the name
of the profile.

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:19.195
If I say US for instance,

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:21.370
then this is the
property file and

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.650
its configuration which
would get activated.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.335
Others would be ignored.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.905
Similarly, if I say IN,

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:31.474
then this is the configuration
which would be activated.

00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:33.890
So basically this will
allow us to launch

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.010
multiple instances
on different ports

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.620
and with different
configuration.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.775
That's what essentially
is all about profiles.

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:47.819
I'm going to get inside
one of these files.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.080
I'm actually going to
open up all of them.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.305
Weight of us chain
the port numbers.

00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:59.240
Since we are going to
run all these instances

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.710
in single host.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.770
When to say nine zeros,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.040
01 for India and zeros
0 to four Japan,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.590
and three for the United States.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.810
In addition to
that, I'm actually

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.505
going to change this to true.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:23.060
If you're wondering why each
one of these servers are

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.610
the several instances
when we launched them are

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.820
essentially the clients
of the other two silvers.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.725
This instance is going to be
a client of Japan and US.

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:35.585
And same as the case with Japan.

00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:37.730
Japan is going to
be a client for

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.205
these two silvers stances,

00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:42.750
same as the case with us.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.270
When we set this to true.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.290
We want this URAC instance
to register with the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.670
other two so that we can
support data replication.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.205
Rather to replicate the
registry information.

00:02:58.205 --> 00:03:01.210
Of course, we also want to fetch

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.980
the registry information from

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.305
the other sovereign instances.

00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:09.175
We set this to true as well.

00:03:09.175 --> 00:03:11.410
When to copy the
same configuration

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.390
for the other two as well.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.045
Save the files. In
addition to this,

00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:27.430
I also need to mention the URLs,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.460
just as we did with our
client applications.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.669
Let me open up on all
those property files.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.185
Went to copy this habit in here.

00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:43.930
Otherwise, the server
doesn't know to which

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.600
server instance it needs
to communicate with.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.795
Going to be 9002.

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:55.570
We also have one more silver.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:03.025
I'm going to say comma 9003.

00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:04.750
And guess what?
We're going to have

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.125
the same key-value pair

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:10.355
inside the other two
conflicts as well.

00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:17.975
But of course we need to
change the port numbers, 213.

00:04:17.975 --> 00:04:22.860
This right here to
two, or rather one.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.270
To save the file.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.260
Well, this should suffice.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.815
We're going to ignore
the default one.

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:41.720
We're actually going to launch

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.120
three different instances
of your deca solver.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.055
Just in case if you're
using YAML file,

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:51.665
the way you go about
creating profiles,

00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:57.215
in that case is just
have your configuration,

00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:00.800
of course, in the format
that YAML file supports.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.380
Then separate them like so.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.850
And then you have your
configuration once

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.190
again for other servers.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.215
Since I'm using properties file,

00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:15.650
I have to make
copies of this file.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.665
That's how you create profiles.

00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:21.320
There's actually one additional

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.675
key-value pair which
we need to add.

00:05:23.675 --> 00:05:27.120
But I'm going to talk
about it pretty soon.
