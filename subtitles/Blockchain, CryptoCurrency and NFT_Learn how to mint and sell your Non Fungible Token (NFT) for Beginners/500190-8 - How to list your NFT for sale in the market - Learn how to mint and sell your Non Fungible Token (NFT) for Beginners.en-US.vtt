00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.345
So other dialogue and we did the transaction to pay the pay for the gas fees.

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:08.685
And that was a pop-up over here.

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:12.480
So I basically refresh the page and the pop-up disappeared.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.490
So I'm just gonna do this thing again, 0.008.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.225
Both your listing as it is listing your item and it's asking me to sign,

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:26.530
I'm going to click on Sign.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.550
And there you go. So it's now listed.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.110
I paid the fees.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.565
I didn't have to wait for ten hours that I was thinking initially.

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:41.975
I was able to list it very quickly.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.570
But I think I've added an extra 0,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.239
so I'm just going to change the price.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:59.780
Non, That's something that I would need to learn how to do it, but that's fine.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.830
I thought somebody on the bottom where it says null.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.409
So let's just try to change the price from.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.310
So I don't know how to change the price.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.850
I will have to look into it, into the documentation.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.070
But I don't see any option directly visible at this point of time.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.570
But do you have, there you go.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.565
We have listed our force NFT, we have D.

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:36.500
And this is the main idea of this course that can you list and create your first NFT.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.210
And we have done it.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.575
Congratulations.

00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:42.260
So it's now your turn to do the same thing,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.860
create your own, and actually enlisted. Thank you for watching.
