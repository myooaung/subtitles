Hi there. This video is about creating your digital wallet.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:08.385
So think of it like this.

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:11.805
If you're going to buy anything in the physical world,

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:15.810
you need money and you need a place to keep that money.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.075
So in the digital world,

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:19.590
it's the same concept.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.175
You have a wallet where you keep the money and that is where your money is taken from.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:30.030
Now, the concept of money isn't exactly the

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.784
same in the digital world as they are tokens and numbers.

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:38.730
As the real-world where you have got caught physical notes.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.490
But overall, the idea is same

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.125
so let's get started with this.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:50.420
So the first thing that you need to do to sell you an NFT is have a wallet

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.265
And to create a digital wallet,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:56.550
the easiest thing to do is go to MetaMask.io

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.390
Make sure you're using the Chrome browser.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.690
When you open metamask.io it will ask you to download now.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.165
And then you can select Chrome and click on Install metamask for Chrome.

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:20.105
Here you will see MetaMask,

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:26.250
Chrome browser extension, and click on Add to Chrome and add extension.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.474
So now the extension has been installed,

00:01:34.474 --> 00:01:36.260
just click on Get Started.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.495
And because this is your first time,

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:40.055
you will click on yes,

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:41.480
let's get set up.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.425
This will create a new wallet and space for you.

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:50.210
So I can click on that and I will agree.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.760
And I'll create our very secret password.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.420
After ticking that agreement

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.745
Now, those of you who are new and they want to protect their wallet

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:07.535
I would definitely recommend clicking 

00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:12.410
on reveal secret and copying them in a secret place.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.420
For me, it's fine.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.400
So I'm not going to copy right now because this is being recorded.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.850
So I will click on remind me later.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.570
You don't need to worry about this, just close that.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.935
And you can see your account has been created and you have 0.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:34.790
ethereum and 0 USD.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.030
And if you go to the extension,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.780
will see the same details,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.690
0, 0, and and account 1.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.125
Whatever the hashes here as it could be the same hash over here.

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:49.160
It means that you have successfully installed the MetaMask Wallet.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.910
Thank you.
