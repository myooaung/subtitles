Hi there, my name is Qambar Raza,

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:06.015
and this course is about NFT.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:13.935
Now, imagine a future where everything is being bought and sold using digital currency.

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:17.219
Your house, an audiobook,

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:22.485
your favorite music, or an antique, or some artwork.

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:28.800
Everything in the future will be bought and sold using digital currencies.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.280
Now, when we talk about digital,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.475
the problem in the digital world is everything can be copy pasted.

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:43.595
So how can we trace our track something or stop something from being copied?

00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:50.975
This is where NFTcomes in and makes things unique and secure digitally.

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:59.809
And this course is about how NFT works and how you can create your first NFT.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.900
Yes, I will teach you how you can basically create

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.365
an NFT by finding a royalty-free image and using that image,

00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:18.065
which will be modified by us using some certain technologies and tools.

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:23.720
We will be uploading that image onto OpenSea.io.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.045
So I'll OpenSea,

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:30.890
we will see how we can create that into an NFT.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.084
Add properties and levels.

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:39.200
and statistics and that would be the end of the course.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.035
So come and join me if you like,

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:44.404
and join the NFT evolution!

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:46.290
Thank you.
