00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
When we talk about NFP art,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.365
we are talking about images,

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:11.280
some sort of digital log or some sort of painting that you can share or image or anything

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.475
that you can basically upload to open sea

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:18.840
and shared with other people so that they can purchase it.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.710
This training session is about creating an NFT art and uploading it on open sea.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.240
So there are two ways to do it.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.100
One way is you are like very professional artists and you can draw things in

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.665
Illustrator or via Penn on Apple pen and just draw it on iPad and then upload it.

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:43.010
Or you can just scan your previous artwork and upload it on your computer.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.770
And then from there you can convert it into NFT.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.990
Those are like really highly professional people who are,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.655
who have an art background.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:54.215
I don't have an art background.

00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:56.615
I come from communist science.

00:00:56.615 --> 00:01:05.705
What I can do is I can think of an idea and modify images.

00:01:05.705 --> 00:01:08.810
And that's the most easiest way to do things.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.360
So what I'm going to show you in this video is how the search for images that do not have

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.405
a copyright means that you are using a legal image and how do you modify them?

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:22.970
So let's start by searching.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.910
Normally. When you talk about surgery, go to Google,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.150
we just start typing whatever you want to search.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.255
So I have a passion for t.

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:33.650
This is my thing.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.000
So everybody has their own thing.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.070
So somebody, somebody is a coin collector,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.995
somebody is stamp collector.

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:45.079
My thing is, I'm passionate about D and enemies.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.505
So I will be searching for things like tea and enemy.

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:54.125
When you talk about tea and NME and we go to images is fine.

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:56.045
Tons of images.

00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:57.695
The Boolean.

00:01:57.695 --> 00:02:00.530
But I can't use any of these images.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.275
The reason is they are all copyright.

00:02:03.275 --> 00:02:07.850
So what you do is In the Google Search menu,

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.500
in the images section,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.734
look at this Options settings,

00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:16.490
click on Settings, and click on advanced search.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.150
Here at the very bottom it says Usage Rights.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.740
So you need to ensure that you're legally using the images.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.635
So many click on all.

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:29.150
It gives you two options,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.259
Creative Commons license and commercial and other licenses.

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.095
So when you click on Creative Commons license,

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:41.390
this means that you can potentially borrow the images and modify them,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.360
or you would have to still look into what's going on.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.130
So when you mean I said, Well, what's going on?

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.080
It I basically mean that you need to further investigate it.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.685
You can still use it.

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:57.215
Most probably you can use it.

00:02:57.215 --> 00:03:00.875
But as you can see, we don't get a lot of images after doing this.

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:02.750
Even if I search for, for example,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.460
Pakistani chai and add the settings,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.100
I'm just gonna make sure the settings are creative,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.230
common license, advanced search.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:21.120
I don't get much. So the other option is we go to Flickr.com.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.505
Here.

00:03:22.505 --> 00:03:26.280
I will just search for the same thing, Pakistani GI.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.235
And here, as you can see,

00:03:30.235 --> 00:03:31.600
the same thing, you know,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.465
the the usage rights.

00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:38.270
It's over here on the left top.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:46.700
And then over here you can select commercial use and modes allowed.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.520
And as you can see now you can find images that you are able to use.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.740
So I personally like this image.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.455
I think that there is a enemy while 28 and

00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:03.715
it's talking about chai and Pakistani t and this substance,

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:06.645
one of the cafeteria and Pakistan.

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:07.825
So think of costs,

00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:09.880
but on a lower level.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.925
So you get that this is a Pakistani costs.

00:04:12.925 --> 00:04:15.910
I love it. So I'm going to use this image.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.810
So let's save this image on my desktop.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.415
I can't because this is Flickr.

00:04:24.415 --> 00:04:27.625
So what you do is you do an inspect element.

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:31.840
And then you basically click on the network.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.675
You refresh the page.

00:04:34.675 --> 00:04:37.435
Sort by size.

00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:40.330
And when you sort by size,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.605
you can basically scroll to the right top,

00:04:44.605 --> 00:04:48.280
ensure that it had the maximum size and the top.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.970
And from here, I can look into the banks.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.190
So if you look at this JPEG,

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.390
this is a way same image.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.090
So I'm going to just right-click open a new tab,

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.180
right-click Save Image As.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.620
And that will be on desktop. There you go.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:12.205
That's how you basically find images either on Google Settings.

00:05:12.205 --> 00:05:16.810
And then you search for the license or in Flickr.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.545
You can do the same thing. You can do the same thing for any other image website.

00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:24.040
I'm just showing you some free image options.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.045
Some people basically directly go to Unsplash.

00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:30.295
Unsplash is a very good website.

00:05:30.295 --> 00:05:35.085
It, it also has like royalty-free images so you can search for any topic.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:41.855
So I can search for any of these images into the cartoon,

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:46.865
tea or whatever you want to do with those images.

00:05:46.865 --> 00:05:48.620
So the next step, again,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.175
I've already mentioned a bit of it which is adding value.

00:05:52.175 --> 00:05:54.395
So when you have searched the image,

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:56.810
how do you add value to it?

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:03.200
Now, there are multiple websites out there which can help you categorize your image.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.679
So let's try foo to cartoon.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.460
Sure about this one. I've actually use the first one which is be funky.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.955
It has its limitations.

00:06:16.955 --> 00:06:23.540
So if you click on Start to you and you bring in the image that you want to use.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.800
So for example, I'm going to be using this image.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.505
You can select affects over here.

00:06:34.505 --> 00:06:37.730
So this is digital art.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.145
You can go and select other effects as well.

00:06:40.145 --> 00:06:42.890
If you are interested in any other ones.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:53.090
I'm going to use the digital art and catalyzer Diigo.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.975
So I've got this image in the cartoon format.

00:06:56.975 --> 00:07:04.625
I can potentially add some more texts to it or not,

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:09.230
it's really up to me and this side has a trial so you can find any other website as well,

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.660
but this is an option.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.510
So if, if it's not allowing you to dollar directly,

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:21.200
you could just do a screenshot for now. And Diigo.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.635
So you have got a screenshot of the image that you wanted to use.

00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:33.545
So I've got my screenshot in my Documents folder.

00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:35.790
So this is the image.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.315
This is the final output.

00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:43.055
So again, you don't have to use the exact same resources.

00:07:43.055 --> 00:07:44.704
This is one of the options.

00:07:44.704 --> 00:07:46.220
So in this video,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.610
what we basically saw was,

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.310
number one, how do you find images?

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.490
Make sure that image is royalty free.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.810
It doesn't have a copyright.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.085
That's how you find it,

00:07:58.085 --> 00:08:01.895
either via Google, liquor or any other website.

00:08:01.895 --> 00:08:06.215
Second thing is add value to damage.

00:08:06.215 --> 00:08:10.460
By customizing it filters out the best way to do it.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.100
I use this website.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.620
You can start a free trial over here.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.350
Or you could find any other website which converts it

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.925
into Tonight's format and add like a text on top,

00:08:22.925 --> 00:08:29.465
which would say like Pakistani Chai, tea love.

00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:31.940
And that is how you would add value to it.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.290
Once you have added value,

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.330
you have made an original image.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.480
You're not an artist. You don't have an article on background.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.840
When you have the skills to complete a skill that you can

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.250
use to still make your own OID on empty and you can sell.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.525
How can see IO?

00:08:47.525 --> 00:08:49.355
So thank you for watching this video.

00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:50.585
In the next video,

00:08:50.585 --> 00:08:57.215
we will be talking about how do you actually uploaded open CAN sell your images.

00:08:57.215 --> 00:08:58.980
Thank you.
