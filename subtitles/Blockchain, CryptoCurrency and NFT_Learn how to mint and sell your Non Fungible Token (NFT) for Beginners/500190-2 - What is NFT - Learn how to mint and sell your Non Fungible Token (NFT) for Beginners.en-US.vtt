00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.025
Are you a dog person or a cat person?

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:08.625
Let me ask this question again by zooming my camera.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:13.450
There you go. Are you a dog person or a cat person?

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.010
You don't need to answer that. This video is about an NFTs.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.840
But when we talk about NFT,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.670
we have to talk about cats.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.900
We can't resist.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.820
They're very beautiful animals.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.575
Even in the history.

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:33.365
In the Egypt, people use to worship cats.

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:36.185
They have been a very loyal pets.

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:38.765
Not like dogs.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:40.580
And that would be another debate,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.605
like what you should have.

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:46.145
This course is about NFT again.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.065
And when we talk about NFT,

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.510
we have to go back in 2017.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.910
In 2017, this happened, a company

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.135
called dapper labs in Canada invented a game called crypto kitties.

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:08.300
They knew that people like cats and they were very popular on the Internet.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.785
So why not create a game that people can collect,

00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:19.025
purchase, sell, and even breed crypto kitties.

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:22.520
So this was a really popular game.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.270
It was so popular that in December 2017,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.020
it almost brought down the Ethereum blockchain network.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.820
And when we talk about Ethereum blockchain network,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.965
ethereum is a digital currency.

00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:40.315
It's similar but very different in algorithm

00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:44.705
to Bitcoin has a different algorithm for proof of concept.

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:51.350
But if you move forward in 2021,

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.080
we see another artist who collected his 5000 days of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.980
artwork and convert it into a digital format and sold it for 69 million.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.925
Now you should ask a question,

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:10.280
why can't I anybody copy-paste this?

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.680
It is digital.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.185
Anybody can do right-click Save As,

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:19.290
and then shared with other person.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.980
In the digital world.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.235
We have now invented a way of ensuring things become unique.

00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:31.040
And when we talk about unique,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.785
we talk about collectible items. And NFT's

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:40.400
sole purpose or main application that

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.165
we have seen up until now is when the collectible items,

00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:46.985
because in the collectible items,

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:54.050
they had been created by a creator in either limited format or just one item.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.485
And depending on the type of the item,

00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:00.650
that item has a particular value.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.040
But when we talk about NFT, NFT basically means

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.000
non-fungible token. What is fungible?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Fungible basically means something that is interchangeable, in value.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.570
If I give you one pound and you give me one pound back.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.550
Would there be a difference in value in our pocket?

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.440
You will have one pound back.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.345
So if you had 20 pounds,

00:03:26.345 --> 00:03:28.685
you gave me one pound, and I gave you one pound,

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:31.260
you still will have 20 pounds.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.565
Now, when we talk about digital world,

00:03:34.565 --> 00:03:37.745
if I give you one Bitcoin and you give me one Bitcoin,

00:03:37.745 --> 00:03:40.529
we will still have the same bitcoins.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.450
When we talk about non-fungible.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:52.040
This is where we talk about collectible items such as artwork, paintings, and others.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.825
Think of it like this.

00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:56.840
If Banksy creates an artwork and I create an artwork,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.270
both will have a completely different value.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.000
Similarly, if he creates two art pieces,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.580
they will have different values as well.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.525
But that's physical example.

00:04:11.525 --> 00:04:12.935
In the digital world,

00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:18.665
we can talk about crypto kitties can talk about tickets for the theater.

00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:22.340
So the tickets are limited for a movie.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.220
And they are also digital.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.115
So they have, they can be identified using NFT as well.

00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:35.090
Now when we talk about an NFT,

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.910
we have understood what is fungible, what is non-fungible?

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.849
So we have understood N and F which is non-fungible.

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.815
What is T in NFT?

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.215
T means token.

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:50.855
A token is something like a digital certificate which

00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:58.160
identifies certain things with certain properties.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.365
What does that mean?

00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:10.160
So when you talk about NFT token and that token identifies who created this NFT.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.815
Like for example, in Beeple's

00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:15.125
when he created the artwork,

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.540
Beeple was the creator of the artwork.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.660
But does Beeple own the artwork? No.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.815
No.

00:05:21.815 --> 00:05:23.990
Because he sold it for 69 million.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.245
So when he he sold the artwork for 69 million,

00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:30.995
the person who owns it is different.

00:05:30.995 --> 00:05:37.310
So that certificate will contain that information about who created it, who owns it

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:44.390
and some other properties to ensure that how many of these items exists.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.060
So Beeple's artwork is unique.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.670
its not scarce, its unique.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.505
When we talk about limited items.

00:05:52.505 --> 00:05:54.440
They can be 4, 5,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.525
or 6, or max.

00:05:56.525 --> 00:05:58.790
I mean in the NFT world

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.160
that's the normal range of it.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.620
And it's not divisible.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.265
Meaning you can't divide Beeple's work into two.

00:06:07.265 --> 00:06:11.765
You can't copy paste people's work because it wouldn't work.

00:06:11.765 --> 00:06:15.080
You need a valid token for it.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.795
And if you create a fake token,

00:06:17.795 --> 00:06:19.640
that token will not work.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.954
Because this is based on a blockchain technology.

00:06:22.954 --> 00:06:25.265
Even if you have one machine,

00:06:25.265 --> 00:06:28.700
then there will be multiple other machines which

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.615
will verify that you have done a fraud or something.

00:06:32.615 --> 00:06:36.065
Because he can only change data in one machine,

00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:41.810
in the blockchain network is spread across the Internet.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.205
And that's the beauty of blockchain. This is why.

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:48.545
When we talk about NFT,

00:06:48.545 --> 00:06:52.010
we talked about collectible items,

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.179
the items that can be identified uniquely,

00:06:56.179 --> 00:07:00.875
and the security that NFT provides for those items,

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:04.670
which is why people are willing to spend their money to

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.795
protect or buy basically those items.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:12.425
And they, they trust that this security will work.

00:07:12.425 --> 00:07:15.980
So thank you so much for watching this video.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:22.265
We will continue this topic about how you can create your own NFT in the next video.

00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:24.000
Thank you.
