00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.710
With our new Vuex store now setup,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.425
it's time to add some state to our store

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:10.890
and see how we can access it from within our components.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.980
Just before we do this, we have an error down in the console,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.810
and this is because our Vuex needs a capital V to mark your import at the very top.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.355
We now start with retrieving pizza data from

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:27.105
our Firebase database along with our customer orders.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:28.650
Until we set this up,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.975
however, I'm going to simulate this.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:36.525
If we go over to the menu.vue components, inside here,

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:39.105
if we go down to our data property,

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.340
we have our sample data here,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.525
which is get menu items.

00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:46.010
I'm going to cut out all this section from

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.005
our components and then move this over to our store.

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.425
Make sure you grab the right section.

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:59.140
Get menu items, leaving just the baskets and also the basket text into our store.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.515
We can now paste this into our state object.

00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:07.325
Then I'm just going to change the name to simply be menu items.

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:11.510
This means, our data is now taken out to the components and placed

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.955
inside of a central store for any component to have access to.

00:01:15.955 --> 00:01:21.805
As expected, if we go to the browser and then go over to the menu components,

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:23.840
click on the menu link here,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.080
the menu is missing because we removed the data and placed it into a different file.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.049
How do we access these store from inside of this components?

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.680
Well, if we go back to our menu.vue components,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.200
we can now have access to our store inside the computed value.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.299
I'm going to call this get menu items,

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.270
just like we had before.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.455
Inside here, we're going to return this dot $ symbol store.

00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:55.535
Then from our store file we're going to access the state objects,

00:01:55.535 --> 00:01:56.720
and the pizza state,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.455
which we called menu items.

00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:02.559
This name of get menu items,

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:04.260
also matches our loop.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.875
If we scroll our loop, slip above basket,

00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:10.130
and here we are, inside of the menu,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.825
we have get menu items.

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:15.290
We just need to add a comma after the computed values.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.900
Say this, and back over to our menu.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.190
We now have the menu data now in place.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.815
This data is now accessed from our central store,

00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:28.480
rather than it being restricted to one single component.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.570
When data install updates,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.655
this component and any others,

00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:37.715
which access in this menu data will also be updated or re-rendered.

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:43.595
If we make a quick change to a pizza name back in the store.js,

00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:46.445
let's go down and change the name of this,

00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:49.800
gives this a save, back to our menu.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.180
We now see this immediately updates.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.920
Finally, we also access the same menu items from within the admin screen too.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.900
Let's go to the admin.vue.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.335
We can set up a computed value,

00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:09.320
just like we did it inside of the menu.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.695
Setup our object and add the comma just afterwards.

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:20.550
The name again is going to be the same of get menu items and we're

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.745
going to return our store because access this dot $ symbol store,

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:31.200
our state objects, then again, menu items.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.345
Scroll it up. We can now use this to create our dynamic data inside of the menu table,

00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:40.705
but from the very top, just underneath the menu title,

00:03:40.705 --> 00:03:43.120
if we look for the table body,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.340
we can create a V for loop.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.399
We're going to loop through the get menu items.

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.245
So item in get menu items.

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:58.225
We can also bind a key and the key is going to be equal to the item dot ID.

00:03:58.225 --> 00:04:03.580
Now we can use this item to replace the hard-coded value of margarita.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.024
Inside of the double curly braces,

00:04:06.024 --> 00:04:09.580
we can access the item.name and they should be

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.330
now repeated since it's a loop for all three of our items,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.415
inside of our store.

00:04:15.415 --> 00:04:18.260
Over to the admin.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.070
Let's scroll down to our menu.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.905
Now we'll see our free items pulled in from our central store.

00:04:27.905 --> 00:04:32.030
This is one way to access data from our store.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.735
Next we will look at another possibly improved way,

00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:38.400
which is by using getters.
