00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.475
In the last video, we added

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:06.840
a user login form which we have down at the bottom of our admin.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.245
This will be used to pass data to Firebase and

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:13.920
check if the user is allowed to access this admin screen.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.760
Firebase makes add-in authentication easy follows to head over to the Firebase console.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.200
We see the authentication option in the menu on the left-hand side.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.315
We can then select a sign up method

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:32.125
where we can set up authentication using various providers.

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:35.540
We can make use of social media such as Facebook or

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.515
Twitter or we can use a email and password combination,

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:42.875
which I'm going to click on and then enable.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.825
Once this is done hit Save.

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:49.580
You will then see the enabled status just in the middle here.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.430
Click on a user and now we can add a user to Firebase.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.300
Click on ''Add User'' where we can add

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.045
an email and also password.

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:09.925
I'm going to add test them on and then Add User.

00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:14.150
Of course, a stronger password is required if using this in production.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.690
There is also a way to register users from within the app

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.190
too and it shows this in the documentation if you would interested.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.075
There is various methods such as signing with email and password.

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:31.835
But this is more suited to apps where public users can register rather than our use case,

00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:35.870
where we simply have a admin who can login it to the back end.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.314
Now we have a user registered,

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:42.685
we need to set up our authentication in our Firebase config,

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:48.285
so go back to our project and then the Firebase.js file.

00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:51.390
We can then import our off module from

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.765
Firebase just like we did with the five-star just above.

00:01:55.765 --> 00:02:00.320
We can select Firebase forward slash auth then at

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.860
the bottom we can create a reference to our Firebase authentication service.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.634
I'm going to export this as a constant,

00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:11.915
so it's available in other files.

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:15.920
I'm going to call this constant by a base auth and set this

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.370
equal to Firebase and access the auth method.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.250
Inside of the auth files,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.545
just like we did with the menu reference,

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:30.935
we can access our authentication methods by using Firebase auth as basically a shortcut.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:34.925
We can then go to the login view components

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:39.165
and now we can import this auth reference from the config file.

00:02:39.165 --> 00:02:41.785
I'll blow our templates.

00:02:41.785 --> 00:02:44.510
Let's create our scripts.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.700
This is a named export,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.545
so I'm going to import this using the curly braces,

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:55.700
so the name was Firebase auth and this is from the file path,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.740
which is dot dot slash and then Firebase and we're going to make use of

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.600
this authentication service to create the sign-in and sign-out functionality.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.085
Let's begin with sign-in by adding a click handler to our sign-in button adjustable.

00:03:12.085 --> 00:03:14.820
On just this line here we can create

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.455
a click handler use dot prevent to prevent the default behavior of a browser

00:03:21.455 --> 00:03:25.655
refresh set this up to be equal to a method called

00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:31.780
sign-in and this method we can now create low inside of our script.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.655
First of all, inside of our export,

00:03:34.655 --> 00:03:38.795
we can add the name of our component which is login.

00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:46.260
We also need to setup our methods and the only one at the moment is sign-in.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.610
Inside here we can access all of the available authentication methods which we can

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.680
access using Firebase auth and this is what we'll begin to look at in the next video.
