00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.075
I'm going to get started with the header components which we created in the last video,

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:08.190
which will have our logo,

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.675
our site title, along with some links to other pages.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:15.285
Inside of this Header.vue,

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:18.330
let's begin by creating our template,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.660
which is going to contain a header elements.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.840
At the top of our header we're going to have a div,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.945
which is going to be a rapper bubble logo,

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:30.720
and also our site title.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.660
We can add a class to our div.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.775
We can link this to the CSS in just a moment of header logo.

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:44.990
Inside here, the first thing I'm going to do is to add our image and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.000
the image which is being included inside of the assets on the images folder,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.615
is going to be for the planet.jpg,

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:56.270
so I'm going to link this.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.205
This is from the../ slash assets,

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:06.880
the images folder and the name of planet.jpg.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.549
As the old text I'm going to add a pizza planet icon,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.625
followed by a level one heading,

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:20.105
which is going to link to our homepage.

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:26.770
We can add the href as a forward slash and then the title of PIZZA PLANET.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.770
Just after our surrounding div with our logo,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.495
we can then add our links to different areas or different components of our application.

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:41.300
Let's add these inside of a nav element.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.890
To begin, I'm going to hard code another list until we

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.965
are at the front and routing later in the course using the view router.

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.830
The unordered list, the first list item,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.050
which is also going to be a link,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.325
is going to link to a Home route of forward slash.

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:04.060
The link name of home.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.945
Each link, I'm going to add a span element with the Tilda icon to separate each one.

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:18.710
The next one I'm going to copy the span and also the list item. Paste this in.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.445
This is a link to our menu components, which is forward/menu.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:30.450
The next one is for the contact us page.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.640
The href is simply forward/contact.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.350
The last one is for the about this link.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.850
Let's add this in. This doesn't need the span.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.355
We're going to move this.

00:02:47.355 --> 00:02:50.730
The text of about us.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.000
The href is simply forward/about.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.850
The next thing we need for our header is to add the scripts.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.200
The only thing we need to add for now is the name of our components.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.680
The name is going to be the app header.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.480
The next thing I wanted to do after the template and script is to

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.660
also add the Style section where we can add these styles for header.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.175
Also include these scoped keyword,

00:03:22.175 --> 00:03:24.680
which means the styles will only apply to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.390
this single components and not for the rest of the site.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.405
Let's begin by selecting our level 1 heading,

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:34.955
which is for the site title.

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:38.225
We can make the font size a little larger.

00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:41.600
I want to set mine to be 1.3 ms.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.175
When we created our template just above,

00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:48.890
surround an inside subtitle and also our logo.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.995
We have this div with the class of header logo.

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:55.205
I'm going to use this class to add a linear gradient,

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:59.380
which is going to make up some stripes as a background image.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.655
Let's grab this. Just under our H1.

00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:10.260
We can take this as a class setting the background image.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.765
The background image is going to be a linear gradients.

00:04:14.765 --> 00:04:22.070
To set up our stripes at an angle of 45 degrees separate it by comma,

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.745
we also now need to add the stages which the colors are going to appear.

00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:32.959
I'm going to switch between two colors to create the stripe effects.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:36.850
On the first color, which I'm going to add is a x value

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.890
of d85226 and then 25 percent.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.390
This basically means that the start of the gradient from

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.440
zero up to 25 percent will consist of this color.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.235
We can then add our second color,

00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:58.590
which is going to be the value of f79e38.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.995
This color is going to apply from 25 percent to 50 percent.

00:05:05.995 --> 00:05:09.035
The second quarter of the gradient,

00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:10.340
for the third quarter,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.740
we're going to switch back to our original color.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.195
Let's add the same.

00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:19.340
This is going to be from 50 percent up to 75 percent.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.230
For the last quarter of the gradient,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.385
we're going to switch back to our lighter color.

00:05:24.385 --> 00:05:29.810
Let's add this in. This we're going to run it from 75 percent onwards.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.780
We can then finish off our gradient with the same color.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.885
This will run to the end of the gradients,

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:37.685
which is 100 percent.

00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:43.290
We can then specify the size with the background size property,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.435
which I'm going to set to a value of 80 pixels.

00:05:47.435 --> 00:05:49.415
Then 80 pixels.

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:53.125
The display type is going to be flex.

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:58.325
So in this, the flex will allow us to add the flex direction to be column,

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:01.760
which will allow our items to be stacked on top of each other.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.600
We get the site logo on top of the site title.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.914
We can also add the align items property,

00:06:08.914 --> 00:06:11.530
set these in the sensor.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.780
Then finally finish things off with some padding on the top of some pixels.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.145
Keep this away from the top of the browser.

00:06:21.145 --> 00:06:23.490
But we add any more styles.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.840
Let's add this to our app.vue.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.460
So we can see this inside of the browser.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.405
Remember, all of the files which we created are standalone single file components.

00:06:34.405 --> 00:06:40.505
Which means tell a view exactly where we want this to appear inside of our projects.

00:06:40.505 --> 00:06:44.540
The app.vue is our main components

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.475
and we can use this as a wrapper for all of our components.

00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:51.175
To begin at the top of our scripts,

00:06:51.175 --> 00:06:56.275
we need to add an import where we import our header from the file path

00:06:56.275 --> 00:07:02.420
of dot slash components and that header.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.910
We need a components property which we already have from

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.365
the content provided when we created this with the view CLI.

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:15.175
So inside here we can add the app header,

00:07:15.175 --> 00:07:20.080
which is going to be equal to the header which we'd just imported.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.500
So when registering components inside a vue,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.260
we should not use a reserved element name such as header.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:33.235
So what we're doing here is setting the header component to be a alias of app header.

00:07:33.235 --> 00:07:36.380
We can therefore references up had a loop in

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.710
our templates where we want this to appear on the screen.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.490
So we can move this and add inside of lowercase

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.765
the app header with a opening and a closing elements.

00:07:47.765 --> 00:07:53.740
Alternatively, we can use a self-closing tag just like this. This will also work.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.910
I'm having error appearing here,

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.825
and it's the file path from the header.

00:07:58.825 --> 00:08:01.375
Let's just fix this.

00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:04.620
This is supposed to be PNG.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.430
So save this. Now we can go over to the browser.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:13.070
We now see our logo appear in with the background linear gradients.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.915
We also have the site title and also our navigation links just here.

00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:19.760
Just to finish this video off,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.710
let's add some styling to the rest of

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.415
these links and we can also make the logo a little smaller.

00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:28.355
So back to the header.vue.

00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:31.309
We can scroll down to our styles.

00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:35.435
Let's begin by targeting the header logo image.

00:08:35.435 --> 00:08:37.215
So it had a logo,

00:08:37.215 --> 00:08:44.210
we can grab the image element and then set the maximum width p-value of 25 vw,

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.750
which is 25 percent of the view port width.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.960
Next I'm styling for all links at the bottom,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.570
we can grab the unordered list.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:59.550
Set the padding to be a value of 10 pixels on the top and bottom,

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.155
zero on the left and right.

00:09:02.155 --> 00:09:12.940
We can also select the list items and also set the display to be inline-block. Save this.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.955
Also we are going to finally add a media query,

00:09:16.955 --> 00:09:18.980
which is going to make this image a little bit

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.645
smaller when we reach 900 pixels and above.

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:26.215
Let's add this just after our list item.

00:09:26.215 --> 00:09:37.360
At media, we'll target these screens which have a minimum width of 900 pixels.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.330
We can then target our header logo image,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.265
which you have just here.

00:09:43.265 --> 00:09:48.665
We can add this inside and drop this down to a value of 20 vw.

00:09:48.665 --> 00:09:50.455
So now on a smaller screen,

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:53.050
this is a body of 25 percent.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.005
We can increase to 900 pixels.

00:09:56.005 --> 00:10:00.510
Then we see the image drops down to make it a little smaller. This is it.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.850
Now for our header,

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:06.274
we will come back to these components later on when we add a front-end routing.

00:10:06.274 --> 00:10:09.900
But for now let's move on to our homepage.
