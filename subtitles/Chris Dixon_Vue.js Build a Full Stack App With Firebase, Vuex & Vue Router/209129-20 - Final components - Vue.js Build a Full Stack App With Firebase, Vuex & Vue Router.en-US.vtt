00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.205
We're making good progress with this application so far.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.530
Before we move on to the next section,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.675
which will be to look at routing,

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:14.250
I just want to first add the remaining components needed for this project.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.235
They're going to be pretty simple components such as an About Us and Contact Us page.

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:22.965
But they'll be handy in the next section

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:26.475
where we'll see how we can use routing to switch between them.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:31.500
One of the final components which we need is the About Us components so let's

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.330
open the sidebar and create a new file called About.view.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.010
This is going to be pretty simple where we create

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.095
a templates but now I'm going to add an empty div.

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:49.870
Also create our script section

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.785
and the component name which is going to be about save this,

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:58.900
and back into the components we can create our second file,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.365
which is going to be Contact.view for the Contact Us page.

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:07.345
Create our template inside here,

00:01:07.345 --> 00:01:15.250
so this is going to have a div with the class of contact_ wrapper,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.375
a level for heading with the title of Contact.

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:25.975
After this, we're going to add our address for the contact section.

00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:32.010
At the top we're going to add the name of Pizza Planet inside the strong tags.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.910
Then we can make up a fictional address separated by break tags,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.120
add these onto new lines.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.440
Let's simply make something up of address 1,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.580
Copy and Paste this in a few more times,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.360
and also a phone number and also make this up.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.345
There's always a second set of address tags and it's just going to be for our e-mail.

00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:05.400
Inside this strong tags let's add the title of e-mail,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.505
followed by a break tag and then a e-mail address inside the P elements.

00:02:11.505 --> 00:02:18.430
Now we can add any e-mail address inside here so contact at pizzaplanets.com.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:27.590
A script tag, just below this and only script tag needs is a name of the components,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.960
which is contact and then we can add our styles just below.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.470
I'm just going to add some basic styles for our contact wrapper,

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.200
which were added as our surrounding div.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.140
This is a class,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.140
so the backgrounds I want to add a hex value of f1e6da,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.440
a height to the components of 100 percent of the viewport height,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.050
I'll apply by some margin and padding,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.310
so 10 pixels and also the same for our padding.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.700
The next component is going to be for the Delivery Info so this is Delivery.view.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.125
Starts off with the template as usual,

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:24.560
a surrounding div, which is going to have the class of info_block.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.230
A title of Delivery Info and I'm going to add the tildes on either side.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.605
A second div after this with the class of info block content.

00:03:41.605 --> 00:03:45.760
Just so we can target this inside of the CSS.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.505
We can add some sample text inside of the P element so I'm going to type in lorem,

00:03:51.505 --> 00:03:54.680
hit Tab to get some sample data.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.780
After this, we can add in an image.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.345
For the image source, we can grab this from our images folder.

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:04.340
This is inside of assets/images,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.200
and then the name of delivery.png,

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.730
the alt texts of delivery image.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.805
Then all we need to do after days is add our script,

00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:23.110
which is going to have the name of our components,

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.270
which is going to be delivery.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.380
The next two components of history and ordering guide are going to be pretty similar.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.415
I'm going to copy all the contents from this file,

00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:41.230
create a New file and this is going to be History.view,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.485
Paste in the contents.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:49.975
All we need to do here is to change the title of history,

00:04:49.975 --> 00:04:55.275
the image is planets.png,

00:04:55.275 --> 00:04:59.580
the alt text of planet image.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.450
Then the component name of history,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.250
save this and the very last one which we need to create is for the ordering guide,

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.240
based in the same data,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.040
and we can make use of this.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:25.685
The text of how to order the image source instead of delivery is going to be order.png,

00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:36.340
the alt text of all the image and then finally the title of ordering guide.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.480
This is now it for our components and most of the project is now setup.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.860
We don't need to register any of these components

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.640
because we will be displaying them using routing in the next section.
