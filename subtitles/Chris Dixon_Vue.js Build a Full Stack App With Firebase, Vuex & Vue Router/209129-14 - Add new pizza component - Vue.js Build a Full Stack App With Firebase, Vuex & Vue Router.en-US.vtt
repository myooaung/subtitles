00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.890
Over in the menu only finished version,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.750
these aren't new pizza section,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.680
is basically form to add a new item to the database.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.330
I'm going to create a section in its own components, called NewPizza.vue.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.980
You could argue that this could go in the admin file 2,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.600
which would also be fine.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.510
However, it is quite a bit of HTML code.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.170
So the admin component make it a little bit bloated.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.320
As usual, let's go to the components folder,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.635
and we can create our new components, inside here.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:40.845
So this is going to be NewPizza.vue extension.

00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:42.660
Inside here, we can add

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.910
our [inaudible] template and we can have some basic structure to our form.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.600
So the form that's have the opening and closing tags inside the level free heading.
