00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.900
All of our pizza information will eventually be stored inside of a real database.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.570
But for now I'm going to add some menu items into our data property to work with.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.500
I'm going to do this inside of the menu dot view component.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.135
We need to add a script tag just bellow our template.

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:26.049
We can then add our familiar export default

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.480
where we can add our data property to store all pizzas.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.305
Inside of the return statement,

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:40.420
I'm going to create an object to store these in called get menu items.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.890
For now we'll just set this up as an empty object.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.290
Provided with this course is a text file called pizza

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.860
object which will contain all the data which we need.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.365
Have this available on the desktop.

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:56.230
I'm going to open this up.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.280
Then we can grab all of the contents and paste them inside of our data.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.450
Let's select all, copy these.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.790
Then paste this inside of get menu items.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.160
All we have here is various objects.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.075
The first one is an object which contains a margarita.

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:21.835
We have a description and then inside here we have a Options array.

00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:24.045
We have our two sizes.

00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:29.615
We have a nine inch and also a 12 inch pizza with the corresponding price.

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:31.475
Then have a second item,

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:32.945
which is a pepperoni,

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:36.490
also with the description and the two options.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.395
With this data property now available,

00:01:39.395 --> 00:01:42.590
we can make use of views v for directive.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.460
To look through our data we can do this up inside of

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.035
the table where we added all of the static data in the last video.

00:01:51.035 --> 00:01:54.635
To begin on the surrounding table elements,

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:59.060
I'm going to make use of the v for directive to look through.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.510
We can add v for.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.045
We then say item in get menu items.

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:10.975
Get menu items is the object which is added to our data property.

00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:14.660
We then store each individual pizza inside of

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.495
this item variable so we can access is inside of our table.

00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:23.000
We're going to begin by removing the hard-coded value of

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.915
pepperoni inside of the double curly braces.

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:30.570
We can then access the item dot name.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.060
With all this inside of the small times we can remove the Lorem Ipsum.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.985
We can actually double curly braces unless I want to access the item dot description.

00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:48.395
Save this over to the browser and we can see if this is working.

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:51.160
We see we have a small problem.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.580
When using Vue.js and also this is the same when using React to if you've used up before.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.795
We need to add a key to each item.

00:03:01.795 --> 00:03:07.690
We see the view is expecting the v bind directive with a unique key.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.460
To fix is when using a loop.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.240
We can also see we've got the red underline in the text editor.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.585
We can also bind a dynamic key property with the colon and then key.

00:03:19.585 --> 00:03:21.440
For each individual item,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.630
we need to add this unique key.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.310
This is all view come better,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.995
keep track of each item when we are adding,

00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:31.435
removing or updating a list elements.

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:35.915
At the moment, our pizza object contains unique pizza names.

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:41.090
We can just use up. We can say item.name.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.115
We can instantly see upon saving that's our menu items and now added.

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:51.205
However, a better value for a key would be a Unique ID.

00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:53.190
When using our database later

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.025
a Unique ID will be generated for each item in the database.

00:03:58.025 --> 00:04:01.210
We can come back and change this key later on.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.525
But now our free items which you have inside of our data.

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:08.240
The next thing to do is to create a second loop,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.550
which is going to loop through all the options.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.905
At moment we just have the hard-coded value of the nine inch pizza.

00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:17.255
If we go down to our data property,

00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:19.310
we have two options.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.960
We have the two values of

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.870
nine and 12 inch meaning we can add a second loop to go through these.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.375
If we locate the table row with the sizing inside of the opening elements,

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:35.875
we can add a second loop would be four.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:40.415
Inside here we're going to loop through our individual options.

00:04:40.415 --> 00:04:45.325
Remember we have our individual pizzas stored inside this item variable.

00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:47.375
We can access item.

00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:55.045
Options, and then we can store each individual option in a variable called Option.

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:58.395
We can then set up our dynamic data.

00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:00.560
Instead of the hard-coded values,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.600
we can ask the double curly braces.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.870
This can be option.size

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.745
with the double quotation just afterwards to signal this is in inches.

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:14.315
We can then remove the price,

00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:18.910
set the double curly braces to be option.price.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.415
Once we save this, we again see that we have a problem with the v bind directive.

00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:28.040
We also need to add this to our second loop two.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.420
Let's add a key.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.605
We also need to add a unique value to these two.

00:05:33.605 --> 00:05:37.130
We only have two items inside of our options array.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.110
Therefore, we can use the arrays index number as a unique key.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.360
We can grab this by adding a second value 12 before loop.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.099
Instead of just adding the option variable,

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:55.160
we can add to the brackets and then add a second value which is for our index number.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.750
Since this is an array,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.820
this will be option zero.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.210
Then option one and so on.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.020
When passing the key as option with the index number.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.470
Save this and now inside the browser we see our nine and 12 inch options.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.785
Well done if you can see the three items on the screen.

00:06:16.785 --> 00:06:19.695
If not, don't worry just go back through.

00:06:19.695 --> 00:06:23.890
Check the code and try again until they get to the stage.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.125
Join me in the next video where we will continue with

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:33.120
the menu components and push the selected pizzas to the shopping baskets.
