00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.555
If you want to read more about Vuex,

00:00:04.555 --> 00:00:06.415
you can head over to the homepage,

00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:09.865
which is vuex dot vuejs dot org.

00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:14.695
But I'm going to jump straight into getting this setup inside of our projects.

00:00:14.695 --> 00:00:19.090
Getting Vuex setup inside of our app is not too difficult.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.355
If we go to the installation,

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.605
just like when we install the router,

00:00:23.605 --> 00:00:29.115
the CDN links available if you prefer but since we use an NPM,

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:32.440
I'm going to install this over inside of the terminal.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.855
Let's open Visual Studio code,

00:00:34.855 --> 00:00:40.075
wants to close down the server and then install the command which is npm i,

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:43.270
and then the package name, which is Vuex.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.570
And then give some moment to install.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.480
Once this is done, we can restart the development server with npm run serve.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.760
We can add this to our files and folders.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.930
Now, they want to say straight away that Vuex does not

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.995
enforce any certain structure to all files and folders.

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:06.110
We are free to handle it exactly how we want.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.100
It is common nodes have one main folder for

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.935
our states inside of the source folder called store.

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:16.215
Let's do this now. Let's go to the source,

00:01:16.215 --> 00:01:20.175
create a new folder, name this store.

00:01:20.175 --> 00:01:23.380
Then inside here we need a main JavaScript file,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.840
which I'm going to call the store dot js.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.405
This will be the main file for our store,

00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:33.685
and it can be any name which you want.

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:37.720
You may also commonly see this called the index dot js.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.710
I'm going to call my new store to distinguish it from any other index files.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.725
Then inside of our store file,

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:51.115
we need to import both Vue and also the Vuex modules,

00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:59.080
so import Vue from Vue and also import Vuex from Vuex.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.860
Then just like when we installed the router,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.484
we can add Vue dot use to make Vuex available in all of our files or modules.

00:02:09.484 --> 00:02:12.755
This next section should also look familiar too,

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:14.530
from when we added the router.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.470
We need to add a new Vuex store,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.420
and also export this so it's available in our files,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.960
so export const store and set this to a new Vuex dot Store,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.000
capital S. Inside here we pass in

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.280
an object and it's inside this object where we can set any initial state.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.450
For example, if you had a game where we updated the player's score,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.850
we could add a state property here for the score and initially set it to zero.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.045
Then one or more components could update the score during the game.

00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:59.130
The other file I want to add too is the main dot js, so let's open this up.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.630
We need to update this into our main file,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.875
just like we did with the router.

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.810
First we need to import the store.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.945
This is named export and the file path is dot slash into the store.

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:18.580
Then the file name which is store too.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.350
Scroll down, we can then register our store inside of our view instance.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.740
Just below the router.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.950
I'm going to add this here, followed by a comma.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.205
And this is our store now registered with Vue,

00:03:33.205 --> 00:03:35.470
back over and install dot js.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.610
I'm going to set things up by adding a initial state objects. Inside here.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.210
All the state object works a bit like the view data property,

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.640
where we can set up our variables and update them from our files.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.270
With this now all set up,

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.055
I'm going to leave this video here.

00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:56.630
As we go through this section.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.075
There will be a lot more files and folders added and the low more added to the stall.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.720
But for now, this is the start setup and registered to be

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.610
used and will begin to access data from our store in the next video.
