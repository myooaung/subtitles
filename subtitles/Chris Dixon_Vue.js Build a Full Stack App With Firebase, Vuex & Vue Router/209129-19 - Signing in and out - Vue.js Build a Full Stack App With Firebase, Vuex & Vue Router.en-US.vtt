00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.785
We enabled our authentication with e-mail and password in the last video.

00:00:05.785 --> 00:00:10.915
This means we need a way to capture the e-mail and password which the user enters,

00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:14.095
and we can easily do this using V-model.

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:19.225
The first step, is to add e-mail and password as a data property.

00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:24.660
So we'll do this inside of our export, setup the data,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.865
and inside we'll return our data as an object without a comma used after the data.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:35.680
We can setup the email initially to be

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.405
an empty string and also the same with the password.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:44.555
We can then use V-model to synchronize this with our form data.

00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:47.675
Let's first go log to our email.

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:50.075
Inside of the form input,

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:57.015
we can add V-model and set this equal to our data property which is going to be email.

00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:00.740
We'll do the same. Just below inside of the password input,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.750
V-model and this time the data property is going to be the password.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.695
We can then scroll down and to finish off the sign-in method,

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:12.230
which we started in the last video.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.025
First of all, I'm going to mark this as a async function.

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:18.260
We can use async await.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.460
We can also add try and catch.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670
We can add error handling,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.950
passing in the error which we'll deal with in just a moment.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.140
Let's begin in the try section where we're going to sign

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.365
in and store the returned users data.

00:01:35.365 --> 00:01:39.760
First of all, let's grab our reference to our firebase authentication.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.735
Therefore, you can access all of the available methods which we need.

00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:45.775
The method which we're going to use is

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:51.200
a Firebase method called sign-in with email and password.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.679
Inside this method we simply pass in our email and password.

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.680
We have this available on the view instance.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.270
We can all access this.email and this.password.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.185
We can also await on the data coming back.

00:02:08.185 --> 00:02:10.680
This is all we need to do for the try section,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.785
let's go down to the catch area to collect any errors.

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:20.600
We're going to access the error object and store the data inside all so variables.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.135
The first one is going to be the error code which is available from error.code.

00:02:28.135 --> 00:02:32.959
The second constant is going to be for the error message,

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.190
and the error message is available from error.message.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.080
After this we're going to display some alerts,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.980
which is going to be for the error messages.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.135
To begin, I'm going to check if the user has entered an incorrect password.

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:54.980
We can do this by checking if the error code is going to be equal to

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.560
a string which is auth/ wrong password.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.595
If it is we can create a custom error.

00:03:05.595 --> 00:03:10.560
So let's create an alert with the screen of wrong password.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.155
If the password is correct,

00:03:15.155 --> 00:03:20.110
we can then create an L-section which is going to catch all of the error messages,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.990
so let's add a second alert with the error message or with the browser,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.430
we can now give this a test.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.025
Scroll down to the bottom of the admin,

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:35.200
and let's open up the console.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.975
We can begin by adding an incorrect password.

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:48.645
Let's add test@test, on the password as test, sign in.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:53.000
We'll get the error message telling us that no user has been found.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.770
Let's try the correct one,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.630
which we added inside a Firebase and an incorrect password, sign in.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.725
We get the message of wrong password which we setup.

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:05.250
Let's try the correct password.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.870
So test them on.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.700
Now we've used the correct email and password,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.410
we don't see any errors.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.020
Later this login component will hide to reveal the admin so the user knows it

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:27.160
was a success along with displaying the logged in user's email and also a sign up button.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.200
This sign up method is a little simpler and this will go inside of the admin component.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.240
Let's add over to the admin.view.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.285
Look at the top of our template we've already created a div for the user area,

00:04:41.285 --> 00:04:43.810
which is the current user wrapper.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.305
Inside it will look like this.

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:49.730
If we open this up, create the span,

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.550
which is going to be the text of logged in as, followed by colon.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.520
Below there's a button with the text of sign out.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.305
This also needs some attributes inside of the opening tag.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.035
This is a type of button,

00:05:08.035 --> 00:05:13.920
a class, BTN red.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.489
We can add a click handler where we are going to prevent the default behavior.

00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:22.970
The method which we're about to create is going to be to sign out.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:30.040
Now we need to access a new Firebase method/ scroll down to our script where we can

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.535
import and we'll off module or impulse

00:05:33.535 --> 00:05:38.195
inside of the curly braces since this was a named export.

00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:46.930
We can import Firebase off and this file path this time is../ and then Firebase.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.765
After our components, we can then create our method.

00:05:50.765 --> 00:05:52.230
So setup our methods,

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.720
and then inside here,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.800
we can create an async function called sign out.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.645
Setup a try and a catch section.

00:06:03.645 --> 00:06:06.460
Passing in the error.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.000
Signing up with Firebase is pretty straightforward.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.965
All we're going to do is await, Firebase off.

00:06:15.965 --> 00:06:20.090
The method which we need to access is sign out.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.584
That's all we need to do inside of the try section.

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:28.280
We can then catch any errors by alerting a message to the user.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.250
I'm going to add this inside of the [inaudible] So you can insert a variable.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.880
Error, signing out followed by a comma,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.065
and insert our variable of error.

00:06:41.065 --> 00:06:44.655
Let's give this a try over in the browser.

00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:47.090
Let's reload and clear the console.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.715
Let's try all of our error messages.

00:06:49.715 --> 00:06:53.140
First of all, a wrong email and password.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.280
We get the message of the user may have been deleted.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.070
We can add the correct email and incorrect password,

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.275
and we get the incorrect message.

00:07:03.275 --> 00:07:06.300
Let's try the correct password,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.380
sign in, we get no error messages. Scroll up to the top.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.680
Now we're logged in, click on sign out.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.690
We don't see any error messages.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.985
So that seems to be working fine.

00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:23.615
Later in the course, we will add some feedback to the user,

00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:26.225
show a new email address when logged in,

00:07:26.225 --> 00:07:29.550
but for now this all seems to be working fine.
