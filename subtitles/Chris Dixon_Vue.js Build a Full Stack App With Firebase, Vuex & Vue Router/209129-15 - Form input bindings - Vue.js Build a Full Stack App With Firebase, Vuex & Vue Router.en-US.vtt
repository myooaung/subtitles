00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.350
With the new pizza form already,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.705
we need a way to add the users data and store it to our view incidence.

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:12.630
We can easily do this by using V-model,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.075
which creates two-way data binding,

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:18.810
and this means that the values of the form inputs will

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.145
billing to the data property until bulky kept in sync.

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:28.515
Let's begin by creating a new pizza objects inside of the data section.

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:32.220
To our new pizza menu file,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.890
I wouldn't go up to our script section,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.935
where we're going to add the data property just after the component's name.

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:45.870
We can return our objects where we're going to add our new pizza objects.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.805
This new pizza object will form a structure

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:53.360
of how our pizza will be saved to the database.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.785
This object will follow the same structure as what we use in the menu W components.

00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:03.235
Let's go over to our menu.view.

00:01:03.235 --> 00:01:09.450
We can go down to get menu items inside of our scripts.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.670
I'm going to copy all of the contents of one of these objects,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.775
so we don't need the surrounding curly braces.

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:22.075
Let's grab the array closing tag all the way up to our pizza name.

00:01:22.075 --> 00:01:27.745
We can copy this and then at this inside of our new pizza objects.

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:31.565
The idea here is to use this as a template.

00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:38.755
I'm going to add EG at the start of the name and also EG at the start of the description.

00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:42.425
The reason for this is because of two-way data binding.

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:45.260
We mentioned two-way data binding before

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.055
and how this data will be linked to our form inputs.

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:51.650
My link list is well formed, it's actually,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.090
we'll see inside of these form inputs will be EG margarita

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.825
and also EG followed by a description which will prompt the user what's typing.

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:04.355
Then, since this is two way,

00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:07.685
when the user types in anything into these inputs,

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:11.425
it will then replace the values inside of this object.

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:15.940
We can then go ahead and push this new pizza at the database.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.290
Let's first set this up using V-model.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.505
We can use this form input fields loop inside our form.

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:26.805
Let's go up. We'll start with the name.

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:28.620
We can add V model.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.790
Then we combine this to our new pizza objects.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.240
Then the field name of name,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.720
I'm going to copy this section and then go down to the description.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.555
Inside of the text area,

00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:46.115
let's paste this in, and assuming new pizza.description.

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:50.980
Here I'm also going to set the initial rose to be a value of five.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.460
When X have the option one section and into the size.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.810
If we go into the inputs,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.280
we can paste this in.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.385
But this time we want to access the new pizza.

00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:06.135
We want to access the options, which is an array.

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:08.730
The first array value is 0,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.505
and we can access the size.

00:03:11.505 --> 00:03:14.010
Next up slope in option 1,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.585
we have the price.

00:03:15.585 --> 00:03:19.940
So many pizza, the options still at

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.905
the index number of zero and this time we want to access the price.

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:29.360
For option 2, we begin with the size.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.070
This is options, but this is the first item in the array.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.075
Just confirm if we go down inside of our array,

00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:43.950
the first item is position 0 and the second item is position 1.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.670
Position1.size. Then for the price,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.390
options born and then price.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.125
Service, new pizza components and we can check the silence over in the browser.

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:03.320
He will see the text of EG margarita,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.600
the description and also the size and prices appearing in the form fields to.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.555
This all seems okay.

00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:13.425
To check the binding is working correctly,

00:04:13.425 --> 00:04:17.435
we can add a click listener to the button down at the bottom,

00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:20.100
which is going to trigger a method.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.575
Down to our bottom,

00:04:22.575 --> 00:04:27.125
we can add a click listener without click and set up

00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:31.535
a method which I'm going to call out down to all view instance.

00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:33.575
After the data property,

00:04:33.575 --> 00:04:36.750
here we can set up all methods.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.275
The method name was odd.

00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:43.050
Inside here for now we can run an alert,

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.020
just with the message of method

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.785
triggered and so we can see the results of our object being updated in real time.

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:53.795
If we go inside of all form,

00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:57.230
we can also output our new pizza inside of

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.330
the double curly braces with this dot new pizza.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.814
Over to the browser.

00:05:03.814 --> 00:05:07.850
We can now see our initial pizza object down at the bottom.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.745
We can then make any changes inside here,

00:05:10.745 --> 00:05:14.740
and we see them reflected immediately inside of our data.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.550
We can also obtain the description.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.304
We can obtain the size.

00:05:20.304 --> 00:05:28.835
Let's try updating both these on the corresponding size and price also changes too.

00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:31.040
Good, what is now all in place?

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.305
Let's now move on to the next section

00:05:33.305 --> 00:05:37.380
where we'll start to work with our Firebase database.
