00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.010
In the last video, we'll move the sign in code from the

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.460
login.view components into our central store.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.785
Now the action is complete.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:13.800
We need to dispatch it from our login components,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.445
passing in the user's email and password for it work.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:23.010
I head over to the login.view component and then scroll down to our sign in method.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.450
The sign up method is currently empty and we're going to begin working on this now.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.305
We can begin by removing the async keyword.

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:34.515
This is because the function is marked as async

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:38.095
in the central store and then inside here,

00:00:38.095 --> 00:00:40.850
we're going to begin by creating a user object

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.910
which is going to store our email and password.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.615
We're going to setup the email from the data property,

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:50.900
which you can access with the store email and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.800
also the password is available from the data property too.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.630
The next thing to do just after our user object is to dispatch in action,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.915
passing in the details as a payload.

00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:07.610
So access I our store which we're going to import in just a minute.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.460
We then need to call the dispatch method,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.565
which is going to take in the name of the action.

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:15.860
The name of the action is signIn,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.585
and then we pass the payload which is our user object.

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:23.465
It's good enough we don't need our firebase reference anymore,

00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:25.860
since you've moved this into a different file.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.460
Put in place, we need to import our store.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.195
The file path as a string is../.

00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:35.960
We need to go into our store,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.855
and then the name of the file is our store.

00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:44.555
Now we need to check this is work in by displaying the value of currentUser in our app.

00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:48.140
Remember currentUser was the name of a piece of state,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.005
which we set of in the store.js.

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:53.510
This is a currentUser which is set to null as

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.729
default and we know from earlier in the section,

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.935
that to get the contents of our states.

00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:00.645
We need to use getters.

00:02:00.645 --> 00:02:03.520
Let's set the server for our currentUser.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.225
Inside of the getter is objects separated by a comma.

00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:12.629
I'm going to call this the currenUser and pass in our function,

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.045
which grabs the currentUser from state.

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:17.900
Now we'll have our getter.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.545
I'm going to add this to a computer property of in the admin.view components,

00:02:23.545 --> 00:02:25.750
so scroll down to JavaScript.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.905
You can now add this inside of the computed section.

00:02:29.905 --> 00:02:33.220
The name of currentUser.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.940
We're going to return the value,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.990
which is from this.$store,

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.565
access the getters object, and the currentUser.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.440
Then inside of our template,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.950
we can output the value anywhere in our code as a test.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.090
I'm going to go up to the log in as section,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.000
and just output this inside of the double curly braces.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.540
See this contexter works by logging in and seeing our user objects.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.290
Let's go over to our admin where we can login.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.280
Scroll down, we're currently not logged in as anybody.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:23.115
Let's log in, using our email and password that was set up inside a firebase, sign in.

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:26.270
Now if we scroll up, we see all of

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.639
the user details which is held for our currentUser inside a firebase,

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.415
but we don't need all of this information inside of our application.

00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:37.250
I'm going to filter this use information down to

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.505
only display the current logged in user's email.

00:03:40.505 --> 00:03:44.180
We can see inside of this object there is an email key

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.540
inside here and to only return this email address,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.235
we can make a small change to our mutation inside of our store.js.

00:03:52.235 --> 00:03:57.330
All you'll to do is to set the currentUser inside of the userStatus.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.995
We're going to set the currentUser to be equal to user.email.

00:04:01.995 --> 00:04:05.500
This will grab the email address from the user objects.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.920
Let's go down and sign in once more,

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.765
click "Sign In," scroll up,

00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:19.030
and now we just have the logged in email address.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.630
We also need to move over the sign out method into the store too,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.295
inside of the admin.view where we have our sign out method.

00:04:28.295 --> 00:04:32.285
We can cut out the contents and move this over to our store.

00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:34.340
So have sign out,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.350
describe all the contents.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.505
We can take this over to our store.js,

00:04:41.505 --> 00:04:43.380
which is going to be an action.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.045
We can add this to stuff the signIn,

00:04:46.045 --> 00:04:49.050
so separated by a comma,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.410
this is called signOut,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.155
which I'm going to add as an async function.

00:04:56.155 --> 00:05:00.640
Once again, we can destructure our commit method and set up the rest of

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.415
our function and then paste in the contents.

00:05:05.415 --> 00:05:07.800
Will again be using this action to commit

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.890
the user's status method and since we are logging out,

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.960
we want the user to be null.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.920
So just after the cut section,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.560
we're going to commit the name of our mutation,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.840
which is the userStatus,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.270
and set the payload to be null.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.955
So now we have our signOut action all now setup,

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:33.470
we can now dispatch this over in the admin.view.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.245
Let's go to our sign up method where we could the contents out before.

00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:42.565
Inside here we're going to access the star which will import in just a moment.

00:05:42.565 --> 00:05:44.095
We can call dispatch.

00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:48.050
On the name of the action we want to dispatch is signOut.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.400
We can then replace our firebase impulse just

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.750
above with our store and the file path is../.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.985
We can access the store folder and then the store file.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:03.790
Save this under to the projects.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.580
We don't see any detail, so let's login.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.400
Scroll up and we have the logged in user email,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.335
click on "Sign Out."

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:21.245
We now see these moves the user email from the screen.

00:06:21.245 --> 00:06:24.530
So our sign up method is now still a work in,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.755
but this time it's placed into our central store.

00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:32.325
We're making good progress with Vue X and also our project.

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:35.210
Vue X can seem a little confusing at first.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.379
It is just something which becomes more clearer with practice.

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.130
You've already seen most of the core concepts of Vue X.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.815
So there is not that much extra to learn.

00:06:45.815 --> 00:06:49.370
Lot of what we cover for the rest of this section is focused

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.670
on simplifying our code and making it more organized.
