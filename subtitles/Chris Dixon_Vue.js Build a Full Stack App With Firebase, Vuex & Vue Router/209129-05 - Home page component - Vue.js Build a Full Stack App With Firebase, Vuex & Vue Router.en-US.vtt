00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.625
Now it's time to add the contents to the homepage component file.

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:09.000
As we can see here from this final finished version,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.235
will be adding the Welcome section,

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:13.185
which is this section just here.

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:18.390
This will link to our Menu when the user clicks on the "Let's Order button."

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.925
If we go back, just below this section we may also have three separate sections,

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.285
which is the order,

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:28.440
delivery info and the history section.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.920
These information blocks are actually

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.945
separate components and this will allow us to reuse them later on.

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:37.355
We can switch between them,

00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:39.815
when we set up the view router.

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:43.100
So for now we're going to leave off these three components,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.430
and just concentrate on this section just here.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.595
Let's head over to the home.vue,

00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:52.900
which is component we've already setup.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.330
We can begin by create in our familiar template and then nested inside here,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.340
I'm going to add two divs.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.640
So the first div is going to be the wrapper.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.985
This is going to be the background wrapper,

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:09.565
which is going to be the surrounding container,

00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:13.015
where we can add a image using CSS,

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:17.110
nested inside here we're going to have a background overlay wrapper,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.925
which is going to be for the box in the center.

00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:27.370
So this first one. Let's add the class of background this is for the image.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:34.160
The second div, this is for the box with the class of background overlay.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.510
So inside of the background overlay,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.240
we're going to start with the level two heading,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.030
which is the text of Welcome to Pizza Planet.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.970
After this, we add our image,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.940
which is the roller image which we just have here.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.920
Let's add the image inside here,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.600
which is the source of../.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.070
This is the Assets folder into the images and the roller.png.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.765
We can also add the alt tags of roller and then followed by the level three heading,

00:02:10.765 --> 00:02:13.820
which is the text of, "Feeling hungry?"

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.200
But now we're just going to add a simple button,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.935
this button will be hooked up later on when we add the vue router.

00:02:26.935 --> 00:02:29.975
So for now we'll just add a h button.

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:38.940
We can add a class for styling of order- btn and the text "Let's order!"

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.140
So this is all the content for our templates.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.180
Just before be move on, we can also add

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.855
our script and inside the script all we are going to do is add

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:54.580
a name for our components inside of the export defaults with the text of home.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.820
Save this file. Just as we did with the header,

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.145
we can nest is inside of the app.vue file and register this Home component.

00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:07.935
Go to the app.vue, let's go down.

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:11.610
We can also import home,

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.865
from our components, which is./ Components and then home.

00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:23.220
We then need to register this by adding this to the components objects.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.810
We can add a component just like we did here,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.455
where we import it by a name such as header

00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:34.850
or another way to do this is to use the name which we use when importing,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.825
so just home and this is fine if there is no naming conflicts with HTML elements.

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:44.315
Just like early on when we did with the header,

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:46.535
this is a HTML element name,

00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:50.290
therefore we had to give this alias of app header.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.545
So now we've got this imported.

00:03:52.545 --> 00:03:54.275
We can go up to the top,

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:57.175
just underneath the app header,

00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:00.720
we can add our home inside here.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.360
H, save this file.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.005
I'm going to check this is showing inside the browser,

00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:09.650
says I have a component now displayed on the homepage.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.935
We will go and add some styling in just a moment.

00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:18.430
For now though, I'm going to remove the white space which is at the top of the app.vue,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.090
so let's scroll down.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.280
We could remove the default styling which is provided where it says about projects.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.615
This now pushes the header back to the top and we can now go all to the Home.vue,

00:04:31.615 --> 00:04:34.115
we can setup our style tags.

00:04:34.115 --> 00:04:39.200
I'm going to remove the scope flag and then begin with our headings.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.180
We scroll up, we have a level two and also a level three heading.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.470
Let's begin with these and type in the h2 and also the

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.665
h3 and add some margin of two percent.

00:04:53.665 --> 00:04:57.275
Just after this, we can then target the background,

00:04:57.275 --> 00:04:59.630
which is the main container.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.675
This is where we're going to add the background image,

00:05:02.675 --> 00:05:05.855
which is going to be, and we'll take a look at the final version,

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.670
this picture, as we see here.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.570
Let's select the background.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.575
First of all, we want to set the image,

00:05:15.575 --> 00:05:18.080
which we can do with the background property,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.340
by setting the URL and then passing in a file path.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.315
The final path we want is./,

00:05:25.315 --> 00:05:28.680
this is the Assets folder Images,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:36.290
and then the image which you want is dough.jpg we can also center this.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.110
Then set the background size to cover.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.599
If we save this and go over to the browser,

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.180
we now have the background image.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.320
I'm going to set the height to be, 30vh.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.555
Which is 30 percent of the vue port or the browser height.

00:05:59.555 --> 00:06:03.280
Set the display type to use the flexbox.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.115
We can align the text into the center.

00:06:08.115 --> 00:06:11.630
Then finally, we can also align our box into the center

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.830
too and we're going to line this vertically using align items,

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.440
this is a flexbox property and we want to set the value to be in the center.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.835
So now we can move on to the actual background overlay,

00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:30.240
which is the text and also the image and the button.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.225
Just below the background.

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:36.390
This is the background overlay.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.560
Where we also want to make use of the display type of flex.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.240
We can set the flex direction to be column,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.700
to stock these vertically.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.815
We also need a background,

00:06:49.815 --> 00:06:52.695
so this is more visible over the background image.

00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:55.410
I'm going to use a value of f1e6da.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:01.875
So we you can still see the background image.

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:06.680
I'm also going to add the positive value of 0.8,

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.530
to make this slightly transparent.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.330
We can to see this just here.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.205
We can control the width.

00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:18.475
I'm going to use a value of 50 percent.

00:07:18.475 --> 00:07:23.190
Center this with margin zero auto.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.505
Some padding inside of five pixels.

00:07:28.505 --> 00:07:31.780
Let's keep the text away from the inner edge.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.365
Okay, so it's all norrow centered.

00:07:34.365 --> 00:07:37.655
We need to reduce the size of this roll image.

00:07:37.655 --> 00:07:40.865
So we're going to get in again inside of the background overlay,

00:07:40.865 --> 00:07:47.725
select the image and we can say that the maximum width to be a value of 15 percent.

00:07:47.725 --> 00:07:50.855
We just now need to push this back into the center.

00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:55.070
We can do this with the flexbox back up in the background overlay.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.605
I set in align items,

00:07:57.605 --> 00:08:00.239
to be in the center.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.550
There we go, and then finally we going to target

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:10.530
the Order button and give this a different background color and also some padding.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.220
So right at the end of our style sheets.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.800
We gave this button the class of order when this call our btn,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.110
which is this class just here.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:26.235
So let's grab this, add this in.

00:08:26.235 --> 00:08:29.190
Let's first start with the background color,

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.290
which is going to be f79f38,

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.855
a border-radius and we want to keep this small,

00:08:39.855 --> 00:08:42.750
so a value of three pixels is fine,

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:49.760
some margin on the bottom of 10 pixels.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.530
Some padding to make the ball in a little bit larger of 10 pixels.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.580
We can then select the cursor to be a pointer.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.760
So save this and head over to the projects.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.935
We now have the background color,

00:09:03.935 --> 00:09:08.600
the border-radius and our cursor is now changing to a pointer.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.745
So this is now our basic homepage setup and displayed in the browser.

00:09:13.745 --> 00:09:16.970
In the next section, we will focus on getting our menu and

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:22.230
our shopping basket all setup to receive data from Firebase.
