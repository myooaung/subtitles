00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.420
When we created our header components,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.985
we added a link to the menu.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.795
This menu component which we are going to now start working on,

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:14.834
will eventually be where we pull in all the menu items from our database.

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:19.065
If we take a look at the final version and head to the menu,

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:22.305
these items will be listed on the left-hand side,

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:25.875
which the user can select which pieces they want to order.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:30.110
They will then be added to the basket of on the right-hand side,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.905
that can also increase or decrease the quantity and then finally place the order.

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:41.290
This order will also be pushed to Firebase and also be available from our admin.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.095
Both the menu items and also the orders will be kept in

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:49.055
sync with a central store two inside of our application,

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:51.355
which we will take a look at later on.

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:57.990
Now let's add the menu.vue components inside of our components folder.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.110
Let's go into the sauce,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.405
inside of the components.

00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:06.340
The menu.vue.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.415
The first part is to create our template,

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:14.335
which will just be a HTML table to display our data.

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:19.960
This table will be used to display our pizzas with the names and options available.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.930
This will just be static information for now until we get working with Firebase later.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.440
To begin, we add our templates,

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.950
then inside we can add a div,

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.060
which is going to have the class of menu on the sky wrapper.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.335
Inside of this div, this is going to have our menu and also the baskets.

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:45.290
For now I'm going to have a comment

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.045
of the menu so we can clearly see which section this is.

00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:55.655
We can then add a div with a class of menu.

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:59.570
Inside of here we're going to have a level three heading,

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.200
which will be the text of authentic handmade pizza,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.285
we’ll then set up our table,

00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:08.750
which will have some sample data in for now.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.645
Level three heading, I'm going to surround this inside of the tilde's,

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:19.690
so authentic handmade pizza.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.910
Then we can set up our table just below.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.025
We are not going to have a table header,

00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:28.325
so I'm just going to jump straight to the table body.

00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:29.840
Inside of the table body,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.395
we’re going to set up free table rows.

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:35.844
The first one is going to be for the pizza title,

00:02:35.844 --> 00:02:38.170
a second row for the description,

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.960
and then a third row which is going to be for the options.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.465
Inside of the first table row,

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:48.820
we can add our table data.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.465
Then inside of the table data,

00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:56.200
I'm going to add these strong tags to make this bold,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.275
and then a pizza name inside of the tilde.

00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:02.420
I'm going to add pepperoni,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.105
followed by a tilde at the end too.

00:03:06.105 --> 00:03:07.975
This is our first row.

00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:11.095
The second one is going to be for the the description.

00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:13.565
Add a new row just below

00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:17.190
the table data and then this is going to be

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.640
the small tags to make this a little bit smaller,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.215
I'm going to add some Lorem Ipsum.

00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:25.930
If you're using Visual Studio Code,

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.750
you can type in the word Lorem and then hit Tab,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.840
or you can add in any sample data you want,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.950
it really doesn't matter since this will be pulled from Firebase very soon.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.195
After this table row,

00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:40.885
let's create one more,

00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:43.340
which is going to be for our options.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.680
Our table data that starts with a nine inch pizza.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.990
Just below, we can also add the price.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.035
I'm going to add 695 followed by a button,

00:03:54.035 --> 00:03:57.960
so td, and then inside here we can add our button,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.660
which will be the plus symbol to add this to our baskets.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.220
The button needs a type of button and also a class for the CSS,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.880
which we once called btn underscore green,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.995
a right plus symbol.

00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:17.690
At the moment we have no way of telling view that we want

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.505
these components to display when we click on the forward slash menu routes.

00:04:22.505 --> 00:04:25.680
Since we don't have a router setup just yet,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.170
as a temporary measure,

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.975
we can add it into the app.view file,

00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:32.720
so we can see it's inside of the browser.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.435
Let's begin by importing this,

00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:37.760
just below the home components.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.075
We want our menu,

00:04:40.075 --> 00:04:42.300
our menu from here.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.985
We can also register this just under the home,

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:50.620
and then add this above inside of our template.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.545
Let's check this out. Over inside of the browser,

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:58.249
so there we go so we have our title,

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:00.410
we have our pizza title,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.390
our description and also the option just below.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.660
This option will be a loop,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.870
so later on when we use the database,

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.565
we’ll look through the available options and show the different sizes and prices.

00:05:13.565 --> 00:05:22.605
I'll just correct the spelling mistake inside of the menu. There we go.

00:05:22.605 --> 00:05:27.320
With this now in place, we can now add some style into our menu components.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.815
Slight head over to the menu.vue.

00:05:29.815 --> 00:05:32.475
We can then scroll down to the bottom.

00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:35.240
We can set up our style tags.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.760
I'm going to leave this as scoped for this component,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.970
so this only applies to this single file rather on the rest of the project.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.635
Let's begin with our level three heading,

00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:49.645
which is the authentic handmade pizza title.

00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:52.890
All we need to do here is to set the text-align,

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.120
its being in the center.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.345
Next open gone to target, the menu wrapper.

00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:03.335
Remember the menu wrapper is going to be the main container.

00:06:03.335 --> 00:06:04.790
It would go up to the top.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.515
This is going to surround our menu and also the baskets.

00:06:09.515 --> 00:06:11.810
If we take a look at the final version,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.110
this is going to mean if we scroll this down,

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.750
that the menu and also the basket will be stacked vertically on a smaller screen,

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.730
then we'll add a media query,

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.310
so these appear side-by-side.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.185
Let's go down and begin this now.

00:06:28.185 --> 00:06:32.720
To do this, we can change the display type to be flexbox,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.430
and then on the smaller screen we can set the flex direction to be column.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.875
We'll add a media query changes back to row very soon.

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:45.020
Lets also target the menu,

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.000
which is the left-hand side.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.615
I'm going to set the background color to be a value of F1,

00:06:52.615 --> 00:06:57.995
E6, DA, a border radius,

00:06:57.995 --> 00:07:00.640
which is going to be three pixels.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.695
We can also make this the full height of the browser by sending it to be a 100 vh.

00:07:06.695 --> 00:07:10.625
At the moment, it looks pretty small because we want to get one item,

00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:15.355
but we can make this see full height to the browser even without the content.

00:07:15.355 --> 00:07:21.070
This has to be height property to be 100 vh,

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.759
some margin of ten pixels, add some spacing,

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.715
and also some padding of ten pixels,

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:30.995
the inside of the menu.

00:07:30.995 --> 00:07:35.800
Save this, scroll down and there's our menu.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:41.915
Now we just need to add a media query to make this a row on the larger greens.

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:43.730
Still within the style tags,

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.040
we can add the media query,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:54.610
which is going to target the screens which are a minimum width of 900 pixels.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.985
Then all we want to do here is to grab the menu wrapper,

00:07:58.985 --> 00:08:00.530
which we have here.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:07.290
Then I change the flux direction to below and also add some space in between,

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:13.230
so the flex direction changes to row.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:19.015
We can then also justify the contents to be space between.

00:08:19.015 --> 00:08:23.330
This also means that later on when we also have our baskets,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.235
we’ll also have some space in between the menu and the basket sections.

00:08:28.235 --> 00:08:31.940
On this larger screen, we also need to set the menu to be

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.860
a certain width so it doesn't span the full width of the browser.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:46.520
We can do this by targeting the menu class and then set the width to be a value of 65 Vw.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.865
I've got back over to our projects.

00:08:49.865 --> 00:08:54.845
We now see that we have some space over on the right-hand side for all baskets.

00:08:54.845 --> 00:08:57.145
If we shrink this down,

00:08:57.145 --> 00:09:00.300
this will now be the full width of the browser.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.555
Then this and also the basket later on will be stacked vertically.

00:09:05.555 --> 00:09:09.520
Okay, so this table looks now how we want it to,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.975
but we do need to set things up to loop through a menu with multiple items.

00:09:13.975 --> 00:09:16.790
We’ll do this in the next video where we will add

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:21.240
an object to display more items into our table.
