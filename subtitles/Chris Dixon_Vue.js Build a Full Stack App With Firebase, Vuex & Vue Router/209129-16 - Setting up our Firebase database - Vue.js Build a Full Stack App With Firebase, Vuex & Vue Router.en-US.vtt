00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.265
With the NewPizza data now being successfully captured,

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:09.210
we now need to set up our database to store this information.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.140
I'm going to be using Firebase for the project's backend,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.935
and in particular the latest Firestall database.

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:20.910
We will also soon make use of a package called Vivax fire,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.485
to keep our project data in sync with this database too.

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:28.170
Also later on in the course,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.650
we can also use the Firebase authentication facility,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.140
to make sure only login admin users can access certain data.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.090
Let's begin head over to firebase.google.com.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.015
If you don't have an account,

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:48.170
you will need to sign up and then head over to the console.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.180
Inside of the console,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.715
we can now create a new project.

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:55.730
I'm going to add a new project here,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.720
and call mine Pizza Planet.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.060
Click on "Continue".

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.250
I'm not currently going to enable Google Analytics,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.615
so I'm going to create a new project,

00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:10.650
and just give this a few moments to go ahead and create.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.230
Once it's done, click on "Continue" and you should be

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.185
taken to a page which looks similar to this.

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:22.095
We're going to be using the Cloud Firestore as our backend.

00:01:22.095 --> 00:01:25.775
You can either click on this section here to create the database,

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:28.270
or click on the option in the menu.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.920
This is going to get us started with a new database to our Pizza Planet project.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.095
Click on "Create".

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.960
Before we create this, we have two options.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.639
We have the production mode,

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:42.800
where the data is more secure,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.140
but we can start in the test mode,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.895
which will allow our database to be kept open for reading and writing data.

00:01:49.895 --> 00:01:53.845
We'll come back to this later and change our security rules.

00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:57.090
Then click on "Next" inside the test mode.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.500
We can complete this and finalize our datastore.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.815
Once this is done, we then taking it to our database home section,

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:12.445
and very soon this is where all of our data in our database will appear.

00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:16.645
We can also manually add a collection too if we wanted.

00:02:16.645 --> 00:02:19.165
A collection is a group of data,

00:02:19.165 --> 00:02:22.625
which will be our orders and also our menu.

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:26.350
I'm going to click on "Cancel" since we are going to be pushing

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.770
data from our project rather than adding this in manually.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.025
To add this database to our project,

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:36.640
we need to access our Firebase settings,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.770
which we grab from the sidebar,

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.120
and then project overview.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.365
We're of course using Firebase on a web project,

00:02:44.365 --> 00:02:47.500
so click on the web icon just here.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.255
We can then register our app.

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:56.890
I want to call mine Pizza Planet. We can register.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.609
This will give us access to our configuration settings,

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.070
which needs to add to our project.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.315
I'm going to copy all of the concerns from the config option,

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:09.860
so the API key,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.885
right down to the App ID.

00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:15.790
Let's grab this, go over to the project.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.560
Inside the terminal we're going to begin by closing this

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.145
down and installing in Firebase as an NPM package.

00:03:22.145 --> 00:03:24.485
We can do this with NPM I,

00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:27.010
on the Firebase package name.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.245
While this is setting up,

00:03:29.245 --> 00:03:32.860
we can then create a new file in the root of our source.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.720
Let's go inside of the source,

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.230
inside of the sidebar, create a new file.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.930
This can be called the firebase.js,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.315
and it's going to be inside of this file where we can add our configuration.

00:03:46.315 --> 00:03:53.120
Let's start by importing our Firebase package from firebase/app.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.000
As a second import,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.484
we're also going to be importing our firestore,

00:03:59.484 --> 00:04:02.690
which is available from firebase/firestore.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.265
If you've used Firebase in the past and just simply imported Firebase,

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:11.970
the more modern versions of Firebase,

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.600
do allow you to select various packages,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.265
such as the firestore,

00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:19.805
will also later on be importing the authentication.

00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:22.625
These all split up into separate modules.

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:25.090
Let's make these file sizes smaller.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.625
We can then set up our constants,

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:29.600
for our config option.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.670
This is going to be an object,

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.245
where we can paste in these settings,

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:35.770
which we just grabbed from Firebase.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.315
Just after this, we can grab our Firebase variable,

00:04:40.315 --> 00:04:44.330
and then use a method which is called initialize App.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.110
To initialize our App,

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.909
we also need to pass in the configuration options.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.305
After this, we can also create a second constant,

00:04:54.305 --> 00:04:55.915
which is called DB,

00:04:55.915 --> 00:05:00.840
and this is going to be a shortcut to our firebase.firestore.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.269
With a need to create a database reference,

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:07.325
I'm going to export this reference,

00:05:07.325 --> 00:05:09.145
so we can use it elsewhere.

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:14.645
We can export a constant called, dbMenuRef.

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:21.470
This is going to be a reference or a shortcut to all menu collection inside all database.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.280
The shortcut is going to be a linked to our database,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.995
and then pass in the collection name,

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.260
which is going to be menu.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.585
This menu folder will be created for us when adding the first pizza,

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.730
if it doesn't already exist.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.485
So we don't need to go to Firebase and manually add this inside the console.

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:45.875
Now all we need to do inside of any components,

00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:48.905
is to import this dbMenuRef.

00:05:48.905 --> 00:05:52.550
Then we can call any of the Firebase methods we need,

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.080
to save the menu item,

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.950
remove, update, or delete.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.870
Save this file and let's go back over to the NewPizza.vue file.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.875
We need to import this reference inside of our scripts.

00:06:05.875 --> 00:06:08.735
I'm going to do this inside of the curly braces,

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:10.925
since this is a named export.

00:06:10.925 --> 00:06:15.300
So dbMenuRef.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.265
We can import this from the file path of../,

00:06:20.265 --> 00:06:22.770
and our firebase file.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.055
At the moment, if we go over to our project,

00:06:26.055 --> 00:06:28.165
when we click on the "Add" button,

00:06:28.165 --> 00:06:31.120
we trigger an alert inside of the browser.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.630
But instead we can now use this menu reference and use

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.695
a Firebase method called art to push our NewPizza to Firebase.

00:06:39.695 --> 00:06:43.075
Let's scroll down and replace our alerts,

00:06:43.075 --> 00:06:46.105
by accessing the dbMenuRef.

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:48.835
Access the Firebase add method,

00:06:48.835 --> 00:06:52.600
where we are going to push this.newPizza.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.815
We need to restart our server,

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:58.810
with NPM run serve.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.275
Over to the admin inside of our project,

00:07:08.275 --> 00:07:10.015
and change the name.

00:07:10.015 --> 00:07:12.160
I'm going to add a Pepperoni.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.080
We can also change the description,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.165
[inaudible] mozzarella and pepperoni.

00:07:18.165 --> 00:07:20.775
Let's also alter the prices,

00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:24.030
so seven, and let's make this 11.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.930
Click on the "Add" button,

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.350
over to our database and heads over to the database link.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:36.560
We now see our menu collection has automatically being created for us.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.595
Inside here we have one document.

00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:41.700
This is the document's ID,

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.630
and then all the information from our form.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.450
We have our two options as an array,

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.815
with the updated name and description.

00:07:50.815 --> 00:07:53.885
Hopefully this has all worked for you too.

00:07:53.885 --> 00:07:56.945
If not, do go back and check the code,

00:07:56.945 --> 00:08:00.385
it is usually something as simple as a typing error.

00:08:00.385 --> 00:08:03.110
If you can see this in the database however,

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.660
you are now good to move on to the next video.
