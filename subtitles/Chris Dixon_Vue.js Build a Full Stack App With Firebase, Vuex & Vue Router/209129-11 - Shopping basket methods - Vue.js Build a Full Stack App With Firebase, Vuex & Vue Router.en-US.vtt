00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.705
We now have a shopping basket displaying the pizzas which the user selects.

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:11.460
There is some extra functionality and I want to add it to improve this.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.195
First we can get the plus and minus buttons working,

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:18.570
so we can change the quantity of each item.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.150
Also related to this,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.210
when the quantity is reduced to zero,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.525
we want this item to be removed from the basket.

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:30.590
Let's begin by setting up the methods to change

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.985
the quantity back over in the menu of the components.

00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:39.770
We need to begin by adding some click handlers to these two buttons.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.264
Let's scroll up and take a look for our two buttons,

00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:46.250
which is this section just here.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.275
The first thing we need to do is to add a click handler for the minus button.

00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:57.990
So we can add @click and set this equal to a method called decrease quantity.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.370
When decreasing this quantity,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.950
we also need to know which item we're reducing so we can pass in the item.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.600
The plus button just below.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.580
This is going to work in a similar way.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.049
This takes a click handler where we are going to increase the quantity.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.645
Also passing in the item we want to increase.

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:28.240
Now let's scroll down to our script where we can create our methods.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.470
So let's take a look for these.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.210
Just below our data,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.340
locate the end of our add to basket method, which is her.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.060
The first one I'm going to add increaseQuantity,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.575
which we'll receive the item past to it.

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:49.435
Increasing the item is pretty straightforward.

00:01:49.435 --> 00:01:51.710
All we want to do is to select the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.750
item.quantity and increase the value by one with plus, plus.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.109
I'm going to copy this at a comma where you can setup decrease quantity.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.995
All we need to do for this is to change to negative, and then we're good to go.

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.575
Save and then over to the browser.

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:15.640
Let's add some items inside a here.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.915
So first of all, we have one pepperoni.

00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:23.500
We can increase this and the quantity is increased along with the price.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.960
Let's try deducting this and then taking this zero.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.980
If we keep going, we get a negative value.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.010
Of course, this is not something which we want.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.375
So we can fix this by creating a method to remove the item when the quantity is zero.

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:42.890
So head over to our methods.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.870
I'm going to create a new method inside here called removeFromBasket.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.120
This is also going to take in the item which you want to remove.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.250
We can use the JavaScript splice method to remove the item from our array.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.670
We can select this.basket,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.485
which is our array.

00:03:04.485 --> 00:03:07.860
We can call the JavaScript splice method.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.100
Inside of the parentheses,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.485
we can add two parameters.

00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:17.360
The first is the index position of the item we want to remove.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:25.730
So we can grab this with this.baskets.indexOf where we are going to pass in our item.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.605
So this will find the index position of our item in the array.

00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:34.910
The second parameter is the number of items we want to remove.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.135
We only want to remove one.

00:03:37.135 --> 00:03:38.955
For these methods work.

00:03:38.955 --> 00:03:42.500
First, we need to call it when the item quantity is zero.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.275
Under this can be added in need decrease quantity method. Let's go down.

00:03:48.275 --> 00:03:57.445
We can set to buy if statement to check if the item.quantity is equal to zero.

00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:01.745
If it is, we want to call our remove from basket method,

00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:05.190
which takes in the individual item.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.120
Give this to save over to the browser and we can add some items.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.300
Start by removing the pepperoni,

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.070
the ham and pineapple.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.490
This is all now working fine.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.515
We still have the place all the button to why group two,

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.285
which is down at the bottom.

00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:32.970
But we can look at this later when we begin to work with Firebase and data stores.
