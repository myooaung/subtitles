00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.260
All of the navigations we've performed so far,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.670
have been a result of using

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.380
the router link component to take us to the path which we specify.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.230
There is also an alternative way of doing this,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.790
however, by using code to navigate programmatically.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.810
If we go over to the home.vue components,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.555
inside the components folder,

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:30.360
we added a button on line seven here to take the user to the menu.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.105
We've not yet added any links to this button yet.

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:36.555
But we can also use the router to push to any location.

00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:42.395
I'm going to begin by adding a click listener to this button inside of the opening tag.

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:44.120
So use [inaudible] click.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.145
I'm now going to use this to figure a method which I'm going to call Go To Menu.

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:51.870
Scroll down to our script.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.450
Then we can set this up just after our name property.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.230
We can set up our methods and our method name of Go To Menu.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.530
We can access any method which has been provided with the vue router inside of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.720
this vue instance using this.$ router.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.200
Remember anything prefix with this $ indicates that this is native to vue.js,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.395
or in this case the router package rather than a custom method we have created ourselves.

00:01:25.395 --> 00:01:30.470
Here we can take a look at some of the navigation methods provided by the router.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.830
Vue router gives us the option of navigating back or

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.450
forward by accessing the browser's history.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.650
It does this weird router.go,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.820
and this is the first method which we are going to look at.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.115
This takes in a single argument to declare how many pages we want to move.

00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:54.350
Positive numbers will move the pages forward in the browser's history.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.495
Negative numbers, will go back one page in the browser.

00:01:58.495 --> 00:02:01.895
We can test this by going over to our application.

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:03.820
So give this a save.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.295
Let's click on the "Menu," and let's click on "Home."

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:10.900
Now if we click on the left sided button,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.105
it should take us back one page which was to the menu.

00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:18.110
Let's try this one more. If we go to the about link and then home,

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.650
click on this button it should take us back to the About Page.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.530
This number can also be more than one too,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.510
if you have a use case for this.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.370
Another method which is available on the router is router.replace.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.965
This is used to replace the current URL with the one which we add inside these brackets.

00:02:39.965 --> 00:02:42.830
So if we wanted to go to the menu,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.155
we could add a string of forward slash menu, over to the browser.

00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:53.820
Let's go to the Contact Us, then to "Home."

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.980
Click on the button. This then pushes us to the menu page.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.950
Or just like we looked at in the last video.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.850
We could also pass in an object and using named routes by passing the name property.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.485
Then our menu link,

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:12.645
which we setup. Let's give this a go.

00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:17.850
Contacts, home and this still pushes us to the menu.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.035
However, there is one potential drawback when

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:24.710
using this replace method. I will show you now.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.690
If we go for example,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.665
to the About Page and then click on "Home," click on the "Let's Order" button.

00:03:33.665 --> 00:03:37.205
If we then navigate back using the browser's back button,

00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:38.810
this then takes us back to

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.180
the About Us Page rather than the homepage which was the previous components.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.705
The reason this happens is as the name suggests,

00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:51.355
the browsing history is replaced rather than added to.

00:03:51.355 --> 00:03:54.380
If we want this link, we are going to be added to

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.880
the browser's history so we can use the back buttons in this way.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.345
There is another method available to us called router.push.

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:05.855
This is also used to navigate to a different URL.

00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:08.450
But the difference is the routes and are pushed onto

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.645
the browsing history rather than replaced.

00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:16.885
Let's give this a go. Changes to be push.

00:04:16.885 --> 00:04:20.265
We'll do the same as before, we'll go to About,

00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:23.570
to Home, click on the button,

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.255
which takes us to the menu.

00:04:25.255 --> 00:04:26.965
Now if we go back,

00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:31.120
we're now take into the home component rather than the About Page.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.400
Both of these ways are fine to use, but of course,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.850
it depends on the behavior which you want to achieve inside of your app.
