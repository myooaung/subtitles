Hello, and welcome to this course on JSON fundamentals in Java.

2
00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:07,225
I'm your host, Richard Warburton.

3
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:12,585
I hope you're as excited to be watching this course as I am to be producing it.

4
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:16,724
Now this is the first module, which is entitled, What is JSON?

5
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:19,378
Now just to make sure that you're in the right place,

6
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:25,034
I should say that I'm not talking about the actor who played George on Seinfeld,

7
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:27,990
the guy who played Marshall Eriksen in How I Met Your Mother,

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,137
or even the guy in Arrested Development.

9
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:33,463
We're not answering the question who is Jason.

10
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:37,135
Where answering the question what is JSON.

11
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:42,268
Now JSON is an acronym and it stands for JavaScript Object

12
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:46,997
Notation as it provides a language independent and human

13
00:00:46,997 --> 00:00:49,128
readable data interchange format.

14
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:52,863
Now even though it originates from the JavaScript ecosystem,

15
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:56,483
JSON can be used for interchanging data between different

16
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:58,273
languages that aren't just JavaScript.

17
00:00:58,273 --> 00:01:02,236
A particularly popular use case from the point of view of Java developers,

18
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:06,130
sending or receiving data between a Java server or a JavaScript web client.

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,381
Now were going to break out what I think are the three biggest

20
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:20,000
use cases for JSON within the Java world so that it's clear whether and why you should be using JSON.
