1
00:00:01,773 --> 00:00:05,462
Finally, let's talk about when we should use this style of API.

2
00:00:05,462 --> 00:00:10,660
So in this course, we'll be covering three styles of API, DOM, binding, and SAX.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,382
So it's important to understand when we would want to

4
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:16,472
use DOM rather than binding or SAX.

5
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:17,838
Now, in my experience,

6
00:00:17,838 --> 00:00:21,937
there are two key use cases where a DOM API shines through.

7
00:00:21,937 --> 00:00:25,049
The first is when you're integrating with unstable APIs

8
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:28,686
where the API will change relatively frequently and your

9
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:30,851
parsing requests from this API.

10
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:32,988
The second is API evolution,

11
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:36,667
where you have to support JSON payloads and different

12
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,386
client versions connect to you.

13
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:39,131
For example,

14
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:42,111
suppose you've got different Android clients who are

15
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:44,894
sending you JSON requests and some of those people aren't

16
00:00:44,894 --> 00:00:48,532
updating their Android app version, but you still have to make sure it works.

17
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:50,226
Now in both of these cases,

18
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:53,534
the DOM API takes the work out of parsing whilst giving you

19
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:56,560
the flexibility to inspect the object graph and only pick out

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,201
the information that you need.

21
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:00,464
So it's very, very useful in that regard.

22
00:01:00,464 --> 00:01:01,345
Now, finally,

23
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:06,519
it's worth saying that whilst DOM APIs are very nice APIs to use

24
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,307
for parsing and working with generic documents,

25
00:01:08,307 --> 00:01:09,547
it's not the only choice.

26
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:10,540
In the next section,

27
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,013
we'll talk about the binding API and that's better

28
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:23,000
for regular simple applications. So I would say don't say with a DOM API, start with a binding API.
