1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,444
So, what does PMO stand for?

2
00:00:03,444 --> 00:00:06,394
Well, when you find out, let me know.

3
00:00:06,394 --> 00:00:11,424
Okay, I'm kidding, but this abbreviation seems to be misinterpreted by many.

4
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:15,374
I will give you a quick definition of the PMO,

5
00:00:15,374 --> 00:00:19,374
but we'll go into much more detail in the remaining modules.

6
00:00:19,374 --> 00:00:23,404
At a high level, the PMO is an organizational structure.

7
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:27,374
Sometimes, PMO refers to the project management office,

8
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:30,057
so, in a nutshell, responsible for the management of projects,

9
00:00:30,057 --> 00:00:34,454
and the processes by which they follow to manage those projects.

10
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:38,424
Next, program management office, which is responsible,

11
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:41,434
you guessed it, for the management of programs.

12
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:46,404
Now, think of programs as a container for multiple projects.

13
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:49,424
And, lastly, like I mentioned in the previous slide,

14
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,414
portfolio management office,

15
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:54,444
and that's responsible for the management of portfolios,

16
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:58,424
which is typically a container for one or more initiatives

17
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:01,404
further containing programs and projects.

18
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:06,605
These organizational structures are very important to the success

19
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:09,454
of demand and work management best practices,

20
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:11,374
very important.

21
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:20,000
As I stated, we will go into much more detail in the remaining modules. Okay, now let's summarize this module.
