1
00:00:01,546 --> 00:00:06,536
Because there's no widely agreed on skill set for management practices in IT,

2
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:09,526
good managers come in all shapes and sizes.

3
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:13,506
There's an assumption everyone knows just how to do it.

4
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:15,586
This is like giving my daughter, who's never driven before,

5
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:19,070
keys to a car and told, "Well, drive.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,735
" So,

7
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:22,219
to help mitigate the challenges you may have and to

8
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:26,516
save you time from trial and error, this course may be for you.

9
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:29,516
So here are the objectives for this course.

10
00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:33,940
To understand and appreciate the difference between demand and

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,546
work management processes and their benefits.

12
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:39,536
To learn or improve your planning skills.

13
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:43,536
To learn and improve approaches and tools for demand

14
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:45,516
and work management processes.

15
00:00:45,516 --> 00:00:48,586
To learn and improve your management practices and skills.

16
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:51,556
To help you use resources more effectively.

17
00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:54,546
Your managers will love this about you.

18
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:57,506
And to enhance your career potential.

19
00:00:57,506 --> 00:01:04,536
There is a strong demand for IT managers with the skills in this course.

20
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:07,536
Here are a few more course objectives.

21
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:10,506
To more easily prioritize your work.

22
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:12,546
If you can't do this well, you will struggle.

23
00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:15,755
You will likely get work from all over the map and be told

24
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:18,506
they are all number one in priority.

25
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:21,219
This course will help you get a handle on this and enable you to

26
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:25,506
present options to your management in a constructive way.

27
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:27,546
Align your work to the business.

28
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,944
I have seen so many times that people are working on things and they

29
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:34,506
haven't a clue how it pertains or helps the business.

30
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:40,566
All work, all work that you do should map up to the company's business goals.

31
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,526
Be more effective.

32
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:45,516
We all want to be effective, be contributors,

33
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:47,576
and just plain do good productive work.

34
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:50,526
I will help you do that.

35
00:01:50,526 --> 00:01:53,556
Lastly, to reduce your stress and anxiety.

36
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:57,566
This course will provide a necessary demand and work management skills,

37
00:01:57,566 --> 00:02:04,332
approaches, tools, and techniques, to enable you to transition from a chaotic,

38
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,059
unstructured environment to a well-managed,

39
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:10,516
organized, and less stressful environment.

40
00:02:10,516 --> 00:02:15,556
Okay, now let's see why businesses need people like you.

41
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:19,349
Businesses and companies everywhere need people with the skills

42
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,596
and knowledge you will learn in this course.

43
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:25,526
They need those who understand demand management.

44
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:28,556
They need those who understand work management.

45
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:34,526
They need those who can use your company's resources in the most effective way.

46
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:37,596
To do this well, you need keen insights into your company,

47
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:41,566
its business and strategy, the team, the talent,

48
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:43,546
and what they can and can't do.

49
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:47,576
They need those who can provide real leadership and insight.

50
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:51,596
I believe these talents can tie directly to salary growth.

51
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:55,193
People in the role of demand and work management can

52
00:02:55,193 --> 00:03:06,000
command very high salaries indeed. Now let me give you a quick overview of the difference between demand and work.
