1
00:00:01,036 --> 00:00:04,946
Project work management and PMO.

2
00:00:04,946 --> 00:00:07,014
This section will define what activities make up

3
00:00:07,014 --> 00:00:13,966
project work management and the PMO, the Project Management Office.

4
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:15,976
Are your projects successful?

5
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:20,006
62% is the industry-wide success rate of projects.

6
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:22,946
That is barely two-thirds of all projects.

7
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:24,986
That's not very good when you think about it.

8
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:27,956
There are lots of reasons why projects may fail.

9
00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:31,026
Fuzzy goals, poor requirements, inaccurate estimates,

10
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:34,946
weak ownership or sponsorship, lack of governance,

11
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:37,026
ineffective project managers, to name a few.

12
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:38,956
What are my thoughts?

13
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,026
If you don't have a process, an approach,

14
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:43,946
governance, and some structure,

15
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:46,618
your projects will either fail or be only partially

16
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:48,996
successful and you won't get your money's worth.

17
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:52,006
This module will help you improve your success rate.

18
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:56,557
Now let's look at some key requirements of a solid

19
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,946
project work management environment.

20
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:03,986
Here are the minimal requirements you need for good project work management.

21
00:01:03,986 --> 00:01:06,986
You need an organizational structure for projects.

22
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:10,966
We call that the Project Management Office or PMO,

23
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:12,986
and we'll have more on that on the next slide.

24
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:15,946
You need project management process.

25
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:19,976
That is the work management processes for projects and it's

26
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:22,946
the discipline known as project management.

27
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:25,646
And we will be covering the processes of project

28
00:01:25,646 --> 00:01:26,996
management in this module as well.

29
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:30,153
The project management process must support the demand

30
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:32,946
for large tickets from Operations,

31
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:35,302
where we determine that from the demand process side that

32
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:38,592
work that meets a certain threshold would be deemed a

33
00:01:38,592 --> 00:01:40,956
project and not handled by Operations.

34
00:01:40,956 --> 00:01:44,157
We do this to ensure that the best practices of work management are

35
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:47,976
applied to ensure the proper uses of company resources.

36
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:51,880
It must also support initiatives which drives strategic projects as

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,006
well as projects that are directed by management.

38
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:59,209
These are the projects that aren't from Ops and aren't from initiatives and

39
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:02,956
basically just show up based on a management directive.

40
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,001
You need experienced project managers especially for

41
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:09,006
resource intensive and critical projects.

42
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:12,636
You may also need dedicated project managers that are

43
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:16,288
available to work only on one project and not be diluted

44
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:17,966
by working on multiple projects.

45
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:21,778
And also you need a pool of project managers to handle

46
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:23,971
several projects concurrently within reason,

47
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:24,946
of course.

48
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:28,996
Next, execute and deliver to actually get things done.

49
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:32,633
If people are assigned to be a project manager and also

50
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,966
have a full time job making widgets,

51
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:37,996
then it is unlikely that they'll get everything done.

52
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:38,375
Now,

53
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:42,626
let's dig deeper as to the responsibilities of the Project Management

54
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:47,956
Office and how we might structure the organization.

55
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:52,016
Here are the key responsibilities of the Project Management Office.

56
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:56,396
Project demand management so they need to manage project demand,

57
00:02:56,396 --> 00:03:01,397
planning and prioritization so the PMO performs the demand management side as

58
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:04,966
well as the other key project implementation responsibilities.

59
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:08,501
Execute the project on time and on budget but this also means

60
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:12,006
assigning the project manager and resources and a variety of

61
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:13,026
other supporting activities.

62
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,946
Define and maintain standards metrics and process

63
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,956
for the running of the projects.

64
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:19,409
That is,

65
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:22,481
what is the status of each project as well as what is the

66
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:24,986
aggregate status of all the projects within this PMO.

67
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:28,946
Perform cross-functional reporting and communication.

68
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:31,006
Now communication is so important.

69
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:35,269
The PMO must report out to senior management about the backlog,

70
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:36,966
the projects and work,

71
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:40,956
the issues with the project's schedules and budgets and so much more.

72
00:03:40,956 --> 00:03:42,061
So you can see,

73
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:44,859
a PMO is typically structured to handle both the

74
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,016
demand and work management activities.

75
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:54,006
Now let's see how we might organize a PMO office within an organization.

76
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:57,976
Here is an example of an organizational structure with a PMO in it.

77
00:03:57,976 --> 00:03:59,036
First we have a business domain.

78
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:03,006
I'm going to call that Ad Sales System and it's run by a vice president.

79
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:07,150
He has multiple Operations and this is just an example of one with a

80
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,976
manager and a team but also he has the PMO office.

81
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:14,021
This PMO office has the responsibility for all the projects

82
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,996
within this business domain of Ad Sales System.

83
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:20,622
And under this PMO are three projects that are

84
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:24,986
running right now all led by a PM, all having their project teams.

85
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:27,016
But also there's a small staff within the PMO,

86
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:31,016
remember, doing the demand management, deciding which projects to select,

87
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:34,036
coming up with the metrics and how to measure the success of the projects,

88
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:37,026
documentation and how to pick the good PMs,

89
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:41,986
how to hire all those things around running of the projects.

90
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:42,210
Now,

91
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,124
let's make sure we're on the same page with regards to

92
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:52,000
defining what a project is and the role of a project manager in the next couple sections.
