1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,074
In this section we will define just what a project is or

2
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:09,547
what our project should be so we are on the same page as

3
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:12,839
we work through this module.

4
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,929
Here is a basic definition of a project.

5
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:21,380
A project is a temporary group activity designed to produce a unique product,

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,869
service or result.

7
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:24,849
Now, notice these keywords.

8
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:27,919
Temporary implies a start and an end.

9
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:32,849
Group implies more than one person, usually a team.

10
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:33,718
And unique,

11
00:00:33,718 --> 00:00:37,384
a project is something special and not normal for

12
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:38,879
the current business Operations.

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,879
Now, here is another way of looking at the definition of a project.

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,102
Because activities can have a significant impact on the business,

15
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:51,909
the construct of a project was created.

16
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:55,305
So it is important to have a disciplined approach to

17
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:59,250
certain kinds of work in order to provide focus and

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,919
visibility to the success of the business.

19
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:06,929
That is why I have separated out Operations to focus on that type of activity

20
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:11,839
and in this module we are focusing on the project activity.

21
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:15,859
And lastly, in the next module, we will focus on initiative activities.

22
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,909
Now let's check out the attributes of a project.

23
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,929
So why are certain activities labeled projects?

24
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:28,849
Well, they have certain attributes or characteristics and let's discuss a few.

25
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:29,869
Criticality.

26
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:31,839
When work is critical to the business,

27
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:33,869
it is recommended that you make it a project.

28
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:34,899
Focus.

29
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:39,849
When work has a project, the business can provide better focus to that activity.

30
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,899
When work is critical and there is focus, you also need visibility.

31
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:47,583
Visibility is when the project's outcomes are being reported to

32
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,869
managers and leaders of the organization.

33
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:53,889
A project is unique in that it is not normally a routine operation.

34
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:56,929
In fact, the activity may not have been done before at all,

35
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:01,364
so a project is a specific set of activities designed to

36
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:03,839
accomplish a singular unique goal.

37
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:04,839
But that's not all.

38
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:07,839
Now, let's talk about a few more attributes.

39
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:10,859
Here are a few more attributes or characteristics of a project.

40
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:12,889
A project has a defined scope.

41
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:17,079
Project scope is the part of project planning that involves determining

42
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:21,276
and documenting a list of specific project goals,

43
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:23,399
deliverables, features, functions, tasks,

44
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:25,849
deadlines and ultimately cost.

45
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,670
In a nutshell scope's what needs to be achieved and the work

46
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,859
that must be done to deliver its outcome.

47
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:35,879
Yes, I know, the scope keeps changing, known as scope creep.

48
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,234
But there is still scope and hopefully a change management process to

49
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:42,869
manage the changes in scope and to set expectations.

50
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:46,899
That is why project managers are so critical to the success of projects

51
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:49,889
and we will discuss their role in the next section.

52
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:53,889
Projects have a specific start date and when completed, there's an end date.

53
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:55,849
Projects are not Operations.

54
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,869
They start and they end.

55
00:02:57,869 --> 00:03:03,339
Resources, a project has resources provided by management such as people,

56
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:04,839
money, equipment, etc.

57
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:05,919
to sustain the project.

58
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,839
And lastly, closure.

59
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:09,909
This is very important.

60
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:12,869
This term represents the end of the project.

61
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:15,929
Some closure activities are to secure client acceptance,

62
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,879
transition results from the project to Operations,

63
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,899
capture lessons learned, close out any contractual and business matters,

64
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:26,869
and hopefully, celebrate your success.

65
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:30,889
Now let me give you some examples of projects.

66
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:34,859
I am sure you are all familiar with projects but here are some examples.

67
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:38,859
Implementing a ticketing system to streamline our Helpdesk workload.

68
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:41,869
The migration of a company's applications to the cloud.

69
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:42,929
Maybe you are migrating from an old,

70
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:46,869
internal on-premise system to a cloud-based system.

71
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:49,909
Adding a new module component to your existing web application.

72
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:52,909
Maybe it is to enhance the sales order web-based system

73
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:55,839
with a mobile order status module.

74
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:59,839
Upgrade to a new CAD that is a new computer-aided design system.

75
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,849
This may require new hardware, network, software licenses,

76
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,919
configuration, customer integration, training,

77
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,909
and a myriad of other actions.

78
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:09,849
Remember, projects, to be successful,

79
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:13,859
must be formally managed to deliver on time and on budget results.

80
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:15,839
Now think of your own environment.

81
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,879
Are you on any projects?

82
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,879
Which ones?

83
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,859
Do they have a defined scope, start date, end date?

84
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:22,929
Assigned resources?

85
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,909
A list of tasks to accomplish?

86
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:29,899
If not, it is either Operations' work or a very poorly defined project.

87
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:32,859
Now, the PMO, the Project Management Office,

88
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:37,654
is a critical element to the overall success of your projects and in the next

89
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:46,000
section we will see that the rubber meets the road with the project manager and their essential role in project execution.
