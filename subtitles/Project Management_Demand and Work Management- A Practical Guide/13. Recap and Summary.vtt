00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.209
Let's wrap up and summarize this module.

2
00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:09.189
Demand management does not involve running or the execution of the work,

3
00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:13.199
but it does involve selecting the right work,

4
00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.229
the demand to execute in support of the request.

5
00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:21.179
We made a very killer distinction between demand management and work management.

6
00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.159
I have consulted in many companies and they are so

7
00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.630
focused on getting the work done, which is good,

8
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.239
of course, but they're never even thinking about the demand side of the equation,

9
00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.169
and that is why I have separated out these last two modules

10
00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:37.179
to focus on demand and its distinction.

11
00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:38.169
Naturally,

12
00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:41.939
there is one process into demand management process flows and is

13
00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.159
integrated with the work management processes.

14
00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:45.229
So this is a great segue.

15
00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.133
The next three modules on work management are the modules

16
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.219
that will actually get the work done.

17
00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.169
So it's the processes we'll discuss to actually get the work done.

18
00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:57.189
Are you just reacting to work?

19
00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:01.199
Now as a professional, are you reacting more or planning more?

20
00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.229
Here's what I mean.

21
00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.149
Being reactive,

22
00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.169
that's acting in response to a situation rather than creating or controlling it.

23
00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:10.209
It's unplanned.

24
00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:13.189
Are the things you do typically unplanned?

25
00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.209
Are the things you do typically pushed to you,

26
00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:18.169
that is you didn't go out and get the demand to work,

27
00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:20.169
but instead it came to you?

28
00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:23.615
So examples of that would be operations because they are

29
00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:25.209
likely to be more unplanned than planned,

30
00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:27.219
and to some degree, projects as well.

31
00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.159
Now, onto planning.

32
00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.229
Are you more proactive?

33
00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.352
That's creating or controlling the situation by causing something to

34
00:01:34.352 --> 00:01:38.149
happen rather than responding to it after it has happened.

35
00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.229
Are the things you do mostly planned?

36
00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.159
Are they pulled by you to you,

37
00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.239
that is you went out and got the demand and the work?

38
00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:49.169
Examples of that might be initiatives, and also projects, of course.

39
00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:53.994
This course has provided the processes to help you deal and and manage not only

40
00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:58.199
the reactive side and the proactive side of demand and work.

41
00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:03.149
Now let's look at another takeaway of this module.

42
00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.149
I am not suggesting that there's anything wrong per se about unplanned work.

43
00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.169
That is life,

44
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.758
but the takeaways are as follows: Try to plan as much work as

45
00:02:11.758 --> 00:02:14.239
possible and be proactive in determining them,

46
00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.229
and also the demand in work management processes

47
00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.209
are different between operations, projects,

48
00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.229
and initiatives based on their nature of their work.

49
00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.209
At a high level, they're pretty much the same.

50
00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.219
To get in deeper,

51
00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:33.179
they do have different processes and you need to be aware of those as well.

52
00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.189
Now let's contrast our backlogs.

53
00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.239
Initiatives Backlog, typically only one in a company.

54
00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.209
In fact, there should only be one.

55
00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.229
To lead a company effectively,

56
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:46.219
you need one and only one set of strategies from the top,

57
00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.877
and the grooming cycle is probably semiannual or

58
00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:53.149
annual because these are such large, chunky activities.

59
00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:55.169
Next, the project backlogs.

60
00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.239
Multiple project backlogs.

61
00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.229
Maybe the backlogs are spread out over an organization.

62
00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:01.878
Maybe there are one or more project management

63
00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:05.149
offices running a few projects in each.

64
00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:08.489
Maybe there is a program management office running programs with multiple

65
00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.169
projects in operations organizations within that program.

66
00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:16.300
Now project oversight should be brought together as much as possible and

67
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.189
consolidated to ensure resources are best allocated,

68
00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.189
and the grooming cycle for those is typically monthly,

69
00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.209
maybe quarterly.

70
00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.239
On the operation side for those backlogs, again, multiple backlogs.

71
00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.202
These are typically scattered around an organization and if possible

72
00:03:31.202 --> 00:03:35.174
should be brought together and consolidated as much as possible to

73
00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:38.209
ensure resources are best allocated, and the grooming cycle,

74
00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.209
daily, possibly even twice a day,

75
00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.758
maybe once in the morning to kick off the day and once in the afternoon to make

76
00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:47.239
sure any adjustments or course corrections may be needed.

77
00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.219
All right.

78
00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:53.229
Now let's recap our key topics of this module.

79
00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:57.169
Now let's summarize the key topics in this module.

80
00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.189
The importance of process.

81
00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.209
Remember, if you can't describe what you're doing as a process,

82
00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.159
you really don't know what you're doing,

83
00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.199
and I strongly believe in that.

84
00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.199
Demand type.

85
00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.229
We have operations, projects, and initiatives.

86
00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.229
Recall I divided the world of work, if you will,

87
00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.563
into three broad categories to simplify the approach to

88
00:04:17.563 --> 00:04:19.179
better understanding demand management.

89
00:04:19.179 --> 00:04:23.387
Here I recommended you creating your steering group of line-of-business leaders,

90
00:04:23.387 --> 00:04:25.229
SMEs, Subject-Matter Experts,

91
00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.149
to help frame and construct the initiatives into project candidates.

92
00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:30.229
Tickets.

93
00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.199
For operations, we discussed that everything,

94
00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.169
verbal instructions, phone calls, emails,

95
00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.209
issues are logged, tracked,

96
00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:42.333
and management in the system for complete visibility of your team,

97
00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.239
your management, and your customers.

98
00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:47.149
Operations Backlog and Grooming.

99
00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:49.752
We discussed that your queue of work known as your

100
00:04:49.752 --> 00:04:51.209
backlog must be regularly groomed,

101
00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:55.878
that is each item analyzed based on known attributes to either be

102
00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:59.219
approved to work or maybe placed on hold or reprioritized.

103
00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.679
Projects are handled very similarly to operations and work

104
00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:05.239
may arrive from a management directive,

105
00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:08.494
tickets from ops that meet the ops versus project

106
00:05:08.494 --> 00:05:12.199
thresholds that you have established, and projects from initiatives.

107
00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.179
Project Backlog and Grooming.

108
00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:16.149
Again, like operations,

109
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:20.189
project demand utilizes a backlog and grooming technique as well.

110
00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:22.169
Initiatives drive strategic vision,

111
00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.199
and therefore they drive the key projects in your company.

112
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.149
Portfolio management is quite challenging indeed.

113
00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:30.239
You are taking a very broad ngo-syun,

114
00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:33.229
sometimes even fuzzy requirements and you need to boil

115
00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.149
them down into concrete actions, such as projects.

116
00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:40.199
Portfolio and Project Grooming for Initiatives.

117
00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.199
As with operations and projects,

118
00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.229
projects identified by the initiatives need to be groomed.

119
00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.229
This process is different from ops grooming, but it's the same concept.

120
00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.149
We utilize a graph contrasting value to the business

121
00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:55.179
against ability of IT to execute.

122
00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:58.179
As you can see, there is a whole world of demand management,

123
00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:02.531
and I hope and trust you have a new appreciation of this topic and can

124
00:06:02.531 --> 00:06:05.936
see that the best way to manage it is to have a good,

125
00:06:05.936 --> 00:06:14.000
solid, and well-understood process. Now, let's move on to work management in the next few modules.
