1
00:00:00,851 --> 00:00:05,058
Metrics are critical to collect in order to make solid and

2
00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:06,851
informed decisions about your potential demand.

3
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:10,811
Let's look at a few examples.

4
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:13,801
Here's an example of operational tickets by category.

5
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:17,851
So if you are using a quality ticket tracking system, there are many benefits.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,861
Here is a pie chart looking at where the operational tickets are coming from.

7
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:25,861
We can see that 40% are tied to the category of Ecommerce.

8
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:28,871
You may want to talk to the business managers in those areas,

9
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:30,811
find out what's happening.

10
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:31,891
Maybe there was a new system lag,

11
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:33,881
or maybe there are several new hires brought on board

12
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:35,831
and they have lots of questions.

13
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:37,851
And then try and put together a CAP,

14
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:41,831
a Correction Action Plan to address and then track against.

15
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:45,881
Secondly, you could also talk to the lead players for the other large categories,

16
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:48,871
Security, Engineering, and the Sales App,

17
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:51,861
to show them how much of your resources are consumed,

18
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:56,811
and to find out more about their business and what they may need in the future.

19
00:00:56,811 --> 00:00:59,871
Based on this number and conversations with your key business customers,

20
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:03,381
you may want to move resources around and/or possibly hire

21
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:05,891
more in order to provide better service.

22
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:11,881
And again, if you don't track your work, you cannot do this.

23
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:15,851
Here's a thought: how about prevent tickets from coming

24
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:17,871
into the queue in the first place?

25
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:19,861
It is great that you can handle more tickets,

26
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:22,821
maybe helps more people and provide better service,

27
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:25,742
but don't forget about looking at the root cause of why the

28
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:27,821
ticket was issued in the first place.

29
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,871
Now, this spot does not apply to initiatives or projects.

30
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:34,801
My belief is that the backlog grooming will handle this,

31
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,851
and unworthy projects will not be approved.

32
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:41,841
But operations is different, and let's look at some ideas.

33
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:47,137
Forecasting Operations Demand Maybe you can do some things to

34
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:49,811
better forecast upstream operations demand.

35
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:53,118
Is there new business or significant changes to the business,

36
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:54,821
even mergers and acquisitions?

37
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:55,225
If so,

38
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:58,284
then you want to get ahead of that and figure out how those

39
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,233
business drivers will affect your ability to handle the

40
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,841
additional operational work load.

41
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:04,841
Do not wait for the wave to hit you.

42
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:08,891
Also, education and training can help mitigate and reduce support.

43
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:11,881
New hires can have lots of issues and questions.

44
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:16,171
New system roll outs can be very disruptive or large system

45
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:18,871
upgrades can drive more operational support.

46
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:22,811
Maybe provide online and self serve support as well

47
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:27,801
with online user documentation, and even Wikis are great sources of information.

48
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:28,841
Self provisioning.

49
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:32,194
For example, many obstacles, could be things like, "I need an I.

50
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:32,523
D.

51
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:34,493
", "I need roles or permissions,

52
00:02:34,493 --> 00:02:37,627
" "Set this up so I can access this system or that system,

53
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:41,851
" let's see if any of those things can have self serve provisioning.

54
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:49,000
And this will mitigate the need for a call in the first place. Let us look at a few more examples.
