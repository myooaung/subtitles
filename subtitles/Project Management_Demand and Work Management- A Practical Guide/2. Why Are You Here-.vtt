00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.659
So, why are you here?

2
00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:04.699
There are lots of good reasons you may have.

3
00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:07.649
Some of them may be the following.

4
00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.629
Too many people are asking you to do too many things.

5
00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:13.669
We all get bombarded with things to do.

6
00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:18.619
How do you keep track of what you or your team or your department need to do?

7
00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.679
And is it the right work to do in the first place?

8
00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.629
I don't have enough time in the day to get things done.

9
00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:27.649
No one is making more time for anyone,

10
00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.664
so it is even more important to have methods to manage

11
00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:33.649
your demand and manage your work.

12
00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.629
There are too many things in my queue, so your backlog is getting even bigger.

13
00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:39.699
Your list just grows and grows.

14
00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.669
Again, you need an approach to managing your backlog or list of things to do.

15
00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:47.629
How do I assign resources?

16
00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.534
What is the best approach to assign resources if you are a team leader and

17
00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:55.609
you are assigning resources just for your customers?

18
00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.689
Or is your team providing general services,

19
00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:59.689
like database support, for example,

20
00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:05.629
for multiple IT departments throughout your company seeking your help?

21
00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:07.649
Priorities are always changing.

22
00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.353
How do I know what those priorities are and how do I manage those

23
00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:15.639
priorities and change those priorities if need be?

24
00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:18.659
I wish people could see my backlog and my work,

25
00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.629
so how do I communicate my backlog and work to my management and my customers?

26
00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:26.649
Juggling new work with existing work.

27
00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.024
Just how do I manage all the new work coming in with

28
00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:32.649
the existing work that I am doing?

29
00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.639
Or are you just plain curious?

30
00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:38.619
Well, whatever the reason, welcome.

31
00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.629
Based on how you identify with some of those statements,

32
00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:43.639
this course may be for you.

33
00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:44.400
And full disclosure,

34
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.869
this course may require someone with an affinity to planning or

35
00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.689
that you believe that planning has value.

36
00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.699
So, is planning natural to you?

37
00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:54.629
Do you struggle with it?

38
00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:55.689
I used to.

39
00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.619
But good planning actually allows you to sleep at night much better, trust me.

40
00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.069
In this course,

41
00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.639
I will show you some very easy planning tools and methods

42
00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:08.669
that you can quickly adopt and leverage.

43
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.689
Now, let's see who this course is for.

44
00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.629
Basically, this course is for any business,

45
00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.689
software and IT professionals,

46
00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.877
that are interested or responsible for managing work coming in,

47
00:02:21.877 --> 00:02:25.659
how to assess it, how to determine if and when to do it,

48
00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.659
and once approved, how to manage it until its completion.

49
00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.699
Hence, first time or experienced managers,

50
00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.699
technical team leaders, project managers,

51
00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:39.904
software and technical engineers, systems analysts,

52
00:02:39.904 --> 00:02:45.679
people around and in this ecosystem, project management office personnel,

53
00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:54.000
senior management, or others. Now, let me share with you the course objectives.
