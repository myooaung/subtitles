1
00:00:00,727 --> 00:00:02,717
Grooming for Operations.

2
00:00:02,717 --> 00:00:06,687
This section contains the definition and process of grooming,

3
00:00:06,687 --> 00:00:12,757
which is a great tool to help you manage the demand processes,

4
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:16,295
but first let's define in general what grooming

5
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:18,717
means so we're all on the same page.

6
00:00:18,717 --> 00:00:24,227
Grooming is the process of reviewing items in the backlog to ensure the backlog

7
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:28,791
contains the appropriate items and that information or attributes are all

8
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:33,850
filled in and that the items at the top of the backlog are the ones of the

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,727
highest priority and are ready to be worked.

10
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:42,697
Now let's take a deeper look at the grooming process.

11
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:44,737
So we have our backlog ticket queue.

12
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:47,757
These are our normal tickets as I call them,

13
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:49,747
and as I noted in the previous section,

14
00:00:49,747 --> 00:00:54,692
tickets that really were not part of our responsibility were already routed

15
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:58,717
to other queues and any hot production issues that were immediately

16
00:00:58,717 --> 00:01:01,747
approved to be worked are not in this list as well.

17
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:06,707
So now we will perform our grooming that we defined in the previous slide.

18
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:10,737
And if you can perform as a team, since no one person knows everything,

19
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,677
that would be the best,

20
00:01:12,677 --> 00:01:16,737
but sometimes teams cost a lot of money and it may just be one key individual.

21
00:01:16,737 --> 00:01:17,737
That's your call.

22
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:21,687
Now some tickets might be set with a status of hold.

23
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:24,339
This means you don't have enough information to determine its

24
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:27,687
priority or what exactly needs to be done,

25
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:32,367
so the triage or grooming team may take the next step to perform further

26
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:35,667
analysis and or discussions with the ticket creator.

27
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:35,747
Again,

28
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:39,471
you're trying to fill out those attribute items to make sure you have enough

29
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:42,757
information to make this determination of this backlog item.

30
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:44,747
Next, reprioritize.

31
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:48,677
So you want to adjust priority order of the ticket in the backlog,

32
00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:50,717
and in this case, if it is not approved,

33
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:54,054
maybe the priority is not high enough or you do not

34
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:55,687
have enough resources quite yet.

35
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:59,727
Next, reprioritize and approve to be worked,

36
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:05,340
that is the resources are assigned and a status is set to work in progress,

37
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,667
or W-I-P, WIP.

38
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:06,747
Lastly,

39
00:02:06,747 --> 00:02:10,810
this branch is where the ticket is determined based on the attributes

40
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,667
you have collected and your team's operations versus project's threshold

41
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,757
to move the ticket to the project backlog.

42
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:18,737
Stay tuned.

43
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:21,707
I will discuss this move in the next section.

44
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:26,747
Okay, now let's summarize this process on the next slide.

45
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,717
Here's a summary of the grooming process.

46
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,836
Assemble the daily grooming team, keep at the right size,

47
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:36,697
just the key people, so other people are still working on the tickets.

48
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:39,687
Review production-issue tickets first.

49
00:02:39,687 --> 00:02:43,687
These are the tickets that came in, and based on the criticality of the tickets,

50
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:47,054
were immediately approved and worked, like a system outage,

51
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:47,717
for example.

52
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:51,180
So take a look at any of those that are in work at this time to ensure

53
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,747
adequate resources are assigned and attention is focused.

54
00:02:54,747 --> 00:02:57,737
Next, review new tickets, complete,

55
00:02:57,737 --> 00:03:01,697
filling out all the attributes so you can assess the ticket or issue better,

56
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:03,677
then assign its priority.

57
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:05,697
Now review the top n-tickets.

58
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:09,667
Maybe that is the top three or five, or whatever works for you.

59
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,667
Approve tickets from the backlog, if appropriate.

60
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:13,757
That means they're ready to work.

61
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:15,747
Review tickets in work.

62
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:17,697
Discuss their status.

63
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,677
Maybe modify resources,

64
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:23,195
and even stop working on tickets if you need to reallocate

65
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:26,677
those resources to other more pressing tickets.

66
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:27,667
Don't be shy.

67
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:28,667
Don't be afraid.

68
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,747
If other priorities come up,

69
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:34,727
stop working on certain tickets and reallocate those resources to the priority.

70
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:42,000
All right. Now let's move on to project demand management in the next section.
