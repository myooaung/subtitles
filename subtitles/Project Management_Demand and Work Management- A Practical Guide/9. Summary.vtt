00:00:02.897 --> 00:00:04.897
Here are the key points of this module.

2
00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:05.947
Project work management.

3
00:00:05.947 --> 00:00:10.578
We learned that 62% is the industry-wide success rate of projects

4
00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:12.927
and that's barely two-thirds of all projects.

5
00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:13.329
Good,

6
00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.351
quality project work management will help you better succeed

7
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:17.967
at running and completing your projects.

8
00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:20.957
The Project Management Office (PMO),

9
00:00:20.957 --> 00:00:25.584
we explored why it is important to have a PMO to help manage project

10
00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:28.796
demand and execute projects following standards and metrics and

11
00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:30.987
provides a necessary reporting and communication.

12
00:00:30.987 --> 00:00:32.907
We defined a project.

13
00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:35.987
It is a temporary group activity designed to produce a unique product,

14
00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:41.207
service or result and that has the purpose of the project construct is to

15
00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.967
focus resources and provide visibility to management.

16
00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:46.907
We talked about the role of the project manager,

17
00:00:46.907 --> 00:00:49.796
which is essential to ensure the project gets done professionally and

18
00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:53.159
that they have the responsibility of the initiation,

19
00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.947
planning, execution, performance, monitoring and closure of a project.

20
00:00:57.947 --> 00:01:00.447
We talked about traditional project management which

21
00:01:00.447 --> 00:01:02.897
has five major process groups.

22
00:01:02.897 --> 00:01:05.677
Conception and initiation, planning execution,

23
00:01:05.677 --> 00:01:08.957
performance and monitoring and lastly, closure.

24
00:01:08.957 --> 00:01:12.697
We talked about Agile project management which is based on key Agile

25
00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:15.947
principles and practices for delivering software,

26
00:01:15.947 --> 00:01:18.743
one of which would be that the highest priority is to

27
00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:21.937
satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery

28
00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:24.907
of valuable that is usable software.

29
00:01:24.907 --> 00:01:26.897
And Agile Acrum process groups.

30
00:01:26.897 --> 00:01:28.947
We learned there are four Agile process groups.

31
00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:32.987
They are projects, releases, iterations and daily work.

32
00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:35.987
And then at the end we mapped Agile onto traditional.

33
00:01:35.987 --> 00:01:39.897
This helped us better understand the relationship between traditional

34
00:01:39.897 --> 00:01:41.977
project management and Agile project management.

35
00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:48.000
Now in the next module, we'll build our initiative management processes. See you there!
