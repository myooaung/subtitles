1
00:00:01,523 --> 00:00:05,553
As you can see from the graphic, things are stacking up.

2
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:08,533
So, what type of demand is it in those piles?

3
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,493
Where does it come from?

4
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:11,563
And, what do I do with it?

5
00:00:11,563 --> 00:00:14,493
Let's find out.

6
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:17,553
Demand management is the planning methodology,

7
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:21,523
or an approach, or a technique, used to forecast,

8
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:26,503
plan for, and manage the demand for products and services.

9
00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:30,533
In this course, I will be providing you with an approach to managing demand.

10
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,573
Now, let's deconstruct this definition.

11
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:36,573
Manage, that is to plan and operate.

12
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:42,573
Demand, the stuff that comes in, the things you need to do.

13
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:45,583
Products and services, someone is coming to you,

14
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,583
or your team, or organization,

15
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:51,806
because they want more of the things you do for a living: more software,

16
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:55,503
better software, new features, et cetera.

17
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:59,493
Now, let's look at the process flow for demand.

18
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:05,543
Here is a simple process flow to manage demand, also known as work intake.

19
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:07,563
Collect your demand.

20
00:01:07,563 --> 00:01:12,553
That may be tickets, tasks, projects, or some other entity.

21
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:15,583
And, we will talk more about that in this course as well.

22
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,563
Organize your demand.

23
00:01:17,563 --> 00:01:19,523
Email doesn't cut it.

24
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:21,513
Post-it notes don't work either.

25
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:23,493
Use the right tool, and, again,

26
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:26,543
we will talk more about tools later in this course.

27
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:28,503
Track your demand.

28
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:31,573
Know its relative value to other tasks.

29
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:36,553
Know its business value relative to other items in your demand list.

30
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:38,573
And, lastly, prioritize.

31
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:41,493
No matter how much senior management will tell you

32
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:46,183
everything is number one in priority, we all know that this is a fallacy,

33
00:01:46,183 --> 00:01:50,513
and, in my opinion, an abdication of responsibility by management.

34
00:01:50,513 --> 00:01:53,573
More on this topic of priorities later, as well.

35
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:58,776
The outcome of these simple steps is a collection of

36
00:01:58,776 --> 00:02:03,533
well-organized and tracked demand items in priority order.

37
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:07,583
That's a nutshell of demand and demand management.

38
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,573
This is the process-side of demand,

39
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:13,513
and we will go further into detail in the next module,

40
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:17,843
but I wanted to give you a quick bird's-eye view right now so you have a

41
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:21,493
general overview of the process of managing demand.

42
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:24,553
Let's define, in general, what backlog means.

43
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:30,493
And, I will use the words backlog and demand interchangeably in this course.

44
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:33,563
Demand is a prioritized list of items such as features,

45
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:36,538
bugs, et cetera, containing information,

46
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:42,033
critical information, about the item or requirements desired in a product,

47
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:43,533
service, or system.

48
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:46,503
So, it is the list of things you, your team,

49
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:48,573
your organization, or even your whole company,

50
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:58,000
needs to get done. Now, let's look at the different demand types on the next slide.
