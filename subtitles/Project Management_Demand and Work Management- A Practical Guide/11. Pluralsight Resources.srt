00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:35,046
Since all three of the work types drive project,

10
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:38,096
then this course is a great agent to your learning experience.

11

To successfully implement demand and work management,

12
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:46,026
you need solid project managers and project management processes.

13
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:50,026
