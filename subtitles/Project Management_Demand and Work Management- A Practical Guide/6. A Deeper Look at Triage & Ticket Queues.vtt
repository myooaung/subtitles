00:00:01.806 --> 00:00:06.418
We have seen many shows like MASH and ER on TV where doctors and

2
00:00:06.418 --> 00:00:09.516
nurse characters would perform triage of injuries and determine

3
00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:12.786
which ones were serious and which could wait.

4
00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:15.856
And really, bugs in a feature are like injuries to your code,

5
00:00:15.856 --> 00:00:19.806
and when they are revealed, they too need to be triaged.

6
00:00:19.806 --> 00:00:20.660
Without triage,

7
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.569
bug tickets can add time to your development

8
00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.806
process and even cause invalid fixes.

9
00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:28.836
Every development team should triage their bugs.

10
00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:33.836
And let's look at the importance of a good triage team.

11
00:00:33.836 --> 00:00:35.836
The importance of good triage.

12
00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:38.856
Good triage is a tough skill to find and keep.

13
00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:41.866
So don't just assign tickets as they come in to developers.

14
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:45.856
Every approved ticket should be the product of a good triage.

15
00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:49.555
Have you ever looked at a ticket and said, "What does this ticket mean anyway?

16
00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:53.331
" How many times have you worked on a bug that says something like,

17
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:54.836
this feature is broken?

18
00:00:54.836 --> 00:00:58.826
You might think this is an exaggeration, but it really isn't too far off.

19
00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:02.113
This will even start a cycle of calls and emails with

20
00:01:02.113 --> 00:01:03.796
the customer clarifying the ticket.

21
00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:04.379
Or worse,

22
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.707
a developer will fix it because he or she thinks he knows or

23
00:01:08.707 --> 00:01:10.786
she knows what's implied by the ticket.

24
00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:11.826
Oh, even worse.

25
00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:14.846
All of this is just wasted time and energy.

26
00:01:14.846 --> 00:01:16.018
On the other hand,

27
00:01:16.018 --> 00:01:18.846
how many times have you wondered why some tickets are being worked

28
00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:21.786
while more critical tickets are just sitting around?

29
00:01:21.786 --> 00:01:22.856
How frustrating is that?

30
00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:26.222
This happens frequently if tickets are not prioritized and

31
00:01:26.222 --> 00:01:28.856
put in the backlog with good triage.

32
00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:33.786
So an experienced team will review tickets for best practices.

33
00:01:33.786 --> 00:01:38.347
Bug tickets should be written with enough information to identify the issue plus

34
00:01:38.347 --> 00:01:41.846
steps to reproduce and anything else that might be useful.

35
00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:45.597
The triage team will verify that the tickets have all the necessary

36
00:01:45.597 --> 00:01:48.826
information or return to the originator to clean the tickets up.

37
00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:50.846
This might take a phone call, certainly.

38
00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:54.291
They will also apply their knowledge about the specific

39
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:56.866
feature or other existing tickets to add valuable insights

40
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.786
and maybe link related issues.

41
00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.796
Next, assign severity and priority.

42
00:02:02.796 --> 00:02:05.816
Tickets are often misclassified by their creator.

43
00:02:05.816 --> 00:02:09.526
The triage team might determine that a ticket labeled as critical is actually

44
00:02:09.526 --> 00:02:13.816
not so bad due to no workarounds or other business needs.

45
00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:17.034
Or the team might find a low-priority ticket that should be

46
00:02:17.034 --> 00:02:19.786
worked immediately because they know the impact.

47
00:02:19.786 --> 00:02:22.479
The triage team also usually recommends whether a

48
00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.846
ticket needs to be pulled into a sprint.

49
00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:25.508
For example,

50
00:02:25.508 --> 00:02:29.082
maybe a user's asking for a feature that is part of a

51
00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.426
sprint development effort and therefore,

52
00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:34.856
this ticket should be part of the sprint and not an operations bug at all.

53
00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:36.826
And who should do triage?

54
00:02:36.826 --> 00:02:39.856
The purpose of the triage team is to review bugs as they come in.

55
00:02:39.856 --> 00:02:40.254
Ideally,

56
00:02:40.254 --> 00:02:45.215
the people reviewing bugs have the power to make prioritization

57
00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:47.806
decisions and are also familiar with the features.

58
00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:50.796
Strong subject matter expertise helps,

59
00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:54.776
along with knowledge of best practices and delivery schedules.

60
00:02:54.776 --> 00:02:57.856
So a normal triage team might include the product owner,

61
00:02:57.856 --> 00:03:00.786
who obviously would help with prioritization,

62
00:03:00.786 --> 00:03:03.866
a QA analyst familiar with the bug ticket best practices,

63
00:03:03.866 --> 00:03:08.786
and intimate with the bug queue to help identify duplicate and related tickets,

64
00:03:08.786 --> 00:03:10.776
and maybe a development manager.

65
00:03:10.776 --> 00:03:11.141
You know,

66
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.190
good to have so that the team can understand the

67
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.806
reasons behind prioritization issues,

68
00:03:14.806 --> 00:03:17.227
and he would know or she would know the resources

69
00:03:17.227 --> 00:03:18.806
that may or may not be available.

70
00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:20.796
This might be the best group in general,

71
00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:22.866
but you can add or subtract members as needed.

72
00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:24.836
And when do we triage?

73
00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:27.866
Many factors influence when triage becomes necessary.

74
00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:30.806
Some teams do triage on a regular basis.

75
00:03:30.806 --> 00:03:33.796
And I would suggest daily, first thing in the morning,

76
00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:35.856
then maybe right after lunch if the load is heavy,

77
00:03:35.856 --> 00:03:39.786
and always be ready for an ad-hoc triage stand-up.

78
00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:43.866
As you can see, triage can take place on the fly or on a regular basis,

79
00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:46.816
whatever the situation and team deems is right.

80
00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:51.160
But I would always have regularly planned triages and let

81
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.796
the ad hoc just fill in as you need.

82
00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:55.836
So remember, try to be as quick and efficient as you can,

83
00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.469
but the better the triage,

84
00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.587
the easier it'll be to complete the ticket by the development

85
00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:02.866
team and provide good customer service.

86
00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:04.836
With quality triaging,

87
00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:09.786
your developers and QA teams will really appreciate complete bug tickets,

88
00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:12.089
and product owners will have a deeper understanding about

89
00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.856
the health of their systems as well.

90
00:04:13.856 --> 00:04:16.294
On the next slide we'll talk about why tracking

91
00:04:16.294 --> 00:04:20.786
with tickets is just so important.

92
00:04:20.786 --> 00:04:22.866
Why tracking your work with tickets is important.

93
00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:27.786
And just so you know, I like tracking things, so, full disclosure.

94
00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:30.866
Also, email does not equal a ticket or tracking system,

95
00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:33.806
so don't use it in that way ever.

96
00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:37.786
OK, here are some additional benefits of having a tracking system.

97
00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:39.806
Everything is centralized in one place.

98
00:04:39.806 --> 00:04:43.164
I think that ticket tracking systems' major benefit to me is

99
00:04:43.164 --> 00:04:45.786
that it functions as a system of record.

100
00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:46.836
As a project progresses,

101
00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:50.992
all the key information ends up being documented in the ticket

102
00:04:50.992 --> 00:04:53.590
tracking system so that at any time later,

103
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.786
years even for instance, you'll have all the information you need.

104
00:04:56.786 --> 00:04:59.856
Next, provides built-in tracking and reporting metrics.

105
00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:01.846
You can track things easier, for example.

106
00:05:01.846 --> 00:05:05.846
You can run a report on every ticket a teammate has worked on in the past month.

107
00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:08.846
Mean time to repair, how many open tickets,

108
00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:10.836
how long does it take to solve a ticket?

109
00:05:10.836 --> 00:05:13.866
All sorts of metrics can come out of the ticketing system,

110
00:05:13.866 --> 00:05:17.826
which will provide better information for you to manage your operations team.

111
00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:18.866
Helps prioritize.

112
00:05:18.866 --> 00:05:22.856
It also allows you to more easily prioritize the workflow as well.

113
00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.786
Adds transparency.

114
00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:27.628
A ticket tracking system is better for determining which departments,

115
00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:28.034
teams,

116
00:05:28.034 --> 00:05:32.916
or businesses are receiving the most support requests so you can

117
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.816
allocate your support resources efficiently.

118
00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:36.786
Fosters collaboration.

119
00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:39.816
Multiple people can work on the same issue and in doing so

120
00:05:39.816 --> 00:05:41.816
can keep their progress in the same place.

121
00:05:41.816 --> 00:05:43.806
And ensures continuity.

122
00:05:43.806 --> 00:05:44.406
Simply put,

123
00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:48.826
if you need to delegate tasks to others and track those tasks closely,

124
00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:52.786
ticket tracking is superior to email as I mentioned earlier.

125
00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:56.503
Ticket tracking systems are also a good fit for people who work in a

126
00:05:56.503 --> 00:05:59.816
position where they manage others or handle support requests.

127
00:05:59.816 --> 00:06:02.836
Now, how might we organize our team of resources?

128
00:06:02.836 --> 00:06:12.000
How will people be the most effective at working on operational issues? Let's check that out in the next section.
