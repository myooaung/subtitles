00:00:00.235 --> 00:00:03.926
Let's explore the key responsibilities and processes

2
00:00:03.926 --> 00:00:08.155
of the portfolio management office.

3
00:00:08.155 --> 00:00:10.235
The portfolio management office is similar in a way

4
00:00:10.235 --> 00:00:14.185
to the project management office, except it is on steroids.

5
00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:18.185
That is it is tackling very large and complex company initiatives

6
00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:21.195
and we will look at six key activities of the PMO.

7
00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:23.215
The first, initiative demand management.

8
00:00:23.215 --> 00:00:27.175
The PMO will manage initiative planning and prioritization

9
00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:29.205
and the projects and programs within each.

10
00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:33.165
Governance, establishment of initiative management policies.

11
00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:36.700
Then execute the initiatives via projects programs and operations,

12
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.165
on time and on budget.

13
00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:41.825
Define and maintain standards metrics and process for the

14
00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:44.225
running of the PMO office and its activities.

15
00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:47.205
Perform cross-functional reporting and communication.

16
00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:50.245
Now effective communication is even more important.

17
00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:55.185
You need to communicate from the CxO offices and throughout the entire company.

18
00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:58.165
Maximize the company's investment dollar.

19
00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:00.235
Basically that's one of the main goals of the PMO.

20
00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:04.175
To get the greatest bang, business value for the buck.

21
00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:05.225
For your investment dollar.

22
00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:11.155
Now we'll cover each responsibility in detail in the next few slides.

23
00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:15.012
Demand management we already covered in quite detail the demand management

24
00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:18.175
process in the role the portfolio management office plays.

25
00:01:18.175 --> 00:01:19.235
So as not to be repetitive,

26
00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:23.547
please review the module constructing your demand management process and

27
00:01:23.547 --> 00:01:27.165
also check out the sections demand sources in the PMO,

28
00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:29.245
where the demand typically came from the Board of Directors,

29
00:01:29.245 --> 00:01:32.245
Steering Groups, senior executives and business leaders.

30
00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:35.215
Also the section grooming for initiatives.

31
00:01:35.215 --> 00:01:38.435
We discussed there how you select the right initiatives to be

32
00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:42.195
in your backlog and lastly the section, initiative-driven Project Backlog.

33
00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:43.878
To me the most critical,

34
00:01:43.878 --> 00:01:47.185
important and strategic project should be initiative-driven.

35
00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:50.833
Sure there will be projects coming from operations or other parts of the

36
00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:53.195
organizations based on your demand resource thresholds,

37
00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:57.175
but this is where the most high value projects should likely originate.

38
00:01:57.175 --> 00:02:02.215
So feel free to check out that module in the reference sections.

39
00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:06.225
Let's define the term governance before we talk about the PMO governance.

40
00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:10.024
Governance is the establishment of policies and continuous

41
00:02:10.024 --> 00:02:13.680
monitoring of their proper implementation by the members of a

42
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.165
governing body of an organization,

43
00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:20.195
with the goal of enhancing the prosperity and viability of the organization.

44
00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:24.245
The goal of having governance basically is also to maximize investment value.

45
00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:28.155
This would apply to for-profit businesses certainly.

46
00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:31.555
Also for example governance for a company maybe to not only

47
00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:34.215
maximize profits but be environmentally friendly.

48
00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:38.245
Ensure there is community outreach and provide extraordinary employee benefits,

49
00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:41.175
all while maximizing the investment value.

50
00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:45.235
Now let's see how this applies to the PMO.

51
00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:50.165
The portfolio management office governance is comprised of the following areas.

52
00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:53.165
A formal procedure to review initiatives and projects,

53
00:02:53.165 --> 00:02:55.205
approve, those are funding decisions,

54
00:02:55.205 --> 00:02:58.215
submitted project proposals and business case changes.

55
00:02:58.215 --> 00:03:01.215
As well as to rationalize the investment portfolio.

56
00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:05.532
Clear lines of responsibility and accountability for the technical and

57
00:03:05.532 --> 00:03:09.155
financial performance of the initiatives and projects.

58
00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:12.525
Also the PMO will use a consistent set of policies to

59
00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.878
guide the development of estimates, cost benefits et cetera,

60
00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:19.205
to assess progress and to manage initiatives and projects.

61
00:03:19.205 --> 00:03:21.854
Every project has a senior business manager or

62
00:03:21.854 --> 00:03:25.833
sponsor who oversees the initiatives, oversees the project definitions,

63
00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:29.195
budgets and takes responsibility for their success.

64
00:03:29.195 --> 00:03:33.245
Now let's talk about the initiative management activities.

65
00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:37.185
Initiative Management Process, this is where the main work gets done.

66
00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:40.155
Develop and maintain initiatives and projects.

67
00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:42.571
The executive team will regularly identify new initiatives

68
00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:44.235
and projects and add them to the backlog.

69
00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:48.072
Manage an inventory of current initiatives and their projects

70
00:03:48.072 --> 00:03:51.245
and the investments being made in them, such as people and funding.

71
00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:55.110
Categorize ongoing initiatives and projects and show value

72
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.245
for your investments or lack of value.

73
00:03:57.245 --> 00:04:01.165
In the case where value is not where the executives expect it,

74
00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:04.245
you may delay and rethink that initiative and any associated projects,

75
00:04:04.245 --> 00:04:08.715
or you may terminate and redeploy resources to more strategic

76
00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:12.155
initiatives and projects or launch new ones.

77
00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:14.155
Regular and timely reviews.

78
00:04:14.155 --> 00:04:17.411
The executive governance body meets once a quarter to perform the

79
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:21.175
backlog grooming as we discussed in the demand module but also to

80
00:04:21.175 --> 00:04:23.155
review the metrics from running projects,

81
00:04:23.155 --> 00:04:29.205
programs and operational activities and to make the hard decisions.

82
00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:33.235
For the PMO to work you need to have standards, metrics and a process in place.

83
00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:37.165
When the governance team is established in the policies of the PMO.

84
00:04:37.165 --> 00:04:40.165
They are deciding and requiring what standards to have,

85
00:04:40.165 --> 00:04:42.225
what metrics to collect and what to report.

86
00:04:42.225 --> 00:04:45.235
So you need to gather metrics by initiative and project.

87
00:04:45.235 --> 00:04:48.845
You need a very structured and clear process by which to

88
00:04:48.845 --> 00:04:50.225
gather metrics for all launched projects.

89
00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:53.618
The PMO office will work closely with the initiative owners and

90
00:04:53.618 --> 00:04:57.304
project managers ensuring the right data and metrics are captured

91
00:04:57.304 --> 00:05:00.155
and provided back into the portfolio office.

92
00:05:00.155 --> 00:05:02.746
You need guidelines for presenting initiative and project

93
00:05:02.746 --> 00:05:04.225
proposals for ranking and selection.

94
00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:05.328
This is important,

95
00:05:05.328 --> 00:05:08.040
since it'll be the gatekeeper as to what initiatives and

96
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.235
projects are even considered for the backlog.

97
00:05:10.235 --> 00:05:14.175
Guidelines for the initiative and project selection criteria.

98
00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:18.185
As you know from this course these guidelines are critical for the PMO success.

99
00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:22.215
Remember we are striving to be only doing the right work not just any work.

100
00:05:22.215 --> 00:05:26.155
Repository for financial and resource usage and allocation.

101
00:05:26.155 --> 00:05:28.399
You want to know what was allocated and what was used,

102
00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:30.175
and what value came of it.

103
00:05:30.175 --> 00:05:34.205
You need guidelines of what if capabilities to explore alternatives.

104
00:05:34.205 --> 00:05:38.415
Just because an initiative OF a project was presented you must also look closely

105
00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:41.225
at any alternatives looking for synergies and cost savings,

106
00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:43.185
and certainly some tools.

107
00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:46.205
Hopefully automated tools will support all these activities.

108
00:05:46.205 --> 00:05:49.245
Figure out your process in general before you buy any of your tools of course.

109
00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:53.068
Then figuring what you want to do for your PMO will in fact be the

110
00:05:53.068 --> 00:05:56.225
requirements that you can use to help you select your tools.

111
00:05:56.225 --> 00:06:01.155
On the next slide we'll see how to get the word out.

112
00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:03.235
Communicate, communicate and communicate.

113
00:06:03.235 --> 00:06:05.205
Let's suppose you're heading up the PMO,

114
00:06:05.205 --> 00:06:08.195
here are the communication activities you'll need to do.

115
00:06:08.195 --> 00:06:11.185
You need to communicate the PMO process and rationale,

116
00:06:11.185 --> 00:06:14.245
I would suggest a wiki or website and face-to-face presentations.

117
00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:17.202
You need to facilitate the discussions that drive

118
00:06:17.202 --> 00:06:19.155
project candidates and grooming.

119
00:06:19.155 --> 00:06:21.165
No one will naturally know how to do this.

120
00:06:21.165 --> 00:06:23.245
As well as you'll be following your selection criteria.

121
00:06:23.245 --> 00:06:26.769
You need to provide the interface between the PMO and the boots on

122
00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:29.245
the ground with the project and program managers.

123
00:06:29.245 --> 00:06:32.225
You need to promote the use of tools and dashboards.

124
00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:35.645
These offer great communication vehicles and enable you to roll up large

125
00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:38.225
amounts of data and get a bird's-eye view of things.

126
00:06:38.225 --> 00:06:41.175
Remember tools did not make decisions for you,

127
00:06:41.175 --> 00:06:43.175
but help you make better decisions.

128
00:06:43.175 --> 00:06:45.195
You need to speak in both worlds.

129
00:06:45.195 --> 00:06:48.355
At the project level as a project manager we're used to

130
00:06:48.355 --> 00:06:51.598
communicating key items to management as a measure of whether

131
00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:54.165
the project is progressing successfully.

132
00:06:54.165 --> 00:06:56.538
These are important and provide a gauge of the project's health,

133
00:06:56.538 --> 00:07:00.195
but they don't really reflect the project's true impact on the business,

134
00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:02.185
which is what execs are looking for.

135
00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:04.496
With executives you need to focus on the terms that

136
00:07:04.496 --> 00:07:07.992
reflect how the project is contributing to the larger set

137
00:07:07.992 --> 00:07:11.205
of objectives of the enterprise, that is the initiatives.

138
00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:14.165
Here you want to focus on organizational benefits,

139
00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:16.245
revenue, return on investments rather than costs.

140
00:07:16.245 --> 00:07:20.205
Projects typically focus on costs and the resources consumed,

141
00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:23.235
and lastly consider each person you communicate with.

142
00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:25.205
Try to speak in their language.

143
00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:28.215
Think about how that person gets measured and views success.

144
00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:32.155
Then you can design your communication for each person or audience.

145
00:07:32.155 --> 00:07:35.735
This approach and the things included in each communication event with an

146
00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:39.195
audience should be documented and part of the governance process,

147
00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:42.139
and any of these presentations should be captured on the

148
00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:46.205
website of the wiki as well for future use.

149
00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:50.185
You're always trying to maximize the company's investment dollar.

150
00:07:50.185 --> 00:07:53.165
Basically that is one of the main goals of the PMO.

151
00:07:53.165 --> 00:07:55.225
To get the greatest bang for the buck, of course.

152
00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.185
Now for each project, for each initiative.

153
00:07:58.185 --> 00:08:02.044
Review investment metrics actuals and targets that you

154
00:08:02.044 --> 00:08:04.165
defined via the governance process.

155
00:08:04.165 --> 00:08:06.165
For example has revenue increased?

156
00:08:06.165 --> 00:08:08.185
How much and did it meet the target?

157
00:08:08.185 --> 00:08:09.215
Have cost decreased?

158
00:08:09.215 --> 00:08:11.215
How much and did it meet the target?

159
00:08:11.215 --> 00:08:15.225
You also need look at subjective criteria such as has quality improved?

160
00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:18.155
Again how much and did it meet the target?

161
00:08:18.155 --> 00:08:22.609
Based on the metrics feedback you may need to reallocate resources,

162
00:08:22.609 --> 00:08:32.000
pause or stop projects or start new projects with the freed up resources. Now let's discuss the PMOs workflow in the next section.
