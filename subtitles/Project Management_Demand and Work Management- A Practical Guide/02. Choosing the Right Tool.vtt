00:00:01.288 --> 00:00:04.062
Choosing the Right Tool There is no silver bullet in

2
00:00:04.062 --> 00:00:07.378
selecting the right suite of tools, but before you pick any tools,

3
00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:10.891
you must have your general requirements and approach laid out

4
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:13.378
to ensure you pick the best tools you can.

5
00:00:13.378 --> 00:00:17.348
I just heard a story from someone working at a major insurance company.

6
00:00:17.348 --> 00:00:18.338
And guess what?

7
00:00:18.338 --> 00:00:21.166
Someone bought a tool with no forethought and said, "Just go use it.

8
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.368
" Even if management did pick a tool or set of tools for you,

9
00:00:24.368 --> 00:00:28.298
pause a moment and first figure out what the requirements are,

10
00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:32.308
so you can then validate that the tool or tools can get the job done.

11
00:00:32.308 --> 00:00:33.378
Okay, that's my two cents.

12
00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:38.338
Let's look at the tools that might fit well for this course.

13
00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:42.318
Here are some tools for tracking and managing demand and work.

14
00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:45.348
Here are 20 products in the market today that may help you out.

15
00:00:45.348 --> 00:00:49.288
Products are changing all the time, but here is a starter list for you.

16
00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:50.368
I'm not going to promote any one of them,

17
00:00:50.368 --> 00:00:54.338
since like all products, there's pros and cons to everyone.

18
00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:57.518
But you absolutely need a tool and a processes in

19
00:00:57.518 --> 00:01:02.318
this course to help you manage, track, and deliver a high quality output,

20
00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:05.318
maximize your resources, and also improve morale,

21
00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:08.288
since everyone knows exactly what will be going on.

22
00:01:08.288 --> 00:01:11.288
So on the first half, we have Active Collab,

23
00:01:11.288 --> 00:01:14.358
Agile for Scrum, Assembla, Blossom, Crocagile,

24
00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:18.368
DoneDone, Eylean, Excel, Favro, and Jira.

25
00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:21.298
In the other column, we have LeanKit, Mingle,

26
00:01:21.298 --> 00:01:24.358
PivotalTracker, Scrum Mate, smartQ, SprintGround,

27
00:01:24.358 --> 00:01:28.368
Sprintly, Targetprocess, VersionOne, and Workzone.

28
00:01:28.368 --> 00:01:31.348
Now Excel of course is the cheapest.

29
00:01:31.348 --> 00:01:34.734
If you don't have any budget, you can likely bootstrap,

30
00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:36.368
backlogs, and you name it with Excel.

31
00:01:36.368 --> 00:01:39.298
But I wouldn't recommend it in the long haul.

32
00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.378
The most popular, I believe, is Jira.

33
00:01:41.378 --> 00:01:43.371
I do use it, but again,

34
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:49.288
determine your requirements and then pick your tool or tools to get it done.

35
00:01:49.288 --> 00:01:51.338
Here are some guidance on choosing the right tool.

36
00:01:51.338 --> 00:01:54.358
Just pick one, move fast, and don't overanalyze it.

37
00:01:54.358 --> 00:01:56.308
Cloud-based systems are cheap.

38
00:01:56.308 --> 00:01:59.054
What's nice about these is that provisioning takes about an

39
00:01:59.054 --> 00:02:01.138
hour and you can quit anytime you don't like it and not

40
00:02:01.138 --> 00:02:03.288
bring out very much money at all.

41
00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:07.308
In fact, sign up for two or three concurrently and compare and contrast.

42
00:02:07.308 --> 00:02:09.378
Try using off-the-shelf settings or templates.

43
00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:12.298
Don't get fancy and start making up stuff.

44
00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.338
Use of out-of-the-box settings first.

45
00:02:14.338 --> 00:02:16.991
Try not to customize but configure to get it as

46
00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:18.358
close as you can to what you want.

47
00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:19.348
Train as a team.

48
00:02:19.348 --> 00:02:23.348
It will level-set everyone's expectations, and I think it's a lot more fun.

49
00:02:23.348 --> 00:02:26.358
Start using and making mistakes is just fine.

50
00:02:26.358 --> 00:02:28.348
Improve and tweak as you go.

51
00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.843
Just like Agile,

52
00:02:29.843 --> 00:02:32.080
make incremental improvements where it changes in

53
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.000
how you use the tool over time. Okay, can you predict the future?
