1
00:00:00,744 --> 00:00:01,814
Traditional Project Management.

2
00:00:01,814 --> 00:00:02,556
In this section,

3
00:00:02,556 --> 00:00:07,344
I will walk you through the traditional project management steps that have

4
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:10,451
been widely used in industry and quite successfully,

5
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:13,764
I might add, for many years.

6
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,794
So what does the phrase project management mean to you?

7
00:00:16,794 --> 00:00:18,774
Here's a basic definition.

8
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:21,754
Project management is the discipline of initiating,

9
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:23,824
planning, executing, controlling,

10
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:27,814
and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals

11
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:30,794
and meet specific success criteria.

12
00:00:30,794 --> 00:00:34,484
The primary challenge of the discipline of project management is to

13
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:38,784
achieve all the project goals within the given constraints.

14
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:41,554
Let's review the five phases of traditional project

15
00:00:41,554 --> 00:00:45,784
management on the next several slides.

16
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:47,134
Over the next few slides,

17
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:50,734
we will cover the five phases of traditional project management.

18
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:53,814
Sometimes these are referred to as process groups versus phases.

19
00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:55,824
It'll be a broad brush of these phases.

20
00:00:55,824 --> 00:00:59,744
Whole courses exist on these topics, if you're so inclined.

21
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:02,754
The first, concept and initiation phase.

22
00:01:02,754 --> 00:01:04,824
That is, how do the projects get started?

23
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:08,824
Planning, how do you know what to do, when and by whom?

24
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:11,804
Execution, how things get done.

25
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:14,824
Performance and monitoring, that is how are we doing?

26
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,814
How is the project progressing?

27
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:18,764
And lastly, closure.

28
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:21,774
It's when the project is done and what makes it complete?

29
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:22,103
Okay,

30
00:01:22,103 --> 00:01:25,536
now we're going to go into each one in a little more detail so

31
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:29,784
you'll have a really good understanding of each.

32
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:33,754
First, a note on the slide structure for the next five slides.

33
00:01:33,754 --> 00:01:36,613
On the left will be the phase name and the title

34
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:38,824
will be the English translation, if you will.

35
00:01:38,824 --> 00:01:41,784
Okay, how do projects get started?

36
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:46,643
We did discuss this in the Demand Management modules and I am repeating it

37
00:01:46,643 --> 00:01:50,928
here for completeness since inception initiation is one of the five

38
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:52,794
industry-recognized phases of project management.

39
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:56,764
Okay, the drivers for new projects come from management directives,

40
00:01:56,764 --> 00:01:59,784
of course, project request systems, potentially,

41
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:02,824
tickets from Operations, projects from initiatives.

42
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:07,754
These were the four drivers of new projects that we discussed earlier.

43
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:07,907
Now,

44
00:02:07,907 --> 00:02:12,008
all of these drivers will feed into the PMO or business analysts who will

45
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:15,764
begin documenting the project definition in more detail.

46
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:18,799
It will have things like scope, budget, high-level requirements,

47
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:21,824
cost savings or business value and things like that.

48
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,754
Remember, we call these the project backlog attributes in the Demand modules.

49
00:02:27,754 --> 00:02:31,734
We need this information for project grooming and selection,

50
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:35,488
so we review the project definition information to help us determine

51
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,804
the project priorities and which to select next.

52
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:38,686
Project launch,

53
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:43,764
lastly a project is selected to work and we are ready to launch it.

54
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:44,754
Now what?

55
00:02:44,754 --> 00:02:46,824
Well, the output of this phase is a solid,

56
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:51,794
written project definition document and the approval to work the project.

57
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:55,764
Now, let's move on to planning.

58
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:56,824
How do we know what to do next?

59
00:02:56,824 --> 00:03:01,764
We begin detailed planning, input, project definition.

60
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,824
In order to start this phase,

61
00:03:02,824 --> 00:03:06,764
you need to receive the project definition from the previous phase.

62
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:09,804
I have seen a million ways companies do this from verbal

63
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:13,824
descriptions to a one-pager to a document six inches thick.

64
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:17,675
I just recommend you have a documented process and that you

65
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:20,416
have collected the important and critical information you

66
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,784
need to do most of your planning.

67
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:24,764
Input into the planning phase.

68
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:26,804
You want to validate the project definition.

69
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:28,774
You want to do this with the team,

70
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:32,340
validate the contents of the project definition since there may have

71
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,214
been some time between project approval and you being assigned the

72
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:38,734
actual planning portion of this project.

73
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:41,814
So you may need to just double check the document and its contents.

74
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:43,794
Build your list of tasks.

75
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:47,824
Sometimes we call this a WBS, a Work Breakdown Structure.

76
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:51,824
Understand all of the work that needs to be done and itemize it.

77
00:03:51,824 --> 00:03:54,804
Next, itemize the acceptance criteria.

78
00:03:54,804 --> 00:03:55,244
Obviously,

79
00:03:55,244 --> 00:04:00,453
the WBS will list all of your activities but sometimes the real desired

80
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:04,804
outcome of the project can't get lost in the details of the WBS.

81
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:07,794
The acceptance criteria can be phased, as well.

82
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:12,996
So put together a list of major milestones by date And what will be

83
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:16,804
delivered in terms of the customer and not in technical terms.

84
00:04:16,804 --> 00:04:18,764
Apply resources.

85
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:22,764
Resources are usually people and tools but may include other items.

86
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:25,784
For each WBS or each task listed,

87
00:04:25,784 --> 00:04:29,851
identify who will work this task and when they are

88
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:32,754
needed to start working on the task, the project.

89
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:36,298
In addition you may need other resource details such as role

90
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:38,754
description like maybe senior developer,

91
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:40,053
required skills like.

92
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:41,784
Net or SQL server,

93
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:45,744
training needs like Angular or React and skill experience

94
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,880
level like maybe 10 years' experience in software development

95
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,774
in the healthcare business domain.

96
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,804
Also put together your estimates.

97
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:54,137
So for each task,

98
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:57,060
make an estimate of hours based on the resource that

99
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,794
you have assigned and as a result, in a high-level budget.

100
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:02,744
Develop your schedule.

101
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:05,509
A project schedule will have start and end dates for each

102
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,774
task and ultimately the entire project.

103
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,076
Remember,

104
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:11,214
all projects have an overall start and end date and

105
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:13,734
it'll be determined by this schedule.

106
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:17,764
So the output of this phase is a solid written project plan.

107
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:21,774
Now, let's move on to execution.

108
00:05:21,774 --> 00:05:23,754
So how do things get done?

109
00:05:23,754 --> 00:05:26,784
Now, the input for this phase is the project plan.

110
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,754
The plan you're going to use to execute the project.

111
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:31,774
The project manager will be coordinating the people

112
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:33,814
and resources to implement the plan.

113
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:37,814
So basically, execution is execute the plan.

114
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:38,111
Also,

115
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:41,576
there are a couple of other very important things you will

116
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:44,744
need to support the execution of the project.

117
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,774
It's leadership.

118
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:48,677
It is the action of leading a group of people or an

119
00:05:48,677 --> 00:05:51,734
organization to a common set of goals.

120
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:51,989
Also,

121
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:56,001
leadership is the ability to guide others in a direction or decision that

122
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:58,794
leaves them still feeling empowered and accomplished.

123
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:02,744
For those who know me, you know I'm crazy about snow skiing.

124
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:04,734
Well, leadership is like skiing.

125
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:06,794
You can't just learn it by reading about it.

126
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:08,754
You just have to do it.

127
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:11,134
So if you're thinking of leading a group or a team or

128
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:14,734
a department or an organization, jump in and do it.

129
00:06:14,734 --> 00:06:15,784
You need that experience.

130
00:06:15,784 --> 00:06:18,774
And lastly, you need effective communication.

131
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:24,744
A big part of a PM's job in executing projects is communications.

132
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:27,734
Project managers need to be great communicators.

133
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:28,410
To me,

134
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,799
it's hard to imagine a successful PM and a successful project

135
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:34,754
that does not have a good communicator.

136
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:37,784
The end of this phase is really a completed project

137
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:39,754
but before we move on to closure,

138
00:06:39,754 --> 00:06:46,804
let's talk about reporting and monitoring as we are executing a project.

139
00:06:46,804 --> 00:06:49,804
While the previous three steps or phases are underway,

140
00:06:49,804 --> 00:06:53,341
you will need to report and communicate to others that is,

141
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:54,784
how well are we doing?

142
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:56,774
For example, are we on budget?

143
00:06:56,774 --> 00:06:58,784
Do you think we will meet the schedule?

144
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:01,744
Are we meeting the customer's expectations?

145
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:04,754
Do we have any known issues or risks?

146
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:07,764
Project controls are all the things you use to monitor

147
00:07:07,764 --> 00:07:11,814
and measure the progress of a project, also known as project performance.

148
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:14,804
Here are the key activities for this phase.

149
00:07:14,804 --> 00:07:16,764
Communications management.

150
00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:19,764
Communicating project information to your stakeholders,

151
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:21,814
customers, users and team members.

152
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:24,744
This would include things like status reports,

153
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,274
executive briefings, budget reviews and steering committee meetings,

154
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:29,754
to name a few.

155
00:07:29,754 --> 00:07:30,774
Change management.

156
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:33,017
That's reviewing, approving,

157
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:36,824
prioritizing and implementing changes also known as change control.

158
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,774
Configuration management.

159
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:42,784
Controlling the versions and content of the project deliverables.

160
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:44,754
Requirements management.

161
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:46,814
Ensuring all business requirements are identified,

162
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:50,814
tracked and managed Risk and issue management.

163
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:54,744
Identifying, monitoring and responding to risks and issues.

164
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:55,814
And vendor management.

165
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:58,824
Managing your suppliers and vendors supporting the project.

166
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:02,764
All of these activities are in progress throughout the project.

167
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:07,754
Now, let's move on to see how to close a project.

168
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,734
When is the project done?

169
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:09,939
Well,

170
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:12,627
the goal of this phase is to bring closure to your

171
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:14,734
project for all parties involved.

172
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:15,754
So here's the checklist.

173
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:16,507
For closure to happen,

174
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:20,168
you want to make sure you've met all the project's success

175
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:22,804
criteria and met the customer's expectations.

176
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:26,556
You want to transfer responsibility of the project deliverables to the

177
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:30,744
operational support part of the house or the organization.

178
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,814
You want to thank and acknowledge all participants.

179
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:33,824
This is important.

180
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:38,794
Everyone has likely worked very hard and we all like to be thanked.

181
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:41,754
A retrospective and improvements.

182
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,164
That is get the team together and have a retrospective or

183
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:47,754
another term would be a lessons learned.

184
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:50,754
Talk about what worked and talk about what didn't work,

185
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:53,465
and make changes to your processes and make

186
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:55,925
recommendations to the Project Management Office,

187
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:56,774
as well.

188
00:08:56,774 --> 00:09:00,824
In my experience, I have found that companies have a hard time doing this right.

189
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:01,569
For example,

190
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:05,993
project team members continue to support the operational aspects of the

191
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:09,774
outcome of the project when they shouldn't or they don't thank the team

192
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:12,804
for their hard work and may feel unappreciated.

193
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:17,101
Not only thank them but maybe make it an event with awards or

194
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:19,734
dinner or another form of appreciation.

195
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:19,824
Alright!

196
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:24,794
Now, would you like to learn more about project management?

197
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:27,784
You may want to consider checking out another one of my courses,

198
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:31,754
Project Management for Software Engineers here on Pluralsight.

199
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:34,744
In this course, you can quickly learn common sense,

200
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:38,264
experience-based tips and pointers on how to improve

201
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:39,754
your project management skills.

202
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:43,114
You will learn the practical elements of working with customers,

203
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:43,804
people, technology,

204
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:47,924
processes and connecting them successfully to be more

205
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:49,774
effective as a project manager.

206
00:09:49,774 --> 00:09:53,754
Next, some words of wisdom.

207
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:57,784
Here's a tip for those who are project managers or leaders.

208
00:09:57,784 --> 00:10:00,804
Plan for the worst, expect the best.

209
00:10:00,804 --> 00:10:03,804
It goes against human nature to always expect the worst.

210
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:08,814
But with IT projects, pessimism, otherwise known as contingency planning,

211
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:13,814
is a good way to keep small issues from becoming full-blown business disasters.

212
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,824
So when you finish making that project plan,

213
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,814
well, plan, plan and then plan some more.

214
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:19,142
Alright,

215
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:27,000
now let's move on to an Agile approach to project management in the next section.
