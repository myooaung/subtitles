00:00:00.584 --> 00:00:03.514
The Role of a Project Manager.

2
00:00:03.514 --> 00:00:06.904
This section will define the responsibilities and attributes of a

3
00:00:06.904 --> 00:00:11.584
project manager and what we expect from them.

4
00:00:11.584 --> 00:00:11.912
First,

5
00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:17.604
please relax and sit back for a moment as I share a little tale about a rabbit.

6
00:00:17.604 --> 00:00:21.604
A man walked into a pet shop and was looking at animals on display.

7
00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:26.524
While he was there another customer walked in and said to the salesperson,

8
00:00:26.524 --> 00:00:28.230
"May I buy that C rabbit?

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.086
" The salesperson nodded and went over to the C cage at the

10
00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:34.524
side of the store and took out a rabbit.

11
00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:38.739
He fitted a little collar and leash, handed it to the customer saying,

12
00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.215
"That'll be $1, 000.

13
00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:43.584
" The customer paid and walked out with his rabbit.

14
00:00:43.584 --> 00:00:47.286
Startled, the man went over to the salesperson and said,

15
00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:49.544
"That was a very expensive rabbit!

16
00:00:49.544 --> 00:00:52.544
"Most rabbits I ever bought or only ten bucks!

17
00:00:52.544 --> 00:00:54.233
"Why did that cost so much?

18
00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:58.524
" The salesperson answered, "Ah, that rabbit can program in C!

19
00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:02.184
"Very fast, perfect code, no bugs, "well worth the money.

20
00:01:02.184 --> 00:01:06.034
" The man looked at the cage on the other side of the store and said,

21
00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:07.594
"Hey, that one's even more expensive!

22
00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:09.584
"That one's $3, 000!

23
00:01:09.584 --> 00:01:12.026
"What does that rabbit do?

24
00:01:12.026 --> 00:01:15.554
" "Ah, that one's a C++ rabbit.

25
00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:18.404
"It can manage object-oriented programming,

26
00:01:18.404 --> 00:01:22.554
Visual C++, "even some job if you give him the right kind of food.

27
00:01:22.554 --> 00:01:25.574
"All the really useful stuff, " said the salesperson.

28
00:01:25.574 --> 00:01:28.576
The man looked around for a little longer and saw a

29
00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:31.554
third rabbit in a cage all on its own,

30
00:01:31.554 --> 00:01:35.554
way up high so he could see all the other rabbits.

31
00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:39.534
And the price tag on that rabbit was $10, 000!

32
00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:41.524
The man simply was shocked.

33
00:01:41.524 --> 00:01:43.594
What could this rabbit possibly do?

34
00:01:43.594 --> 00:01:49.514
The salesperson answered, "Well, I actually haven't seen it do a single thing,

35
00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:51.372
"but it claims to be a project manager.

36
00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:55.062
" That is a cute story but good,

37
00:01:55.062 --> 00:01:58.544
quality project managers are more than worth their salary.

38
00:01:58.544 --> 00:02:00.044
And in my experience,

39
00:02:00.044 --> 00:02:04.524
being a project manager and working with project managers throughout my career,

40
00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:08.584
I think it's one of the hardest and least appreciated jobs in our field.

41
00:02:08.584 --> 00:02:14.524
So if you are a project manager or are considering being one, I commend you.

42
00:02:14.524 --> 00:02:18.534
Now let's hop along to the next slide.

43
00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:21.564
Here is a basic definition of a project manager.

44
00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:26.049
Project managers have the responsibility of the initiation,

45
00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.514
planning, execution, performance, monitoring and closure of a project.

46
00:02:31.514 --> 00:02:35.584
In general PMs are organized, passionate and very goal-oriented individuals.

47
00:02:35.584 --> 00:02:35.911
So,

48
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:39.943
if you're looking for excitement or like being in a spotlight of

49
00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:42.514
driving a company or organization forward,

50
00:02:42.514 --> 00:02:44.554
then project management is where you want to be.

51
00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:49.544
Okay, let's see what else PMs are responsible for.

52
00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:54.574
As a PM, you are 100% responsible for the success of your project.

53
00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.574
And that's a lot of responsibility.

54
00:02:56.574 --> 00:03:00.534
And unfortunately, sometimes you do not have the authority,

55
00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:02.544
that is, the necessary pay grade, if you will,

56
00:03:02.544 --> 00:03:05.554
and must instead use your great powers of influence

57
00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:07.554
and leadership to get things done.

58
00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:11.429
You are also responsible for the triple constraint of time,

59
00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:15.544
cost and scope, also known as the Iron Triangle.

60
00:03:15.544 --> 00:03:15.915
Now,

61
00:03:15.915 --> 00:03:18.143
let's discuss the responsibilities of project

62
00:03:18.143 --> 00:03:21.604
manager and their personal attributes.

63
00:03:21.604 --> 00:03:26.594
Here are some of the responsibilities or duties of the project manager role.

64
00:03:26.594 --> 00:03:29.584
Wears many hats and juggles many balls in the air.

65
00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:34.534
PMs should be prepared to leverage and use all of their skills.

66
00:03:34.534 --> 00:03:37.584
The person with the responsibility to manage a project.

67
00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:41.465
Notice I did not say authority but they realize one of the

68
00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:43.544
main challenges of being a project manager,

69
00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:46.594
they may typically have the responsibility but not the authority,

70
00:03:46.594 --> 00:03:50.544
since the team members may not directly report to them.

71
00:03:50.544 --> 00:03:51.584
Now these are the job duties.

72
00:03:51.584 --> 00:03:54.534
Initiation, that's the project start-up,

73
00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:58.594
planning, execution, performance, monitoring and closure.

74
00:03:58.594 --> 00:04:00.584
Central point of contact.

75
00:04:00.584 --> 00:04:03.584
The PM should manage all project communications.

76
00:04:03.584 --> 00:04:05.574
That's up, down, and across.

77
00:04:05.574 --> 00:04:08.574
That is, up to management, down to the team,

78
00:04:08.574 --> 00:04:11.564
and across to the customers or external vendors.

79
00:04:11.564 --> 00:04:13.604
A PM will look at everything as a risk.

80
00:04:13.604 --> 00:04:17.604
Okay, I might be a bit cynical or maybe just experienced,

81
00:04:17.604 --> 00:04:20.915
but issue and risk management identification and

82
00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:23.584
remediation are key elements of that role.

83
00:04:23.584 --> 00:04:28.574
Now, let's check out a few more responsibilities of the project manager.

84
00:04:28.574 --> 00:04:32.544
Creating clear and attainable project objectives.

85
00:04:32.544 --> 00:04:36.030
Not as easy as it sounds when everyone is providing very

86
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.524
fuzzy or ever-changing scope requirements.

87
00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:41.970
Building the project requirements of the customer or client and

88
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.584
maintaining the requirement's change management process.

89
00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:47.549
That is a requirements change you got to know who asked for it,

90
00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:50.537
when they need it, how it will affect the budget,

91
00:04:50.537 --> 00:04:51.534
schedule and cost.

92
00:04:51.534 --> 00:04:54.564
Bridging the gap between the project team and customer.

93
00:04:54.564 --> 00:04:58.951
Many times the project team is highly technical and cannot always relate with

94
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:01.604
the customer from a pure business requirement standpoint,

95
00:05:01.604 --> 00:05:06.559
so the project manager needs to know the business very well and maybe some

96
00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:10.554
amount of technology in order to successfully bridge that gap.

97
00:05:10.554 --> 00:05:15.514
Managing the constraints of cost, time, scope and quality.

98
00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:18.564
This is where the project manager is likely to spend most of their time.

99
00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:22.559
Please note the PM has many other things to attend to but much of their

100
00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:26.048
time will be managing the ever-changing elements of cost,

101
00:05:26.048 --> 00:05:26.547
time,

102
00:05:26.547 --> 00:05:30.160
and scope which will have an immediate impact on

103
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.514
quality and customer expectations.

104
00:05:32.514 --> 00:05:37.574
Now let's discuss the personal attributes required for a project manager.

105
00:05:37.574 --> 00:05:39.604
Attributes of a project manager.

106
00:05:39.604 --> 00:05:42.800
Now what I mean by attributes is not about what

107
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.594
project managers need to do per se,

108
00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:48.594
but about their personal disposition and how they conduct themselves.

109
00:05:48.594 --> 00:05:50.594
The first, people skills.

110
00:05:50.594 --> 00:05:54.778
Project managers cultivate the people skills needed to develop trust

111
00:05:54.778 --> 00:05:58.524
and communication among all our project stakeholders.

112
00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:02.604
It sponsors those who will make use of the project's results and the end users,

113
00:06:02.604 --> 00:06:05.004
and those who will provide the resources needed,

114
00:06:05.004 --> 00:06:05.604
as well.

115
00:06:05.604 --> 00:06:09.534
And lastly the project team members themselves.

116
00:06:09.534 --> 00:06:10.604
Communication skills.

117
00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:15.534
Certainly communication skills are a part of or a subset of people skills,

118
00:06:15.534 --> 00:06:18.534
but I wanted to emphasize these in particular.

119
00:06:18.534 --> 00:06:21.534
You must be able to write well, speak well,

120
00:06:21.534 --> 00:06:23.604
make important and compelling presentations.

121
00:06:23.604 --> 00:06:27.524
This characteristic is likely much more important

122
00:06:27.524 --> 00:06:28.574
than what you are thinking it is.

123
00:06:28.574 --> 00:06:29.425
Trust me,

124
00:06:29.425 --> 00:06:33.780
it is and take note: Project manager must also have a flexible

125
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.544
toolkit of techniques resolving complex interdependent activities

126
00:06:38.544 --> 00:06:41.554
into tasks and subtasks that are documented,

127
00:06:41.554 --> 00:06:43.554
monitored and controlled.

128
00:06:43.554 --> 00:06:45.594
They need to adapt their approach to the context

129
00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:47.604
and constraints of each project,

130
00:06:47.604 --> 00:06:52.554
knowing that no one size can fit all the variety of projects.

131
00:06:52.554 --> 00:06:56.293
And they are always improving their own and their team skills

132
00:06:56.293 --> 00:06:59.564
through lessons learned at the project completion.

133
00:06:59.564 --> 00:07:01.554
A change agent.

134
00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:05.034
A change agent is someone in the organization who helps an

135
00:07:05.034 --> 00:07:08.834
organization transform itself by focusing on critical

136
00:07:08.834 --> 00:07:10.574
business strategy improvements.

137
00:07:10.574 --> 00:07:12.584
So project managers are change agents,

138
00:07:12.584 --> 00:07:18.193
that is they make project goals their own and use their skills and expertise to

139
00:07:18.193 --> 00:07:22.544
inspire a sense of shared purpose within the project team.

140
00:07:22.544 --> 00:07:26.294
They are able to work well under pressure and are comfortable with

141
00:07:26.294 --> 00:07:29.554
change and complexity and dynamic environments.

142
00:07:29.554 --> 00:07:30.211
And lastly,

143
00:07:30.211 --> 00:07:34.682
they can shift readily between big picture things and small but

144
00:07:34.682 --> 00:07:38.554
crucial details and knowing when to concentrate on each.

145
00:07:38.554 --> 00:07:39.544
In summary,

146
00:07:39.544 --> 00:07:43.388
many project managers enjoy the challenges and the

147
00:07:43.388 --> 00:07:45.574
responsibility of driving business results.

148
00:07:45.574 --> 00:07:51.534
Now, let's look at one more attribute all PMs should have.

149
00:07:51.534 --> 00:07:53.554
If you're thinking of getting into the PM world,

150
00:07:53.554 --> 00:07:57.118
here's a personal tip, "Be candid with everyone.

151
00:07:57.118 --> 00:07:59.574
" That's a quote by Jack Welch.

152
00:07:59.574 --> 00:08:04.529
The attributes of a rock-solid project manager must include honesty,

153
00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:06.534
trustworthiness and integrity.

154
00:08:06.534 --> 00:08:09.288
Those elements will help sustain and propel you to

155
00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:12.524
success where process alone may not.

156
00:08:12.524 --> 00:08:12.783
Okay,

157
00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:16.274
now let's check out a Pluralsight course that ties right into

158
00:08:16.274 --> 00:08:21.514
the attributes needed for a project manager.

159
00:08:21.514 --> 00:08:23.396
You may want to consider checking out another one of my

160
00:08:23.396 --> 00:08:26.581
courses: Leadership and Communication Skills for Software

161
00:08:26.581 --> 00:08:28.554
Engineers here on Pluralsight.

162
00:08:28.554 --> 00:08:31.541
If you want to immediately make an impact on your

163
00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:33.514
leadership and communication capabilities,

164
00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:36.554
please consider this course, whether you are a software engineer,

165
00:08:36.554 --> 00:08:38.554
team leader or other expert,

166
00:08:38.554 --> 00:08:42.584
this course will help you be more effective at leading and managing people.

167
00:08:42.584 --> 00:08:42.784
Okay,

168
00:08:42.784 --> 00:08:46.720
let's first talk about the traditional project management process in

169
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:54.000
the next section and then we will move on to an Agile project management approach in this section after that.
