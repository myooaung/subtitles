00:00:00,465 --> 00:00:02,435
Designing Portfolios.

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,425
Now how you may go about designing your portfolios,

3
00:00:05,425 --> 00:00:08,485
I believe is critical to the success of the underlying work,

4
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:12,425
and let's take a look.

5
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:16,465
I look at portfolios as collections or containers of work activities.

6
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:19,485
Here are some examples on how you might design portfolios,

7
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:21,455
projects and programs.

8
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,608
A collection of initiatives with the governance or oversight

9
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,415
being the Portfolio Management Office.

10
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:30,309
A collection of projects with the governance or oversight

11
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,445
being the project management office.

12
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:37,182
A collection of projects and operations and we call these programs with the

13
00:00:37,182 --> 00:00:40,089
governance or oversight being the program management office and I'll have

14
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:43,405
more on this a little bit later in this module.

15
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:46,495
Lastly just custom collections, put whatever you want in the collection.

16
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:49,485
Here the oversight is any of the PMOs,

17
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:52,485
where PMA stand for project portfolio or program,

18
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:56,445
and do what make sense to your organization and your available skills.

19
00:00:56,445 --> 00:01:01,415
In this course I have talked about portfolios as my collection of initiatives.

20
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:03,306
There may be one or more projects and operations

21
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:05,435
supporting one or more initiatives,

22
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:10,415
but out in the world organizations slice and dice these in a multitude of ways.

23
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:13,415
There is no one right perfect way.

24
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:15,425
Be creative, be focused.

25
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:18,475
Use a PMO, set up your policy and procedures,

26
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:22,925
set up your governance and keep it light and lean and you will

27
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:25,425
make a difference to your company's bottom line.

28
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:30,485
Now let's see who's in charge of these organizational constructs.

29
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:33,415
Given the previous slides orientation,

30
00:01:33,415 --> 00:01:36,485
let's see who may be the best to manage each of those constructs.

31
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:42,485
Initiatives probably CEO, CxO or other very senior management.

32
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:45,445
Projects, business unit management.

33
00:01:45,445 --> 00:01:46,435
Programs?

34
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:49,405
Probably cross-functional senior management,

35
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:52,445
and of course the famous mix, basically roll your own.

36
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:57,267
I have found that talent can lie all over an organization and they certainly do

37
00:01:57,267 --> 00:02:01,405
not need to be a manager to have talent for jobs like these.

38
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:05,465
This slide was to give you context between each kind of initiative activity.

39
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:09,415
Now what level or type of management should likely be involved.

40
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:11,435
Okay now, who's going to do all this work?

41
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:14,435
Let's find out.

42
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:17,425
Here are the key portfolio management roles.

43
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:20,435
Executives who are driving the initiatives.

44
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:23,455
The executive governance body developing the policies,

45
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:28,415
procedures, processes et cetera, and how you will run the PMO.

46
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,455
Portfolio Managers.

47
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:34,405
They will be responsible for one or more portfolios and their success.

48
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:35,425
Program managers.

49
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:39,425
They will be responsible for one or more programs and their success.

50
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,445
Project managers.

51
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:44,425
They too will be responsible for one or more projects and their success.

52
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:48,485
Portfolio, Program and Project Management Office managers.

53
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:52,455
They will be responsible for their respective management office.

54
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:55,485
Remember there should only be one Portfolio Management Office,

55
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:59,455
but could be several Program and Project Management Offices,

56
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:03,653
and lastly a variety of other skills such as administrators,

57
00:03:03,653 --> 00:03:08,475
finance analysts, business analysts and project and program coordinators.

58
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:13,141
Remember project managers are not normally part of the initiative or

59
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:16,418
portfolio management office from a reporting perspective and program

60
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:20,455
managers as well but as I've discussed, if it makes sense do it.

61
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:24,262
Also as project and program managers become more

62
00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:27,950
experienced and mature as leaders they may be more suited

63
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,495
for a program management position,

64
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:34,455
for a project manager or a portfolio management position that once was

65
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:38,405
a program manager or a role within the PMO itself.

66
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:40,455
Now let's go into programs a little deeper.

67
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:50,000
The construct of a program is important since it marries projects and operations and the pairing is usually overlooked in organizations.
