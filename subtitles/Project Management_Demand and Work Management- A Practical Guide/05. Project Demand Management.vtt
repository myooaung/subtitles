Next, we will cover Project Demand Management.

2
00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:08.163
This section contains my recommendations of the basics you need

3
00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:10.535
for setting up your project demand process.

4
00:00:10.535 --> 00:00:14.162
Think of this as a starter kit or approach for you and your

5
00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:17.495
team or teams and modify it as you see fit.

6
00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:20.505
No one process can be applied to every situation,

7
00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:24.525
but this may be a great place to start.

8
00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:28.242
Let's first start with the current perception of IT

9
00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:32.485
organizations regarding resources and new projects.

10
00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:37.012
70% of IT organizations report a shortage of

11
00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:39.545
resources to manage project demands.

12
00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.495
Well, I guess the other 30% have enough.

13
00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:43.545
That's even surprising.

14
00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:47.565
You will likely fall into the category of not enough resources.

15
00:00:47.565 --> 00:00:52.162
The fact that you don't have enough resources means you must have a

16
00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:55.545
process to best manage and utilize your limited resources.

17
00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:58.545
That is your job as a manager or leader.

18
00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:03.565
Now let's recap our demand sources for projects.

19
00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:07.495
Now let's our demand sources for projects.

20
00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:09.485
We have management directive.

21
00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:13.368
This is where a manager, or director, or VP just says, "Well, just go do it.

22
00:01:13.368 --> 00:01:16.495
" We also have a project request system.

23
00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:17.525
It may be a system,

24
00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:21.897
an automated system that collects project requests and

25
00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:25.545
feeds them into the backlog as well, and there's tickets from operations.

26
00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:28.535
Remember, based on the threshold of the ops work,

27
00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:32.535
it may become a project rather than remain in the operation side.

28
00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:35.485
Lastly, projects from initiatives.

29
00:01:35.485 --> 00:01:38.525
We'll talk about that a lot more in the next module,

30
00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:40.555
but a lot of projects can come from initiatives,

31
00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:44.535
and they typically are the most important and critical projects.

32
00:01:44.535 --> 00:01:49.234
Now all these come into the project backlog and I show the tickets below

33
00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:53.013
because I'd like everything to drive into a ticket and here a ticket

34
00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:55.565
represents a project request or a project.

35
00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:59.485
Now, again, there may be other types of systems that track this,

36
00:01:59.485 --> 00:01:59.565
and again,

37
00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:03.565
I've been using the term ticket to generically represent an item in the backlog,

38
00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:12.000
whether it's an operational item or a project item. Now let's look at project backlog and tickets.
