00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:05.457
Now let's recap our initiative management process.

2
00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:08.117
A portfolio is a collection of programs,

3
00:00:08.117 --> 00:00:08.497
projects,

4
00:00:08.497 --> 00:00:13.537
or operations managed as a group to achieve a strategic business purpose.

5
00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:15.507
I want to reemphasize,

6
00:00:15.507 --> 00:00:19.477
a portfolio is targeted or tied to one or more

7
00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:22.447
strategic business goals or initiatives.

8
00:00:22.447 --> 00:00:25.457
So you can't have a portfolio just hanging out there somewhere.

9
00:00:25.457 --> 00:00:27.457
It must be tied to the initiatives.

10
00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:31.171
So that is why we call the organization that is responsible for

11
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:33.313
managing and implementing the business strategies and

12
00:00:33.313 --> 00:00:38.467
initiatives the Portfolio Management Office.

13
00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:41.457
Here are the key concepts for initiative work management.

14
00:00:41.457 --> 00:00:43.527
We learn the importance of initiative work management.

15
00:00:43.527 --> 00:00:44.661
In fact,

16
00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:48.502
89% of high performing organizations use portfolio management

17
00:00:48.502 --> 00:00:51.517
as a means to support their initiatives.

18
00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:55.537
We learn the importance of the PMO, the Portfolio Management Office.

19
00:00:55.537 --> 00:00:59.309
That it is critical to establish an organizational structure,

20
00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.497
the PMO,

21
00:01:00.497 --> 00:01:04.992
that acts as the initiative processor and the stewards of

22
00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:06.507
the company's strategic investments.

23
00:01:06.507 --> 00:01:09.467
We discussed the goal of having governance,

24
00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:13.517
and that it is to enhance the prosperity and viability of the organization,

25
00:01:13.517 --> 00:01:16.517
which includes maximizing investment value.

26
00:01:16.517 --> 00:01:20.487
I showed you an example of a portfolio management workflow,

27
00:01:20.487 --> 00:01:23.811
showing how we engage senior management identify business initiatives,

28
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:26.709
and create our portfolio of initiatives,

29
00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:31.447
programs and projects to support the company's long term strategies.

30
00:01:31.447 --> 00:01:32.497
Designing portfolios.

31
00:01:32.497 --> 00:01:36.966
In this course, I have shown that a portfolio is a collection of programs,

32
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:40.517
operations, and projects in support of one or more initiatives.

33
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.504
But out in the real world,

34
00:01:42.504 --> 00:01:46.527
the term portfolio may contain different components towards lesser goals.

35
00:01:46.527 --> 00:01:49.527
How program support portfolio outcomes?

36
00:01:49.527 --> 00:01:50.020
Well,

37
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.615
programs exist in order to focus resources that will enable

38
00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:56.527
broader business benefits and objectives.

39
00:01:56.527 --> 00:02:00.517
An example of an organizational structure of a program was shown as well.

40
00:02:00.517 --> 00:02:02.527
Lastly, keep it lean.

41
00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:10.457
This does not need to be nor should it be bureaucratic at all.

42
00:02:10.457 --> 00:02:12.447
Why are programs important?

43
00:02:12.447 --> 00:02:12.826
Well,

44
00:02:12.826 --> 00:02:16.624
programs exist in order to focus resources that will enable

45
00:02:16.624 --> 00:02:18.537
broader business benefits and objectives.

46
00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:22.021
Programs have a broader reach and much broader

47
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:24.366
impact than a project on a business, and therefore,

48
00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:31.000
that is why I'm emphasizing that more high level business benefits can be realized.
