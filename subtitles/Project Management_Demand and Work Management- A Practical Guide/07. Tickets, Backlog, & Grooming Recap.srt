00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,650
Now let's recap tickets, backlog, and grooming.

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:07,779
For this course,

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:12,670
a ticket is a representation of an instance of potential work to perform.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,590
A ticket starts like as a demand item.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,359
For each ticket,

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,346
you must capture key attributes that will help you make good

7
00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:23,390
decisions about how to disposition the ticket to either get

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,670
right on it since it is a hot issue,

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,620
prioritize it and keep it in the backlog and revisit later,

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,680
or possibly it shouldn't belong to you in the first place.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,650
And you reroute the ticket.

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,810
Sometimes, the term "ticket" is also called an issue,

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,610
card, or requirement, or even some other term.

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,670
Demand is a term representing all of your unstructured potential work,

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:52,170
where a backlog is a prioritized list of known work containing

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,135
information about the desired requirement in a product,

17
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:57,600
service, or system.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,687
Backlogs are the same in the conceptual sense for each of the

19
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,840
three work types that we have defined: operations,

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,590
projects, and initiatives.

21
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,970
Grooming is the process of reviewing items in the backlog to

22
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,630
ensure the backlog contains the appropriate items,

23
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,110
that they are prioritized,

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,590
and that the items at the top of the backlog are ready to be worked.

25
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,670
The grooming activity could be done daily or weekly,

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,640
or whatever period makes the best sense for you and your team.

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,000
Now, grooming for projects and initiatives tend to be longer cycle, such as quarterly or even longer.
