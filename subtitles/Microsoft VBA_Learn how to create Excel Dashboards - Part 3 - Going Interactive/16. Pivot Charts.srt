1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,230
Hey,

2
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:00,490
guys,

3
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,070
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:01,810
So in this video,

5
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,000
we're going to speak about pivot charts.

6
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,170
So first of all,

7
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,770
let's see how to insert a pivot short.

8
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,180
So to insert a pivot chart,

9
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,430
you can click inside your table or your data clicking on any cell in your data on.

10
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,560
Then go to the insert tab on the ribbon here and click on pivot chart,

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,370
and then you're going to click on Pivot short again.

12
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,760
And now,

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,610
as you can see here,

14
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,680
your table or your data range is ah labeled at the moment.

15
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,280
Okay,

16
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,850
so you can click,

17
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,380
OK,

18
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,530
and you private chart is going to be inserted on.

19
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:35,940
Also,

20
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,570
you're gonna have a pivot table inserted with your pivot short,

21
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:47,030
and then you can start populating your pivot chart so you can put the country here on the

22
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,530
the categories access,

23
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,070
and also you can put the order amount for example on the values.

24
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,100
And as you can see here,

25
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:00,910
both the pivot table and the pivot short are being populated with the data.

26
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,680
Another way to insert a pivot chart is to click on any cell inside your data and then go to

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,880
the insert tab here on the ribbon Click on recommended charts and you'll find that

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,730
recommended charts Button Onley in Excel 2013 and 2016.

29
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,190
So if you click on that,

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:23,110
you can see here that you've got some suggested charts here and all these charts the are

31
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:29,760
having two headed arrows in almost a 90 degree there.

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,170
Um,

33
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,030
these charts axity are pivot shorts.

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,290
Okay,

35
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,550
so this logo here having to had it arrows means that you're going to insert a pivot short.

36
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,480
So here,

37
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,290
if I click Okay,

38
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,850
this one will insert a pivot chart.

39
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,650
This is a some of your butt country.

40
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,550
This is meaningless.

41
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,050
Actually,

42
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,390
no,

43
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,440
I don't want the order.

44
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,700
I d by country as well.

45
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,620
Maybe the units sold by country soul Insert that one and click.

46
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,160
OK,

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,830
as you can see here in a new sheet,

48
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,830
a chart husband inserted with a pivot table as well.

49
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,310
Ok,

50
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,390
one more thing I want to tell you as well is that pivot shorts and pivot tables are

51
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,000
connected.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,840
So actually,

53
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,480
each pair of pivot chart and pivot table is interconnected.

54
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,150
So that means that this pivot chart is connected to this pivot table.

55
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,120
So as you can see here.

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,770
If I filter on Australia,

57
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,580
for example,

58
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,320
on the pivot table,

59
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,750
My selection off Australia gets reflected on the pivot short.

60
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,180
But if you check the other pivot table pivot chart combo,

61
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,380
this has not been affected.

62
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:42,450
The this combo Although it's reading from the same data set from the same rayo data from

63
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,430
the same table,

64
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,260
it's not been affected by the filtration on this pivot table.

65
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:48,880
OK,

66
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,070
so here we can filter for Canada as well,

67
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,550
for example and the pivot chart is gonna be affected here.

68
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,750
But actually the other pivot table pivot chart combo,

69
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,460
it's not gonna be effective.

70
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,140
Okay,

71
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,250
so that's something to note as well.

72
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,290
One more thing I want to talk about here,

73
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:13,420
which is actually what distinguishes a pivot chart from a normal chart is actually field

74
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,970
buttons.

75
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,670
So,

76
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,500
as you can see here,

77
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,120
there some buttons on the chart.

78
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,550
Okay,

79
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,930
these field buttons can allow us to actually filter are pivot chart and this effects are

80
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,850
pivot table as well.

81
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,630
So I conforto here for Canada,

82
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,350
for example,

83
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,830
and this effects both the pivot chart and that pivot table.

84
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,660
OK,

85
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,830
And if you would like to hide or on hide this field buttons,

86
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,450
you can right click on a field button.

87
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,340
Okay.

88
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:46,830
And you can either hide just this one button here by clicking on hide value feel button on

89
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,300
chart,

90
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,960
or you can hide all field buttons on charts.

91
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,980
If you click on this,

92
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,290
this is gonna hide all that fueled buttons on the chart.

93
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,110
If you would like to own,

94
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,870
hide them again,

95
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,020
just select your chart and then go to the analyze tab on the ribbon.

96
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,140
And here you can actually untech the hide.

97
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,050
All and all of them will be,

98
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,980
uh,

99
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,550
on hidden okay.

100
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,480
Or you can actually hide them one by one.

101
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,180
Ah,

102
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,780
by actually unthinking the show.

103
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,500
Ah,

104
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,920
button of each of them.

105
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,200
OK,

106
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,320
so show this if you want ticket is gonna hide it.

107
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,950
Okay,

108
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,530
so that's how you can use feel buttons and hide and a non hide them.

109
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:32,600
One more tip you'd like to tell you as well is that when creating dashboards usually are

110
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,390
gonna have your pivot tables and pivot charts on different cheats because you would have

111
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,400
your pivot tables on your analysis sheet,

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,110
for example,

113
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,540
and you would have your pivot chart on your dashboard cheat or on the sheet that would be

114
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,200
actually facing your customer or the interface of the dashboard.

115
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,290
So if you'd like to move your pivot chart,

116
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:01,470
you can select your pivot chart on press control and X on your keyboard for for cutting.

117
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,380
And then you can go to another sheet and paste that using control and V on your keyboard.

118
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,990
You can also select your pivot charts.

119
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,650
That's another way to move it.

120
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,500
And then you're going to go to the design tab on the ribbon click on Move chart,

121
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,120
and then you're gonna actually move it to another sheet.

122
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,280
So,

123
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,810
for example,

124
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,800
if I want to move this to sheet five,

125
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,560
for example,

126
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,950
and then I click OK,

127
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,840
and you can see here that has been moved to Sheet five.

128
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,420
OK,

129
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,300
so that was an introduction about pivot charts.

130
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,120
Thank you very much,

131
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,330
guys,

132
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,120
for watching this video I'll see on the next one
