00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
Hey,

2
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.790
guys,

3
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.200
welcome backs in this video.

4
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.680
We're going to discuss another technique called the scrolling chart.

5
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.530
Okay,

6
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.010
so as you can see era,

7
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.670
I've got a scroll bar control,

8
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.430
and I've got some data here below it.

9
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.010
Okay?

10
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.400
And as you can see here as a scroll through using the scroll bar control,

11
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.180
the data in the table changes and the data plotted on this column chart as well changes.

12
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.980
Okay,

13
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.530
so let's see,

14
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.350
while you would need to use such a techniques,

15
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.770
I'm gonna go to a scroll bar chart analysis sheet here.

16
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.250
And as you can see here,

17
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.160
we've got a big data set,

18
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.920
okay?

19
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.620
Of months and their sales.

20
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.200
The data actually spends between 2010 until 2000 and 14.

21
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.730
So let's say we want to draw a column chart for that data set.

22
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.110
I'm gonna highlight it,

23
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.790
go to insert here,

24
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.760
and then go to my column charts and just Joey column chart.

25
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.810
And as you can see here,

26
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.150
if you draw a column chart for that is gonna be a long charter is not gonna be pretty.

27
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.740
You know,

28
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.260
it's it's not gonna look good,

29
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.570
cause we've got a lot of data points.

30
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.500
So maybe if we have some sort of a method or technique to reduce the number of data points

31
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.500
,

32
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.500
but at the same time be able to scroll through all the data points,

33
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.760
that would be better.

34
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.270
Okay,

35
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.750
maybe we can go year by year.

36
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.650
Says to compare the sales for the same year of different months of the same year together.

37
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.790
Like to compare the sales of the different months in 2010 together and then compare the

38
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.700
sales of the different months of 2011 as well together,

39
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.030
you know,

40
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.180
because the months of a certain year would have a something in common,

41
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.880
which is that they are in the same year.

42
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.410
Okay,

43
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.960
I'm just gonna delete this chart here,

44
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.350
and I'm going to go back to the scrolling chart tub to see how we can implement that.

45
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.650
Okay,

46
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.890
guys.

47
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.290
So this chart here is just charting this table,

48
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.000
OK?

49
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.540
And you can see her.

50
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.640
That row number 15 is hidden,

51
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.580
so I'm just gonna hide it here because there's something here in row number 15.

52
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.350
Okay,

53
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.620
so there are numbers.

54
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.030
Okay.

55
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.910
And you can see her that this cell here,

56
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.620
so be 15 has a value of one,

57
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.530
and then,

58
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.020
ah,

59
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.590
the cell C 15 has a value of B 15 plus one.

60
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.510
And then you know D 15 is C 15 plus one.

61
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.810
So each cell increments one or adds extra one to the cell before it.

62
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.280
Okay,

63
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.970
when you go from left to right,

64
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.660
and if we use the scroll bar control,

65
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:47.080
you can see here that actually the numbers are in commenting forwards up until 60.

66
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.650
Okay,

67
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.000
because we've got five years by 12 months,

68
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.300
has 60 points.

69
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.320
This is why the maximum number here is a 60 or the number on the very right is the 60.

70
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.060
Okay.

71
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.190
And let's check here in the hour.

72
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.970
Scroll bar form control,

73
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.810
check.

74
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.730
How is configured?

75
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.080
So I'm going to,

76
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.300
right?

77
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.100
Click and click on format control.

78
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.890
And as you can see here,

79
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.900
this score bar from control is linked to Selby 15 okay?

80
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.340
And the minimum value is one,

81
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.680
and the maximum value is 49.

82
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.690
And the reason for that is that first,

83
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.340
the minimum value is gonna be a one.

84
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.910
Okay.

85
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.270
And then as you scroll forward with the incremental change and the paid change,

86
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.670
Okay?

87
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.080
They both scroll forwards by 12 months is gonna be one and then adding 12 to scroll one

88
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.970
year forwards gonna be 13 and then another 12 to scroll the second year.

89
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.420
Poor.

90
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.770
Would this gonna be 25?

91
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.180
Okay.

92
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.530
And then 37 then 49.

93
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.660
So this is why the maximum value is 49 cases.

94
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.640
This is by scrolling forward by an extra four years.

95
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.250
Okay.

96
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.700
And so the incremental changes a 12 year,

97
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.290
which is when you press on the buttons for the school bar control and the page changes Well

98
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.290
,

99
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.400
when you press in the middle,

100
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.310
okay,

101
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.210
is also a 12.

102
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.950
Okay,

103
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.820
also,

104
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.130
guys,

105
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.060
if we check the form,

106
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.680
it is here in rose 16 and 17.

107
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.920
We can see here that we've got a V look up formula is looking up the months and the sales

108
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.200
from the score bar chart analysis sheet here.

109
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.180
OK?

110
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.170
And we've offset the value of the column index number that we're getting actually from bro

111
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.860
15

112
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.730
Ok,

113
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.380
so actually,

114
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.350
the V lookups are getting there.

115
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.100
Column index number values from row 15 but it's offset.

116
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.190
They plus one okay.

117
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.770
To make sure that we get the correct values from the school bar chart analysis.

118
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.080
Okay,

119
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.630
because there's an extra column here.

120
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.230
That is the month and the sales.

121
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.510
Okay,

122
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.260
so this is why we ops offset the column in X number by a plus one cause,

123
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.120
for example,

124
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.340
January 11 is in the 13th Column,

125
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.630
but we need to start the look of from this column.

126
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.830
This is why we add a plus one to account for that,

127
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.950
to be able to get the value for January 11 that month correctly,

128
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.620
and also to be able to get the this value for its sales correctly as well.

129
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.360
Okay,

130
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.650
okay,

131
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.460
guys said this is basically the scrolling charts technique,

132
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.010
guys.

133
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.770
It's a very easy technique.

134
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.300
It's similar to the techniques that was seen with the scroll Bar control previously,

135
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.920
OK,

136
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.510
and this just got a schooling chart days,

137
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.260
incremental numbers,

138
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.070
and these numbers are connected to the look of form.

139
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.400
It is so that we're able to look up the correct values.

140
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.710
Okay,

141
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.760
and we make sure to offset,

142
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.400
for example,

143
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.640
the column index number by one if we need to,

144
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.740
so that we can get the correct values,

145
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.160
OK,

146
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.480
and basically this chart is just charting.

147
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.340
This stable is starting a static table OK?

148
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.340
Or is charting the table aesthetically.

149
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.420
But the values in the table are just dynamic.

150
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.790
Okay,

151
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.070
So,

152
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.130
like Ah,

153
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.600
the table is static.

154
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.030
The table is self aesthetic,

155
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.970
but the values are dynamic and they change as you're using this cool bar control.

156
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:15.710
OK,

157
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.390
so sick.

158
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.890
Basically.

159
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:17.170
Guys,

160
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.520
for the schooling chart technique.

161
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.320
Thank you very much for watching this video.

162
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.750
I'll see you on the next one.
