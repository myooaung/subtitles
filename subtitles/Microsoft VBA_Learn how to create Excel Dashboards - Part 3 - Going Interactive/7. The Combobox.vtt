Hey,

2
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.760
guys,

3
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.440
welcome back.

4
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.330
So in this video,

5
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.830
we're going to speak about another form control,

6
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.110
which is the combo box.

7
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.030
So the combo box is similar to the list box.

8
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.330
It enables us to collect an item from a list.

9
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.050
OK,

10
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.160
but it's the only difference is that the list box shows all the items in the list at the

11
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.760
same time,

12
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.880
so you can see them at the same time.

13
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.530
However,

14
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.200
on the combo box,

15
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.920
you need to actually cascade the combo box to be able to see your item.

16
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.340
Okay,

17
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.440
but they work pretty much the same way.

18
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.510
They both enable us to select an item from a list.

19
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.410
Okay.

20
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.250
And if you right click on a combo box and click on Former Control,

21
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.390
you can see where this got the same inputs.

22
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.040
So we've got the import trains,

23
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.950
which is basically your list and also the Cell Inc.

24
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.850
Which is basically the cell that's gonna help put the ordinary position off the item.

25
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.730
Okay.

26
00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.100
And you've got the drop down lines Here is how maney items you can see when you cascade the

27
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.560
list.

28
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.550
OK,

29
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.850
so how many items you can see straight away and they're more than that number of items

30
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.270
you'll have.

31
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.500
Ah,

32
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.250
scroll bar on the right here to just scroll through the items.

33
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.450
Okay.

34
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.770
Now,

35
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.820
let's see how we can insert a combo box.

36
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.950
You can go to the developer tab on the ribbon,

37
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.310
click on insert,

38
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.650
and then click on combo box here.

39
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.050
And then you can just draw your combo box like that.

40
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.030
Okay?

41
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.480
And you can just right click,

42
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.510
click on form and control and start for months and get there Is the three d o a shading

43
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.260
option as well,

44
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.700
which is an aesthetic option,

45
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.750
as we have seen before.

46
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.550
Okay,

47
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.610
that's it,

48
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.270
Guys for the kobo box.

49
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.260
This is just a quick introduction about it,

50
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.030
because this very same Merton list box.

51
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.700
If you know how to work with the list box,

52
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.080
you're gonna be able to work with the combo box and we're going to see ah applications for

53
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.270
in the upcoming videos.

54
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.550
