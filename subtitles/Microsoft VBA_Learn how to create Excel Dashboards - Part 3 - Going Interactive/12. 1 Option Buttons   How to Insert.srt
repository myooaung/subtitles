00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Hi,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:02,630
guys.

3
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,140
Welcome backs In this video,

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,310
we're going to discuss option buttons,

5
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,710
and sometimes they're cold radio buttons,

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,040
so option buttons enable us to create lists.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,620
However,

8
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,680
unlike the list boxes,

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,540
for example,

10
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,660
where only one list box would contain the whole list in case of option buttons.

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,920
If you've got a list,

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,940
you need to ah,

13
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,890
sign an option button to each item in the list.

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,800
Okay,

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,730
so let's check here the option buttons that I've got here,

16
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,980
inserted on the sheet.

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,080
If I right click on that PCs option button on,

18
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,710
I go to former control.

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,910
I'll see that it on option button would have only one,

20
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,470
ah,

21
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,770
inputs that you need to give to it,

22
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,920
which is the selling.

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,000
And if we check the selling here,

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,250
it's the Selby 20 in the analysis time,

25
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,380
okay?

26
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,410
And,

27
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:58,850
ah,

28
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,340
if we check the option button Okay,

29
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,250
we will see that in the analysis.

30
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,680
Stab in Selby 20.

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,500
It's got the number once it's produced the number one in the selling,

32
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,250
and if we check laptops,

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,800
it's produced the number two,

34
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,460
and if you check tablets,

35
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,880
it's produced the number three.

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,960
The reason for that is that the option button for PCs is the first option button that has

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,090
been inserted on the sheet on This is why it produces the number one and the second one

38
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,420
here.

39
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,850
Laptops has been inserted second in order of insertion on the sheet.

40
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,310
This is why produces number two and tablets has been asserted.

41
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:39,870
Third,

42
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,810
and this is why produces the number three and so on and so forth.

43
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,210
So let's see how we can insert an option button.

44
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,990
We would need to go to the developer.

45
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,860
Tab on the ribbon will click on Insert on.

46
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,060
Then we will click on Option Button.

47
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,250
We will dro our option button here.

48
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,890
Then we're going to right click on it and click on Edit Texts were gonna name that Mobil's

49
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,760
for the fourth item in the list.

50
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,430
Now I'm going to right click on it to format it,

51
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,920
and what we will see here is that Excel as recognized.

52
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,420
I've got already option buttons on this sheet,

53
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,470
and they are assigned.

54
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,450
The selling could be 20 so it's actually assigned at the cell link of B 20.

55
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,430
In the analysis,

56
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,300
stab to the fourth option,

57
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,210
but of inserted for Mobil's,

58
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,290
so actually was Excel was smart enough to determine that I've already got option buttons.

59
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:33,730
So,

60
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,470
um,

61
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,260
you know what most probably need this option button to be.

62
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,100
Ah,

63
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,270
having this selling here the same selling as the previous three.

64
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,110
Okay,

65
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,570
so a press OK here,

66
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,230
and I'll check the option button for Mobil's,

67
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,240
as you can see her because it was inserted as the fourth option button s.

68
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,450
So it's produced the number four here on the selling.

69
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,280
Another way to create an option button is by copying and existing one.

70
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,140
So I'm gonna select the my Mobil's option button here by right clicking on it and then left

71
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,260
clicking on the edge.

72
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,890
And then if I press my control key,

73
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,700
you'll see that there is a plus sign here appearing on my cursor.

74
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,180
And if I,

75
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,950
uh,

76
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:27,850
press my left mouse button and drag this option button and then you can see her that by

77
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,410
pressing my control and my left most click,

78
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,210
I can put it anywhere on the sheet over.

79
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,020
If I also in addition to my control and left mouse button,

80
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,650
I pressed this shift key on my keyboard.

81
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,450
I can make sure that I can Onley copy it ah,

82
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,200
aligned with with the original one,

83
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,850
either horizontally or vertically.

84
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,730
Okay,

85
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,250
so if you press your shift while pressing your control and left click,

86
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,410
you can make sure that it's aligned with the previous option button.

87
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,670
And now I'm gonna release my left.

88
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,130
Most click as you can see her.

89
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,350
It's been copied,

90
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,330
and it's got the same name as the original one that we've copied from.

91
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,360
If we right,

92
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,390
click on it and go to former Control if you consider that it's ah,

93
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,110
been given the same cell link as the previous one.

94
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,800
And if you check that option,

95
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,070
button the new one here,

96
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,960
you can see area that it's producing the number five on the selling because this is the

97
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,790
fifth option button there's been inserted on the sheet.

98
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,350
I'm gonna delete it because we don't need it anymore.

99
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,860
You can also copy several option buttons at the same time.

100
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,960
So more than one option button you can right click on one of them and then,

101
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,340
while pressing your shift key,

102
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,070
you're going to right click on the others year to select them on.

103
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,080
Then you're gonna press your control key,

104
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,140
and you're going to see this plus sign our new cursor,

105
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,150
you're gonna copy them by dragging them whether you're left,

106
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,770
click and while pressing your control key.

107
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,550
And if you need them to be aligned either horizontally or vertically with the previous ones

108
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:13,550
,

109
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,670
you compress your shift key as well.

110
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,140
In addition to your control.

111
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,650
Unless Les Miles Button,

112
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,820
you're gonna release your left click here and there you go.

113
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,480
They have been copied.

114
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,970
And,

115
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,300
of course,

116
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,150
they're going to be linked to the same cell link just as we copy the single option bun.

117
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,980
Okay,

118
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,200
I'm gonna delete them now,

119
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,900
guys,

120
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,860
because we don't need them.

121
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,500
One more thing I need to explain here is that sometimes when you insert an option button

122
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,280
because Excel considers your objects to be in different liars.

123
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,370
So sometimes when you insert the option button,

124
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,780
it would be in the layer in the very back.

125
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,870
So I mean,

126
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,940
I've inserted the option,

127
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,650
but in here,

128
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,400
But in this case it was in the layer that is in the front.

129
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,020
However,

130
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,520
let's put it in the layer that is in the very back by going to order here and then put it

131
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,890
on centre back.

132
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,660
So sometimes,

133
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,710
if you sometimes when you insert an option,

134
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,040
but it would be in the layer in the very back.

135
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,390
So if you try to put it on top of your chart here or in top of an object on top of a shape

136
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,390
,

137
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,980
for example,

138
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,580
any other object,

139
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,040
it would be in the very back,

140
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,850
so you won't be able to see it.

141
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,280
So in this case,

142
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,160
what you need to do is to right click on it and go to order.

143
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,870
And then,

144
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,220
uh,

145
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,930
you're going to bring it to front.

146
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,800
To this way.

147
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,580
It would be in the layer in the very front on your,

148
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:40,860
uh,

149
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,300
off your sheet here and you be able to put it on top off another object,

150
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,200
which in this case,

151
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,750
is the chart.
