1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
Okay,

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,100
guys.

3
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,790
So now we're going to speak about the check box form control.

4
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:10,340
And as you can see her as I take an antic the check box here on the left,

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,230
the orange Siris for average,

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,250
it appears and disappears,

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,120
as you can see here.

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,510
So,

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:16,800
actually,

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,550
the orange Siris for the average sales for 2014 it is linked to this check box.

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,310
Is Aziz You can see on also in this cell here if you check it.

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,820
When?

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,400
When this check boxes checked the cell up.

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,230
It's a true.

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,930
And when this check boxes unchecked,

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,060
the cell opus a false.

17
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,550
Okay,

18
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,550
so this cell as well is linked to the check box,

19
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,920
and this is actually how you create the interactivity.

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,320
Okay,

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:47,680
guys,

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,910
let's see how you can insert a check box are going to go to the developer top on the ribbon

23
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,610
here and click on insert.

24
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,520
Okay.

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,940
And then you're gonna select the check box.

26
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,690
Here is the check box shape here.

27
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,850
You're gonna click on it and then left.

28
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,330
Click and drag to dro your check box.

29
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:07,950
Okay.

30
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,010
So you can see here.

31
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,110
It's been inserted with a default name.

32
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,580
You can Ah change its name if you want.

33
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,100
Okay,

34
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,260
so I'm gonna call it my check box,

35
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,070
for example.

36
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,650
Okay.

37
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,090
So Ah.

38
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,660
Now,

39
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,600
in order to create the link with the cell,

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,100
you need to configure the check box.

41
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,450
Okay,

42
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,130
So going to right?

43
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,750
Click on it and click on formal control.

44
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,570
Okay.

45
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,650
And as you can see here,

46
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,630
this is the window for formatting.

47
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,560
Your check box.

48
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,410
Um,

49
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,340
you can give it a three D shape boy.

50
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,900
Just checking this three d shading option.

51
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,530
Okay,

52
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,310
this is just a aesthetic option.

53
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:53,240
And now you can actually create the cell link through this box here so you can just click

54
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,050
on this blue button and then select a cell,

55
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,630
and then this cell will be linked to the chuck box and outputs a value of either true or

56
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,000
false,

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,080
depending on whether the check boxes checked or not.

58
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,390
Okay,

59
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,290
so if you check it,

60
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,850
this cell will help it.

61
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,520
It true,

62
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,810
if you on check it,

63
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,780
the cell would output a false Okay,

64
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,590
So using this information and the fact that it alpa's a true or false in a cell,

65
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,490
you can link a formula.

66
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,230
Okay,

67
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:28,290
That would actually be willing to that cell and depend on the value of the cells of the

68
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,360
cell value is true.

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,490
The formula would give us a certain result.

70
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,880
And if it is false,

71
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,350
then the former they would give us another result.

72
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,680
So if you can see here and the cells here representing the average,

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,520
you can see here that the formula in old the cells is basically the same.

74
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,130
And you can see her that it says if the value of cell K two is equal to true,

75
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,810
then give me the average.

76
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,010
And if if otherwise,

77
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,460
OK,

78
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,040
and other ways could be full,

79
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,190
sir,

80
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,510
could be any other value.

81
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,180
Okay,

82
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,750
then give me a hash and a okay.

83
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,010
It's gonna give us a hash and air.

84
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,280
This is the hash and air.

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,850
This is produced through the n A function.

86
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,150
Okay,

87
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,760
there is a function in excel that is called an A that you could use to produce the harsh

88
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,150
and a her Okay.

89
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:27,390
And this hash and a error is actually what results in the line disappearing.

90
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,980
Okay,

91
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,530
the line for the average sales.

92
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:30,820
Okay,

93
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,340
so if you check that here,

94
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,480
you consider that when the line disappears this is because there is a hash and a we cannot

95
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,580
use zero,

96
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,380
for example,

97
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:46,430
because if we make we make the formula produces zero in case of fools instead of the harsh

98
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,660
and a error this actually would not make the line disappear would just make it appear at

99
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,910
the bottom here.

100
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,490
Okay,

101
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,040
so Ah,

102
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,170
you need to use the hajj and a in order to make ah,

103
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,480
this line serious for the average disappear.

104
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,070
Okay,

105
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,680
so this is how you can use the check box guys to create interactivity to your dashboards.

106
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,330
Okay,

107
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:15,380
So thank you very much for watching this video and I'll see on the next one in all of the

108
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,850
cells is basically to say,
