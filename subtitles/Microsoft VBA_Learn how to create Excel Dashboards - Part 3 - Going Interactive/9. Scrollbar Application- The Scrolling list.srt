1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,330
Hey,

2
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,600
guys,

3
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,190
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,020
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,650
we're going to discuss another application for this crowbar control,

6
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,390
which is the scrolling list says he could see here.

7
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,970
I've got a list of names.

8
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,860
This list contains 10 names.

9
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,480
Okay.

10
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,510
And as you can see here,

11
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,410
I'm able to use a scroll bar control toe scroll through more than 10 names,

12
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:18,910
actually.

13
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,250
So I've got 100 names,

14
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,610
actually behind the scenes,

15
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:27,270
and I'm able to use this crowbar control here to scroll through the 100 names in Onley.

16
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,160
10 records.

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,550
Okay.

18
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,610
And as you can see here,

19
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,760
the values of the records are changing.

20
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,370
Basically.

21
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,200
So let's see the road data behind that.

22
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,070
Since you can see here,

23
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,020
we've got the on this road data sheet here.

24
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,680
We've got the 100 names,

25
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,180
Okay,

26
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,980
Got 100 records,

27
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,190
and I've created actually an I.

28
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,960
D column.

29
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,270
OK,

30
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,340
so it's calm that I've created here,

31
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,120
and all that does is that it increments by one.

32
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,490
Okay,

33
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,990
just counts the names.

34
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,470
Okay,

35
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,210
So is get numbers between one and 100 is just counting the names.

36
00:00:59,210 --> 00:00:59,860
Okay,

37
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,500
you can either create a calm formula or you can just,

38
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,130
you know,

39
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,120
type one here.

40
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,400
And then when you drug that you know,

41
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,050
excel,

42
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:13,640
we'll give you the option to fill the Siri's year with with the one from between one on 100

43
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:13,640
.

44
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,000
So it's really up to you.

45
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,030
You can do it using any method that you would like.

46
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,810
Okay.

47
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,670
And,

48
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,120
ah,

49
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:27,080
let's go to actually the explanation sheet here to explain how we have done that.

50
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,060
Okay,

51
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,200
So to do that,

52
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,840
you need to create the same columns as your road eight up plus the i.

53
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,510
D column.

54
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,020
Okay,

55
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,750
that you created on the road data.

56
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,250
And also,

57
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,480
you need to have a scroll bar control inserted.

58
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,110
Okay.

59
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,470
And then on the i D.

60
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,280
Column here,

61
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,950
you need to type a one,

62
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,560
and then you can type a formula on the second row here on the just to sell below it.

63
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,050
OK,

64
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,450
which is the starting number for the I d.

65
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,480
Plus one.

66
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,350
And then you can drag the formula to the lost row here.

67
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,850
Okay.

68
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,930
To the 10 throw.

69
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,580
So you've got 10 rows or 10 records and you're gonna be able to display ah 100 names on

70
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,120
these 10 records and the reason of done this plus one formula is that we're gonna have this

71
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,550
crowbar control connected to the cell here,

72
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,090
having the idea of one which is Selby to.

73
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,560
And then when this crowbar control increments numbers these numbers as well will be

74
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,200
incremental did with it,

75
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,770
okay?

76
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,300
Or these numbers will basically offset be offset by one.

77
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,930
And then,

78
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,320
you know,

79
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,620
this number will be offset from this number by one and so on so forth.

80
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,020
So when When the i d.

81
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,740
Contains 20 for example,

82
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,530
this one will contain 21.

83
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,480
And then this 1 22 and then this 1 23 and so on and so forth.

84
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,100
Okay.

85
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,120
Okay.

86
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,980
So after inserting our score,

87
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,720
bar control,

88
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,030
we would need to configure it.

89
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,360
So I'm going to right click on it here and click on format control.

90
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
And ah,

91
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,190
first of all,

92
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,780
the current value,

93
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,860
you could put it as one.

94
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,880
Or you can put it at as any value will change anyways,

95
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,390
okay.

96
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,210
And then the minimum value is gonna be a one,

97
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,080
because this crowbar control is gonna be connected to Selby too.

98
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,930
Okay,

99
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,120
So you'd want our minimum value to be a one,

100
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,030
because this is the minimum value and Selby to and this is actually are released.

101
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,950
I d number.

102
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,510
Okay,

103
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,260
so this is why it is the one.

104
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,970
And then the maximum by value is gonna be 91.

105
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,570
In our case,

106
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,110
if you've got 100 records.

107
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:36,620
The reason for that is that if this is 91 than the following one is going to be 92 93 94 95

108
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,970
96 97 98 99 then 100.

109
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,560
Because so because we have got a total of 100 records.

110
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,080
Okay,

111
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,970
we would want this to be 90 ones that the other nine cells would add up to.

112
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,390
Ah,

113
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,640
100 Basically.

114
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,280
Okay.

115
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,150
And then the incremental change is gonna be a 10.

116
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,310
So that's every time you press on the scroll bar buttons.

117
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,120
This number,

118
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,410
this idea number would be incriminated by 10.

119
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,230
Okay.

120
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,290
And then the page change is gonna be 10 as well.

121
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,390
Which is when you click in the middle of this crowbar control.

122
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,300
Okay.

123
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,250
And our cell link is gonna be cell B two,

124
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,110
okay?

125
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,310
And get a three d shading his roles are gonna click.

126
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,870
OK?

127
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,540
And as you can see here when we use the scroll bar control the numbers on the I d get

128
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,590
incremental because the first number gets increment id here by 10 and then the other

129
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,280
numbers air linked by formulas so they get incremental by one,

130
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,500
as you can see here.

131
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,080
Okay,

132
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,170
so the next step here is to actually look up the names from the road data worksheet.

133
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,330
So to look up,

134
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,960
the names were actually going to use this.

135
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,590
I d.

136
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,530
Number here to look up the names and actually phone numbers and country and city and street

137
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,610
address from the road data tables were going to use a V look of formula.

138
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,380
Okay.

139
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,950
And we're gonna look up the i d number.

140
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,510
Okay?

141
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,160
And we're gonna actually absolute the column part because we need to drag the formula to

142
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,650
the right,

143
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,550
and then our table array is going to be this stable here.

144
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,210
Okay?

145
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,740
And you can also use a dynamic range and put that table and Anoma cranes if you need to

146
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,430
allow for any expansion and our column index number.

147
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,350
Okay,

148
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,670
our column index number is gonna be basically in this case there for looking up the name.

149
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,850
It's gonna be too.

150
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,790
And then the range look up is gonna be an exact match.

151
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,770
So free closer brackets and press enter is you can see her.

152
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,300
We're able to look up the names and when we scroll through the names air changing.

153
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,790
Okay,

154
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,750
So for the phone number,

155
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,230
it's the same for men.

156
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:57,470
Except that we need to change our column in X number two or three and for the country need

157
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,740
to change it to a four and so on and so forth.

158
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,150
So we need to change the column.

159
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,850
Index number.

160
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,270
Okay,

161
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,170
So a better trick to use rather than just changing the column index number manually for

162
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,050
each column is to actually used the columns function.

163
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,040
So I was We've learned on a previous video the columns function.

164
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,360
What it does is that it counts the columns in a range.

165
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,740
Okay,

166
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,600
so on the name column here,

167
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,970
you can use the columns and actually highlights columns.

168
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,560
A to be.

169
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,480
I'm just gonna close my brackets here,

170
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:37,420
and you can actually absolute just the first part off the columns formula here.

171
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:37,890
Okay.

172
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,960
So I'm just gonna absolute the first part,

173
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,110
which is column A and I'm gonna leave Column B two B relative.

174
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,910
So in this case is gonna count Columns eight to be on the name column.

175
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,650
However,

176
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,260
on the phone number column,

177
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:01,030
the countings going to be expanded to be from columns A to see because the reference on the

178
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,000
ending column part is relative.

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,110
It's not absolute,

180
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,150
so it's not fixed.

181
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,190
So it's expanding.

182
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,250
And if if I expend the formula here or if a drag it to the right,

183
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,400
you can see here that the reference for the ending column is expending.

184
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,170
So as you can see here,

185
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,030
this is a better way to do it,

186
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,660
actually,

187
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:26,070
rather than just manually typing the column index number as we've learned on a previous

188
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,530
video.

189
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,220
OK,

190
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,390
so actually,

191
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,350
as you can see her weaken,

192
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,160
try our list.

193
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,490
And it's working absolutely fine as the the example that was seen.

194
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:35,920
Okay,

195
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,640
so now we're gonna discuss as well another possibility.

196
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,030
So what if we need to allow for the expansion off the list?

197
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,520
Okay,

198
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,060
so what if we need to allow the user to,

199
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,330
like,

200
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,470
add more than 100 names to the roadie to list?

201
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,020
Okay,

202
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,180
so how do we allow for that expansion?

203
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,500
So I'm gonna go back here to my explanation sheet and I'm going to right click here on my

204
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,290
scroll Bar Control.

205
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:07,900
And let's say we put the maximum value to be 200 instead of 91 let's scroll through the

206
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,170
names and see what's gonna happen.

207
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,550
So as you can see here after the 100th name,

208
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,150
we've got actually hash and a error.

209
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,580
So the reason for that is that the I d names are actually incremental ing,

210
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,210
and they're going past 100.

211
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,140
And we're doing the look up using V look up and were not able to find the I.

212
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,310
D.

213
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,520
Number 104 for example.

214
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,270
And this is giving us an error.

215
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:38,750
So actually to kind of mitigate that and make sure we allow for the expansion as well

216
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,040
without getting these errors,

217
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,340
Okay,

218
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,060
because the user's seeing the hash and a er is not gonna look good.

219
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,850
Okay,

220
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:53,060
is that we're actually gonna put an if air for the four minute here for the V look of

221
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:59,560
formers who can put in if error and then we're gonna make the the cells display a blank

222
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,870
value instead of the hash and a error.

223
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,220
Okay,

224
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,230
so in case of having an error,

225
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,000
we're going to display a blank value.

226
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,850
We're actually going to do that.

227
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,930
As you can see here is displaying a blank value,

228
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,620
which looks,

229
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:12,990
ah,

230
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,220
lot better than the hash and air.

231
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,700
Okay,

232
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,890
so when When the user is crawling through the list,

233
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,260
Okay,

234
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,820
I don't see any names than the list is done.

235
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,230
This is the limit for for my name's basically and this looks much better.

236
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,200
You can also type something else.

237
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,580
Which is,

238
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,320
for example,

239
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,550
end of list A swell.

240
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,110
You know,

241
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,920
she can type that make it end of list or something.

242
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,570
You know,

243
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,440
the possibilities are basically endless here.

244
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,090
Ah,

245
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,450
the possibilities are infinite.

246
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,530
Utkan apply whatever idea you would like basically OK.

247
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:53,790
And one more thing off course to note is that the i d number should be hidden.

248
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,310
Okay.

249
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,250
When the user is crawling through the list,

250
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:56,730
Actually,

251
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,020
this is the form that's gonna appear to the user gonna hide the I d.

252
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,300
Number guys.

253
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,320
We're just gonna have name,

254
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,850
full number,

255
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,280
country,

256
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,540
city and street address,

257
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,650
and the user is gonna scroll through the list this way using this crowbar control.

258
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:16,090
So this was an explanation and how to create a scrolling list using the school bark control

259
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:16,090
.

260
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:16,840
Thank you very much,

261
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,080
guys,

262
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,760
for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
