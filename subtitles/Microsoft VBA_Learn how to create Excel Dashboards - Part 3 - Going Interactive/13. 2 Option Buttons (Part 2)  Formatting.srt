1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,980
one more thing I need to show you is that weaken group option buttons together so that we

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,310
can deal with them as one unit so they can be moved together.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:11,930
For example,

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,250
is one unit or copy together as one unit as well?

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,340
How we can do that is by selecting all the option buttons.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,400
So I'm going to right click on one of them here and then press my shift key and then right

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,400
,

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,850
click,

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,450
right click,

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,590
right click on the others here.

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,810
And then I'm gonna go to the format top on the ribbon.

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,350
I'm going to click on the group,

13
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,650
but in here,

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,480
I'm gonna click group again.

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,730
Okay?

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,670
And now,

17
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,380
as you can see her,

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,250
they have been grouped together,

19
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,190
okay?

20
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,940
And they can be moved as one unit together,

21
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,990
and we ca Nhan group them as well by following the same steps.

22
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,450
Except we click on one group instead of group.

23
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,750
Okay,

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,170
Okay,

25
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:02,200
I So one more thing I want to show you is how to align the ocean buttons if they are

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,680
scattered.

27
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,870
So when I'm going to do,

28
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,050
I'm gonna scratch them.

29
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,260
I'm bright clicking here on my tablets and dragging with my right click on.

30
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,560
Then I'm going to click on move here.

31
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,730
When I get this menu menu on,

32
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,810
I'm going to do the same thing with my PCs.

33
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,230
And now I'm going to select my Mobil's option button here would by right clicking and

34
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,490
pressing on the edge here.

35
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,210
And because this is the first option button there has been selected all the other option

36
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:28,580
buttons.

37
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,350
I'm just selecting the other ones here,

38
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,530
Um,

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,620
and all the option.

40
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,960
Other option buttons will be aligned to,

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,920
ah,

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,490
to this Mobil's option that I'm gonna line to the left edge of the Mobil's option button so

43
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,290
they'd be all aligned vertically to that.

44
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,190
It's left edge going electric on format here on the ribbon.

45
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,370
And then I'm going to click on a line and then press a line left.

46
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,920
And now they they have been all aligned Teoh,

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,350
the left edge of Mobil's.

48
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,650
There are also other options here for a line center.

49
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,190
Align right and you know,

50
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,030
different options.

51
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,550
Feel free guys to experiment with them.

52
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,020
Another option is well.

53
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,220
That you can do is that you can distribute them vertically.

54
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,240
Ah,

55
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,610
and this is to create equal spaces between them.

56
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,310
However,

57
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,720
these equal spaces are created between their top edges and their top,

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,630
the top edge of one of them and the bottom edge of the other here.

59
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,940
So this is why,

60
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,050
actually,

61
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,150
there isn't unequal space between oldest circles here,

62
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,370
so all the circus don't have equal spaces between them.

63
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,400
So what you need to do in this case is to select all of them and give them,

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,200
um,

65
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,920
a unified size.

66
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,040
So I'm going to give them,

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,900
give them a size,

68
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,430
for example.

69
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,950
But off half an inch by an inch,

70
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,060
for example.

71
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,910
So now they all have the same size.

72
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,880
Okay,

73
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,450
I'm gonna click on a line again,

74
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,750
and then I'm going to click on distribute vertically.

75
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,820
And now,

76
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,840
as you can see here,

77
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,880
all the circles have equal spaces between them.

78
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,850
Okay.

79
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,580
Okay,

80
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:11,870
guys.

81
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:18,600
So I'm gonna select all my option buttons here by pressing the control key.

82
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,330
And while pressing the control key,

83
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,950
I'm going to right click on each of them.

84
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,990
And then I'm gonna left click and try to drag them.

85
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,910
And as you can see here,

86
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,450
I can put them just about anywhere on the worksheet.

87
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,590
They can move freely.

88
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,760
Okay?

89
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,370
and there is an option here that you want to show you.

90
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,770
I'm going to go to the former tub on the ribbon.

91
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,950
I'm gonna click on a line and then I'm going to click on snap to grid.

92
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,500
Okay,

93
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,460
on.

94
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,660
And as you can see here,

95
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,230
there is ah,

96
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,280
some sort of ah,

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,400
green lining around the shape here on the borders.

98
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,940
So that means that the option is turned on.

99
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,030
And if you try to move them this way,

100
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,670
if you try to move your option buns after ah,

101
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,310
selecting snap to grid,

102
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,550
you can see here that they cannot move Freedy as they were doing previously.

103
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,990
They need to be aligned to the the Excel grid,

104
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,600
so they need to be aligned vertically here to a column,

105
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,300
for example.

106
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,620
Okay,

107
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,140
s So this is another option that you can use while moving your ah,

108
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:35,950
your option buttons or your or any shape actually in excel to make sure that it aligns with

109
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,670
the grit.

110
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,690
Okay,

111
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:43,230
