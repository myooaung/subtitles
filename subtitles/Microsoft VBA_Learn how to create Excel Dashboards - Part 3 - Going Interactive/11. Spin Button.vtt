00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
Hi,

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.160
guys.

3
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.080
Welcome backs in this video,

4
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.680
we're going to discuss the spin button control to spin button control.

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.970
It's got the same formatting or the same inputs when you try to format it as the scroll bar

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.540
control.

7
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.610
Except for the page change,

8
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.970
which is,

9
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.520
you know,

10
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.300
when you click in the middle of the scoreboard,

11
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.550
controls has got two buttons where if you click the button,

12
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.830
the has the up direction,

13
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.680
it increments up.

14
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.710
And if you click a button having the down direction order facing down,

15
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.990
basically it will,

16
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.450
um they will increments down.

17
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.900
It will increment lower with the incremental change.

18
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.030
So a zika NSEERS got a minimum value,

19
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.240
a maximum value and an incremental change doesn't have a page change,

20
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.630
and it's gotta sell Link.

21
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.280
Okay,

22
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.240
I've got here.

23
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.680
Ah,

24
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.170
ah,

25
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.990
loan calculator that built as an example on how to use the spin button you can see here.

26
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.360
We've got the loan amount,

27
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.810
the payments and the interest rate,

28
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:15.370
and what the monthly payment will be if you select this loan amount on payments and

29
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.010
interest rates.

30
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.950
So how much you're gonna pay per month?

31
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.140
Okay.

32
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.570
If we examine the first spin button,

33
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.740
I'm selecting the formatting for here.

34
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.750
You will see that the cell link is this cell,

35
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.650
okay?

36
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.640
And,

37
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.930
ah,

38
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.690
you'll see that there's there's an incremental change of only a five.

39
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.870
The reason for that is because the there is,

40
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.970
there are limitations on the implementation off the spin button control.

41
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.080
So the minimum can only be a zero on and maximum can only be 30,000 and the income on to

42
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.480
change between zero on 30,000 actually,

43
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.040
because the minimum and the maximum are between zero on 30,000 I cannot put anything more

44
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.270
ah than,

45
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.340
uh than that here on the minimum maximum value.

46
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.520
And because I want values here to appear,

47
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.150
there are more than 30,000.

48
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.120
Okay,

49
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.540
so what?

50
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.420
What I do is that I would link the spin button to this cell here,

51
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.360
and then this cell would simply take the number in this cellar multiplied by thousands.

52
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.510
Okay,

53
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.050
because I cannot if I want to reach this 115,000 figure here,

54
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.140
I cannot write it directly in the maximum value field here because the limit is between

55
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.670
zero and 30,000.

56
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.540
This is the limit.

57
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.310
Were off the numbers that you can put here in the spin button.

58
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.190
Okay.

59
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.990
This is why we're creating here some sort of an intermediate cell or a bridge cell that we

60
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.210
linked the spin button to it.

61
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.300
And then this cell just takes this the number in this cell and multiplies it by 1000.

62
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.150
Okay?

63
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.330
And I've put the incremental change by five,

64
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.150
and I'm multiplied by 1000 here.

65
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.990
That means that we increments by 5000 here on the loan amount.

66
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.050
Okay.

67
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.090
And,

68
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.450
ah,

69
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.160
put directly here.

70
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.300
Ah ah.

71
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:15.150
Put the number of payments are actually here in this cell and and linked the spin button to

72
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.380
this cell for the payments.

73
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.240
Because actually,

74
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.600
the months are well between the limits of zero on 30,000 and the incremental changes by six

75
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.960
months.

76
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.280
So you can take a loan and and have it for a year or a year and 1/2 2 years,

77
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.750
two years and 1/2 etcetera.

78
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.610
Okay.

79
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.050
And this is for four year and four years and 1/2.

80
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.400
54 months.

81
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.520
Okay.

82
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.610
And now there is something.

83
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.140
Also,

84
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.490
I need to ah,

85
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.510
explain about the interest rate.

86
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.240
Well,

87
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.690
the interest rate to get to 1%.

88
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.280
Okay,

89
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.370
to get a 1% you can either put one divided by 100 or 10 divided by 1000 or 100 divided by

90
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.270
10,000.

91
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.260
Okay.

92
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.590
However,

93
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.800
if we put one divided by 100 ah,

94
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.340
we will not be able to increment with the small in Currence such as open 05%.

95
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.710
Also,

96
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.460
the case if we put 10 divided by 1000 if you put the 1% is 10 defied,

97
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.410
divided by 1000.

98
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.350
So I'm just gonna It is straight that for you here,

99
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.450
um,

100
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.540
this spin button here are built,

101
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.280
okay?

102
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.460
And I put the minimum value as a 10 and the maximum value is 150.

103
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.410
Okay.

104
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.570
And if we divide this,

105
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.320
these figures 10 by but by 1000.

106
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.670
If I divide 10 by 1000 they'll give the 1% if a divide 1 50 boy ah,

107
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.480
1000

108
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.070
That would give the 15% okay,

109
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.430
15% interest.

110
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.310
So if I built it this way with this,

111
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.100
um,

112
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.310
spin button year and I link the spin button to this cell,

113
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.170
okay?

114
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.480
And I divide the amount,

115
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.110
um,

116
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.850
nor the number in this cell by 1000.

117
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.790
Okay,

118
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.980
So what would happen is that we would be only able to do,

119
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.650
like 5.5% 6% 6.5% 7%.

120
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.510
7.5% insider will be able to increment up by only opened 5%.

121
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.800
And that's okay if that's all what you need.

122
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.930
You don't wanna do 8.25% for example eight point 2%.

123
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.810
8.15%.

124
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.290
If you don't want to do that,

125
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.730
then absolutely go for it.

126
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.430
That's fine.

127
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.010
Over if you need more precise,

128
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.220
um,

129
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.320
selection or ah,

130
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.500
like if you need to have,

131
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.990
ah finer percentage or,

132
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.530
you know,

133
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.980
more precise selection of the percentage of the loan.

134
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.150
So you do like 2.25%.

135
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.720
2.3%.

136
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.610
2.35% 2.4%.

137
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.100
You know,

138
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.380
if you want to do this,

139
00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.890
it's better to do it,

140
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.950
or you won't be able to achieve that except if you do 1% as 100 divided by 10,000.

141
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:12.100
So that means if we'd write like red click on this spin button and do a formal control

142
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.380
press,

143
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.500
former control here would be having the limits between 115,000.

144
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.120
And of course,

145
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.660
they are linked to this cell.

146
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.690
Okay,

147
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.300
And this is Ah,

148
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.250
this is the cell here that is in commended by the spin button.

149
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:33.320
And then this cell simply takes the number in this cell here and divides it by 10,000.

150
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.510
To be able to achieve that.

151
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:44.010
And you'll see also that the incremental changes by a five when five is divided by 10 1000

152
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:51.170
you be able to achieve an incremental change of open old 5% which is open 05 divided by Ah

153
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.170
,

154
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.900
100

155
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.840
Okay,

156
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.720
so you can try it.

157
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.110
Guys,

158
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.600
please try to practice it to ah,

159
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.730
be ableto even understand it better or on If you try to practice that the concept will

160
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.950
stick to your head better basically.

161
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.060
Okay,

162
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.230
so this is a simple use of the spin button.

163
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.930
I typically don't use the spin button a lot in on my dashboards.

164
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.960
It's mainly used to incriminate numbers here.

165
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.020
Really?

166
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.040
I don't use it a lot.

167
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.020
I think people who,

168
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:34.320
um who use it are more use it more for for making forms for people to enter data like to

169
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.290
select numbers like this to increment them.

170
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.170
And so and normally,

171
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.310
uh,

172
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.610
are typically in these forms to be locking these cells.

173
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.380
Okay,

174
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.620
so they be right clicking on them,

175
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.370
collecting,

176
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.680
clicking and clicking on form it sells,

177
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.080
and them on the protection.

178
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.860
They would leave this this as locked,

179
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.360
OK?

180
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:02.770
And then they would lock the sheet by clicking on review tab on the ribbon and think they

181
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.180
can protect sheet here.

182
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.460
Um,

183
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:11.090
i'll be making ah video for for protecting sheets and workbooks.

184
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:25.770
One more thing.

185
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:26.700
I need to adhere.

186
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.040
Goings is that normally you be,

187
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.650
ah,

188
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:37.260
hiding the cells containing these bridge numbers or bridge selling cell links here.

189
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:43.200
So what you would do is that you would simply hide this column here if you're making ah

190
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.070
riel form and a real dashboard,

191
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.580
um,

192
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.900
to present it to,

193
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.690
ah,

194
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.040
client or customer.

195
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.010
So because you don't want them to see these breach cells,

196
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.340
you condone also,

197
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.080
uh,

198
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.920
make the funds invisible,

199
00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.050
make it ah,

200
00:08:59.050 --> 00:08:59.680
white fund,

201
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.310
for example,

202
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.840
in a white background so that you know,

203
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.200
it wouldn't have a color,

204
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.950
and the user wouldn't see them.

205
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.490
And of course,

206
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:13.710
as we explained you be locking these numbers is if you don't want them to under the numbers

207
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.260
manually.

208
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.010
Just want them to enter them.

209
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.580
Enter the numbers.

210
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.550
Um,

211
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.290
toe,

212
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.870
enter the numbers through the spin button.

213
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:27.400
You be locking these cells and locking these cells so that the only these air only be able

214
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.250
to enter the numbers through.

215
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.520
Ah,

216
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.420
the spin bone.

217
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.330
So thank you,

218
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:32.690
