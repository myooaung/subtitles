1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,250
Hey,

2
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,580
guys,

3
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,260
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,380
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,950
we're going to discuss another form control,

6
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,460
which is the list box.

7
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay,

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,010
so the list box is basically a form control that allows you to put items in the list and

9
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,390
toggle between them.

10
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,910
Select any one of them individually.

11
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,650
Okay.

12
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,880
As you consumerism,

13
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:27,290
selecting the different items I their sales and units sold get plotted on these two charts

14
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:27,290
.

15
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:27,650
Okay,

16
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,860
so each item select,

17
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,940
I get its sales and its units sold.

18
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,780
Okay,

19
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,130
so we're going to see how this works.

20
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,490
But before doing that,

21
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,220
we're going to see,

22
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:37,730
first of all,

23
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,000
how we can insert a list box.

24
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,320
OK,

25
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,390
so we're going to go to a developer tab on the ribbon click on insert on,

26
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,070
then choose the list box here,

27
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,340
and then we're going to click on it and then click on and drag to draw away.

28
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,150
OK,

29
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,020
so let's check It's formatting how to format it.

30
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,780
I'm going to right click on it and click on format control,

31
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,250
OK?

32
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,590
And ah,

33
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,360
you can see her.

34
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,320
There is an imp a trained and there's the cell link.

35
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,650
The import ranges basically the range of cells that contains your items.

36
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,380
Okay,

37
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,870
so is the range range of cells that would contain your list basically so that you could

38
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,450
generate a list out of that range of cells.

39
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,380
And there's also the selling,

40
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,680
which is basically the cell that you're gonna output three orginal position of the item

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,270
that you're going to select in.

42
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:30,900
OK,

43
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,770
so we're going to see that in action and for the selection type,

44
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,790
we're only going to bother with the single selection type because the multi and extend the

45
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,140
need vb a code to run we're not going to bother with.

46
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,490
That is outside the scope of the course.

47
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,280
And there is also the option for three D shading,

48
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,290
which gives it a bit of a three D.

49
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:50,740
Look,

50
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,660
it's an aesthetic option.

51
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,400
So I'm gonna click council here.

52
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm gonna bleat my list box.

53
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,440
I'm gonna check the configuration off this list box that I've got already up and running

54
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,750
year.

55
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,940
And as you can see here,

56
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,130
we've got an import train.

57
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,760
So to check that we can see her that in the analysis sheet get the impetus train jizz cells

58
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,450
before to be seven,

59
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,010
and we've got also the cell link.

60
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,070
It's actually Selby,

61
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,580
too,

62
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,700
As you can see here,

63
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,070
it's It's this cell here.

64
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,420
Be to this is the cell link.

65
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,340
And what this selling does is basically contains the order position of the item that we

66
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,950
select.

67
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,350
So as you can see her,

68
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,240
we've selected here PC's,

69
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,960
for example,

70
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,470
you consider that is gotta one.

71
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,150
If we select laptops,

72
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,000
this is the second item isn't in the list.

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,100
We're gonna have it too.

74
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,170
If was elect ablest,

75
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,330
we're gonna have a three and so on and so forth.

76
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,680
And this number is very useful because you can use it with an index function,

77
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,450
for example,

78
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,790
to get the name of the item that you selected,

79
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,430
for example.

80
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,690
Okay,

81
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,360
so putting a number here is is very useful,

82
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,990
and this can be used with lots of look of functions,

83
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,290
and it can be very useful.

84
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,150
Okay,

85
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,390
So one more thing is,

86
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,150
actually,

87
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,490
as you can see here,

88
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,120
when you select one of the items Onley,

89
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,200
that item appears on the chart and actually the rest of the items disappear.

90
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,730
So let me just explain to you the mechanism behind that.

91
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,600
So,

92
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,040
um,

93
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:27,640
these two charts here the sales reads from this range the sale stores here is the ah items

94
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,190
in the chart.

95
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,920
And these air the months and their values.

96
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,520
OK,

97
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,720
and the units sold.

98
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,490
It reads from this range Basically.

99
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,250
Okay.

100
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,880
And as you can see here,

101
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,390
I've set up the four minute here,

102
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,150
for example,

103
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,190
on the sale.

104
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,040
Start to check if,

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,640
ah,

106
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,290
if actually the number beside the item here.

107
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,180
So you can see here that on the items have got some numbers,

108
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,400
which is basically the ordinance position in the list.

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,150
Okay.

110
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,960
And I've set up actually the for minister,

111
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,820
that he would check that.

112
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,920
Ah,

113
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,730
the number of the item is equal to the list boxes selling value.

114
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,310
Okay.

115
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,620
And if that's the case,

116
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,370
then return some data from the sheet they scold,

117
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:16,930
rotated.

118
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,480
Let me just on hide that for you.

119
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,460
The row data sheet.

120
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,970
As you can see here,

121
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,930
it's reading its values from this sheet.

122
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,330
Okay,

123
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,040
so this is basically the shed that contains the source values,

124
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,680
and this is basically analysis.

125
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,940
Shed the intermediate sheet,

126
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,150
and this is basically the presentation sheet or the dashboard cheat.

127
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,900
Okay.

128
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,480
You remember guys when you spoke about the structure of a dashboard containing sheet for

129
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:39,900
road eight.

130
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,790
Another one for analysis and the 3rd 1 for your dashboard to output it or to show it to the

131
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,390
customer.

132
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,350
Okay,

133
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,910
so this is the analysis sheet here.

134
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:56,170
It's basically it checks if the item here is basically the one that you selected.

135
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,180
And if so,

136
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,930
it gets the value from the road data sheet,

137
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,460
and if it isn't,

138
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,390
it gets zero,

139
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,670
or it actually helps zero in the cell.

140
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,720
Okay,

141
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,430
So because the PC's is the items selected at the moment,

142
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,120
it's not opening a zero,

143
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,940
but here is actually out putting a zero.

144
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,900
But why is there not a zero?

145
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,450
They're actually blank cells.

146
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,420
Well,

147
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,530
the reason for that is that I have changed the formatting of the cells.

148
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:24,820
OK,

149
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,700
so I'm going to right click,

150
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,340
click on form.

151
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,680
It sells to show you that.

152
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,380
And as you can see here of change the formatting of the cells to show a blank value in case

153
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,250
you get a zero.

154
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:34,980
Okay.

155
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,380
Well,

156
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:35,650
um,

157
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,510
number formatting is a big topic,

158
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,340
and it probably needs a video all by itself.

159
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:40,650
Okay,

160
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,050
but,

161
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:41,940
um,

162
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,400
I'm gonna just make it shorter for you.

163
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,070
This part here the first part represents how Excel would deal with the number if it's

164
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,600
positive.

165
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,430
The second part here The general also represents how Excel would deal with it if it's a

166
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:56,820
negative,

167
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,550
and 1/3 part is how it deals with it.

168
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,710
If it's zero on the fourth,

169
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,570
but is how it deals with it if it's a text.

170
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,050
Okay,

171
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:11,090
so I've actually put put it to deal with it if it's zero to make it to give me a blank

172
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,570
value.

173
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:19,150
And the reason I'm doing that is because a blank value will just not show any labels on the

174
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,370
other items that are not selected.

175
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,050
Okay,

176
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,300
where is if you actually put it as a zero?

177
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,570
So let me just change that to zero just to show you here.

178
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,290
If you put it a zero,

179
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,270
for example,

180
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:39,640
you're gonna get zeros on the data labels here,

181
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,880
as you can see for the other items that you haven't selected.

182
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,160
Okay,

183
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,490
so this is to allow me to have the data labels for the items that are not selected.

184
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,360
Not so have zeros,

185
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,890
but to be blank.

186
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,580
OK,

187
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,250
so I'm actually just going to switch it back here,

188
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,780
my guy.

189
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,470
And the same goes for actually the chart at the bottom.

190
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,010
Okay,

191
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:06,890
I'm actually planning to make another video or by myself for number formatting cause the

192
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,540
big topic there needs to be discussed in and have a video all by itself.

193
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:11,950
Okay.

194
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:17,670
And the reason also I haven't used the hash and a that we used previously is for the same

195
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,990
reason.

196
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,280
If you use the hash and a,

197
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,090
it's going to appear on the daily data labels and you can try it yourself.

198
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,400
Okay,

199
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,700
so you can just try to open a hash and a or the n A function instead of a zero,

200
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,460
you'll see that it will appear on the data labels.

201
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:32,770
OK,

202
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,610
so this is kind of an exercise to do.

203
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:40,740
And one more thing I need to tell you as well is that the list box?

204
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,100
If I right click on it and click on form and control,

205
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:53,110
it actually can have a list through a named range instead of just ah range of cells.

206
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,590
OK,

207
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,670
so actually,

208
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,700
I've got a named range that I had created before.

209
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,130
It's called list Strange.

210
00:07:59,130 --> 00:07:59,450
Okay,

211
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,040
so far,

212
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,450
right click again here.

213
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,350
Quicken format control for right list range of the same spelling.

214
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,170
It's actually it actually can read it correctly,

215
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,250
and it will still have the correct items in the list.

216
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,050
Okay,

217
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,910
so that's perfect.

218
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,860
Thank you guys for watching this video.

219
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,990
If you have any questions,

220
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,370
leave them in the Q and A section.

221
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,190
Thank you very much for watching this video I'll see on the next.
