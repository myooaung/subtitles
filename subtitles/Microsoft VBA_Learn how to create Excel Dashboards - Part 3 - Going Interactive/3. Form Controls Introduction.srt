00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,170
Hey,

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,450
guys,

3
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,100
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,170
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,550
we're going to speak about form controls.

6
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:10,580
So form controls are objects that are available in excel that enable us to change some

7
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,550
parameters or some values.

8
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,220
And based on these changes that are done with form controls,

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,910
other values would change as well.

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,480
Like you would have this form control linked to a cell,

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,480
and it would help it.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,060
A number in that cell and then a formula would be linked to that numbers whenever that

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,320
number changes.

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,810
That formula changes.

15
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:38,240
And this room that could be opening some values to a charge to this enables you to control

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,180
the values in charts,

17
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,350
as we will see later on in the course.

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,680
So let's see.

19
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,970
The most common form controls are available in Excel These air not all the form controls,

20
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,670
but they're actually the most commonly used ones.

21
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,830
So we got our button with our combo box,

22
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,910
the spin button,

23
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,390
the scroll bar,

24
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,000
the shock box,

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,720
the option button and the list box.

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,110
And we're going to discuss all of these in detail in the upcoming videos.

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,370
So to get the form controls,

28
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,970
you need to have the developer top on the ribbon in your excel enabled.

29
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,320
And to enable the developer top.

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,080
You can simply right click here on the ribbon anywhere in the ribbon and then click on

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,740
customize the ribbon here and then under the customize ribbon top here under the main tabs

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:28,740
,

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,810
you'll have the developer top here.

34
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,850
Just check it and click.

35
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,570
OK,

36
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,360
Ok,

37
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,920
so this was a quick introduction to from Controls Guys on the upcoming videos were going to

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,570
discuss them in detail.

39
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,070
So thank you very much watching this video and I will see on the next one.
