00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,710
Hi,

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,000
guys.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,730
Welcome back.

4
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,600
So in this video,

5
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,460
we're going to discuss group boxes.

6
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:13,100
So group boxes enable you to create a different groups of option Dutton's so that each

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,490
group would have ah,

8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,770
separate selling.

9
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,340
So,

10
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,350
as you can see here,

11
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,270
I've got to group boxes.

12
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,160
And in each one,

13
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,800
I've got three option buttons,

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,670
okay?

15
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,210
And each group of option buttons housed in a group box have a different cell link.

16
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:30,540
So,

17
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,650
as you can see here,

18
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,180
the first,

19
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,730
uh,

20
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,250
group,

21
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,930
it has this the selling for the one for that selling yellow,

22
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,350
as you can see on the second group,

23
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,330
has ah,

24
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,370
selling quid that cell in blue.

25
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,640
Okay,

26
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,980
so this is useful if you want to create,

27
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,380
like,

28
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,760
two different filters on your charts,

29
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,450
like you'd have ah,

30
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,410
filter for the region and other filter for the product type,

31
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,150
for example.

32
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,010
Okay.

33
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,520
And of course,

34
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,680
we have explained how you can control charts with option buttons on the previous video,

35
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,010
so I'm going to show you how you can do that.

36
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,620
First of all,

37
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,490
you're going to go to the developer tab,

38
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,030
you're going to click on insert,

39
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,890
and then you're gonna click on this icon here for group books,

40
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,750
The one having X y Z on it.

41
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,310
And you're gonna draw your group bucks by dragging with your left most button on.

42
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,250
Then we're gonna insert an option button here,

43
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:38,240
and I'm gonna assign ah,

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,640
link cell to it.

45
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,580
I'm gonna great click and click on formal control,

46
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:50,020
and I'm gonna put a selling for it here and now.

47
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,550
If you click that option button,

48
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,980
it gives us the number one.

49
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,300
And this is ah,

50
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,360
separated from the others.

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,510
And as you can see here,

52
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,760
although this is the seventh option,

53
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,190
but the husband inserted because it's in a group box of its own and the others are in group

54
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,210
box of their own.

55
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,000
You know,

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,010
Excel starts counting again from one on the linked seller on the selling.

57
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,830
Okay,

58
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,070
You know,

59
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,420
if you insert the other option button here Ah,

60
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,080
and if you right click on it,

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,060
you will see that Excel will automatically pick up the links sell here or the cell link.

62
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,020
OK,

63
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,270
it will pick up the same cell link as this one eyes the one that this one had.

64
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,180
Okay,

65
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,380
this is because you have inserted it in the same group box.

66
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,770
So Excel was smart enough to know that because the 2nd 1 was inserted in the same group box

67
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,720
that you need to ah,

68
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,860
link it to the same Ah,

69
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,520
cell or two you need to make it uses the same cell linker.

70
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,470
Okay,

71
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,330
so this is guy guys,

72
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,570
how you can use group boxes to create different groups of option buttons.

73
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,400
So thank you,

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,110
