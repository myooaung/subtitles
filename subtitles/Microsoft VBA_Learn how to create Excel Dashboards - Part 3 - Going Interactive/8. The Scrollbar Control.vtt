00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
Hey,

2
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.790
guys,

3
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.320
welcome back to in this video.

4
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.780
We're going to speak about another form control,

5
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.180
which is this crowbar.

6
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.370
So this crowbar control allows you to create a moving image off your data.

7
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.700
So as you can see here,

8
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.720
as I'm scrolling through the scroll bar,

9
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.190
I get the sales for my different items.

10
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.850
Okay?

11
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.010
And I'll show you how it works.

12
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.240
But first of all,

13
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.370
let's see how we can insert a scroll bar control so you can go to the developer tab on the

14
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.750
ribbon,

15
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.930
click on insert,

16
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.330
and then click on scroll bar here.

17
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.900
And you can either dro a horizontal one or a vertical one.

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.260
Okay,

19
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.440
so you can just draw it as a horizontal in,

20
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.400
and it will be drawn as a horizontal one.

21
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.620
And you can also draw as a vertical one like that.

22
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.540
Click and drag.

23
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.880
And it will be Joan as a vertical one.

24
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.170
Okay,

25
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.250
I'm just going to lead the vertical one here,

26
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.690
and let's see the horizontal one that we've created.

27
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.280
Let's right.

28
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.910
Click on it,

29
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.830
click on Former Control to see what it's controls are so you can see her.

30
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.850
The 1st 1st of all,

31
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.960
is the current value.

32
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.060
You don't need to worry much about the current value because it's basically the value that

33
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.280
it has right now.

34
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.150
And it will change as you use it.

35
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.840
Okay,

36
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.350
as you scroll through this crowbar control,

37
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.330
okay?

38
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.170
The minimum value is basically ah,

39
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.030
the minimum value that it would have.

40
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.190
So,

41
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.220
in this case here,

42
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.330
because I've got 12 months scrolling through,

43
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.930
it's actually the months of the year,

44
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.190
actually,

45
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.820
two months of 2014.

46
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.250
So the minimum value in my case here is gonna be a one,

47
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.250
okay?

48
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.060
And the maximum value is gonna be 12 because they've got 12 months in the year.

49
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.540
And the incremental change here is just a one because we need for each press on the scroll

50
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.820
bar,

51
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.100
forward or backwards to just change our months by one.

52
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.750
So go one months forward or woman's backward.

53
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.060
Okay,

54
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.090
If you need to go forward or backward by more than that,

55
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.020
then you can just change it to two or three or whatever.

56
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.650
Okay.

57
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.270
And the page changes also.

58
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.620
How many months forward or backward,

59
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.690
you go when you press actually on in these areas.

60
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.600
So in this area or in this area,

61
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.700
no on the ah,

62
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.150
no,

63
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.710
on the arrows on the right and left.

64
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.120
But actually in the areas between the this block and and the arrow.

65
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.400
Okay,

66
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.280
so in this area or this area Okay,

67
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.330
so we will set that to one as well,

68
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.230
cause we want to move forward or backward by just one when we click on any of these areas

69
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.280
because we just got 12 months,

70
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.720
okay?

71
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.830
And we scroll through them one by one.

72
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.990
And the cell link is basically where you help put the ordinary position off the item that

73
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.640
you selected.

74
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.610
So I'm going to select your cell J two.

75
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.790
It's actually the same cell that this school bark control is.

76
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.630
Using the one on the left on the three d shading is just to give it a bit of a three d.

77
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.990
Look,

78
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.200
it's an aesthetic setting.

79
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.180
So if we click OK,

80
00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.610
here,

81
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.280
you can see her that I can actually scroll through forward on backward on the school

82
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.980
control score Bar control.

83
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.680
Okay.

84
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.030
So I can go forward and I reach a maximum value of 12 and it can scroll backwards and I

85
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.950
reach a minimum value of one.

86
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.710
And also for the page change.

87
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.330
When he actually click in the middle of the scroll bar,

88
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.560
he conceded that it increments Bali one forwards or backwards.

89
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.870
Okay,

90
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.750
because we set the page change option to be a one.

91
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.050
Now,

92
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.250
I'm gonna delete the school bar control that I created here.

93
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.310
Okay?

94
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.790
And we're just ah,

95
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.640
gonna have a look at the data that we're charting.

96
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.300
Okay,

97
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.220
So you can see here as I scroll through the school bark control here,

98
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.640
the selling changes.

99
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.680
And if we check the formula for for these items here,

100
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.760
they're actually being looked up from a sheet called this crowbar analysis.

101
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.280
You can see her.

102
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.490
It's just a table with,

103
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.050
ah,

104
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.550
the items and the months across the columns.

105
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.000
Okay.

106
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.990
And,

107
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.500
ah,

108
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.290
I want you to see something here If you go to January.

109
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.840
Okay.

110
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.270
You can see here that the school Bahr el puts a one on the selling.

111
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.740
However,

112
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.850
you can see here that on the formative for the V,

113
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.120
look up for all the items you consider that the column index number is basically the pulpit

114
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.360
of this crowbar on the selling offset by a positive one.

115
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.680
Okay,

116
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.650
so it's the output of the school bar on the selling care plus one.

117
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.260
The reason is it is plus one is because January here is in the second column on on the

118
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.740
table.

119
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.090
OK,

120
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.300
so if we have the month of January with cell link of one,

121
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.480
we need to add an extra plus one Okay,

122
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.930
to get the values for January and if we check February,

123
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.130
you can see her that it help?

124
00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.940
It's too on the cell link.

125
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.650
OK,

126
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.210
And if we check the school bar analysis worksheet to consider that February is in the third

127
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.670
columns,

128
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:13.230
this is why we need to offset that to hear on the selling by a positive one to get a three

129
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.030
on the column Index number input for the V,

130
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.990
look a formula.

131
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.750
Okay.

132
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.910
And you can see her also that February itself is being looked up as well from the table.

133
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:23.720
So everything,

134
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.740
including the months,

135
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.420
is being looked up from the school bar analysis table.

136
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.920
OK,

137
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.000
so this is basically the school bar Ah,

138
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.190
form Control is it's basically a form control the outputs a number,

139
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.510
okay.

140
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.690
And this number can be incremental it and you can link that number in a function or formula

141
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.590
to create interactivity to change your data and create interactivity this way.

142
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.250
Okay.

143
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.400
Thank you very much.

144
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.630
Guys,

145
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.980
For watching this video,

146
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.310
we will see applications for the school bar form control in the future.

147
00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.770
Okay.

148
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.640
Thank you for watching.

149
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.970
I'll see on the next one.
