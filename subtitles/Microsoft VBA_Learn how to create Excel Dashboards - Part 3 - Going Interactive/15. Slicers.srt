1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260
Hey,

2
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,540
guys,

3
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,190
welcome back.

4
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,220
So in this video,

5
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,630
we're going to speak about slicer.

6
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:11,350
So slicers are actually user friendly filters and the enable us to filter are pivot tables

7
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,640
and thus adding interactivity to our dashboards this way,

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,320
because we can filter the data that is shown on our pivot tables.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,810
And this data would be linked to other elements in our dashboard and thus changing the data

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,370
appearing on our dashboard,

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:36,170
changing the numbers on our charts and so on slicers are only available starting from Excel

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,270
2000 ton.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,640
Now let's see how we can insert a slicer.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,300
So you need to select any cell inside your pivot table and then go to the analyze tab on

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:48,980
the ribbon,

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:56,700
click on insert slicer and then select which field in the pivot table you would like to

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,320
filter.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,240
So here,

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,910
for example,

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,030
I'm going to select the country because I want a filter my pivot table using the country on

21
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,030
.

22
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,910
I'm gonna get the same slicer that I've got here on the right hand side,

23
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,640
which is the one filtering the country's.

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,070
So if you click OK,

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,460
here,

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,000
you're able to insert a slicer that filters your countries So now you can change your

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,850
countries here,

28
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,480
and you can see here that whatever countries you filter for here on the slicer are

29
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,530
reflected on the pivot table here.

30
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,080
And note also that the filtration on your slicer works,

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,880
even if that particular field is not put as a filter field on your pivot table,

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,650
so you can see here the country is not.

33
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,590
He filter field on the pivot table,

34
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,470
and still the slicer works,

35
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,570
so I'll just delete that one because we've got a similar one here at the top.

36
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,330
Now let's speak about slicer formatting,

37
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,840
because you can actually change the colors of your slicers so you can select your slicer.

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,340
Go to options here,

39
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,360
and you can select a different color for your slicer.

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,100
You can also change the color of multiple slicers by selecting one of them president

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,610
control and selecting the other and selecting a different color.

42
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,550
As you can see here.

43
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,140
Also,

44
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,620
if you click on this arrow here and you can click on new slicer style,

45
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,200
you can create your own custom slicer style,

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,010
the own colors,

47
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,460
your own everything.

48
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:24,900
So feel free to experiment with these options because you can color the slicer and make it

49
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,470
suit your own branding.

50
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,560
You can also make your slicer control multiple pivot tables.

51
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,000
So here at the moment,

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
this particular slicer only controls this pivot table here on the left and we get another

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,470
pivot table here on the right.

54
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,490
This pivot table is called pivot table two,

55
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,590
and this one is called pivot Table one.

56
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:54,410
So if you right click on your slicer and click on report connections because here that this

57
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:01,180
Leiser is connected only to pivot table one if you check pivot table two and click OK,

58
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,650
you're gonna be able to control both.

59
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:10,680
Pivot Table says you can see here when I do a change on the year the year gets changed on

60
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,750
both pivot tables and you can do the same as well for this one so as to make the country

61
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,760
change on both off them at the same time.

62
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,860
However,

63
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,920
please note that in order to make a slicer control multiple pivot tables,

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:37,390
you need to have all the pivot tables having their data source from the same source,

65
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,580
so they need to all have the same data source,

66
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,240
so they need to be all casing from the same table.

67
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,800
OK,

68
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,220
so I've got both these pivot tables here.

69
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,810
They're getting their data source from this table here on the left.

70
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,920
If it had been the case that each one of them had a different data source,

71
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,030
you will not be able to control them using the same slicer,

72
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:08,650
at least without involving V v A and without having some code to do it for you also,

73
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,880
you can actually select multiple items on your slicer at the same time.

74
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,520
So here I'm selecting the year 2012 I compress control and select 2013 as well.

75
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:29,570
So now on filtering with the data for both 2011 and 2000 and 13 You can also use the shift

76
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:35,410
key to select multiple contiguous years or multiple contiguous items on your slicer.

77
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,570
So here I'm selecting 2011.

78
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:46,260
If you press the shift key and select 2013 you will select everything from 2011 till 2013.

79
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:53,010
So all these contiguous items You can also select multiple contiguous items by clicking on

80
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,470
dragging.

81
00:04:53,470 --> 00:05:00,330
So if you click 2011 and drag while clicking until 2013 you're able to select all these

82
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,890
contiguous years.

83
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:07,740
You could also remove all the filters by clicking on this red button here the clear filter

84
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,180
button,

85
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,200
and this will actually select all the items on the slicer.

86
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,820
So currently we're selecting all the years from 2011 to 2014.

87
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,750
Because we've removed any filtration,

88
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,850
you could also remove their headers.

89
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,160
So basically,

90
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,620
as you could see previously,

91
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,860
there was no red button here.

92
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,240
And that is because this slicer had its header removed so you can remove its header by

93
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,610
right clicking on the slicer,

94
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,120
clicking on slicer settings year and then until the display header button and click.

95
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,750
OK,

96
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,180
this removes the headers,

97
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,070
and this could be required sometimes because you're filters are pretty obvious.

98
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,380
So here it is obvious that 2000 of in 2012 13 and forcing our years,

99
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,950
so maybe you don't need the year header and the slicer looks sleeker this way and also here

100
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,370
on this slicer,

101
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,240
we could remove the Hatter for the country because it is very obvious that Australia,

102
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,650
Canada,

103
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,150
the UK and USA are countries.

104
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,410
You could also,

105
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:10,870
of course,

106
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,050
change their sizes using this handle here.

107
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,100
So you congee just Ah,

108
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,500
expand them and shrink them.

109
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:26,240
And you can also go to the options tab here on the ribbon after selecting your slicer to

110
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,480
make them have multiple columns.

111
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,370
So,

112
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,630
as you can see here,

113
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,260
there's an option for changing the number of columns.

114
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,800
So here you could have two columns.

115
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,270
You can have three columns.

116
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,700
So if you have a lot of items,

117
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,550
this could be useful for you.

118
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:45,030
And this also enables you to have or you filters or isn't Lee beside each other so you can

119
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,070
shrink your slicer after having multiple columns trinket like that,

120
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,440
and have your data arranged in a horizontal fashion instead of a vertical fashion.

121
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,950
Okay,

122
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,210
guys,

123
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,230
So that sit for slicers?

124
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,650
Thank you very much for watching this video and I'll see on the next one.
