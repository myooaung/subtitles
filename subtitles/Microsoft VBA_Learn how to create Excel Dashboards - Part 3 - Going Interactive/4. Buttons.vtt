00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.210
Hey guys,

2
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:01.990
welcome back.

3
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.030
So in this video,

4
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.290
we're going to discuss the first type of form controls,

5
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.180
which is the button control.

6
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.940
OK,

7
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.100
so buttons air used to trigger Mac Rose.

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.750
Okay.

9
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.600
And a macro is basically a program in Excel on a program is basically a set of steps that

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.150
you ask the computer to perform or ask Excel to perform.

11
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.240
Okay.

12
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.370
And ah,

13
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.940
macro Zehr written in a language called VB A and that stands for visual basic for

14
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.260
applications on.

15
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.720
We're not going to go into the details of vb A on this course because it needs a course old

16
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.500
by its own.

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.430
However,

18
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.750
I'd really encourage you to learn Vehbi,

19
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.050
eh?

20
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.590
As it would give you a very good skills.

21
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.310
Okay,

22
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.380
so I've got a button here on the left,

23
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.380
and it's already connected to a macro.

24
00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:01.220
And all that macro does is that it writes used the button form control in cell F six as we

25
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.930
can see her of deleted the contents of cell F six and I'm just gonna press the button here

26
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.930
.

27
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.080
And you can see her that it rights to use the button form control in cell F six.

28
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.560
Okay,

29
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.200
So let's see how we can insert a button in excel.

30
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.490
Okay,

31
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.340
so you need to go to the developer tab on the ribbon,

32
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.510
click on insert.

33
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.390
And then,

34
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.520
as you can hear,

35
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.720
this Ah,

36
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.650
shape here represents a button.

37
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.330
Okay,

38
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.290
so click on it.

39
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.980
And then you can left,

40
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.560
click and drag to dro the button wherever you want.

41
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.210
Okay?

42
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.250
And then excel when you drove the button.

43
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.190
Excel will start asking you,

44
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.940
Ah,

45
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.650
which macro you would like to assign to that button so that when that button is pressed or

46
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.250
clicked,

47
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.370
the macro would get triggered.

48
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.730
Okay,

49
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.720
so I'm gonna choose here the button macro.

50
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.230
Okay.

51
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.280
And I'm going to click.

52
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.050
OK?

53
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.170
And as you can see her,

54
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.650
my button has been drone.

55
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.550
You consider it's been the same that anymore,

56
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.200
but nine.

57
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.980
But I can get it's name by right clicking on it and clicking on it It text.

58
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.780
Okay.

59
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.880
And then I can start editing.

60
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.630
It's think OK,

61
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.450
so I can call it Molly Button or so Okay.

62
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.240
And it's now connected to the same macro as the button on the left.

63
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.860
I'm just gonna delete here the contents of cell F six,

64
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.930
and if I click on the button here.

65
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.880
You can see her.

66
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.200
The in cell F six,

67
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.450
it's written used the button form control.

68
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.480
You can also assign Micro's two shapes of Got here a shape,

69
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.120
actually.

70
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.930
Ah,

71
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.750
that is used as the button.

72
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.180
Okay to trigger macro.

73
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.380
So there is a market already assigned to it.

74
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.300
So if I click on it,

75
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.110
you can see here that there is a macro this written used the shape macro.

76
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.830
By the way,

77
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.900
both these macros have been written by myself.

78
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.300
So ah,

79
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.580
to insert a shape you can go to insert and then go to shapes,

80
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.450
and then you can choose any shape here.

81
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.050
But I'm gonna choose the rounded Richt rectangle here,

82
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.930
and you can just left,

83
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.150
click and drag to draw the shape.

84
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.250
Okay?

85
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.470
And ah,

86
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.860
you condone Just change its name.

87
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.750
I'm going to change it to my shape as well.

88
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.610
Okay.

89
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:20.990
And to assign a macro to a shape you can right click on it here and click on a sign macro,

90
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.920
and you can assign any macro to it.

91
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.430
I'm gonna assign the macro called shape macro,

92
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.450
which is the same macro for the shape on the left here,

93
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.150
So I'm just going to leave the contents of cell F 11 year.

94
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.680
And if I click on money shape here on the right,

95
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.630
you can see her that the macro has been triggered,

96
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.150
and,

97
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.510
ah,

98
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.710
the contents of cell F 11 hour used the shape macro.

99
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.980
Okay,

100
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.520
so let's check the code for the Mac Rose that are triggered by the shape and the button.

101
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.310
Okay,

102
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.030
So to do that,

103
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.560
I'm gonna go to the developer tab on the ribbon here earlier and click on Micro's and then

104
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.970
on this button macro here,

105
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.110
I'm going to highlight it and then click on edit.

106
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.810
Okay,

107
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.510
so now I can see the button macron,

108
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.930
actually,

109
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.610
just below it.

110
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.930
There is the shape macro.

111
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.710
Ah,

112
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.620
they're just Ah,

113
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.740
very simple Micro.

114
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.610
Only do is that they write,

115
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.050
um,

116
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.500
used the shape,

117
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.650
use the button form control in cell F six,

118
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.290
and you also insulated 11.

119
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.640
The right its rights used the shape Macro this for the shape macro.

120
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.880
Okay,

121
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.930
so they're very simple.

122
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.160
Micro's just one line that writes a text in a cell.

123
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.450
Okay,

124
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.600
so now we're gonna close the V b A editor,

125
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.720
and I'm gonna also show you how you can record a micro so you can go to the developer tab

126
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.320
on the ribbon Click on record.

127
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.880
Macro.

128
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.580
Okay,

129
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.890
I'm gonna call it Hello.

130
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:44.850
Um,

131
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.440
macro here,

132
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.550
cause this Ah,

133
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.150
it's gonna just right.

134
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.650
Hello?

135
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.510
Okay.

136
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.470
So if if you just write the name of the macro and click,

137
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.140
OK,

138
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.880
Excel will start recording.

139
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.340
So I'm gonna go to sell F 15 year and right.

140
00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.850
Hello?

141
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.470
Okay,

142
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.570
I am Press enter.

143
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:08.830
And now I want to stop recording so I can stop recording by clicking on stop recording here

144
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.870
under the developer top on the ribbon.

145
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.500
So if you click,

146
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.670
stop recording here.

147
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.440
Excel will stop recording.

148
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.320
And then you can insert a button by going to a developer.

149
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.030
Time on the ribbon,

150
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.220
clicking on insert here and then clicking on button.

151
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.540
And then you can draw another button here you can assign to it the new macro.

152
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.850
Hello,

153
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.470
Macro.

154
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.140
Okay.

155
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.710
And I'm just going to change the name of the button here to hello,

156
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.500
for example.

157
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.590
Okay,

158
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.680
So if changed its ah name and then I'm just going to lead the contents of cell F 15 and

159
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.930
click on the button.

160
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.930
You can see her That Ah,

161
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.440
the word hello has been written in cell F 50.

162
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.000
Okay,

163
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.590
so one more thing about using buttons and versus using shapes is that actually,

164
00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.760
shapes have an advantage that they have mawr formatting that they that can be done to them

165
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.760
.

166
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.550
Okay,

167
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.890
so with shapes,

168
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.800
you can do a lot more formatting.

169
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.650
So if you select a shape here,

170
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.440
you can go to format and you can just give it ah,

171
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.460
lot of colors,

172
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.780
different colors year.

173
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.490
And you know,

174
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.940
you can give it even many more.

175
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.130
And you can also ah,

176
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.420
do some effects to it so you can give it a bevel here,

177
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.950
okay,

178
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.520
to give it some sort of a three dimensional effect.

179
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.380
And you can also make it glow and stuff like that.

180
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.080
Okay,

181
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.440
so this is ah,

182
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.650
very distinct advantage of shapes over.

183
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.240
Ah,

184
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.650
buttons.

185
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.120
They can both sugar macron's.

186
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.740
But this is ah,

187
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.840
an advantage for shapes over buttons.

188
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.000
Because buttons cannot change their colors.

189
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.740
Their ah aesthetics are basically limited.

190
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.550
Okay,

191
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.940
so thanks.

192
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.090
