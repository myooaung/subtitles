00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.800
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.500
Over the last few lectures we did a lot of work for the users.

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.420
So that was setting things up like the views for the users and the templates as well as special views

4
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.130
and templates like viewing all the users blog posts.

5
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.060
Now we want to do is actually make sure that we've set up enough so we can test run the site.

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.680
We still won't be able to create blog posts or view blog posts in particular because we haven't created

7
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.800
anything for that.

8
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.170
But we can still test from the site to at least make sure that we're able to register and log in as

9
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.510
users and ordered to do that.

10
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.340
We can do a couple more things.

11
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.710
First remember that we created a lot of forms.

12
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.260
So we're going to want to set a secret key in our in it thought Paey file for the forms to work.

13
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.300
Then we're also going to fix the navigation bar in our baseline h T.M. right now regardless of what

14
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.190
users logged in or logged out.

15
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.910
They still get to see every single possible link or log out register log in all at once.

16
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.080
So we want to fix that with some quick if statement checks there.

17
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.310
Then we also haven't actually used flask D-B commands to initiate and migrate our models to the database.

18
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.700
So we'll be doing that as well.

19
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.670
Once we do these three main things we should be able to get enough that we can actually debug and make

20
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.570
sure our site is working so far.

21
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.940
Keep in mind anything that's really related to a blog post is still not going to work correctly because

22
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.040
there are no views or templates for blog posts right now.

23
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.980
OK let's get started.

24
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.610
OK.

25
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.250
Here we are back of the project.

26
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.170
Let's begin by making sure we set a secret key that we all the forms we created work so we'll come back

27
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.000
to our PI file.

28
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.060
Remember this is the one underneath the puppy company blog.

29
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.580
So that and at that pie we've created our application here.

30
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.250
All we need to do is say app config and set the secret key as we've done many times before.

31
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:59.070
So say secret key equal to my secret and then later on when we actually cover real deployments We'll

32
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.950
talk about how to actually set this as an environment variable so you don't have in your actual code.

33
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.460
But right now since we're just kind of practicing locally we'll set it right here.

34
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.860
OK.

35
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.220
Once you've saved that let's go back to our base each time I'll file and Interbase the H to him file

36
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.500
remember this has the links to the C Ss and J.

37
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.140
Crew files for bootstrap as well as our navigation bar under based thudded T.M. And if like collapse

38
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.270
the left hand tab.

39
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.170
Remember that right now we're showing everything once a user is on the Web site we're showing them both

40
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.750
log out accounts log in and register all at once which doesn't really make sense now that we have capabilities

41
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.600
for users to be authenticated.

42
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.430
So instead let's add add in a little bit of logic here to make sure that it's going to work as we expect

43
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.030
once the users log in.

44
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.290
Then they can log out check their account or create a post or they can log in and register.

45
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.970
So let's fix that now.

46
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.960
We're going to come first up here and we can do this which is really a simple IF statement and then

47
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.450
adding in some links.

48
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.710
So right here I'm going to say the following.

49
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:11.320
I'll say if the current user is underscore authenticated remember we get to use that because we're using

50
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.460
Flast loggin kind of all of this is handled for us in the bacchanals McCrary spell that right is authenticate.

51
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.240
There we go.

52
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.930
So if the current users authenticated that means they're already logged then we'll give them the option

53
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.850
to log out check their account or create a post.

54
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.710
So else we're going to do reps will say else

55
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.970
else that means they're not logged in.

56
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.510
We'll tell them to either log in or register.

57
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.120
And remember with Jinja templating we have to end this statement.

58
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.560
So after that we'll just say right here.

59
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.320
And if and then save those changes.

60
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.790
OK.

61
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.800
So we have the current users authenticated else and then and if so log out account create post log in

62
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.720
register.

63
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.480
Now it's actually add in some links here.

64
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.380
These refs will take us somewhere so I'll start with the log out one so we'll say your all.

65
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.250
And in this case it's users log out.

66
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.350
And I'm actually going to copy this because the rest of them are actually quite similar.

67
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.330
So for accounts it's the same thing.

68
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.770
Instead sort of the log out you were going to have them view the account view and then for create post.

69
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.200
We actually don't have that view yet so I'll leave that as just an empty hash tag log in.

70
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.710
We do have that in our users view that's not logged out.

71
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.200
That's going to be log in and then register.

72
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.790
Same thing here except it's going to be users that register.

73
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.750
So that way our navigation bar actually takes us places.

74
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.000
So we're going to save those changes there.

75
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.640
OK.

76
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.870
Now that it's all set up for an aggregation bar let's actually commit the changes for the models that

77
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.150
apply follow we created earlier since technically we haven't actually pushed any changes using Flast

78
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.950
the being Flast migrations.

79
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.870
So remember in our in at the PI file you should already have everything set up for your database as

80
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.250
well as a sequel alchemy and migrate.

81
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.930
Now what we need to do is actually run those flasks D-B commands.

82
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:14.850
So right here a flask examples on the say flask D-B in it hit run or hit enter really to run all that.

83
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.350
So you should see something like that.

84
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:25.610
And then we're going to say flask D.B migraine and let's give ourselves a little message like first

85
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.310
migration.

86
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.460
Enter let that migrate should see a bunch of lines and then it says done.

87
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.870
And then finally we'll do the following.

88
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:39.050
We'll say flask D-B upgrades actually push those migration changes.

89
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.720
So run all that and you hopefully don't get any errors there if you do get an error.

90
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.650
That means there's probably something wrong either with your PI file setup or your models that PI file

91
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.730
and I would recommend that you use our provided notes if you are getting some errors at the step because

92
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.420
that's usually the kind of parts of the bug like very minor typos somewhere in it that PI file or your

93
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.590
models that PI file.

94
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.220
So make sure copy and paste from our notes and Kiska any errors there.

95
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.720
All right.

96
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.850
Now that that's been run we should be able to register new users.

97
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.600
So let's actually run our application and see if all the changes worked.

98
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.640
So we're going to say Python app that PI enter and it looks like it's running.

99
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.180
So that's always good news.

100
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.220
Let me bring in my browser here and we'll play around with the site and see if we can register a new

101
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.750
user sort to come over and right off the bat.

102
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.340
You should see the navigation bar working.

103
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.910
You should not only see log in and register as options because we're no longer logged in as a user.

104
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.320
So if a click the about I get info about the company for come back home I could see the home page.

105
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.310
So that's all working.

106
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.850
Let's now register a new user using our form here.

107
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.580
So what we'll do is just use a very simple e-mail olic to use something simple like one at one dot com

108
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.870
for the first user have the user name one have the password would be one.

109
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.730
Just so it's easy to keep track and then for the actual use to it Today.com and so on.

110
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.270
Remember that this form actually looks really ugly because there was no bootstrap classes on this form.

111
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.570
But recall that we did show you how to do that specifically for the update view.

112
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.090
So we'll see that in just a second.

113
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.160
OK let's try registering this user and see if that works.

114
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.310
So it did register.

115
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.260
That's good.

116
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.850
Keep in mind there was like a microsecond flash there because we did have that flash command but since

117
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.560
it's just reroutes us to log in we actually don't see that.

118
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.620
So now that we can log in.

119
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.710
Let's try it out.

120
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.630
So we're going to say one at one dot com.

121
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.100
The password is one.

122
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.810
See this log in works.

123
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.190
So the logging did work.

124
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.270
It took us back to the home page and now check.

125
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.880
Take a look at our navigation bar.

126
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.210
I can log out.

127
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.700
Check my account or create a post for click Create a post right now.

128
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.220
Nothing's going to happen because we haven't set up any of those used yet.

129
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.070
So let's check if our account page is working.

130
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.150
So I click on account and it says Welcome to the page for one.

131
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:59.060
Right now there's an empty picture there because we haven't set the actual default PLG we've said it

132
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.410
on the views and the templates so there is a link to some string.

133
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.760
What I haven't done there is actually put the picture.

134
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.700
So we're going to do that in just a second.

135
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.460
But let's actually try uploading our own picture.

136
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.390
So we have the user name.

137
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:19.040
It's one let's call this one edit and we'll also edit our email will say one edit at one dot com and

138
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.580
then I'm going to choose a file to upload as my picture.

139
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.570
So what I'm going to do is just select this python logo.

140
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.600
All open here and then lets it update and see if my pictures updated.

141
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.010
So it looks like welcome to the page for one edit.

142
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:32.970
So that worked.

143
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.570
But what's not working is our ability to update profile pics.

144
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:42.170
So let's fix that and make sure that our routes are correctly working for updating the pictures because

145
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:47.780
it looks like right now I'm not seeing that picture update but my username and email it's looks like

146
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.420
they are updated correctly.

147
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:56.730
So let's go back to our files and make sure that the profile picture and that actual directory exist.

148
00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.000
So we're going to go back to Adam here.

149
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:05.690
We're going to open up the left hand tab here and you'll notice we have static profile picks and right

150
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.120
now nothing got saved under profile pics.

151
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:15.420
Let's try to first debug the default picture not showing up and then we'll debug the updating not showing

152
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:15.960
up.

153
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.180
Now the default not showing up that one is actually quite simple to fix because there was no default

154
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.180
underneath profile pics.

155
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:29.100
So if I take a look at a user model under models that pie remember that the profile image has a default

156
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.710
value of default and then default underscore profile that DNG.

157
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.510
So I should probably stick that PFG file there.

158
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.760
That way I can actually have a profile picture show up on my computer underneath a folder.

159
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:48.450
I have this cute little picture of a dog and I've labeled it default underscore profiled up hangi.

160
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:55.230
So I'm actually going to grab this guy and then move it to profile pics.

161
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.410
So now I have a default profile dot PMG there.

162
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.970
Keep in mind it's really up to you.

163
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.810
Whatever profile you want to use you just got to make sure that the name matches up.

164
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:09.550
So right now have default underscore profiles that PFG and that name is matching up with my default.

165
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.160
So I'm going to save those changes.

166
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:16.330
And let's see if I register a new user if I actually pick up on that PMG file.

167
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.340
That means we'll bring back our browser and I'm going to log out.

168
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.510
This one user and create another user in upon you registration.

169
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.140
Let's see if we see that puppy profile pic.

170
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:31.740
If not going to show you a really nice way to help debug these sort of missing images.

171
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.060
So let's log out and let's see if that works.

172
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.490
So lock that work I'm going to register.

173
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.540
And now let's register a new user.

174
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:46.410
We're going to call this user to Today.com to passwords also to and then confirm password.

175
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.550
Remember you can always add in additional validators to make sure that the password is a certain length

176
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.650
like the length required validator.

177
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.910
Right now we're just keeping things simple.

178
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.950
Let's register this to user and that worked.

179
00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.220
So now let's actually log in with them.

180
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.790
So we'll say to it to pass into We'll log in and if we get a count now.

181
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:13.040
Now my actual pathway is working for that default profile pic which makes sense because we just set

182
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.860
it up so that's good news.

183
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:18.640
However let's see if now if I can actually update my profile pic.

184
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:23.360
I know the username and e-mail updates were working because when I refresh the page I saw my updated

185
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:29.920
username and e-mails but let's actually choose and you file are going to choose choose this one on here

186
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.390
have their safe pictures.

187
00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.510
So I'll open that one update.

188
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.740
And right now it's still not working.

189
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:42.040
So it looks like I have some sort of issue with my account view or account template where upon hitting

190
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.220
update I'm not actually updating that profile picture.

191
00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:52.270
And a hint that I want to show you is if you right click on this and select View page source you can

192
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:57.130
since you understood the actual construction as web site you can begin to see where the source is coming

193
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:57.820
from.

194
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:03.370
So looks like the source is still coming from a static profile pics default underscore a profile PMG

195
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:09.730
so that hints to us that the actual submission of that form for the use case of updating our profile

196
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.360
picture isn't working yet.

197
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.420
So I want to come back to this account view and see if I need anything for actually updating the profile

198
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.910
picture and hopefully it's a simple fix.

199
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.230
All right.

200
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.240
Luckily for us it actually is a simple fix.

201
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:28.660
And the reason that our update wasn't working is if we come back to our template page for the account

202
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.870
that is account the H Tim L.

203
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:36.760
You'll notice that right now in our form at the very top we only specified method is equal to post.

204
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:42.790
And if you do a little research on this basically the way that these HVM all forms work is when you

205
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:48.880
make a post request like we're doing here you have to encode the data that forms the body of the request

206
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.140
in some way and you can actually Google search this.

207
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.630
But basically what we have to add here are two things.

208
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.590
One is we have to actually specify an action.

209
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.190
And in this case we can specify this be a blank string.

210
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.330
But we do want this action to be there.

211
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.130
And more importantly what we want is e n c t type.

212
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:15.910
So this attribute where you could do is you're going to set it to multipart slash form data and then

213
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.460
you're going to want to save those changes.

214
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:24.280
And again you can check out just by Google searching what this actually phrase means but it has to do

215
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.860
with the way you can upload files.

216
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:32.380
So if you're just uploading simple text then you don't actually need specify the sort of type the default

217
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.100
of your L and works.

218
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:40.360
But if we're actually uploading files like a CISC file an excel file or a PNB file we need to add in

219
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.630
these two attributes to our form tag.

220
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:48.220
So again you can Google search and you'll get lots of really nice answers as far as what this actually

221
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:48.950
means.

222
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:54.160
And it basically just explains that each team of forms in general has three methods of encoding and

223
00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:00.220
if we're actually encoding some more complex file types that aren't just text being passed into the

224
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:05.100
form they need to actually specify multipart slash form dash data.

225
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:09.730
So if that being then let's go ahead and restart this and close this window here.

226
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.920
And we've added in the action and this attribute.

227
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:19.250
So let's run our application again and see if we can successfully actually update the photo.

228
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.420
So let's bring in our site again.

229
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.200
I'm going to register a new user.

230
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:30.060
So let's go ahead and have this register just be called for for the comm username for password before

231
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.670
and confirm password before will register that user and let's log them in.

232
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:41.040
So for for fore we'll log in and out and hit my account page.

233
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.950
I see that that default is working for me.

234
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.070
So let's try to update this and then choose some new file.

235
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.800
So I'll just choose this python logo.

236
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.690
I'll update.

237
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.410
And now it's actually working.

238
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:57.870
So the only changes we had actually make was to set up our team L4 to not just accept the default text

239
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:02.280
types but instead be actually able to accept more complex form data.

240
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.190
And the way you do that is by adding in those two lines right here.

241
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.010
OK.

242
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:11.890
So now we're able to successfully register users log in users and edit their accounts.

243
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.290
So we're essentially done with the users.

244
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:19.920
What we have to do now is begin to fill up the blog post applications that is creating a post updating

245
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.320
a post deleting a post and then at the end will update the home view actually show all the blog posts

246
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.180
for this particular company.

247
00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.380
All right that's it for this lecture if you have any questions feel free to post to the Q&amp;A forums.

248
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.280
We'll see if the next lecture.
