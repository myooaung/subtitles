00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,080
Hi everyone it's Jose here.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,020
And thank you so much for enrolling in the course.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,070
And welcome.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,890
This is the course overview lecture.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,640
I have a quick favorite to ask of you and ask that you please don't skip this lecture.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,820
I know it's very tempting to just go straight ahead to the technical material but we're going to cover

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,320
a lot of important things in this particular lecture.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,890
It's going to be pretty brief but there's a lot of important topics.

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,270
Well we're going to discuss here is how to get help during the course semi-useful course taking tips

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,680
how to get the actual notes and technical files for the course and also quick note.

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,460
Please check your automated welcome message for some nice useful information.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,850
There's lots of useful links there that covers a lot of what we're going to talk about here.

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,110
OK.

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,400
So probably the most important question is how do you actually get help during the course.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,650
So you're taking the course semi-technical pops up and you don't know how to solve it and you want to

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,800
ask the question.

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,400
So the first thing I would say is please double check against our provided files so we provide a file

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,470
for pretty much every single lecture video.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,390
So you actually have the technical code available as well as the scripts and our files will are guaranteed

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,980
to pretty much work with all the correct versions of the libraries.

21
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,720
So there's different versions of a lot of the flask and Python libraries that we're using.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,270
And we actually have a method to make sure that you use the exact same versions we do upon filming of

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,050
the course.

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,000
So that way as long as you run our files with those exact same versions that we provide they will always

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,580
work.

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,660
So please double check.

27
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,780
Always try to run our provided files first before posting a question because often as you're following

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,250
along with the videos it's really easy to make a simple typo and that can set the whole thing off.

29
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,880
And it's sometimes hard for us to catch those typos from our end.

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,340
So always please double check against our provider files by running them directly.

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:40,730
OK.

32
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,120
So let's say that they didn't work you're still having some sort of confusion.

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,300
That's totally OK.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,220
What I would recommend doing first is to search the flash documentation and do a quick google or Stack

35
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,260
Overflow search about 80 to 90 percent of all questions have already been answered either through a

36
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,640
quick Google search or Stack Overflow search.

37
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,730
So you definitely don't want to have that as your quick response so a simple Google search of your error

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,190
code or your point of confusion often renders a really good answer on stack overflow and often in the

39
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,940
queue in a post where we're going gonna do is link you to a useful Stack Overflow searches ourselves.

40
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,840
So definitely check that out first.

41
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,380
OK.

42
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,280
So let's say Google did when Oscar flow but still couldn't find the answer you were looking for.

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,170
Maybe it's a little more related to a particular lecturer and of course no problem.

44
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,790
What you should do is search the previous Q and A post.

45
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,170
We have lots of students already in the course so it's highly likely that you're going to have a similar

46
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,540
question that someone already thought of to go ahead and search the previous Q A POSE.

47
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,580
OK so you've exhausted all those options and still have the confusion that is now unique upon the Kewney

48
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,390
forums.

49
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,400
No worries we're happy to help you out.

50
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,260
All you need to do is post and you question the question answer forums instead of course and will be

51
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,230
there to help you out.

52
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,370
The last thing I want you to please keep in mind in reference to getting help is with thousands of students

53
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,360
inside our courses.

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,890
We have more than half a million across all our courses and we can't really help out too much personal

55
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,630
homework assignments outside of the Course material.

56
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,690
What we've done for those kind of questions is we set up the court chat server and that's specifically

57
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,920
set up free to share those types of questions of other students and that we connect other students and

58
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,380
help each other out.

59
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,440
Personal homework questions and those kind of things were not really well suited to answer them.

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,970
We're really well suited to answer questions related to the course material itself or just questions

61
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,750
on video lectures so we really appreciate your patience with that.

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,090
And please keep that in mind.

63
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,450
And if you want more information on the dischord chat server check the automated welcome message.

64
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,050
It has the links for that.

65
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,420
OK so let's say your question is more about a platform issue.

66
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,670
Maybe the video is blurry or is taking a long time to render or having issues of the to me app.

67
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:50,250
The best way to do that is to get help by either opening a support ticket on the support page on Timmy's

68
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,480
Web site or their rectory email support.

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,520
You to me that com.

70
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,710
So these are things like video player issues certification issues enrollment or payment issues.

71
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,120
I actually don't control any of that.

72
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm just a creator of the course and I teach the technical content the actual platform view to me is

73
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,840
separate from that.

74
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,840
So you don't want to e-mail them for those kind of issues.

75
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,300
All right let's go through some quick useful tips for taking the course.

76
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,820
What you should do is you should check out the bottom settings on the video player.

77
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,120
There's lots of useful things there you can adjust the quality of the stream and you can also adjust

78
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,340
the playback speed.

79
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,720
So maybe I'm going a little slow for you.

80
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,440
You can always watch the videos that 1.5 x or 2 x speed.

81
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,050
I personally tend to watch videos at 1.5 or 2 x beat myself or maybe English isn't your first language

82
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,600
so you want to watch them a little slower.

83
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,480
And eventually there should be automated captions for this actual video as well.

84
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,130
So you can click the automated captions on there.

85
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,430
And I also want to point out for easeful tip of taking the course there's probably a lot of material

86
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,890
that if you have some experience you're already familiar with it.

87
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,450
So please feel free to jump around sections if you already feel familiar of some of the material.

88
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,070
And we're going to cover the entire curriculum in the next lecture to give you a good idea if you want

89
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,430
a jumping off point.

90
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,880
OK.

91
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,450
Finally let's talk about how to actually get those notes.

92
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,680
So in this very lecture there's going to be a resource link and you should see either in the course

93
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,680
curriculum tab page or as you started watching this lecture you saw a blue pop up that contains a zip

94
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,440
file and that zip file has all the resources for all the lectures so all you need to do is download

95
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,710
that zip file unzip it and that's it.

96
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,900
You now have all the files and all the notes.

97
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,490
And as we go along for certain sections We'll explain how those notes are laid out but pretty much they're

98
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,650
all in the same order and they're numbered in the same order as the Course Lectures themselves.

99
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,140
OK.

100
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,750
You can also check out the link in the FNQ lecture for the resource link as well.

101
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,970
So it's the same ZIP file there and last but not least a huge thank you for enrolling in this course.

102
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,930
If you have any other questions always feel free to message me things about other courses that take

103
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,120
what paths to follow.

104
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,520
I'm always happy to help out.

105
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,340
Just shoot me a message here on to me.

106
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,400
And again thank you so much for enrolling in this course.

107
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,010
OK let's continue on.
