Welcome back in this lecture we're going to take a quick moment to discuss each time I'll divs and spans

2
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.950
divs stands for divisions later on when we're talking about C Ss and bootstrap for in order to add styling

3
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:19.840
to our sites.

4
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.580
We're sometimes going to only want to apply the style to a certain section or division of the website

5
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.720
divs and spans tags allow us to segment portions of our age T.M..

6
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.960
That way we can later on apply styles only to those specific portions.

7
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.220
So right now you're not really going to see an effect when we only perform of h t m l but later when

8
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.220
we actually add in a CSSA class call or another style call from Bootstrap then you'll be able to understand

9
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.540
why we would need div and span's.

10
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.230
So this is just a very quick moment to introduce the actual syntax that spans.

11
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.730
Later on we'll actually see their use case.

12
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.310
Let's get started by hopping over to the text editor.

13
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.670
All right.

14
00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.400
I'm back here.

15
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.940
My basic thought each team M-file and what it will do is show you how you can build a div and also insert

16
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.340
a span tag.

17
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.590
So for a div or division what we do is we type out div and if hit enter it will automatically create

18
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.210
the closing tag and notice it also automatically creates this class call.

19
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.130
Now we don't actually know about classes yet because we haven't discussed CSSA but later on we'll we're

20
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.460
going to do is we're going to import a special string here that connects to the SS call and that will

21
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.020
add styling to everything in between these two div tags.

22
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.900
So in between these two div tags you can add in whatever you want such as a header heading and then

23
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.000
maybe even a paragraph some stuff.

24
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.640
And if you save this and refresh your page you'll just see heading in some stuff.

25
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.790
In fact it will look the same as if you didn't even have a div there.

26
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.180
So if I delete those and refresh I won't see any changes.

27
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.500
But keep in mind once we actually add in this class string and connect it to a CSSA file then we will

28
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.490
see changes only performed on things within this division.

29
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.490
So that's a nice way of basically dividing up everything inside your body for your T.M. because later

30
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.670
on we'll see a very large H.T. mail files.

31
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.500
It'll be nice to organize them as well as apply styles by divisions.

32
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.330
The last thing I want to know is sometimes you want to apply styling to only a certain thing inside

33
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.120
of an already existing tag.

34
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.050
For example I can have a paragraph tag and let's say there's some stuff in it.

35
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.210
So here is some text woohoo.

36
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.650
Let's imagine that I wanted to apply a style call to only some text.

37
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.520
What I could do is instead of having to deal of this div tag which is meant for larger divisions I'm

38
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:55.810
already within a paragraph tag what I'm going to do is type outspan and hit enter and this span.

39
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.540
Basically what you put is the text you want to manipulate.

40
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.990
So I have some text within the span and then later on we can do is add a class call to span.

41
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.410
So in the future we'll see something like this with some sort of string in here with my class.

42
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.200
Right now since we haven't discussed CSSA yet I just want you to be aware of that when you want to add

43
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.510
a style to something else or do it then tags.

44
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.170
You'll be using span.

45
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.950
Now again if I save this and refresh I won't see any real differences between having spent in there

46
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.920
or taking those spand tags out.

47
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.160
So if I save that and refresh you won't notice any difference.

48
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.600
Again will only be using this once we actually learn about C Ss.

49
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.100
OK so that was just a brief moment to talk about these tags.

50
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.650
That way when you see him in the CSSA lectures they're not totally unfamiliar to you.

51
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.480
Thanks and we'll see you at the next one.
