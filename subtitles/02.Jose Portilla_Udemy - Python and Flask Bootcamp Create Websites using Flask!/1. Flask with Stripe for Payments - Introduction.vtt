00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.180
Welcome back in this section of the course we're going to talk about accepting straight payments with

2
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.650
a flask application stripe is a company that allows you to easily integrate their API to web applications

3
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.060
to accept payments.

4
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.190
Basically all you have to do is add in a few lines of code after you've already registered for your

5
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.870
own API.

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.010
Q A stripe and connected your bank account in order to accept payments from other users who visit your

7
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.160
web application and then you can decide what to do with those users after they've given you a payment.

8
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.330
For example you may decide to ship them some product that you're selling or give them access to a particular

9
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.140
web page.

10
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.050
Upon payment you should also note that if you're starting from zero and trying to build out your own

11
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.720
online store there's actually already many platforms that provide the ability to quickly create an online

12
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.490
store.

13
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.800
For example one of the more popular ones is called Shopify.

14
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.500
I would highly suggest you try to check out preexisting solutions before starting from zero and building

15
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.870
out your entire flask application for something like an online store which is a really common problem

16
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.420
that a lot of people have already solved through a third party service.

17
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.630
You should really be using Strype when you're trying to create an application where your actual deliverable

18
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.110
in exchange for money is to customize for existing services.

19
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.930
For example maybe you're trying to accept donations for your particular cause.

20
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.640
In that case you could use many other services.

21
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.930
There's things like Kickstarter in the gogo or just other platforms for accepting donations.

22
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.420
But if you want to create your own particular flask application web site and you still want to accept

23
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.050
money Strype might be the solution for you.

24
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.670
All I'm trying to say is these sort of tasks are complicated enough that a lot of people have already

25
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.030
given out third party solutions for them including Strype.

26
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.010
So sometimes the best course of action is not actually programming yourself.

27
00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.830
However if you've come to the conclusion that yes I do need to program the ability to set payments on

28
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.680
my own web site myself Strype is a really nice solution because of just a few lines of code.

29
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.120
You can accept credit cards and debit cards from users all over the world and Strype basically handles

30
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.600
everything for you.

31
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.360
It's handles grabbing money from their bank account and then sending it over to yours on the Bakken

32
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.960
with Strype OK.

33
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.310
Now on top of that Strype is really easy to use and has really great documentation.

34
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.770
So we're going to be doing and this section is walking through creating a very basic donation Web site

35
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.780
that basically just accepts payments with a flask application using streite I think you'll see just

36
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.750
how easy it is to accept money of Strype and we'll be using some fake API keys that Strype puts out

37
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.030
publicly to kind of mimic the idea of the transaction.

38
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.460
If you actually want to accept real money you would need to create a straight account.

39
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.210
Keep in mind Strype those charge a percentage which I believe right now is 3 percent plus about 3 cents

40
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.460
per transaction.

41
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.360
I would recommend that you check out their web site for the latest documentation on what their current

42
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.940
fee is.

43
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.030
But it should be around 3 percent.

44
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.190
OK let's get started in the next lecture will actually begin building out this donation application.
