00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.660
Welcome back in this lecture we're going to discuss backgrounds and Borders see SS So we've already

2
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.330
discussed the color property in other really common property to adjust the background property and borders

3
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.170
property and the various properties that are similar or related to them.

4
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.260
We're also going to touch back on divs and spans that we discuss in the HTL crash course.

5
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.350
Let's get started.

6
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.950
All right.

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.650
Here have my basic H-2A metafile and I've linked it to the stylesheet master about C Ss and my master

8
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.980
that C Ss is currently blank.

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.970
Let's add a few elements to our H-2A.

10
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.140
And then we'll style some of their properties in the SS will begin by just creating a simple paragraph

11
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:54.370
tag and we'll say this is a paragraph but I'm also going to add in outside the div and then lets put

12
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.810
in a div tag.

13
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.380
So this div tag notice it's a division right now.

14
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.760
I'm not going to worry about class.

15
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.090
We'll talk about that in an upcoming lecture.

16
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.080
Instead I'm just going to have this division and I'm going to put in some paragraph text inside this

17
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.720
division so I'll say I'm inside the div and let's put in another paragraph tag.

18
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.230
Also inside the div.

19
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:27.070
And finally we'll put in one more paragraph tan I'll say inside the div thought thought thought and

20
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.180
then we're going to add in a span tab.

21
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.510
So get a little bit of space here and then start typing outspan and you should see span and were able

22
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.410
to autocomplete that.

23
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.910
Or you can just type it up manually.

24
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:47.020
The Open and span tags so inside of this will say in the span.

25
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.660
OK so I'm going to save those changes.

26
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.180
So how this paragraph and I have this division.

27
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.730
And when I refresh my basic's thought each time.

28
00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.370
Right now my CSSA is blank so I just see this is a paragraph outside the div I'm inside.

29
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.500
Also inside a div and then inside the div in a span.

30
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.030
So right now the divs in the spans they're not really showing up as any different than the other paragraphs.

31
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.550
OK now let's add in some CSSA style calls so we'll come back to master that CSSA and I'm actually going

32
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:27.420
to apply a style to the entire body and weren't going to explore is the background property so notice

33
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.800
as you begin to type background there's all kinds of property you can affect such as the origin the

34
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.000
size image position color and so on.

35
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.760
I'm just Mikol basic background.

36
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.230
And here if I provide a color let's say Grey for instance.

37
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.310
Save this and refresh anything that is within the body is going to have its background color changed

38
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.630
to grey and you should be careful with this sort of choice because you can make something really awful

39
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.080
like red and then you'll have this bright ugly red website but maybe you want it that way.

40
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.210
So it's also more power to you.

41
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.090
Now as an option where you can do is also provide a u r l image so it can say background.

42
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.310
Your L and I have opened here some image from an splash dot com and you can really point out to any

43
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.850
image hosted on line.

44
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:21.230
If I just copy this image address of this cute little puppy and paste it here into my actual Your L

45
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.830
tag.

46
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:30.060
The Riego still say background your URL and this really long image save those changes and will come

47
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.900
back here refreshed.

48
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.980
And now if you zoom out you should see this image and notice how it's actually being repeated.

49
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:46.900
So an option to make that stop is to add an background dash repeat.

50
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.500
And then you can say no repeat and look at this autocomplete that's actually telling us the option.

51
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.550
So that's really nice.

52
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.520
We can have it rippee along the x axis or y axis or just no repeat save that and only refreshes page

53
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.410
you only see that picture once.

54
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.400
Now for pretty much all our sites we're not going to really be having your backgrounds.

55
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.830
I just want to show you that you have that option.

56
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.410
OK.

57
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.530
So let me go ahead and comment all this out and I can comment this out just by highlighting all this

58
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.080
and then doing control forward slash.

59
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.300
Or you can just manually add and forward slash Asterix to the beginning and the end of whatever you

60
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.580
want to comment out.

61
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.510
So to say that it won't be affecting the body anymore.

62
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.060
Let's refresh this page.

63
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.520
There we go.

64
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:34.710
So now we have it nice and clean white and let's go back and now discuss these divs and this particular

65
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.740
span.

66
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.790
So let's imagine that I want to just style a certain portion of my website maybe I don't want to style

67
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.140
every single paragraph tag.

68
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.020
Instead I only want to style some of the paragraph tags.

69
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.460
This is where something like a div can come in real handy.

70
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.170
So what I am going to do is just refer to that div and then change the background of that division.

71
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.380
So I'll say background and notice by default.

72
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.690
I can just say background blue background color.

73
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.320
Ill treat it the same way I'm going to say that.

74
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.420
Set the background of blue here.

75
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.200
Refresh and everything inside the div is going to have background blue.

76
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.860
We can also affect the border.

77
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:23.000
So if you say border and give this a color such as orange save that then I can color this border that's

78
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.340
around the div but notice right now I'm not seeing any effect and that's because we haven't specified

79
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.820
how thick or how wide we want that border.

80
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.700
So I can say border dash with and then I can say medium thin or thick.

81
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.520
And then we also have to provide a border style sort of say border dash style and there's dasht grooves

82
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.940
hidden dotted will say dotted for now save that refresh.

83
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.980
And now I see a dotted orange border around this.

84
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.240
And you can play around with these border styles solid is another style that's really commonly used

85
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.500
reforest that.

86
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.510
And now you see this solid orange around that.

87
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.250
Keep in mind you can also provide actual pixels here so maybe you say 20 x for pixels if you want to

88
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.070
make it really thick or if you want to just have it be really thin maybe just say two pixels or something

89
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.600
like that refresh.

90
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.480
And I see this thinner orange.

91
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.310
OK.

92
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.750
So the main idea here is that you can affect the background color.

93
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.850
You can also set your all to your background.

94
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.850
You have border but the border is not going to show up unless you say border with and border style.

95
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.820
Now there is a shorthand for this and often what people do is instead of saying border border with and

96
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:44.060
border style you can actually combine all of these to just one line by providing it in this order so

97
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:52.160
you can say border orange to pick's solid and let's make it thicker something like 10 pixels.

98
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.460
Let's change the colors to red and let's make it dasht here.

99
00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.440
So you can provide a single line code like this.

100
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.410
And when we refresh this you'll see that taken effect.

101
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.650
So since people like to effect borders without having to write border with border style CSSA will also

102
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.690
accept these kind of three terms just linked to border.

103
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.630
OK.

104
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.080
So there are options for editing background them border and again notice what's happening.

105
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.160
It's only affecting div tags.

106
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.100
So just to show you again let's stylize all the paragraph tags.

107
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:30.260
I can say color and maybe make it really obvious something like all paragraphs should be yellow.

108
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:35.660
I run this and now all the paragraphs are yellow including the ones outside the div.

109
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.680
Now let's imagine I want to affect this one in the span in a span.

110
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:47.430
All I need to do is say span and then we can give it a specific background such as a red background

111
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.980
and we can change its color to something maybe black should be pretty obvious.

112
00:07:52.380 --> 00:08:00.770
Ok so now I refresh this page and I see in a span with a red background in black font color.

113
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.380
All right.

114
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.730
That's really the basics of what we're going to discuss here.

115
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.940
Again you have these background parameters these border parameters and you can run border either border

116
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.330
with border style or all as a single line.

117
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:17.010
And then we have the ability to tag paragraphs as well as divs and spans.

118
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:17.850
OK.

119
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.560
I hope that clarified why we use divs and spans as well.

120
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.070
Coming up next we're going to talk about selectors which is probably one of the most important aspects

121
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:31.090
of using C-s us being able to use IDS selectors and class selectors.

122
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.650
That's really what we're going to be doing most in our real life projects.

123
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.220
So it's going to be important to understand that very next lecture for this lecture.

124
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:42.740
All you need to understand is that you can affect backgrounds in Borders and you can call div and span

125
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.520
tags specifically if you have any questions feel free to post the Kewaunee forums.

126
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.730
We'll see you at the next lecture.
