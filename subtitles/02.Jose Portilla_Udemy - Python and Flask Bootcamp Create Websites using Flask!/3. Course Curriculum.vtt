00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.720
Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.230
We're going to go and have a high level overview of the course curriculum.

3
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.520
That way you can understand how the Course is structured.

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.540
And more importantly if you already know some topics that are in the course curriculum you can understand

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.230
which sections to skip and where you can just dive in.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.470
So let's get started.

7
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.590
Here are the major topics in the course curriculum and we go through them one by one.

8
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.430
Keep in mind some of these major topics are then divided further into subsections.

9
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.000
So after going through his course curriculum you should understand everything that we teach in the course

10
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.070
as well as if you already know something where to jump in.

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.370
Further along the course so we start off an introduction section that's the section you're in right

12
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.850
now.

13
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.360
It's the Course overview lecture.

14
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.360
This lecture is described in the course curriculum.

15
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.770
The fake Q lecture which is just an article lecture of some useful links and frequently asked questions.

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.510
And remember if you're ever looking for the source files that are available as a zip file here either

17
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.690
in FNQ lecture or in the course overview lecture the one previous to this one that said Don't skip.

18
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.600
OK so you should already have an understanding of where to find your notes.

19
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.450
By the time you're doing this lecture then we have a couple of sections that I'm going to label as a

20
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.540
front end crash course.

21
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.870
Essentially you have three major crash courses for the front end material and that's a crash course

22
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.540
on HVM L C Ss and bootstrap.

23
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.470
For now many users especially have already done previous web development.

24
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.140
You may be already familiar with those and concepts.

25
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.240
So if you are please feel free to skip.

26
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.320
According to your skill level each of these crash courses does have some sort of project exercise.

27
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.280
At the end of it.

28
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.980
So if you want to make sure that your understanding is up to par which with what we teach here in the

29
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.020
course you can always just skip ahead to those project exercises.

30
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.110
Check them out and then see if you can pass them.

31
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.690
So we're going to cover those three main topics aist in LCS and bootstrap.

32
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.300
Those are really just the basic level you need to know in order to continue on and learning about Python

33
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.270
and flask.

34
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.610
So once we go through those front end crash courses they're pretty short sections each.

35
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.940
Then we have a larger section which is just an overall Python crash course essentially a mini Python

36
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.490
course inside of this entire class course and we've broken this up into two levels because it's very

37
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.580
likely that someone already has Python experience if they're interested in learning flask.

38
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.460
So I divided it up into basic Python and then advanced Python.

39
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.780
The basic Python that discusses things from the very basics such as objects data types.

40
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.280
Very basic data structures.

41
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.510
How to perform a control flow like if an L statements and then ends up talking about functions.

42
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.070
So if you already understand that stuff and you already know how to create a function of Python you

43
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.470
may be able to skip that first level of basic Python then Level 2.

44
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.090
That's a more advanced action on Python that discusses things like object oriented programming decorators

45
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.700
and how to create your own modules.

46
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.080
Those kind of ideas aren't necessary to fully understand the flask framework so maybe have a little

47
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.370
bit of basic Python you know to create basic functions but you haven't learned about things like decorators

48
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.850
or object oriented programming.

49
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.450
Then you can jump into the advanced Python section and check that all out OK.

50
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.270
So after that entire section on Python those two sections then we actually start learning about flask.

51
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.000
So we'll start off with the very basics of flask.

52
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.010
Essentially an overview of flask applications and really get a focus here on how to route a flask application

53
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.380
to show different web pages on your actual web app that we have a couple of sections on building out

54
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.600
this idea of basic flasks and there are three really important sections and we'll divided up into templates

55
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.260
forms and databases.

56
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.510
So the template section that's going to show you how to actually connect the HTL files and essentially

57
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.210
all that front end stuff to flask and then also cover Jinja templating there so you can directly send

58
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.490
information from glass to the front end of your web site.

59
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.400
Then the next section will talk about forms essentially how to create forms with flasks for input.

60
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.410
We talk about HMO forms and the front end crash course section but then this shows you how you can easily

61
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.290
create those forms with flask automatically.

62
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.690
Then after that we talk about databases essentially once you actually get input from a form how do you

63
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.080
save that to your database so you can retrieve it later on.

64
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.870
So we talk all about databases in that third section.

65
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.230
Now by the time you're finished with this section you actually understand how to make a basic web site

66
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.530
you understand how to take in user information save it report it back.

67
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.320
So by the time you're done with flask basics templates forms and databases you really have a ton of

68
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.380
knowledge of how to actually create real web applications.

69
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.100
So then we're talking about our more advanced topics such as how to actually structure larger flask

70
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.300
applications.

71
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.920
So the previous lectures before this are going to talk more simplified applications but here we're really

72
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.560
going to have an in-depth discussion on how we like something called blueprints to organize flask applications

73
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.460
that can scale to a much larger structure that would talk about things like user authentication.

74
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.110
So have a whole section on that.

75
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.890
And those are things like user registration user logons just general authentication practices such as

76
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.180
storing passwords and we'll even talk about auth for outside authorization.

77
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.980
Those are the kind of things when you go to a Web site and it says log in with Facebook or logon to

78
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.920
Google or log in with Twitter.

79
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.520
That's called authorisations.

80
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.400
You basically like any other web site handly your authorization and show you how to do that with something

81
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.870
like Twitter to log into the Web site in case you don't want to implement your own registration or logging

82
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.860
practice.

83
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.480
Then we get to a very large portion of the course which is a huge social network project essentially

84
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.620
taking everything we've learned so far including the front end the Python the flask and all that good

85
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.160
stuff and we create a very large project that has gone to a lot of those important features altogether.

86
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.260
So we'll talk about having multiple users authenticating them how to register new users to your Web

87
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.230
site how to connect all those users to non-skilled database how to use blueprints to have posts and

88
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.310
how users can follow other users.

89
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.860
So all those little details and we'll have that all in a very large projects are going to learn a lot

90
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.250
and will be a really nice review as you code along.

91
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.240
And it's going to be an awesome project and later on to either your friends or your colleagues.

92
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.080
Then after that we talk about some more esoteric topics which you may or may not need the pending on

93
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.240
the scale of our Web site.

94
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.070
And those are going to be things like touching at rest.

95
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.850
API.

96
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.230
So you can create a restful interface for your web site and also other things like how to accept payments

97
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.920
we stripe.

98
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.220
So it may be you do or don't want to actually accept money for your web site but we'll show you how

99
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.010
to do that anyways.

100
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.830
And some of these more advanced topics it is going to be shorter sections sister a little more advance

101
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.640
and you may or may not need them.

102
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.380
OK.

103
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.060
And that's really essentially the entire course curriculum.

104
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.680
Kind of a broad level here.

105
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.010
And as you go through of course we'll dive into much better detail about all those little individual

106
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.700
topics.

107
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.210
All right.

108
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.110
If you have any questions on where is a good fit for you to jump forward in the course.

109
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.130
If you already feel familiar some of these topics feel free to post the Q&amp;A and forums or send me a

110
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.700
message.

111
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.290
I'm always happy to help you find a good starting point.

112
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.880
Thanks.

113
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.290
And up next we'll talk about just in general how a flask website works.

114
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.590
OK we'll see you there.
