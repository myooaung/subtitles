00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.350
Welcome back in this final lecture in our crash course section of each team all we're going to quickly

2
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.900
discuss form selections basically we're just going to explore a few more form input types that require

3
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.670
some extra element Tex.

4
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.480
Let's get started.

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.310
All right here we are back in our basic watched him l file.

6
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.760
I have a form object and we're just going to cover three types of inputs extra ones and those are linking

7
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.620
radio buttons dropdown menus and text area inputs.

8
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.760
So let's create an example form for asking if someone owns a dog.

9
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.600
Or create a heading inside of this and say do you already own a dog.

10
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.360
Question mark.

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.600
Save this.

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.100
I refreshed the page and now I see do you already own a dog.

13
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.080
So what I can do is I can have an input type and the type I can provide is radio and if you just refresh

14
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.910
this you should now see a little radio button show up.

15
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.700
So let's give this some names and values.

16
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.250
So I'll say the name of this is dog choice and the value is yes.

17
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.520
And let's connect it to a label.

18
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.620
So the label will say call it.

19
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.950
Yes.

20
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.540
And then give it an idea of yes as well.

21
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.320
So that way we can connect this label to this radio button.

22
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.510
And also yes save that and when it refreshed us I now see the already own a dog.

23
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.550
Yes.

24
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.400
And then the radio button.

25
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.140
OK.

26
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.150
So that's a single radio button.

27
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.770
Often however you'll see multiple radio buttons and you'll see them connected to each other.

28
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:52.340
So what we can do for that is zoom out a little bit here and I'm going to copy and paste these values

29
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.360
so I see label again.

30
00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.850
Except this time we'll have this setup for no I'll type out instead of four yes we'll make this no.

31
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.100
We'll make the label know as well and change the ID to be No.

32
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.310
We can still have the same name because we're basically going to connect this radio button to this radio

33
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.640
button.

34
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.300
So only one of them can be selected and that will change the value

35
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.670
save this refresh your page.

36
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.190
Now you'll notice you have a yes and no radio button.

37
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.800
So do you already own a dog.

38
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.630
Yes or no.

39
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.040
And notice when they click YES NO automatically gets de-selected.

40
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.590
And the reason that happens because these two input radio types are connected because they're sharing

41
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.900
the same name.

42
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.850
If I were to change one of these names for instance stock choice to save that refresh you'll notice

43
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.260
that all of a sudden I can actually select both if I want these to be connected.

44
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.790
I should set them up to have the same name which makes sense because that way when I actually submit

45
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.990
the form I'll just have a name and then select the value either yes or no.

46
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.220
So we'll save that and that's the basics of using a radio button.

47
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.340
And that's the basics of also linking or connecting to radio buttons.

48
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.580
All right.

49
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.030
So we already have the already own a dock set up and then the linked radio buttons to them.

50
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.890
We also have the option of using dropdown menu.

51
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:29.270
So let's come back in here and zoom in a bit we'll create a paragraph just asking someone how clean

52
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.910
is your house.

53
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.700
Let's say from 1 to 3 so we'll say three is the cleanest.

54
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.480
The next step of tag we're going to talk about is the select tag.

55
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.380
So the select 10 we can go ahead and not worry about class and that's going to be related to success

56
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.140
but we can give it a name we'll say something like stars for one two three stars.

57
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.760
How clean is the house.

58
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.060
And then instead of this we have option tags.

59
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.860
So we'll say option and then we can give a value here.

60
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.580
So our internal value will be great and we'll say 3 as the option that the user sees.

61
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:16.800
I will copy this two more times and we'll say this next one is good at level 2 and then we'll say this

62
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.260
last one is just bad.

63
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.890
So it's not a very clean house.

64
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.110
At one so let's save that and refresh.

65
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.010
And now I see how clean is your house.

66
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.090
That's that paragraphed how we have here.

67
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.800
And then we have this selection of various options.

68
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.240
And this is the dropdown menu so I can say 3 2 or 1.

69
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.190
And what happens is the viewer of your web site is going to see what's in between these options text

70
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.690
3 to one.

71
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.300
But when you actually submit this form you're going to connect this name to whatever value was chosen

72
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.500
just as we saw in the last lecture.

73
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.710
Instead of that you URL where we said the name is equal to some value in the same way that when you

74
00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.210
submit this form you'll have Daag choice connected to either yes or no.

75
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.630
You'll have name stars connected to either great good or bad.

76
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.770
And this is how you can create a dropdown menu inside your form.

77
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.650
Lastly we can show you how to create a text area.

78
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:22.270
So I'll say any other comments inside of my form and then we'll say text area and here we can give it

79
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.890
a name we can give it a number of rows and number of columns that basically defines how large the text

80
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.560
area box should appear.

81
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.210
So if we save that and refresh then I get to see this text area box show up.

82
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:41.200
And in fact we can expand this so I can see that this is essentially just a large text box.

83
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.510
And if you wanted to be smaller.

84
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:49.500
All we need to do is release or reduce the number of columns.

85
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.310
So for instance I want three columns maybe by four rows.

86
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.130
Save those changes refresh and I'll get a much smaller box to begin with.

87
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.620
Keep in mind most browsers allow the user to automatically resize that text area once that's all done.

88
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:12.770
You can just have an input button at the end for submit type save that and then we should give it a

89
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.030
value something like Submit Feedback.

90
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.480
Save it refresh.

91
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.000
Now I see.

92
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.830
Any other comments.

93
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.410
Submit Feedback.

94
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.650
All right.

95
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.890
Let's finish off this lecture by actually submitting our form and expand my window here a bit.

96
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.560
We're just going to provide some general values.

97
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.690
You already own a dog.

98
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.800
I'll say yes.

99
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.840
How Clean Is Your House.

100
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.230
I'll say two and then any other comments.

101
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.810
I will say none.

102
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.730
Keep in mind that right now my form actually doesn't have an action parameter and that's because Wolfville

103
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.670
in the action attribute later if you don't actually fill it in what happens is you just end up refreshing

104
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.830
the page with the name value pairs.

105
00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:01.430
So I have yes two and none hit Submit Feedback and now I get to see the name value pairs appear Mayerle

106
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.730
from the get method.

107
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.910
It says Daag choice is equal to yes Starrs is equal to good in name is equal to none.

108
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.570
Keep in mind it says stars is equal to good because that's a name value pair.

109
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:18.350
I chose back in the form so even though the user gets to see these three to ones if he come back down

110
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.710
here and take a look at the options three to 1.

111
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.880
That's what the user sees in the back and you're only dealing with name and value pairs.

112
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.330
OK so that's it for those extra.

113
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.860
Form selection types.

114
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.270
Won't be using them too often but you should be aware of them and you can check out the documentation

115
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.930
links from the previous lectures.

116
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.530
Inside those H.A. files to explore various other H.A. him forum types.

117
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.530
Keep in mind in the future we're going to be automating a lot of this through the use of a flask.

118
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.870
Thanks and we'll see at the next lecture where we're going to have just a quick final assessment for

119
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.580
the tonight crash course.
