00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.640
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.750
We've already seen how to run our site and test the capabilities of registering logging in and logging

3
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.290
out as users as well as updating a user account.

4
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.480
Now it's time to move off to the second main component which is the blog post component so we'll start

5
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.070
off by setting up the forms for creating a new blog post and then we'll move on to connecting the views

6
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.960
to the blog post templates.

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.140
Let's get started.

8
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.150
So we're going to do this lecture is just set up our forms for our blog posts.

9
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.190
So underneath the blog posts directory I have this forms up high file.

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.830
So underneath blog posts right now we're in forums stop PI and this will actually be a pretty simple

11
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.870
form to set up.

12
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:53.530
We're just going to say from flask WCF import flask form then we'll save from the beauty forms import

13
00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.120
and we'll say String Field submit field and then text area field Ritchies in text area because that's

14
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.760
going to be the larger text portion of a blog post.

15
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.650
And then finally you will added some validators so we don't just have empty blog posts will say from

16
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.150
W.T. forums that validators import data required then we'll just set up a simple class here.

17
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.600
Call it blog post form will inherit from flask form and we really just have two things we need to check.

18
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.760
One is that the tiles been provided.

19
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.750
So say the string field title and then the validators.

20
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.820
We're actually going to require a title in order to display correctly and then the text of the actual

21
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.540
blog post.

22
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.790
So that's going to be a text field to give the user more room than will say text and then the validator.

23
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.100
Here again is just going to be data required then to have a submit button to submit their form.

24
00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.030
Remember by default we actually have the date of the blog post automatically set to when they hit this

25
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.750
button.

26
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.900
So the Submit field will go ahead and just saying like post.

27
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.090
You can also say blog post whatever you want that button to say so save that and we successfully set

28
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.830
up our forms for our blog posts.

29
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.710
So pretty short lecture because coming up next we're going to the harder part which is actually setting

30
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.280
up the views we'll see at the next lecture where we set up the views for the blog posts.
