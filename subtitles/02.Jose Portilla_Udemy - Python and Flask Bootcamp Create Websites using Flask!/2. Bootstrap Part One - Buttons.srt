00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,610
Welcome back to this lecture on bootstrap basics and buttons and this lecture.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,980
We're going to discuss how to actually link your H T.M. to bootstrap C Ss and javascript files as well

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,910
as containers jumbo trons and buttons of bootstrap.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,200
Let's get started.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,170
We're going to have our browser open as well as our text editor.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,380
OK so here I have a basic H.T. mail file and it's empty right now.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,730
And they also have the get bootstrap documentation on the home page and another tablet's linked to the

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,270
to him file.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,550
So let's go ahead and fill this in of some skeleton code.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,560
H team.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,640
Save it.

12
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:45,620
And in the body I'll have a heading one that says Hello world.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,560
EXCLAMATION POINT we'll save this.

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,820
Refresh our browser and now see.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,220
Hello world there.

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,870
Now let's see what happens when we actually connect the stage to himself to bootstrap.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,160
We can do this easily by coming back to the home page scrolling down and you'll notice there's a link

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,580
for the CSSA here.

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:09,370
So let's grab this and let's make sure we get that closing tag as well go all the way to the left.

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:16,220
Copy that and I'm going to paste in inside of this head in between the open closing head tags.

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,890
I'm going to paste in that link for the stylesheet.

22
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:24,950
So that's the stylesheet that's being hosted online that are each HTML file will automatically connect

23
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,770
to and we can also do is copy and paste these other script lines.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,190
And this basically connects to the javascript and Jay query so we can copy that and place that as well.

25
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:41,560
Not every component needs these scripts right here are these links to javascript but some components

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,620
that have a little bit more interactivity will need them.

27
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,140
So we'll make note of that when we actually need them or not.

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,150
Typically you just copy and paste all of them.

29
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:55,000
So I will save that and let's refresh our page and see what happens.

30
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,550
So part of being refreshed noticed that there's a couple of changes here now.

31
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,460
Or Hello world is in a different font.

32
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,620
And also the margins and kind of buffers around hello world have changed as well.

33
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,780
So we're going to do now is explore various class calls we can make with bootstrap What are the most

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,010
common class calls we are going to make is putting things in a container.

35
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:26,700
So often you're going to start a div and for the class you report back a container class and here is

36
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,560
where we can have a Heading 1 and we'll say hello world exclamation point.

37
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,610
Save that and this hello world you'll notice is inside this container which is going to automatically

38
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,070
set some margins to the left and to the right and it's actually smart to be responsive.

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,950
So as you begin to move your browser size maybe reviewing on a mobile device it can automatically set

40
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,870
the text to where it needs to be.

41
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,650
So it actually senses the size of the browser that it's being looked at.

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,680
OK.

43
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,770
Now we can also add in some buttons and we can do this with an HMO button that so create a button tag

44
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,430
here and we'll have the Type-B button and the name be button.

45
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:15,340
And right now in between the open and closing button tags I'm just going to type button so I can save

46
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,970
that in if I hit refresh here.

47
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,280
Now I see this nice button and nothing happens when I click on it.

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:29,090
But if we take a look back at bootstrap and go to the documentation and then click on the components

49
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,190
and Button section you should notice a bunch of examples for different buttons.

50
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:39,200
So pretty much by default there is different colorings for buttons such as a warning button or a danger

51
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,760
button and all you need to do is copy the class call to this.

52
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,440
So for instance the primary button this blue we can add that in as a class call inside of the button.

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:59,300
So say class copy and paste between space between primary save that and then coming back to our basic

54
00:03:59,300 --> 00:03:59,840
page to him.

55
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,950
We're refresh.

56
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,530
Now you notice it's stylized as a primary button and there's lots of preexisting bootstrap templates

57
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,670
that can't affect the colors of these and you could always override with your own color classes as well.

58
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,700
So you can come down here and check out the other button tags.

59
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:22,690
You can do kind of outline buttons different sizes so let's say we want a large secondary button like

60
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,910
the one shown there.

61
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:29,200
I can copy that code come back here we can create another button.

62
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:38,560
And this button will just say large and let's pass in that class call so will copy and paste that in

63
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,250
between BT and secondary tan large save that and when it come back to basic it's HTML refresh.

64
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:52,070
Now I see that larger secondary color button is the main idea behind our use cases for bootstrap.

65
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,990
We're just going to come to the documentation.

66
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,650
Scroll down until we find the components we like.

67
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,780
Check out the examples see which ones you liked and then you can copy and paste the classes.

68
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,810
So there's ways to kind of disable the state of the button.

69
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,930
So here I can clearly click on them here when they're disabled.

70
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,160
I can't so it can copy and paste that as well.

71
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,800
And you can scroll down here and see the other toggle States.

72
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,450
So you're able to toggle buttons on and off essentially changing the color.

73
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,160
See if a has been checked or not etc..

74
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,370
So here we can see just a bunch of buttons.

75
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,400
So if you ever want to copy and play around of these.

76
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,200
All you need to do is click here on the copy of the clipboard.

77
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:35,530
Come back to each T.M. and you can put this inside of a new div save those changes come back here refresh.

78
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,820
And I see that example.

79
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,860
So we have these kind of active radio buttons there and something you should get really comfortable

80
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,220
with.

81
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,570
It's just come into documentation and looking for those components and copy and pasting and playing

82
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,800
around with a lot of these class calls.

83
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,540
The last thing I want to mention is the Jumbotron class.

84
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,850
So if you scroll down you can see an example of a here jumbotron and it's a lightweight flexible component

85
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,500
that really is kind of like a showcase message for your web site.

86
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:09,050
So I'm going to remove all of this here including the hello world and I'll create a new div and give

87
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,790
it the class Jumbotron.

88
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:18,310
And inside this DiVall say H-1 and say hello and welcome.

89
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,260
We'll see if those changes come back to basics or a smell to a refresh.

90
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,460
Now I see this nice background in gray.

91
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,900
Hello and welcome.

92
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:34,180
And often if you want to censor this way you can do is put this whole div inside of another div with

93
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,190
a container class.

94
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:43,480
So then we can grab this div with the Jumbotron stick that inside some container save it and when refresh.

95
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:50,120
Now we see it being contained to the center and it will adjust as we kind of expand or contract or browser

96
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,960
size.

97
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,070
So Jumbotron is something we're going to be using a lot more throughout the course and you can always

98
00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:01,680
copy and paste these examples here so we can copy that paste it here so now I see there's a jumbotron

99
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:08,040
with some display classes some late classes save that will come back here refresh and you get to see

100
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,000
that example.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,150
So it's up to you whether you want to put it in a container or not depends on what you want your website

102
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,040
to look like.

103
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,560
Main idea being you can always come to the bootstrap documentation and copy and paste from the examples

104
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,250
here and then adjust to the way you see necessary.

105
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,280
So if you don't want to say hello world who's come find the heading one and have it say something like

106
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,060
puppies are awesome.

107
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,190
Save that.

108
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,550
Refresh our page.

109
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,460
And now we see puppies are awesome.

110
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:37,980
OK.

111
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,740
So that's the very basics of using boot strap.

112
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,380
Coming up next we're going to briefly discuss bootstrap forms.

113
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,680
And after that we'll talk about Neph bars.

114
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,600
I'll see you there.
