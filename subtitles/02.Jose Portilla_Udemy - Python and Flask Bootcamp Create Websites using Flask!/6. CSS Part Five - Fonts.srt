1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,780
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,760
In this last part of our CSSA crash course we're going to quickly discuss Funk's we can apply custom

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,530
fonts to our Web sites through the use of font properties in the CSA.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,090
Let's quickly explore how we can use the Google font API to add custom fonts as well as we can explore

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,610
various font properties such as font sizes and font families.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,000
We'll get started by jumping over to the text editor and later we'll head over to the browser.

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,150
OK here we have a basic thought HCM elf file.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,050
I also have a master that see SS that it's linked to with no actual links right now.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,070
Any tags or any styles that are basic H-2A smell.

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,490
Let's add a few element components.

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,200
We'll have a Heading 1 and we'll just have the same header one.

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,330
And then let's quickly add two paragraphs so I'll say a paragraph.

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,950
And if you begin typing Lorem you should see larm some pop up enter and then will autocomplete that

14
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:04,700
generic Lorem of some text which is just filler Latin text and create another paragraph except this

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,480
one will give it a specific ID of two.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,880
That way we can make sure to differentiate it from the first paragraph tag and then we'll say warm gypsum

17
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,430
enter and save.

18
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,850
So basically we just have three components here a heading and then two paragraphs one of them with a

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,230
specialized ID.

20
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,160
Let's refresh our page and I get to see no header Lorem Ipsum and then ipsum.

21
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,950
Now let's mess around with the actual C Ss.

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,590
So let's imagine that we want to actually change the font being used.

23
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:42,410
Keep in mind that is available on every OS so only certain fonts are available on Windows and certain

24
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:49,280
fonts are available on Macs and you can check out the CSSA file for this particular lecture for wikipedia

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,410
links on the list of typefaces that are included of Microsoft Windows and Elyssa type places that are

26
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:00,970
included with Mac OS so let's say I want to change the actual font of the header.

27
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:10,050
I can say H-1 and then I'll say Fonte dash family and I can change it to be cursive.

28
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,140
So I'll see cursive there save.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,460
And then when I refresh notice now it's technically in cursive.

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,940
Now this may not look like cursive but it's the way the browser is going to represent this particular

31
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,800
style of cursive.

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,780
We can also do other font families like monospace save that hit refresh and then I see a monospace font

33
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,690
for that heading and the previously mentioned inside the CSSA file we have commented links as far as

34
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,230
the list of typefaces that are included that differ operating systems.

35
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,280
So if you go to one of those links for example the one for Microsoft and zoom out here a bit so we can

36
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,000
see it.

37
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,860
I can see the list of typefaces included Microsoft Windows.

38
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,870
So since I'm running on Windows I could technically choose any of these for my actual styling.

39
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,010
So for instance let's choose this font right here.

40
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,790
Colibri.

41
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,270
So I'll say font family and paste it in.

42
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,570
Save it and then for the basic one for refresh.

43
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,510
Now I have that specific font.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,780
I can continue it down maybe use something like console this grab that.

45
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,050
Copy paste save it refresh and not showing that font type.

46
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,210
OK there's other things we can't continue to edit.

47
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:31,660
Let's do this on our paragraph Ted so we can edit the font size so I can say font size and then specify

48
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,380
the font size in pixels.

49
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,610
So if all my paragraphs appear larger I can say show them as 20 pixels.

50
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,310
I'll come over here and refresh and now I can see that my paragraphs are now larger.

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,340
Keep in mind I'm zoomed in here.

52
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:52,820
We can also do things like affect the font style or font white so I can say font weights and make this

53
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,400
bold or normal.

54
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,670
Some of these won't be actually effective on certain families.

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,690
Just keep that in mind.

56
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,940
Not every font family can be made bold or italics but most normal ones can.

57
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:11,860
So if I refresh Now I could see everything in bold and maybe we can also say font style will say font

58
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,900
style then it can have it be a taluk or normalized.

59
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,200
So say it taluk refresh.

60
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:22,170
And now I see everything that's paragraph in bold metallics and there there's also text properties.

61
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,510
That's the last one I want to mention.

62
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,800
So you can align the text give it shadow transform it so a text line is probably the most commonly used

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,250
one and it just whether you want to align it left right justified or center.

64
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,100
So let's go ahead and do Center here.

65
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,600
And if I refresh this now I see everything center along my browser center here.

66
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:48,450
OK so those are various font parameters or attributes that you'll be playing around with in your C Ss.

67
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,950
The last thing I want to explore is actually grabbing a font from online and then implementing it into

68
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,720
your web site.

69
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,610
And the best site for this is the Google font API and the best way to find this is if you go to your

70
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,970
browser and expand the right here.

71
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,870
And if you google search Google fonts you should be able to find here.

72
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,170
The Fahnestock Google dot com.

73
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,440
Go ahead and select the and then you'll be able to see a list of all the Google fonts so we can see

74
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,830
here.

75
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,420
Sunflower open sands.

76
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,130
And you can actually search so there's a search capability and you can sort it by trending.

77
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,980
Most popular alphabetical search ones that look more like handwriting.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,100
See different categories.

79
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,930
You can choose so let's choose a very unique one.

80
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,830
The specifica looks pretty unique so once you actually want it you can actually edit by typing in here.

81
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,670
So let's say we like the specific font.

82
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,570
We want to include it in our Web site.

83
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:45,020
I could just click here on the plus button select this font and you should see a little one family select

84
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,270
that pop up over here on the bottom.

85
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,640
Expand that and this will inform you on how to actually add this into your website to notice.

86
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,020
Do you have this link.

87
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,560
And that's basically a style sheet reference to this particular font.

88
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,610
So there's two steps of this one is adding this link to the HVM L and the second one is specifying the

89
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,870
font family insider SS So let's grab this link.

90
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,030
We're going to copy this.

91
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,910
We're going to come back here to basic thought Tim L and in addition to our master that see SS.

92
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,500
I'm going to add in that link to the stylesheet.

93
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,330
So let me zoom out so you can see this here.

94
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,020
I'm just copying and pasting that same link that Google fonts provided.

95
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:33,290
So link a reference to the Google fonts API and then we see the family relations style sheet.

96
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,830
Save that change come back to your C Ss over here and the for the font family.

97
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,400
You're going to again copy and paste the command was given to you by Google fonts.

98
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,060
So here we can specify font family Pacific go cursive.

99
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,340
Copy this.

100
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,870
And now let's apply it to the heading 1.

101
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,240
So we'll save that and in fact let's apply it.

102
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,750
Everything on the page.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,450
So I'll say it for the paragraph as well.

104
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:04,110
We'll come back to our basic h him l that's linked here and I'm going to refresh.

105
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,340
And now I see everything in that Google fonts API font family style.

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,540
Pretty easy right.

107
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,470
So now you have full access to all the Google fonts simply by adding a link to your HVM L and then by

108
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:21,000
adding in the font family call inside your CSSA file again.

109
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,720
Let's quickly go over those steps.

110
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,480
All you need can do is come to Fahnestock Google dot com.

111
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,120
Select the fonts you like and you can select multiples just add with the plus signs.

112
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:37,320
Expand this window you'll get a list for what link you should provide in your stylesheet and then how

113
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,500
to specify these font families inside your C S S call.

114
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,130
They just add that link to your mail and then specify that C Ss is the font family.

115
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,600
OK that's it for this lecture.

116
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,460
Hope you enjoyed it.

117
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,670
Coming up next we'll have a quick crash course assessment to make sure you understood all these new

118
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,790
skills and see assess will see.
