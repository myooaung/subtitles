00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.360
Welcome back to your first assessment.

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.760
We're going to test your new skills before we continue with the crash course for each team.

3
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.160
Your task is to recreate the T.M. for a site shown in your browser.

4
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.560
What I want you to do is inside of the H team I'll crash course folder.

5
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.600
You should see a file called Part 6.

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.470
Each time assessment one but each team will go ahead and without peeking at it inside your text editor.

7
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.010
Just double click on the file to open it in your browser.

8
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.150
So once you double click on this and see it in your browser Let's go ahead and check it out.

9
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.850
Now in your browser you should see something like this.

10
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.710
And basically what I want you to do is try your best to recreate this site from HVM L.

11
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.920
So notice here how we have a Heading 1 Welcome to our Web site that I have a paragraph here.

12
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.700
I'm excited to eventually learn flask and then I have a link to the official flask website so you'll

13
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.530
have to use an anchor tag for that.

14
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.450
There's another paragraph and then I have an image here of a puppy and we've actually provided this

15
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.480
as a jpg file already for you.

16
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.050
It's called puppie underscore Picot JPA.

17
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.480
And if you open up the notes.

18
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.550
So again underneath H.M.S. a bootstrap underneath each team will crash course.

19
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.450
There's already a puppy Picot jpg file and it's resized for you.

20
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.090
So it's not the huge file we were working with earlier and the file I'm looking at right now is perts

21
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.900
6 h HTML assessment 1.

22
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.590
That's what we have open in my browser.

23
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.010
Once you linked that image locally then I want you to create another paragraph with an ordered list.

24
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.950
Very simple.

25
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.380
Lots of ill will add ons and create a website in a few minutes.

26
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.490
As a bonus optional X credits section I want you to see if you can figure out how you can make a picture

27
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.720
into a link.

28
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.600
So here I have an image from online just the flask logo.

29
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.820
And if I click on this they'll actually take me to the flask Web site.

30
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.600
So that's something we did not specifically cover which is why it's a bonus optional extra credit problem.

31
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.900
But what I want you to do is in general just be able to view a web site like this in your browser and

32
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.680
then be able to create the components from your text editor Tim L.

33
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.030
So heading some paragraphs some inkers links putting in an image and then an ordered list.

34
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.690
All right don't worry so much about having text match exactly.

35
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.470
Basically as long as you can create the main components you're good to go thanks.

36
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.420
And we'll see you in the next lecture where we go over an example solution.
