00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.770
Welcome back the last series of lectures for this age Tim I'll crash course are going to focus on forms.

2
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.980
Let's start off with the forms basics.

3
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.220
A major function of really any web site is except user information as input that can be you typing in

4
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.890
a search term into Google and then hitting submit.

5
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.290
That can be you registering for a web site providing your e-mail and password or really any sort of

6
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.960
submission to the site where you're providing information and then clicking some kind of Submit button.

7
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.420
We used a form tax to set up a form then we can add special input tags to accept user information and

8
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.590
pretty much every major form element already has a corresponding input tag attribute.

9
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.530
We'll discuss the basic input elements and special tags for it now and then later on we'll discuss more

10
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.760
complex tags.

11
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.070
At the end what we do is we provide a submit input type and that automatically adds in a button for

12
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.590
form submission later on we're going to also be exploring how to create these sort of forms automatically

13
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.440
with flask in Python for it.

14
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.760
Now let's understand that HTL basics.

15
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.190
That way when we understand how to build them a flask we can connect that to let's get started.

16
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.540
All right.

17
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.410
Here you have a basic thought to himself while connected to my browser and there's nothing in this HMO

18
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.430
right now.

19
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.730
So let's go ahead and autofill it with the basics of each table and we'll just provide a paragraph tag

20
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.760
saying test saved that will refresh the page and then we can see testers showing up here.

21
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.560
So we're good to go.

22
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.890
Now let's come back here and can remove this test and what I'm going to do is add an A form tag so I'll

23
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.520
say for hit enter and it should automatically create a opening form for you as well as a closing form

24
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.290
tag.

25
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.090
You'll notice that this opening form Tang has several attributes such as class action and method.

26
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.600
We'll be discussing these attributes in more detail in the next lecture.

27
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.630
For right now feel free to delete them.

28
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.320
So you just have a basic form opening tag and a basic form closing tag inside of this form.

29
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.270
You can add things like headers and labels.

30
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:24.860
So for example I can say H-1 log in and then let's say H-2 please input your e-mail and password I'll

31
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.340
save that and when I refreshed this it says log in please input your email and password.

32
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.230
Now let's discuss how to actually put input tags to do this.

33
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.320
You start typing out input and have a autocomplete again input tags will have attributes themselves

34
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.180
such as type name and value.

35
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.590
Right now let's just focus on the very basic ones which is the type attribute this type attribute essentially

36
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.310
tells the browser what kind of actual input box you're going to render if it's a default text and I

37
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.810
save this and refresh then you'll see a little text box show up and you can type text in here.

38
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.270
There's other types such as password and this password input.

39
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.790
If I save this and refresh this is an input box yes specifically designed to set passwords and what

40
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.460
that means is as you begin to type you'll see that the information is hidden from view and that's because

41
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.040
this input understands that passwords for security purposes should be hidden from someone looking over

42
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.460
your shoulder.

43
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.470
So we have these various types that we can supply to our inputs.

44
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.900
Now you've probably noticed these other attributes name and value and these attributes themselves are

45
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.030
going to make a lot more sense when we actually submit a form before right now you can think of value

46
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.450
as the actual value that is passed back to whatever the next page or whatever to your server is requesting

47
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.640
upon submission of the form name.

48
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.670
Here is the identifier of this value.

49
00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.140
Again this will make more sense when we actually submit the forms for it now we can leave them blank

50
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.960
and continue on.

51
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.170
So we have an input type of password already.

52
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.530
Let's create one more input type for the e-mail save this and when we refresh.

53
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.910
Now I see one for my email and then one for my password.

54
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.100
Then finally what we can do is add a submission button so I can type out input and then further type

55
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.900
I will say submit.

56
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.510
And if you just type submit like this with no name and no value save this and refresh.

57
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.050
You should notice a little grace submission button that's waiting to be clicked.

58
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.000
Right now there's no text inside of that submission button.

59
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:44.500
Since we're going to do for the value of submit you can type out some sort of text string to show up

60
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.020
inside of this text and so it a little button.

61
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.520
So I will say enter save refresh.

62
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.450
And now I see.

63
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.290
Enter here.

64
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.900
So I'm providing values equal to enter and now I get to see enter inside of this button for that form.

65
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.050
OK.

66
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.960
So let's see what happens when I actually provide an e-mail and a password.

67
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.840
So I'll say my e-mail and e-mail dot com type in whatever.

68
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.820
Three letters for a password enter and then right now nothing's actually happening.

69
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.290
And that's because we haven't really selected any sort of action for our form.

70
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:27.590
That is those attributes that we first saw when we typed out that form attribute tag what we'll be discussing

71
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.890
in the next lecture is how to actually accept this submission of the form and then send it either to

72
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.800
another page or back to your server.

73
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.110
The last thing I want to point out is that these specialized types such as email will also sometimes

74
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.150
prevent you from submitting the form.

75
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.380
So if we come back here and we try to submit something that is not an e-mail.

76
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.580
So notice this isn't an email because it doesn't have an app OPERATOR It doesn't have a dot org but

77
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.250
com is just a string not an e-mail.

78
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.420
And if I hit some random letters for password I hit enter.

79
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.740
Notice the submissions actually get in block now.

80
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.450
So some browsers will display this differently but most of them will say something like hey please include

81
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:11.330
an ad in the e-mail address so you can notice already just by specifying the type is e-mail the browser

82
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.150
will perform its own default checking to try and make sure that what's being provided is in fact an

83
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.290
actual e-mail.

84
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.170
OK.

85
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.140
That's the very basics of forms.

86
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.840
Remember you have a form tag and an input tag and the type in the impotent dictates what's actually

87
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.390
rendered in the browser and certain types will have restrictions such as not being visible for password

88
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.070
checking if it's an email.

89
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.220
And then we finally have a submit type which will allow us to supply the information.

90
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.400
We still haven't learned yet what actually happens when you click submit and connect it either to another

91
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.280
page or to a server.

92
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.610
Lastly I'll show you one last type of input really just for fun and that's the color input which is

93
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.460
fun to use.

94
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.760
So if you say type and put color hit save and then refresh the page you get to see this little cool

95
00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.280
button.

96
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.800
And if you click on it and then you get to pick a color.

97
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.190
So for example I can pick green I can change that shade of green pick teal it OK and then I'll see that

98
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.700
color being updated.

99
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.980
That's just the fun little impot type we probably won't use it really that often during the course but

100
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.670
I just wanted to show it to you.

101
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.180
OK.

102
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.690
That's the basics of the actual foreign tags.

103
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.280
Coming up next one of the scuzz had actually some form and had a redirect to another page.

104
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.910
We'll see if there.
