00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,870
Welcome everyone to some level 2 section of the course in some level.

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,350
We're going to discuss some more advanced topics such as scope object oriented programming.

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,150
We'll have a quick project to test your O.P. skills.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,820
Then we'll talk about decorator's.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,840
We'll talk about this name equals mainlined that shows up in a lot of Pi scripts and then we'll talk

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,980
about how to create your own modules.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,130
I'm going to assume that actually a lot of people are probably have some sort of experience with Python

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,800
and maybe just jump directly to Python level too.

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,240
I just want to make clear that if you're jumping straight into Python level two you should already have

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,700
an understanding of how functions and basic data types and data structures work with Python.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,770
So if you don't feel comfortable functions quite yet maybe go back and review Python level one.

12
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,430
OK but that being said let's get started and start learning about these advanced topics.
