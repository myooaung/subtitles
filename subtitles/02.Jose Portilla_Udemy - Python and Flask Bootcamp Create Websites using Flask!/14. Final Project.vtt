00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.500
Welcome back everyone in this lecture we're going to finish some functionality for our overall project.

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.010
A couple of things we need to clear up are the actual index page.

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.870
So we want to show all the existing blog posts on the index page in order and the other thing we want

4
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.020
to set up is the navigation bar.

5
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.930
There's probably still a few links to the blog post views that we haven't set up yet.

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.950
So let's go and do the finishing touches and then we'll also be running our website to see and make

7
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.720
sure everything works OK.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.290
Here we are.

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.530
Let's begin by making sure our baseline reached him file is showing the links for everything in the

10
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.570
navigation bar.

11
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.070
Because if you recall we didn't create a create Post link in the ref because we hadn't actually created

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.980
those views.

13
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:55.290
So all we're going to do here is just say your L for and then say blog posts create underscore posts

14
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.020
and then save those changes.

15
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.470
So that's actually all we need to do at the base that each team will in the in it up PI file for the

16
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.570
entire project.

17
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.150
We're going to make sure that we've have everything registered and by now you should have registered

18
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.820
core users blog posts and error pages.

19
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.110
So that's looking good.

20
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.480
So now we're going to do is for that core index for each team L..

21
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.050
Right now it just says Papy company blog.

22
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.850
What we're going to do is add two main components to it.

23
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.580
One is showing all the blog posts and we're going to be using a card component from Bootstrap to view

24
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.840
it and then also add some page capabilities.

25
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.760
So just in case there's like a thousand blog posts we don't see everything on one page so we'll begin

26
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.040
by actually creating cards to show all the blog posts or at least part of the blog posts and what I

27
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.970
mean by cards is if you come over to the bootstrap documentation and then click on components.

28
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.030
Eventually you'll see this card object and that's where we're going to be using to display the little

29
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.350
bits of the blog post.

30
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.510
So you can see here cart objects can take a picture they can take a title some quick text and then a

31
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.080
button.

32
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.090
So what we're going to do is we're just going to use this title for the title The blog post maybe have

33
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.950
a little bit of information maybe the first 100 characters of the blog post itself and then have this

34
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.820
button actually go to that individual blog post.

35
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.070
So we're going to be using a lot of these classes such as the card cards body and card title.

36
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.170
So all of those classic calls they come again from the bootstrap documentation.

37
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.840
Keep in mind you definitely don't have to use bootstrap cards.

38
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.930
You can really present these blog posts however you decide what we're going to be showing you.

39
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.730
KURTZ Just to add in a little more flair to this Cygnet delete that or as close that window and we have

40
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.090
a puppy company blog.

41
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.010
Now let's go ahead and the capabilities to show all the blog posts to do that.

42
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.780
I'm going to create a container class and then I'm going to create a for loop that actually goes through

43
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.220
the blog post so I'll save for post in blog post items.

44
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.420
So we should make sure that we're actually passing in this blog post in our core index view.

45
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.830
So let's go back to our views that file for core.

46
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.850
So here's the core.

47
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.550
And then here's views that pi.

48
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.760
Remember that right now the index page it just says in X-Trace Tim L..

49
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.980
And I mentioned to the very beginning that there was more to come here.

50
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.940
What I'm going to want to do is query for all the blog posts so I can display them on the actual page

51
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.910
and also set up the page marker.

52
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.680
So I'll do the following here and then to set two variables on that page equal to request Arkes that

53
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:37.420
gets page 1 and then the type is going to be integer.

54
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.490
And we'll be using it.

55
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.590
And the very next one where we say blog posts is equal to blog post.

56
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.660
And notice I haven't actually imported that yet.

57
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.820
So going to come back up here and say from Papy company blog.

58
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.160
Top models in your blog post.

59
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.750
So now I'll be able to use it and I'm going to just query and if I just say Doc query that's basically

60
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:10.400
gonna grab everything or say order by the blog post date in descending order so we see the most recent

61
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:19.760
blogs first and then we'll just call page 8 and say page is equal to page and then we can say per page

62
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.800
and maybe you can decide that you want 10 blog posts per page or five blog posts per page or two really

63
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.430
whatever you wanted.

64
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.780
The site is up to you.

65
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.130
So I say that.

66
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:37.490
So now if you take a look at index sites Sammael going to passen blog posts as blog posts.

67
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.110
So that's going to give me access to that in our actual template file.

68
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.070
So we'll come back to index each T.M. and that's how I'm not going to be able to use this blog post

69
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.040
the items and let's double check to make sure variable names match.

70
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.880
So if I come back to the index views Here's views not core.

71
00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.130
I said Block close plural so on my index page I want to make sure it says block posts plural as well.

72
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.050
All right so those are the items and then I can begin creating those cards for them.

73
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:15.140
So for every single post I'm going to create a new division in the class here will be card.

74
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.560
And then inside of this we'll have card body.

75
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.110
So why bother having a picture here and then we'll do the following.

76
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:30.190
I'll say H-2 and that's going to be wups that's going to be an anchor Ted and that's tag it's just going

77
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.510
to be essentially a link to the actual blog post.

78
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:44.480
So we'll do the following inside of this anchor Ted I'll say the class is card dash title again just

79
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.920
getting that from the bootstrap documentation.

80
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.950
And then the text here being shown will be post-cart title.

81
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.100
So remember a post that's coming from here for post in this little blog post.

82
00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.880
So grab that title and then they can click on the title and that will link to the blog post itself.

83
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.170
Which means I'll say your URL for and make sure I get this right.

84
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.870
I should be double curly braces.

85
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:20.390
You are for than I will say blog posts blog underscore post and then pass on that particular blog post

86
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.170
ID.

87
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.090
So we've actually already seen this before in previous lectures.

88
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.240
OK so that allows someone to click on that post title and then anchor tag reference to that actual individual

89
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.250
view for that single blog post.

90
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.960
So let's see H-2 that link is set up.

91
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.280
Let's go ahead and create another anchor tag here just for the written by.

92
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:53.450
So an essay written by and then whoever that posts author is so say Post the author dot username and

93
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.590
let's say if they want to click on that then that will take them to that user names page.

94
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:09.510
So the Tref here that's going to be your L4 will go to the users the user posts and then I say the user

95
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:15.530
name is equal to post the author dot username.

96
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.670
OK so what that means is the card title is basically going to link them to the blog post and then right

97
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.600
below that there's a link to the author in case you want to see the author page.

98
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.070
So it's up to you if you want to put these in size H-2A are the main things that they should be anchor

99
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.410
text after that.

100
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.750
Let's go ahead and add a publication to this.

101
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.900
So right below that I'm going to say create a paragraph that says published on and then we'll say grab

102
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.650
that post-date and let's structure the time a bit.

103
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.380
Really it's up to you how you want to structure it.

104
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.630
We'll just say year dash month dash that day it was published.

105
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.230
So there's that.

106
00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:02.690
It was published on and then right below that who create one last Achor tag and the Saker tag is just

107
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.020
going to say read a blog post.

108
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.850
Make sure we said that right.

109
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.300
Read blog post.

110
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.830
So that's what the actual button says on that.

111
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:22.100
And then to make sure that looks like a button an asset class equal to between 10 primary and add a

112
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.970
lot of the structure is just grabbing it from the bootstrap documentation for cards.

113
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:30.580
And so when someone clicks on that read blog post button or when actually goes that particular block

114
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.110
post.

115
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.430
So they'll actually be the same thing as the title here.

116
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:39.800
So it's up to you if you want to make the title or up will go and make both the title link and the button

117
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.360
a link.

118
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.630
It kind of just how it performs that action.

119
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:49.670
So there's a card body I'm going to save that and that will list out all our cards for the post.

120
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.130
Lasser do is set up the page anation itself.

121
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:58.700
So this is actually going to be pretty much exactly what we did for the last time it works at page nation

122
00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.040
on a user page.

123
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:06.380
So if I come back to my HMO for user blog posts remember we had if we scroll all the way down to the

124
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.760
bottom this page navigation example we're pretty much going to do the exact same thing here.

125
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.930
So I'm going to copy this and then do a couple of changes.

126
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.660
So again copying this from user underscore blog underscore post-dates the email then go back to the

127
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:28.710
index page right before that and block and then set up that navigation and then we're going to just

128
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:34.450
basically edit the actual links so this stays the same the sky stays the same.

129
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.080
This blog post left right.

130
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.270
That also stays the same.

131
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.880
If that is the same idea then that's disabled as well.

132
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.170
We're going to hear set of linking for user posts.

133
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.970
We're going to do is just link to core index.

134
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:53.280
So this will be core the index where the page numbers are equal to the page number.

135
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.370
So just keep that itself and then the sky is actually going to be the same thing.

136
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:06.340
So delete that username reference and then passen core indexes that there we go.

137
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:10.920
And basically all the same logic we previously discussed still holds true for this.

138
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.690
We just wanted to link to the core index page instead of the user page.

139
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:20.900
So save that and that should be the main things we had to fix to get some full functionality.

140
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.360
Let's actually begin running this and see if we need to add anything else to our Web site.

141
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:31.420
So I'm going to say Python app that PI run that lets make sure we didn't get any bugs or typos or errors.

142
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.430
Looks like an invalid syntax somewhere.

143
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.800
So it says LLF request that method is equal to get.

144
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.970
So under blog post views that pi.

145
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.140
So let's go back to that.

146
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.630
Use that PI file on their blog posts and it looks like it's in line 62.

147
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.980
So right here it says LLF request that method that should be a double equal size.

148
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.390
So I will save that.

149
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:58.250
Let's try running this again looks like in line 43 We also have a simple bug so we're going to come

150
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:03.290
back up to line 43 and it says function object has no attribute route.

151
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.640
So blog post has no attribute.

152
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.080
And that should be pleural blog posts.

153
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.900
So let's say that run this.

154
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.090
And looks like I do the same thing at a later line.

155
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.820
Actually right in the singles there.

156
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:23.020
So I'll say that slide 7 the blog post that Roe save that as well.

157
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.430
Make sure that do that multiple times and this one looks like I'm forgetting a little closing carat.

158
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.100
So let's fix that as well.

159
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:36.110
We'll come down to the blog post writing for the blog post of you will go up for that.

160
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.330
So right here blog post update.

161
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.590
That should be a closing bracket here.

162
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.360
And let's make sure we have a closing bracket there as well.

163
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.490
So that looks good.

164
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:46.730
Save that.

165
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.440
Let's run this.

166
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.020
And we had the same thing for delete.

167
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.930
Like we kind of were copy and pasting a couple of bugs here so close that as well.

168
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.140
Run this and now looks like we're running ok.

169
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.830
Hopefully those bugs weren't too difficult for you to debug on your way but let's make sure that everything

170
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:07.610
is running.

171
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:14.020
So I bring in this right here and right now I have no blogs so let's log out.

172
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.760
Let's register a new account.

173
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:26.840
So I'm going to register this new account as seven seven that com user name will be seven password will

174
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.640
be seven confirmed passwords seven registry that user.

175
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.770
And now let's put them in.

176
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.460
So 7 8 7 7.

177
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.380
Log in.

178
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.590
Let's create a posts.

179
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:40.400
Make sure that works.

180
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.640
If we don't get a bug there.

181
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:48.480
OK we'll say 7 new title and then some.

182
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.290
Example text or hit post.

183
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.130
And now it took me back to the home page and I actually see this card.

184
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.120
So I see this card 72 title.

185
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:04.060
If I click on that it takes me to the actual post and because I'm the same author as it I can update

186
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.200
it or delete it.

187
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.760
So let's try updating it.

188
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:14.010
So I'm going to say new title to some examples text to click post and no new title to that example text

189
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:14.230
2.

190
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.800
So if I come back home I see those changes as well.

191
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.620
So now let's see if I can actually delete that blog post.

192
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:24.040
So click delete and now notice the model or the model is popping up.

193
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.660
So I will click Cancel.

194
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.330
Make sure nothing happens so that looks good.

195
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.270
So now it's actually tried the link and see if this view worked.

196
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:35.350
So hit delete and that takes us back home and I no longer see that blog.

197
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.800
So let's create another post so we'll create another one.

198
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.720
Let's go.

199
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:48.370
New material title and then brand new text and I will post that to the blog.

200
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.570
Let's go ahead and create another one just to make sure I can create multiple ones without any errors

201
00:13:53.020 --> 00:14:01.030
so I'll say in other title and some more text post that as well.

202
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:06.880
And I see another title by written by 7 new material title written by seven so that's all working.

203
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.320
Let's make sure that it works.

204
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.240
If I linked to myself so it's written by 7.

205
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.130
Let's click on that and it looks like I have a bug Blug it says blog post is undefined.

206
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:22.930
So let's go ahead and quickly debug this says right here under views that PI under users like 93.

207
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:30.820
This blog post is undefined so let's go to that line under the users view when we come back here.

208
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.020
Open this up.

209
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:38.810
I have my users down here open up their views and remember it said if we come back here to the air on

210
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.830
online 93 I had some sort of bug so no worries we can handle bugs.

211
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:50.500
We'll scroll down here and then on line 93 it's a blog post was undefine.

212
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.130
So he said blog underscore post that looks like it's working correctly.

213
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.010
So then it's probably an issue with the actual template.

214
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.790
So let's bring back our error.

215
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:05.090
So it's set in line 93 you're passing and blog posts plural and if he keeps scrolling down here eventually

216
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:12.080
you'll see that in the user blog post the h t m l I'm saying four posts in singular blog posts the items

217
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.770
when I'm passing it in as a plural variable.

218
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.070
Blog posts.

219
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.290
So that's easy enough to fix.

220
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.910
All need to do is fix that view inside of that template file.

221
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.830
The user blog postdates T.M. so hopefully can see what the problem was here in passing it in within

222
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.370
us.

223
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.970
But if we take a look at the user blog post HTL file.

224
00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.410
So was this user blog post.

225
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.180
H Tim L.

226
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.180
I said four posts in blog post singular.

227
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.540
So just add an s there save that change and then that should fix it.

228
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.570
So let's refresh this 7.

229
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.850
Looks like a quite haven't fixed that yet.

230
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.750
It said could not build it for user that user post with values username.

231
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.830
Did you mean users user underscore posts instead.

232
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.940
I probably did.

233
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.680
It's another issue of S or no s.

234
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.660
So this can be kind of tricky sometimes.

235
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.530
So I'll say user blog post.

236
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.740
Line 14.

237
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.090
Let's go ahead and fix that real quick.

238
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.300
So here's my user blog post.

239
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:08.430
Line 14.

240
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.360
User Daut user.

241
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.210
Underscore posts.

242
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.880
I'm going to save that change come back here refreshed and now it's working.

243
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.880
So welcome to the page for 7.

244
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.800
OK so we have another title written by 7 new material title.

245
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.980
I can click on any of these I can update them and delete.

246
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.340
Let's make sure everything's working.

247
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:36.990
I'm going to log out and I'm going to register one more user so let's register 8 at 8 dot com users

248
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:43.750
8 passwords a confirmed passwords 8 will register them.

249
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.400
Let's go ahead and log them in.

250
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.690
So Ada 8.

251
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:54.340
Their password is a they can log in and if I click on this blog post to read it I get to read it.

252
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.280
But look I cannot update or delete it because it's not actually my blog post.

253
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.760
That's the blog post belonging to number 7.

254
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.700
So looks like everything's working and you now have a very basic company blogsite.

255
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.190
We learned a ton in this project and we were able to debug a couple of issues.

256
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.200
A lot of them had do a small typos so if you're getting those typos as well.

257
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:19.340
Remember you can always reference our notes and files and everything is finalized for you in that final

258
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.780
project folder.

259
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.800
OK I hope you find that useful and I hope you can see how you can bring.

260
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.420
Pretty much everything you've already talked about in the class together to get something that's highly

261
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.100
functional website for you to show off to your friends or colleagues.

262
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.320
If you have any questions on any parts of this please feel free to post the Kewney forums and we'll

263
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.560
be happy to help you out.

Thanks and we'll see at the next lecture.
