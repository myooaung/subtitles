00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,690
Welcome back everyone in this section of the course.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,260
We're finally going to embark on a larger project that incorporates a lot of what you already learn

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,350
in the previous sections of the course.

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,180
So we're combining all the skills into a singular project.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,810
We're going to be creating is a company blog page where multiple users can each log in with their own

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,950
user credentials.

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:30,800
They can create their own blog posts up they or delete their existing blog posts as well.

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,570
Plus we're also introducing some new concepts such as how to handle image files so every user is going

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,140
to have their own profile image.

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,060
Also show you how to add pages.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,800
So for example if you ever go to a Web site where you can cycle through pages of many blog posts.

12
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,950
So in this case if we have more than five blog posts we'll go ahead and just shift those over to another

13
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,500
page.

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,780
We'll show you how to do that.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,130
And we're also going to show you how to use modals which is basically a way that bootstrap allows you

16
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,420
to create pop ups.

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,280
So know step by step in this code along project so all of this code along that we can follow through

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,860
with us and see how to structure a larger project that will have multiple users on it.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,180
So let's take a look at what the finished product is actually going to look like.

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,100
That way we can understand or building it head over to the browser now.

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:14,720
All right.

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,780
So this is the final product that we're actually going to be creating.

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,930
Looks wise we're not going to focus too much on the actual styling.

24
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,350
So overall it's not the most attractive web site.

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,190
Really what we want to focus on is the functionality so we can think of this as some sort of company

26
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,400
blog where multiple employees of the company are going to be able to create their own blog posts.

27
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:38,560
So notice here we have a home and about us page some log in page and a registration page.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,920
So where you're going to be able to do once you complete this Web site it's going to be able to click

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,600
on register.

30
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,240
Here we have a registration form.

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,670
Again not the most beautiful looking registration form but here are just really focused on being able

32
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,570
to add the functionality with flask.

33
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:59,570
So let's go ahead and register and your user will say brand new at new dot com the username will also

34
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:06,570
have that be brand new password are you going to keep it simple keep it as brand new.

35
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,180
Same here.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,990
So brand new We'll go ahead and click register then that takes us directly to the logon page.

37
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,570
We have an email and password.

38
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,870
Again very simple aesthetics wise.

39
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:25,590
So the email was brand new and you dot com and the password was brand new We'll click log in and now

40
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,380
we're logged then we still see the same home page but notice here now I can create a post so if I click

41
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,240
on Create a post I get a title for my post such as brand new title.

42
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,750
And then I have text so brand new text and I can just you know fill in whatever text I want here.

43
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,020
And then when I click on blog post essentially posting this.

44
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,430
Now I can see on the main company blog page as well as these other blog posts.

45
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,490
I have this brand new title written by brand new published on this etc..

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,800
Now if I read a blog post since this is my own blog post since I'm right now logged in as a brand new

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,990
user I can click update and then add some new stuff to it.

48
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,250
Maybe change the title.

49
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,170
Post this again.

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,230
Or I can also delete it and so happens when I click on delete.

51
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,770
I get this nice little pop up so I'll be showing you how to use bootstrap to create these pop ups as

52
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,260
well.

53
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,610
Cancel that deleting and if I go back to my home page right now if I take a look at other blog posts

54
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,560
written by someone else that I don't have the update and delete functionality.

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,550
So we're going to be able to smartly say OK only if you're viewing a blog that you created.

56
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,890
You can update it or delete it.

57
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,270
You can edit other peoples blogs as you would expect.

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,220
Now we can also check out the About Us page which is just info about the company.

59
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,180
And notice also how my own account page.

60
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,980
So if I click on my account I say welcome to the page for brand new.

61
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,870
I see this little profile image and I can update my username.

62
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,330
Update my email and I can also update my profile picture so I'll be showing you how to choose files

63
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,150
by uploading things and then updating it.

64
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,220
We have the default image but if you take a look at other users if we come back to home take a look

65
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,520
at written by 6.

66
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,850
This is the page for 6 against same profile image.

67
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,280
Since that's the default image but if we take a look at some other ones we've uploaded some other profile

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,940
images.

69
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,370
So if I take account pages I can then read other blog posts by the author.

70
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,390
So this offer just happens to be named 3.

71
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,690
We click on this and then we see the blog post.

72
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,390
OK and then we can always log out and come back to the company blog page.

73
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:28,790
All right.

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,730
I'm really excited to get started with this project.

75
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,660
It combines pretty much all the skills we've covered so far.

76
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,120
Whether it's authorization different views templates and a lot more we're also going to cover things

77
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,770
like those bootstrap methods that we haven't seen before and we're having to cover things like how to

78
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,930
make your own 404 pages.

79
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,600
So if you try to go to a page that doesn't exist we'll see how to customize our own for 4 pages to show

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,030
whatever we want to show.

81
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,620
OK let's go ahead and get started.

82
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,760
The first thing to do is just get an overview.

83
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,420
However setting up art projects will see you at the next lecture.
