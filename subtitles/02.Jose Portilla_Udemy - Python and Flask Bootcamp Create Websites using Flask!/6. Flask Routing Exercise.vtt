00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.500
All right let's finish off this section with an exercise and this exercise we're going to call the writing

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.300
exercise.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.630
We're going to test you on everything we've covered so far and you're going to be creating a simple

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.940
web page that converts puppy names into puppy Latin which is just a made up language similar to Pig

5
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.840
Latin.

6
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.310
Here are the rules for puppy Latin.

7
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.050
And then we'll go in more detail over what the exercise actually entails.

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.900
So puppy London.

9
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.050
It's quite simple.

10
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.100
If a puppy named does not end in a Y then what you do is you just add a y onto the name.

11
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.880
So for instance if the puppy's name is rufous it becomes Rufus E for Y at the end if their name is Spot

12
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.950
it becomes Spadina for Y at the end.

13
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.490
So the puppy name originally does not end in a Y.

14
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.110
Then you just tack on a y to the very end.

15
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.750
However if a puppy named already does and then a Y then you take off that y and replace it with I f

16
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.940
u l so that something like sparkie becomes spark a full or a name like somebody become spot awful.

17
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.440
OK.

18
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.240
Those are the only two rules for puppie Latin and it's just based off whether the name does or does

19
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.570
not.

20
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.130
And then why.

21
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.870
Now your web application is going to have a specific row and the red is going to be puppie underscore

22
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.700
Latin forward slash and then you can insert any name you want there.

23
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.150
And what this is going to do it's going to take in the name that you pass into the your aisle and then

24
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.060
display the puppy Litan version on the page.

25
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.590
And if you want a little bit of hints on how you actually do this you can review are they namak route

26
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.920
video lecture for a similar example where we pasan a name and then showed it in full upper case you're

27
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.190
going be doing a very similar thing except your function is going to be a little more complex because

28
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.020
it's actually going to convert the name that you pass into the OR L into puppy liten based off these

29
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.350
rules that we just showed.

30
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.120
Now we've created sculpting code for you to code into.

31
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.960
It's called the routeing exercise.

32
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.290
Alternatively what you can do is you can skip to the solutions video lecture if you want to treat this

33
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.550
as a code long project.

34
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.910
Instead let's quickly view with the final Web site's going to look like.

35
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.650
And then we'll set you loose on the exercise.

36
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.970
Or you can skip forward to the next video and treat it as a code along with the solutions.

37
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.040
Let's head over to our browser and see what the finished product looks like.

38
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.380
OK this is what the home page looks like and it basically just says Welcome go to puppie underscore

39
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.070
Latin slash name to see your name and puppy Colyton.

40
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.490
So let's do that now we're going to say slash puppy underscore Latin slash and let's start with Rufus.

41
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.060
So Islands pass and Rufus says Hi Rufus your puppy Latin name is Rufus E..

42
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.790
So notice Rufus and the Hawaiian.

43
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.490
So we added a y onto it.

44
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.290
Now it's put in a name like spotty.

45
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.020
So we're going to say spotty.

46
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.280
Put that in it says hi Spadea your puppy Latin name is spotty full.

47
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.980
So again it's already ends for y we remove that Y and then tack on I f u l so you don't have to be using

48
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.540
indexing with your strings.

49
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.110
And then a good way to add onto a string is just a concatenation with that plus sign.

50
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.670
OK.

51
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.880
Best of luck on this project.

52
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.630
If you get stuck.

53
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.370
Go ahead and check out the solutions lecture which is up next.

54
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.960
We'll see there.
