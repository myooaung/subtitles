00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Now in this section, we're gonna get really down and dirty with

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.495
Groovy and look at them as Stendhal language features that it gives us.

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:09.750
As always, the theme in Groovy is about giving us the freedom as

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.320
developers to write less code through its compact syntax.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.110
But with this comes responsibility too, as we'll see.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.820
As long as you're careful though,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.370
and adopt some simple conventions in your Groovy coding,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.655
you can take advantage of it all without falling into traps.

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:27.520
So let's take a look now at the language features of Groovy.
