Groovy has some really useful and cool operators which are

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.005
unique to the language and help you get things done with less coding ceremony.

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.180
In this section, then we're going to explore

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.400
the most important operators in Groovy and

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.680
get you used to what they do and how they work.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.630
This is going to give you a nice easy running to

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.705
just how much nicer ribbon mics development for you, the developer.

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:20.055

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:21.940
