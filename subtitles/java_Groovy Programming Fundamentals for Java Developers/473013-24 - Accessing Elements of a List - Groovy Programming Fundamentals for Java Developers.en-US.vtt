00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
So that's great. We've now seen how we can create collections,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.515
the standard collection, so thats lists, sets, and maps.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:09.960
We've seen how we can instantiate those by one go using

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.525
this literal syntax is collection literal syntax.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:16.035
So let's just see how we can pull elements back out from those collections as well.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:21.240
So for example, a, B, C,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.925
For example, if I want to get the first element, I could do that.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:31.980
It gives me a, that's the equivalent of just invoking the get method on the list itself.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.050
But Ruby also allows you to access

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.890
list elements as if it's an array within an array of type syntax like this.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.150
So you can see we get the same effect.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.035
You could also pull ranges as well.

00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:44.660
So for example, if I had some more elements in here,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.895
so E and F.

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:48.710
And if I wanted to get, say,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.525
the second element, the fourth element,

00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:53.090
I could go one dot dot three,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.860
because it's 0 indexed.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.895
One will be the second element and three will be the fourth element.

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:00.665
And now if I get this,

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:04.070
you can see here we're pulling back effectively a sublist.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.465
And if we look at the type of this which we can invoke directly on the result as well.

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:10.565
So we can just do getClass here.

00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:13.805
Again, you see it just comes back as a standard ArrayList,

00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:16.070
but it's a nice extra feature. They can pull back ranges.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.590
But the main set, of course, is the fact that you can just access

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.260
elements directly in a very easy and straightforward way.
