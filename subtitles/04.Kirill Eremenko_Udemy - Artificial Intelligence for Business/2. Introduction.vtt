00:00.480 --> 00:02.650
Hello and welcome to the course.

00:02.760 --> 00:05.640
Artificial intelligence for business.

00:05.640 --> 00:08.820
I know a lot of you have been waiting for it for a long time.

00:08.820 --> 00:15.030
We've been doing some artificial intelligence courses but that were not applied to business problems.

00:15.030 --> 00:18.510
Well here that's exactly what you'll get with this new course.

00:18.510 --> 00:23.640
We will build some AI's to solve real world business problems.

00:23.640 --> 00:29.610
So that means that this is the ultimate course to help you in your work whether you are working in a

00:29.610 --> 00:34.590
company and trying to leverage the power of artificial intelligence for the business.

00:34.710 --> 00:39.630
Or if you are of course building your own business yourself.

00:39.630 --> 00:42.930
So definitely this course will be highly valuable for you.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.870
So make sure to smash it.

00:45.080 --> 00:45.440
OK.

00:45.450 --> 00:52.050
So in this first introductory video we're going to see what this course will be about and mostly I'll

00:52.050 --> 00:58.040
show you the structure of the scores because you need to understand the structure of the journey you're

00:58.050 --> 00:59.200
going to take in this course.

00:59.420 --> 01:06.840
But before I show you the preview of the journey let me be very clear on the three main applications

01:06.840 --> 01:13.680
of artificial intelligence for any business which are first optimize business processes.

01:13.920 --> 01:19.270
Second minimize cost and third maximize revenues.

01:19.350 --> 01:26.070
You have to understand and keep in mind that these three applications are the main applications of artificial

01:26.280 --> 01:28.170
intelligence for any business.

01:28.170 --> 01:34.560
Meaning that if you want to start an AI company you know building AI solutions for companies for other

01:34.560 --> 01:37.120
businesses in several industries.

01:37.290 --> 01:42.690
Well these obligations are just three main things you're going to do for them either optimize business

01:42.690 --> 01:48.630
processes which means you know optimize the flows the steps in the process happening in the business

01:49.020 --> 01:54.330
or what you can do for other companies is to minimize costs meaning you're going to extract all the

01:54.330 --> 02:01.620
data to create an environment in which you're going to build an AI and this AI will perform some actions

02:01.830 --> 02:05.090
which in the end will minimize the cost of the business.

02:05.220 --> 02:10.920
And I will show you exactly an example of this in one of our cases and then what you can also do is

02:10.920 --> 02:17.190
maximize revenues meaning same you extract all the data of the company with which you create an environment

02:17.490 --> 02:23.320
inside which you build an AI to perform some actions which will maximize the revenues in the end.

02:23.340 --> 02:26.680
And again I'll show you exactly how to do this were the case then.

02:26.970 --> 02:33.300
So let's recap the three main applications of artificial intelligence for any business or one optimized

02:33.300 --> 02:38.140
business process to minimize cost three maximize revenues.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.070
Remember this.

02:39.210 --> 02:46.140
And now for the rest of the Course I'll show you exactly how to succeed in each of these applications

02:46.440 --> 02:54.150
through real world business cases and for each of these applications we will build a separate AI to

02:54.150 --> 02:58.870
solve the challenge meaning that we'll have a different age for each of these applications.

02:59.160 --> 02:59.510
All right.

02:59.520 --> 03:03.480
And speaking of them in speaking of the real world business case studies.

03:03.660 --> 03:07.050
Well let's see what they're going to be in this course.

03:07.080 --> 03:14.670
So this course is structured in three parts the three parts correspond to each of these three applications

03:14.820 --> 03:21.090
in the same order and for each part we'll get this real world business case study which will solve with

03:21.090 --> 03:23.200
a different solution.

03:23.220 --> 03:29.400
So let's see what these cases are and for each of them let's see what a solution we're going to build.

03:29.400 --> 03:36.720
So in part one optimizing processes the case that he will be about optimizing the flows in an e-commerce

03:36.780 --> 03:37.870
warehouse.

03:37.950 --> 03:44.610
So the flows in a warehouse are most of the processes in the company that holds the warehouse.

03:44.610 --> 03:50.990
So that's a real world business case study of how we can leverage aiight optimize processes and the

03:51.000 --> 03:56.780
AI's solution will build to solve this challenge is going to be huge learning.

03:56.880 --> 04:01.320
This is the most simple yet very effective AI model.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.730
And that's why I wanted to start with this one on this case study.

04:04.920 --> 04:05.570
All right.

04:05.610 --> 04:13.470
Next second part minimizing costs in energy consumption of a data center and the AI solution will build

04:13.470 --> 04:20.220
for this will be a deep learning model which is a more advanced AI model than the previous one.

04:20.220 --> 04:27.240
Q learning moral because indeed in the deep jewellery model we're going to combine jewelry and neural

04:27.240 --> 04:31.790
networks or in other words we're going to combine deep learning and keep learning.

04:31.950 --> 04:39.240
So this makes a hybrid artificial intelligence that is well known in the AI ecosystem and we absolutely

04:39.240 --> 04:42.320
need to know how it works and how to implement it.

04:42.450 --> 04:50.040
OK so of course for each of the case studies and Morell's will implement will provide not only the intuition

04:50.190 --> 04:55.950
but also the theory with Aldermaston explaining details and also of course you'll get the most important

04:55.950 --> 04:59.760
of all the code templates for each of the applications.

04:59.970 --> 05:06.660
We'll give you the code template so that you can easily adapt it to your own business problem or any

05:06.660 --> 05:10.820
problem you're trying to solve at work with an AI and more than that.

05:10.830 --> 05:17.970
Even better than that will provide a general AI framework which is a blueprint containing the steps

05:18.150 --> 05:23.560
of the process you have to follow when building any eye to solve business problems.

05:23.700 --> 05:30.690
So we'll provide the general a blueprint for learning because in your career or while running your business

05:30.900 --> 05:34.460
most of the business problems will solve will be with deep Guler.

05:34.470 --> 05:40.680
So we really wanted to provide that a framework or blueprint so that you can adapt it to your own work

05:40.680 --> 05:41.780
and business problems.

05:41.820 --> 05:42.910
The easiest way.

05:43.140 --> 05:43.590
Okay.

05:43.610 --> 05:49.980
And now for the last part for which the application is maximizing revenues Well the case study will

05:49.980 --> 05:56.340
be about maximizing revenue of an online retail business and this one will be quite exciting because

05:56.340 --> 06:03.090
will actually help a business earn more than one billion dollars in revenue and the a solution that

06:03.090 --> 06:10.560
will solve this challenge this huge challenge will be the unbeatable algorithm and the online reinforcement

06:10.560 --> 06:16.530
learning branch which is Tompson Semlin Thompson something you absolutely have to know about this one

06:16.770 --> 06:22.650
and know how to implement it because you can use it in a lot more business cases than you think and

06:22.800 --> 06:24.290
when to know how to use it.

06:24.330 --> 06:27.480
It can be tremendously powerful for the business.

06:27.480 --> 06:32.910
So you have to know about Tompson something this is the most powerful algorithm in what we call the

06:33.000 --> 06:39.360
online learning branch of artificial intelligence and we will of course provide all the theory intuition

06:39.570 --> 06:43.800
math details and code templates for this AI solution.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.210
All right.

06:44.220 --> 06:49.280
And then remember thats not all there is something much bigger in this course.

06:49.290 --> 06:54.410
Remember we've prepared a huge innovation for you highly valuable for your career.

06:54.420 --> 07:00.210
I'm talking of course about the book the artificial intelligence for business book.

07:00.210 --> 07:08.100
This is the very first time we provide a book in a course and this book covers everything about artificial

07:08.100 --> 07:09.550
intelligence for business.

07:09.780 --> 07:17.080
It contains 100 pages of crystal clear explanations written and beautiful and clean tech.

07:17.160 --> 07:23.850
You will see what I'm talking about then all the AI intuition and theory including all the math explains

07:23.910 --> 07:28.070
in detail the three case studies of the course and their solutions.

07:28.470 --> 07:33.600
Three different models including in deep kerning and unbeatable.

07:33.600 --> 07:40.470
Thompson something it contains to contemplate and better than that the general AI blueprint that will

07:40.470 --> 07:47.940
be provided in part two and plus it contains lots of extra tips and tricks like you know early step

07:47.950 --> 07:51.940
in saving and loading models Chihuly models and much much more.

07:52.110 --> 07:54.360
So basically everything is in the book.

07:54.360 --> 07:59.960
This is not like a compliment for the course because everything that is in the course is in the book.

08:00.150 --> 08:03.600
Well maybe when I explain the code I provide more details when I speak.

08:03.780 --> 08:07.300
Because of course we'll be coding together and I will provide all the details.

08:07.440 --> 08:13.860
But in terms of you know the case that is description the AI intuition the AI theory the math details

08:14.130 --> 08:16.800
well you will even find more in the book.

08:16.920 --> 08:19.640
So you must absolutely check out this book.

08:19.740 --> 08:24.990
Always keep it with you not only during the course but also at work in your company.

08:24.990 --> 08:29.820
If you're starting with building your business this book will be super helpful for you.

08:30.150 --> 08:35.340
So let's have a look at it and you will understand what I mean by beautiful and clean tech.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.360
Here it is.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.030
Here is the Table of Contents.

08:38.100 --> 08:41.800
Again following the same structure of course part 1.

08:41.850 --> 08:48.180
Optimizing processes part to minimizing cost and part 3 maximizing revenues.

08:48.180 --> 08:54.150
And of course inside each of these parts you will get the whole case study with the solution and with

08:54.150 --> 08:59.550
the implementation containing the code template and you can see that for each of the case that you will

08:59.550 --> 09:06.300
proceed with the same steps first will define the problem to solve then we'll define the environment

09:06.660 --> 09:13.500
then we're going to study in details the whole AI solution by always providing in the end the whole

09:13.500 --> 09:15.800
algorithm that will do the magic.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.080
And then we proceed to the implementation right.

09:18.150 --> 09:20.340
Same here same for the second case study.

09:20.490 --> 09:21.720
We solved the problem.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.170
We define the environment.

09:23.340 --> 09:29.130
We study the AI solution and we give the implementation and same for the third part and the third case

09:29.180 --> 09:31.350
study we define the problem to solve.

09:31.350 --> 09:32.970
We defined the environment.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.600
We study the solution and we keep the implementation.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.720
And of course you'll get Also the code template.

09:38.840 --> 09:42.000
And of course no worries you can not miss them.

09:42.010 --> 09:44.110
Now let's turn a little bit to pages.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.530
So this is the first part.

09:45.540 --> 09:48.580
Optimizing processes in the first pages of this part.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.940
We described the problem to solve.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.740
We describe the environment to define.

09:53.760 --> 09:59.710
Then again some more description of the environment than we study in detail the whole AI solution.

09:59.980 --> 10:05.820
Start from the beginning with Mark of decision processes for this solution then we explain what Kulemin

10:05.870 --> 10:13.570
is then as you can see all the details are provided even intuition here you see that where I explain

10:13.570 --> 10:15.160
the intuition.

10:15.190 --> 10:21.790
Q learning and then of course in the end I provide the whole learning algorithm and then that's when

10:22.060 --> 10:23.700
you have the whole code.

10:23.770 --> 10:28.330
And of course in this book we explain the whole code code section by code section.

10:28.390 --> 10:31.690
Remember there of course since we code together in the course.

10:31.790 --> 10:36.110
You will get more details because we will code each line of code one by one.

10:36.130 --> 10:41.590
So if there is anything you don't understand here in the explanations Well I'm sure you will understand

10:41.590 --> 10:43.360
what you miss in the course.

10:43.540 --> 10:44.290
So here we go.

10:44.290 --> 10:46.820
That's the whole code and we get the results in the end.

10:46.960 --> 10:52.720
Well you have everything and you even have the homework and solutions of the course right here.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.580
This is actually a homework of course.

10:54.670 --> 10:59.560
We're trying to make a big improvement of our AI after we put it in production.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.190
All right.

11:00.460 --> 11:06.100
And then of course you have all the same four part to minimize and cost with this new case study where

11:06.100 --> 11:09.870
again we define the parameters of the environment.

11:10.030 --> 11:16.060
And here you have a lot of description of the second case study and then defining the environment with

11:16.360 --> 11:22.450
the states the actions the reward we give a final simulation example to make sure everybody understand

11:22.450 --> 11:23.500
what we have to do.

11:23.650 --> 11:27.000
And then of course that's where we study the whole AI solution.

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
You know remember deep learning is actually learning into deep learning that is into a deep neural network

11:34.300 --> 11:36.670
and this is by the way the brain will build.

11:36.820 --> 11:41.880
And the second case study in the second case will build exactly this one to solve.

11:41.980 --> 11:49.300
Well this problem where we have to minimize the cost and energy consumption of a whole data center and

11:49.320 --> 11:52.900
you will see we will get very good results in the end.

11:52.920 --> 11:58.900
All right and then saying we have the whole implementation all described all explained including of

11:58.900 --> 12:06.210
course where I told you about the general AI framework containing all the general steps of the process

12:06.220 --> 12:08.810
when building an AI to solve a business problem.

12:08.950 --> 12:15.220
So I'm not saying that you will be able to apply this general blueprint to all of the business problems

12:15.490 --> 12:22.060
but many of them in fact any of them where you can build an environment with some state actions and

12:22.060 --> 12:22.560
words.

12:22.720 --> 12:28.250
And when you want to build a deep reinforcement learning model like a deep Coonerty model.

12:28.300 --> 12:28.640
All right.

12:28.630 --> 12:31.180
So make sure to print this page.

12:31.180 --> 12:34.660
This is the whole general framework or blueprint.

12:34.660 --> 12:36.950
Make sure you print this page and put it somewhere.

12:36.970 --> 12:38.620
Never too far from you.

12:38.680 --> 12:39.070
All right.

12:39.070 --> 12:42.200
And then part 3 maximizing revenues you have all the same.

12:42.280 --> 12:48.370
The description of the case to the problem to solve and and to define the whole AI solution including

12:48.370 --> 12:52.210
the intuition and the whole implementation.

12:52.210 --> 12:58.090
All right so this book you will be able to download it in the next story will also keep in mind that

12:58.150 --> 13:03.580
I will improve it over time you know by getting some feedbacks I can always do some modifications and

13:03.580 --> 13:04.280
improvements.

13:04.510 --> 13:11.190
So I'll provide some new versions over time so that it can really be for you the best of the resources.

13:11.650 --> 13:14.200
And now that's it for this introduction.

13:14.200 --> 13:18.070
We're going to move on to the first part of this course part one.

13:18.160 --> 13:25.120
Optimizing processes where we will build a cooler or any model to optimize the flows in an e-commerce

13:25.120 --> 13:27.760
warehouse that's going to be the beginning of the journey.

13:27.820 --> 13:29.940
I can't wait to start this venture with you.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.750
And until then enjoy AI.
