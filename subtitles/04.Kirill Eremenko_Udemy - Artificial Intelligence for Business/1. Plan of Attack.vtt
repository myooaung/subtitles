Hello and welcome to the intuition tutorials for the artificial neural networks part of the course.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.870
Super excited to get these things started.

00:08.940 --> 00:11.820
And today we're going to find out how we going to tackle this section.

00:11.820 --> 00:14.620
So in this section we will learn the following things.

00:14.700 --> 00:20.490
First of all we'll talk about the neuron so there'll be a little bit of neuroscience and we'll find

00:20.490 --> 00:26.580
out a bit about how the human brain works and why we are trying to replicate that and we'll also see

00:27.060 --> 00:31.820
what the main building block a neural network of the neuron looks like.

00:32.100 --> 00:37.680
Then in the next tutorial We'll talk about the activation function and we'll look at a couple of examples

00:37.680 --> 00:43.920
of attrition functions that you could use in your neural networks and we'll find out which ones of which

00:43.920 --> 00:52.740
one of them is the most commonly used one in neural networks and in which layers you'd rather use which

00:52.740 --> 00:53.540
functions.

00:53.790 --> 00:56.370
Then we'll talk about how neural networks work.

00:56.370 --> 01:03.960
So in contrast to what you would expect and what it was probably conveyed in other courses and tutorials

01:04.200 --> 01:10.740
we're not going to go into the learning we're actually going to go into the working of the neural networks

01:10.740 --> 01:18.630
first because that's way by seeing neural networks in action that will allow us to understand what we're

01:18.990 --> 01:20.670
aiming towards what our goal is.

01:20.670 --> 01:27.060
So here we'll look at an example of a neural network we're going to look at a very simplified and very

01:27.060 --> 01:33.030
simplified hypothetical example of a neural network working to predict housing prices are basically

01:33.030 --> 01:34.690
real estate prices.

01:34.920 --> 01:40.320
And by looking at that example we'll understand better exactly what we're aiming towards and what we

01:40.320 --> 01:41.780
want to achieve in the end.

01:41.990 --> 01:49.500
And then we will move on to understanding how neural networks learn because that way we'll be more prepared

01:49.500 --> 01:51.020
for what's coming.

01:51.120 --> 01:57.420
Then we'll talk about gradient descent This is also part of neural networks learning and we'll understand

01:57.960 --> 02:05.580
how that algorithm is better than just the brute force method that you might be intending or willing

02:05.580 --> 02:10.080
to take as a first resort a first method that comes to mind.

02:10.080 --> 02:16.650
So we'll find out how great the advantage of and decent are and then we'll talk about stochastic gradient

02:16.650 --> 02:17.120
descent.

02:17.140 --> 02:23.550
It's a it's a continuation of the great and decent tutorial but it's an even better and even stronger

02:23.550 --> 02:26.060
method and we'll find out exactly how it works.

02:26.160 --> 02:33.000
And finally we'll wrap things up by mentioning the important things about back propagation and summarizing

02:33.000 --> 02:40.340
everything in a step by step set of instructions for running your artificial neural networks.

02:40.380 --> 02:46.200
I hope this all sounds very exciting to you because I am very excited myself and I can't wait to get

02:46.200 --> 02:46.750
started.

02:46.890 --> 02:49.280
I look forward to seeing you on the first tutorial.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.550
And until then enjoy deep learning.
