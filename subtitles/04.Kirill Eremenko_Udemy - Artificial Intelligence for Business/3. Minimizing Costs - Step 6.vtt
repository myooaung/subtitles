00:00.300 --> 00:01.650
Are right here we go.

00:01.650 --> 00:07.620
Let's define all the variables and all the parameters of our environment.

00:07.620 --> 00:13.590
And so since these are going to be parameters and variables of our objects environments we have to introduce

00:13.590 --> 00:19.940
them and initialize all of them starting with self because self refers to the object.

00:19.950 --> 00:21.100
All right and let's do this.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.570
We have a lot of them to define.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.660
So let's do this efficiently.

00:24.690 --> 00:29.180
The first one we just have to follow the list given in the book or in the slide.

00:29.250 --> 00:38.550
The first one is the monthly atmospheric temperatures which is going to be the list of all the average

00:38.820 --> 00:43.050
atmospheric temperatures for each of the 12 months in a year.

00:43.050 --> 00:49.110
And so we're going to say that for January this average temperature is going to be 1.0 zero Celsius

00:49.800 --> 01:01.890
then from February 5.0 then from March 7.0 then for April 10.0 then from May 11.0 you can see I'm following

01:01.890 --> 01:06.430
the seasons here then for June twenty point zero.

01:06.450 --> 01:13.860
We are approaching the summer then for July 20 3.0 then for August 24 point zero the hottest month of

01:13.860 --> 01:22.830
the year then twenty two point zero in September 10.0 in October 5.0 in November.

01:23.070 --> 01:29.160
And finally back to the winter 1.0 in December.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.210
All right perfect.

01:30.210 --> 01:33.610
That's why our first and varment object variable.

01:33.660 --> 01:39.370
Now the second one second one is going to be the initial months indeed.

01:39.420 --> 01:45.750
So far the initial month is only an argument and that's because we want to catch the initial month easily

01:45.750 --> 01:48.180
whenever we create a new environment object.

01:48.180 --> 01:52.380
But still we have to introduce the here as the variable of the object.

01:52.440 --> 01:57.990
And of course we will initialize it as the value that will input in this argument.

01:57.990 --> 01:59.760
Initial month.

01:59.790 --> 02:05.030
All right so that's the second one then the next object Vibro is going to be.

02:05.160 --> 02:10.680
Well since now we have the atmospheric temperatures for each of the 12 month and the initial months

02:10.680 --> 02:11.700
when we're starting.

02:11.760 --> 02:12.270
Well of course.

02:12.270 --> 02:19.840
Now what we're going to get is the atmospheric temperature we're starting with that is of the month

02:19.850 --> 02:20.820
we're starting with.

02:21.050 --> 02:22.000
And so to get it.

02:22.010 --> 02:22.810
Well that's easy.

02:22.810 --> 02:29.840
We're going to get our list of atmospheric temperatures inside which we're going to get the index of

02:29.840 --> 02:30.480
the month.

02:30.500 --> 02:38.220
We're starting with which is that index of the initial month perfect then next I.

02:38.360 --> 02:43.410
Now the next one is going to be the optimal temperature range.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.600
And again exactly as before.

02:45.720 --> 02:53.610
We already have that argument but we also need to initialize this as an object variable and we energises

02:53.610 --> 02:58.400
with the value entered in the arguments optimal temperature perfect.

02:58.440 --> 03:01.010
Next one self that.

03:01.140 --> 03:05.640
Now that's when we're going to get all the men temperatures max temperatures mean number of users maximum

03:05.820 --> 03:09.250
users and same for the rates of data.

03:09.270 --> 03:10.180
So let's do this.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.170
Everything is listed in the book.

03:12.240 --> 03:23.910
We start with the minimum temperature which is minus 20 degrees then the maximum temperature which is

03:24.210 --> 03:38.790
80 degrees then the minimum number of users which is 10 users then the maximum number of users which

03:38.790 --> 03:42.990
is one hundred users then the maximum.

03:42.990 --> 03:49.080
Remember we also have this The maximun update of the number of users that can go up or down per minute

03:49.110 --> 03:50.520
inside the server.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.690
And we said that to five.

03:52.830 --> 03:55.120
So these are all the parameters for the number of users.

03:55.140 --> 04:04.860
Now let's take care of the data itself that minimum the minimum rate of data that can be in the server

04:04.870 --> 04:07.070
and that is 20.

04:07.080 --> 04:12.150
So let's say 20 gigabytes or terabytes of data depends on the service capacity.

04:12.150 --> 04:21.470
Then we also have the maximum rate of data which is 300 gigabytes of terabytes.

04:21.480 --> 04:24.270
You know it doesn't really matter as you want.

04:24.270 --> 04:33.030
And then of course again the maximum update of data that is the maximum amount of data that can go up

04:33.030 --> 04:35.070
or down per minute inside the server.

04:35.160 --> 04:38.050
And that is 10 gigabytes then.

04:38.470 --> 04:43.650
Now we're going to take care of you know the initial number of users and the initial rate of data and

04:43.650 --> 04:50.160
these will actually be parameters always equal to the value provided here in the arguments and then

04:50.160 --> 04:56.060
we'll also make two separate variables for the current number of users and the current rate of data.

04:56.190 --> 05:01.130
And these will be the number of users and the rate of data which will be updated over the iterations

05:01.140 --> 05:04.890
that is over the minutes either in the training or the simulation.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.660
And so we're going to initialize four new variables here.

05:07.800 --> 05:15.150
First one that is self that while we can copy this actually because this is going to be the environment

05:15.150 --> 05:22.410
object viable that gives us the initial number of users and we will initialize it actually as the value

05:22.410 --> 05:24.300
of the arguments entered.

05:24.300 --> 05:27.050
When creating an environment object.

05:27.270 --> 05:33.840
Right and then we're going to introduce this separate variable for the correct number of users.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.600
That is the number of users that will be updated over the iterations.

05:37.680 --> 05:42.960
And of course at the beginning since we're starting with the initial number of users Well I'm also going

05:42.960 --> 05:46.610
to initialize it this way with the value of the argument provided.

05:46.830 --> 05:48.940
And now let's do the same for the data.

05:48.990 --> 05:57.150
We introduce a new horrible for the initial rate of data which will be equal to the initial rate of

05:57.150 --> 06:01.400
data provided in the arguments.

06:01.480 --> 06:09.340
That's why I'm pasting that here and same finally another variable for the current rate of data which

06:09.340 --> 06:16.800
will be updated over time and which we also have to initialize as the initial rate of data because indeed

06:16.810 --> 06:21.520
at the beginning the current rate of data is the initial rate of data.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.490
All right so these are for our parameters.

06:23.490 --> 06:29.680
Now we're going into care actually of some of the very important variables because these current rate

06:29.680 --> 06:32.730
data in current number of users are twofers variables.

06:32.920 --> 06:38.410
But then we have to initialize you know all the variables related to the temperatures and also of course

06:38.410 --> 06:45.100
to the energy because our ultimate goal is to save the maximum energy and we can do that through the

06:45.100 --> 06:48.180
best temperature regulation as possible.

06:48.460 --> 06:51.420
But here here comes a crucial point to understand.

06:51.580 --> 06:57.250
So let's take a little break and I'll explain this important point in the next tutorial in which we'll

06:57.250 --> 07:01.980
also introduce and initialize the rest of the environment object variables here.
