00:00.600 --> 00:06.660
So now just to finish let's just update our two final important variables which are you know that all

00:06.780 --> 00:08.050
accumulate in reward.

00:08.210 --> 00:13.950
My dad Tompson something strategy which is our list of strategies selected by Tompson sampling.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.220
So I'm just going to get that.

00:16.470 --> 00:20.910
I'm going to copy this and I'm going to play that here.

00:21.150 --> 00:27.870
And indeed what we're going to do with this variable Well we're going to append very simply the strategy

00:27.870 --> 00:35.010
that was just elected because this is exactly the list of the strategies selected by Thompson sampling

00:35.520 --> 00:36.960
over the rounds.

00:37.560 --> 00:38.370
All right perfect.

00:38.370 --> 00:44.640
And then the final thing we have to do is indeed to update this as well which is the accumulated reward

00:45.030 --> 00:51.740
because indeed Indian will want to compute some absolute and relative returns to compare how better

00:51.750 --> 00:57.800
Thompson sampling performed with respect to our benchmark which is a random strategy.

00:57.810 --> 01:02.220
Then we'll do you'll see to invest a PDA to see exactly what we're going to compute you know in the

01:02.220 --> 01:03.340
next Teutul.

01:03.420 --> 01:06.720
So let's update this final variable.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.380
That is that all accumulated reward and to update it.

01:10.410 --> 01:19.910
Well we just have to incremented by of course we were we got by deploying the selected strategy at this

01:19.910 --> 01:26.580
specific route and that is for the specific customer and and that's why I'm pasting that received we

01:26.580 --> 01:27.940
were right here.

01:28.150 --> 01:29.190
And perfect.

01:29.250 --> 01:32.190
Now we're done with the whole for loop.

01:32.190 --> 01:34.590
We're done with the Tompson sampling algorithm.

01:34.650 --> 01:36.360
We're done with the Ranum strategy.

01:36.430 --> 01:42.300
We're done with the whole for loop and therefore we're ready to compute the final results that is the

01:42.300 --> 01:49.770
absolute and relative returns to see how Thompson simply beats the Ranum strategy and mostly to see

01:49.770 --> 01:55.390
how many extra millions of revenues we made for this online retail business.

01:56.060 --> 01:57.920
Let's check it out and its oil.

01:57.930 --> 01:59.700
And until then enjoy A-I.
