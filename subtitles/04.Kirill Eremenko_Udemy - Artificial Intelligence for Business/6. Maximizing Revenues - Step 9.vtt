00:00.610 --> 00:01.900
All right let's do this.

00:02.020 --> 00:04.350
Let's start the big four up.

00:04.450 --> 00:12.620
So we're going to loop over all the rounds and in the range of course from zero.

00:12.760 --> 00:17.060
Well this is a different value but let's Presider it anyway too.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.290
And the total number of rounds.

00:19.360 --> 00:25.300
So I remind that we're going to start first with 10000 but then we'll try with 1000 to see if it is

00:25.300 --> 00:27.560
able to catch the best strategy.

00:27.640 --> 00:30.400
Even with a much lower number of rounds.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.100
All right.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.810
So that's our big fall.

00:33.910 --> 00:36.070
And then inside here we go.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.460
We're going to repeat the steps.

00:38.470 --> 00:42.070
But first of all before we repeat each of these three steps.

00:42.190 --> 00:44.070
Well let's take care quickly.

00:44.080 --> 00:51.340
The Ranum strategy you know we're going to select randomly and strategy then add it to our strategy

00:51.340 --> 00:58.510
selected R S which is the list of the strategies selected at random then we'll get the reward that we

00:58.510 --> 01:05.350
get from this random selection and then we'll update of course the total reward that is actually reward

01:05.620 --> 01:06.950
from the random strategy.

01:07.240 --> 01:12.180
So let's do that quickly and to specify that we are now dealing with the run strategy.

01:12.250 --> 01:18.930
Well I'm going to put in a comment here random strategy.

01:18.940 --> 01:19.520
All right.

01:19.520 --> 01:23.280
And then later I'll put the same gunman with Thompson sampling.

01:23.300 --> 01:23.900
So here we go.

01:23.900 --> 01:25.520
Let's do this efficiently.

01:25.520 --> 01:31.130
So first of all we have to indeed select randomly a strategy.

01:31.250 --> 01:38.170
And so where are the strategies selected at random that call it strategy are s.

01:38.330 --> 01:45.620
And we're going to get that by taking of course our random module that we import here which is not even

01:45.620 --> 01:46.700
by non-Thai.

01:46.790 --> 01:56.190
And from this module will get a random number from the range 0 to the right so 0 is the default value.

01:56.200 --> 02:02.480
Basically rund range is a function that we call from the random Mudgal and that takes as input the lower

02:02.480 --> 02:09.920
bound zero and the upper boundary and which will return a random integer between 0 and which is exactly

02:09.920 --> 02:10.850
what we wanted to know.

02:10.850 --> 02:18.770
We wanted to like run a strategy and since the strategies have indexes from 0 to 8 Well this will return

02:18.770 --> 02:20.420
exactly random strategy.

02:20.720 --> 02:26.610
And then we're going to append this to our strategy selected our s list.

02:26.810 --> 02:28.900
That's why I'm copying this.

02:28.980 --> 02:32.600
I am basing that here and now we're going to use this trick.

02:32.600 --> 02:42.360
Remember we add that append to append exactly the random strategy which is selected randomly.

02:42.360 --> 02:47.900
All right so I'm copying this and adding that in the append function and this will happen.

02:47.930 --> 02:56.410
Our first strategy selected randomly in our whole list of strategies selected from the run and strategy.

02:56.740 --> 02:57.360
OK.

02:57.530 --> 02:59.060
So here we go.

02:59.100 --> 03:05.570
Now we can get the word because since we selected a strategy Well we don't know exactly.

03:05.570 --> 03:08.260
Thanks to our simulation here that we created.

03:08.480 --> 03:14.540
If we're going to get to zero and one word and actually let's execute that again because previously

03:14.540 --> 03:19.720
we had this example I want to show you so I'm executing that again.

03:19.790 --> 03:28.190
And now let me show you what's going to happen in varry will explore here is X our matrix of words.

03:28.190 --> 03:32.110
Here we go again our matrix of word which contains the simulation.

03:32.240 --> 03:37.710
So right now what we just did is selected a random strategy at each round.

03:37.910 --> 03:43.340
So let's say for example that we are in the first round that is corresponding to a first customer connecting

03:43.340 --> 03:45.140
to the online retail website.

03:45.380 --> 03:49.450
And let's say that for example the Ranum strategy selected is strategy.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.600
Number three there is an index too.

03:51.800 --> 03:57.970
And so for this specific round corresponding to that specific row and for this specific randomly selected

03:57.970 --> 04:04.400
Dragic respond to that specific column while we get a zero here in the cell which means that the customer

04:04.580 --> 04:10.400
that connects here won't subscribe to the premium plan as we deploy.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.740
Strategy number two.

04:11.820 --> 04:17.540
The there were only zeroes here so we would automatically get as you want and then Same for customer

04:17.540 --> 04:19.160
number two on the 00.

04:19.160 --> 04:24.740
So wherever the Ranum strategy we select for example this one the customer won't subscribe.

04:24.890 --> 04:30.650
But then for example let's imagine that customer number three you know they're connecting one after

04:30.650 --> 04:36.560
the other but customer number three and let's say we're very lucky and we select randomly the strategy

04:36.560 --> 04:39.160
of index 7 that is the eighth strategy.

04:39.350 --> 04:45.740
Well according to our simulation customer number three is very attracted to the strategy.

04:45.740 --> 04:51.320
Number seven we deploy and therefore this customer will subscribe to the premium plan because we get

04:51.320 --> 04:52.520
a one here.

04:52.520 --> 04:53.930
And so right now what do we have to do.

04:53.930 --> 04:59.960
Well since we are in the specific round you know in the for loop and we selected a specific strategy

05:00.050 --> 05:06.770
corresponding to specific Culham well to get the reward for that specific selected strategy deployed

05:06.770 --> 05:08.280
on that specific customer.

05:08.390 --> 05:15.300
Well we just need to get the sale of this rope around and this column that is the strategy selected

05:15.740 --> 05:23.000
and therefore what we have to do now to get you know to collect the strategy is to first introduce a

05:23.000 --> 05:29.930
new Orwoll which we're going to call reward r s because it's the reward received by the Ranum strategy.

05:29.930 --> 05:38.060
And so to get it we can get our matrix of rewards X and we're going to get the round we are encouraged

05:38.180 --> 05:44.510
into that specific customer we are dealing with which is around and because we are in a specific round

05:44.510 --> 05:46.750
in the loop corresponding to end here.

05:46.790 --> 05:52.980
So that's for the row and then for the column well that corresponds to the strategy that was selected

05:52.980 --> 05:58.670
it is the index of the strategy that was selected which is the exact same index the column we need to

05:58.670 --> 06:00.070
get right now.

06:00.260 --> 06:04.220
So strategy on this core are s and here we go.

06:04.250 --> 06:07.000
We just received the reward.

06:07.310 --> 06:08.030
All right.

06:08.030 --> 06:08.680
Perfect.

06:08.730 --> 06:16.120
And now one last final step before we are done with this random strategy it's of course to update the

06:16.310 --> 06:23.660
total reward accumulated with this random strategy here are as because in the end want to compute the

06:23.660 --> 06:30.440
absolute return and the relative return that is how much more revenues we earn with Tompson sampling

06:30.650 --> 06:33.800
with respect to this random strategy.

06:33.800 --> 06:39.510
So let's get this let's update this variable and update it.

06:39.680 --> 06:49.760
Well we simply need to increment it or add to it the reward which is obtained by selecting this strategy

06:49.760 --> 06:50.870
randomly.

06:50.870 --> 06:51.410
All right.

06:51.560 --> 06:58.770
And the other trick to this is just to do this Leydet right as you want.

06:58.810 --> 07:01.850
Feel free to choose your preferred syntax.

07:02.230 --> 07:03.500
All right perfect.

07:03.520 --> 07:09.700
So we're done with the Ranum strategy and now we're going to tackle the real deal of this part.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.310
That is the Tompson sampling algorithm.

07:12.550 --> 07:14.180
Let's do that in the next tutorial.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.880
And until then enjoy AI.
