WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:02.150
Are right we are almost done.

00:02.160 --> 00:04.660
We only have one step to go.

00:04.830 --> 00:10.110
And this is step three we already implemented step 1 and step 2 and now we're about to implement step

00:10.110 --> 00:16.170
3 where we have to update the numbers of times the strategies have received a one word or two around

00:16.200 --> 00:21.570
and and the number of times the strategies have received a zero we weren't up to around.

00:21.760 --> 00:27.700
And I remind that we created two variables with these two numbers which are in fact not numbers but

00:27.700 --> 00:31.430
a list of these numbers for each of our nine strategies.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.770
And that's exactly what we have to do right now.

00:34.110 --> 00:36.240
So how are we going to do that properly.

00:36.510 --> 00:40.180
Well really we just need to follow what's written here.

00:40.260 --> 00:48.000
Indeed we first need to check if the strategy we selected in step to here you know this one here thanks

00:48.000 --> 00:48.840
to the for loop.

00:49.080 --> 00:56.010
Well we just need to check the reward of the strategy because if the reward of the strategy is one well

00:56.010 --> 01:03.240
we'll have to update this number here and for that specific strategy that was elected you know so well

01:03.270 --> 01:08.400
only update this number for the specifics that was selected in step two.

01:08.460 --> 01:15.570
And if the strategy we selected is that to get us a zero reward well same we only have to update the

01:15.570 --> 01:19.990
second number that is number of times the strategy has received to zero.

01:19.990 --> 01:25.340
We were up to around and and for only this strategy that was selected.

01:25.620 --> 01:26.820
So let's be careful.

01:26.830 --> 01:33.990
They basically will only have to date one element of these two lists we created here.

01:33.990 --> 01:34.590
All right.

01:34.590 --> 01:35.280
So let's do this.

01:35.280 --> 01:38.230
First we have to get in the reward.

01:38.550 --> 01:44.240
So I'm going to call it exactly as we call it here reward.

01:44.380 --> 01:45.090
Yes.

01:45.230 --> 01:51.510
So I'm just copying this and I'm going to paste that and replace r as by ts.

01:51.780 --> 01:59.340
That's the word we get after selecting the strategy TS here at the specific round and we're dealing

01:59.340 --> 02:00.400
with right now.

02:00.510 --> 02:02.950
And so how are you going to get that reward.

02:03.060 --> 02:10.760
Well again we're going to get it from our matrix of rewards which we created through the simulation.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.150
So let's take that again.

02:12.180 --> 02:18.330
I'm going to go to varry will explore inside which I'm going to open our matrix X rewards.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.590
And let's just explain this again quickly.

02:21.810 --> 02:28.230
So let's say that the customer we are dealing with right now or the round we're dealing with right now

02:28.320 --> 02:33.630
and this for loop is round number for you know round of index 3.

02:33.990 --> 02:40.650
So for this round we are at the beginning and therefore Thompson simply did not get enough trial and

02:40.710 --> 02:47.250
error info is like the best strategy and therefore the highest of the run draws from the data distributions

02:47.250 --> 02:50.860
of the 9 strategies will probably lead us to a better one.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.020
You know like this one strategy number three.

02:53.460 --> 02:58.880
And therefore since right now we're dealing with a specific round that is a specific customer put into

02:58.890 --> 03:04.950
that row and the strategy selected is this one corresponding to this specific column column the next

03:04.980 --> 03:06.960
to well to get the reward.

03:06.960 --> 03:13.800
We simply need to get the number in the cell of this row and this column which is zero and that corresponds

03:13.800 --> 03:20.940
of course to the situation where the customer did not convert that is did not subscribe to the premium

03:20.940 --> 03:21.630
plan.

03:21.630 --> 03:26.100
After we deployed strategy number three for the specific customer.

03:26.430 --> 03:33.180
All right but then you know as we go in the rounds and as Tompson something is learning which is the

03:33.180 --> 03:34.150
best strategy.

03:34.320 --> 03:41.520
Well now let's say that you know we dealing with customer number two thousand six hundred and twenty.

03:41.690 --> 03:44.600
You know of next 2600 twenty three.

03:44.970 --> 03:47.010
Well at this point.

03:47.190 --> 03:52.920
THOMPSON something might have shifted the beta distribution of the best strategy.

03:52.920 --> 04:00.270
That is a strategy of index enough to the right and therefore the highest of the random draws picked

04:00.510 --> 04:08.160
from the 9 beta distributions will probably be the one of the beta distribution of strategy number 7

04:08.430 --> 04:15.210
because you know at this point this has now become the beta distribution for which the positive probabilities

04:15.480 --> 04:21.960
are for the highest conversion rates and therefore that's why at this point we'll probably get you know

04:22.320 --> 04:28.230
the strategy number seven because indeed it has the beta distribution the most shifted to the right

04:28.230 --> 04:34.230
and therefore the beta distribution that has highly positive probabilities for the highest range of

04:34.230 --> 04:35.690
conversion rates.

04:35.790 --> 04:42.390
And so let's say that it is the fact and therefore that Tompson sampling indeed select and the specific

04:42.390 --> 04:48.870
round that is for the specific customer strategy number seven and therefore we deployed a strategy and

04:48.870 --> 04:54.600
indeed by deploying the strategy the customer is attracted to it because it's the best strategy and

04:54.870 --> 05:01.710
the customer decides to subscribe to the premium plan and that's when we one we want for that specific

05:01.710 --> 05:02.240
round.

05:02.370 --> 05:09.870
Well the reward will get will be one and we'll update this exact number because the strategy selected

05:09.870 --> 05:14.720
received one we word but then that doesn't have to happen every round.

05:14.760 --> 05:21.090
Indeed at the next round even if Thompson sampling will probably select this strategy again because

05:21.090 --> 05:25.360
again the beta distribution will again be even more shifted to the right.

05:25.450 --> 05:31.790
Well unfortunately not all the customers have to be attracted to strategy number seven.

05:31.920 --> 05:38.580
And that's the case with next one according to our simulation because in the next customer is only attracted

05:38.580 --> 05:45.310
to strategy number one you know we'll only decide to subscribe if we show him strategy number one.

05:45.450 --> 05:51.880
And therefore at the next round assuming that Thompson sampling will indeed select again the strategy

05:51.880 --> 05:57.900
number 7 because again it has the beta distribution with the highly positive probabilities for the highest

05:57.900 --> 06:01.640
range of conversion rates then it will probably select this again.

06:01.650 --> 06:07.470
No because it's taking the maximum of the wrong drugs from the beta distributions but unfortunately

06:07.800 --> 06:11.460
the next customer won't convert and we'll get zero reward.

06:11.640 --> 06:16.660
And so in that case what we'll have to do is update this number here.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.300
All right.

06:17.340 --> 06:19.240
So let's do this.

06:19.380 --> 06:25.830
The first thing we have to do therefore is just to get this reward and we get it exactly from our matrix

06:25.830 --> 06:31.010
of rewards X which right now has to give us the sell of Roe.

06:31.140 --> 06:40.600
And because we're dealing with customer end in the round and and call him of index strategy TS because

06:40.660 --> 06:45.260
that's the strategy that was just elected and stepped right here.

06:45.280 --> 06:53.130
So by calling this will getting the reward we get by deploying strategy ts on customer.

06:53.610 --> 06:54.730
Perfect.

06:54.770 --> 06:56.130
So now we got this reward.

06:56.170 --> 07:03.760
Well the next step is very simply to implement this you know implement these two conditions to get the

07:03.760 --> 07:04.610
right number.

07:04.900 --> 07:12.040
And therefore what we're going to do here is check first if the reward of the strategy we just selected

07:12.380 --> 07:18.220
that is reward as if reward TS is equal to one.

07:18.400 --> 07:25.600
Well in that case we'll have to update our numbers of rewards one barbel but only for the strategy that

07:25.600 --> 07:26.570
was selected.

07:26.610 --> 07:32.350
You know that's a list where each element corresponds to a strategy and we'll only date the elements

07:32.590 --> 07:34.940
corresponding to the strategy that was selected.

07:35.170 --> 07:38.840
And therefore we're going to do here is just get this.

07:38.890 --> 07:45.970
And so if we would see as equals 1 that is if the reward of the strategy we just selected is equal to

07:45.970 --> 07:46.540
one.

07:46.750 --> 07:54.040
Well we'll update the element of this numbers of reward to one list corresponding to the strategy that

07:54.040 --> 07:55.000
was just elected.

07:55.000 --> 08:03.310
That is the element of index strategy TS and we'll increment it by one or every one we can do it this

08:03.310 --> 08:10.430
way we can just copy that again and add a plus one like that.

08:10.470 --> 08:18.210
You know we just add a 1 to this number here but only for the strategy that was selected exactly as

08:18.210 --> 08:22.210
we have to do here and the now very easily we have to do.

08:22.290 --> 08:27.370
The other condition which is a condition where we get a zero reward.

08:27.570 --> 08:34.860
But since these are complimentary conditions Well we just need to add else here and now we can just

08:34.860 --> 08:44.040
very easily copy this and paste it here so that we have a date in the condition that we get zero reward

08:44.370 --> 08:52.710
which is a condition in the else here we update our numbers of awards zero variable only for the strategy

08:52.710 --> 08:57.890
that was selected is only the element of this list corresponding to that strategy selected.

08:58.230 --> 09:01.920
And same with increment that 2 1.

09:02.310 --> 09:03.230
And here we go.

09:03.280 --> 09:09.890
We're done with step 3 and therefore we're done with the whole algorithm.
