00:00.390 --> 00:04.500
Hi Guys welcome back to the artificial intelligence business course.

00:04.530 --> 00:10.920
The first case study optimizing wherehouse flows with Q learning you are now done with the first two

00:10.920 --> 00:11.600
steps.

00:11.670 --> 00:17.490
The first two big steps of this case are the one defining the environment that we did together and to

00:17.790 --> 00:19.800
studying the AI solution.

00:19.800 --> 00:25.830
Getting both the intuition and the theory with curious intuition lectures and now we're going to tackle

00:25.830 --> 00:30.530
the third big step which is our final step but a very important one.

00:30.540 --> 00:33.780
It's of course the implementation in Python.

00:33.780 --> 00:40.890
So we're going to implement the whole jewler solution to solve this warehouse Flo's optimization problem

00:41.220 --> 00:49.830
and to do that not only we will implement Julan But also we will make the right functions to go into

00:49.830 --> 00:50.310
production.

00:50.310 --> 00:55.920
That is you know we would like to make a tool that takes as input the location where our autonomous

00:55.920 --> 00:58.580
warehouse robot is at a specific time t..

00:58.680 --> 01:04.650
And the top priority location where it has to go immediately to collect the products for the most important

01:04.650 --> 01:05.540
deliveries.

01:05.740 --> 01:06.390
OK.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.430
So that's what we'll do in the first step.

01:08.430 --> 01:15.480
And then at the end will improve our AI's solution by adding a new feature in this tool which will be

01:15.480 --> 01:17.390
to optimize even more.

01:17.460 --> 01:23.850
The warehouse flows by adding the option to go by an intermediary point before going to the top every

01:23.850 --> 01:29.890
location and of course this intermediary location will be the second or prior location.

01:30.180 --> 01:32.030
So let's do all this.

01:32.070 --> 01:39.930
And the reason I'm on Google right now is because we're going to implement our solution in Spider Anaconda

01:40.170 --> 01:45.660
which is an idea that I highly recommend because it's like a studio you'll have your editor where you

01:45.660 --> 01:46.970
implement your code.

01:46.980 --> 01:53.580
You have to console to execute a code and some other features like a way to easily look at all your

01:53.580 --> 01:54.350
variables.

01:54.450 --> 01:55.680
Well I'll show you all this.

01:55.710 --> 01:57.580
After downloading and Oquendo.

01:57.990 --> 02:00.690
So therefore it's all good to Google.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.800
And if you don't have a nick on there yet let's download it.

02:03.790 --> 02:07.710
So you just type here and I kinda just like this.

02:07.710 --> 02:15.330
And here we go you can take the second link download Anaconda and now depending on your system make

02:15.330 --> 02:21.600
sure to choose the right system here I think it should automatically be protected here on Windows.

02:21.600 --> 02:25.670
Click here if you click here and if you're on Linux click here.

02:25.740 --> 02:33.030
I'm on Macs all good and now make sure to download bidon 3.6 because indeed not in this case.

02:33.120 --> 02:39.490
In the second case so he will use some bison 3.6 index which won't work in Python 2.7.

02:39.500 --> 02:44.490
So make sure to click this download button for Biden 3.6.

02:44.640 --> 02:48.080
And now the download just started is right here.

02:48.120 --> 02:52.430
Forty seconds on my computer here you have the option to get a cheat sheet.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.400
You can say no thanks.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.710
You can close this.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.610
We will need it for our implementations.

02:58.080 --> 03:02.230
All right so I'll accelerate until the download is over.

03:02.550 --> 03:02.880
All right.

03:02.880 --> 03:03.610
Here we go.

03:03.630 --> 03:04.810
Download over.

03:04.820 --> 03:12.740
So now let's go to our downloads folder which is right here and here is the file that I just downloaded.

03:13.050 --> 03:18.050
And so this is the insulation file that will install Anaconda.

03:18.360 --> 03:26.610
So you just double click on it then you click Continue continue continue continue agree and install.

03:26.910 --> 03:33.750
And this will install an icon that it will just take a few minutes maybe less and you'll get an icon

03:33.750 --> 03:39.740
they'll get the spider studio on which we will implement our AI solutions.

03:40.110 --> 03:43.150
So again I'll accelerate until the end.

03:43.200 --> 03:43.930
Perfect.

03:43.950 --> 03:45.440
The installation is over.

03:45.450 --> 03:47.720
You don't have to install Microsoft vs code.

03:47.730 --> 03:50.670
You can just click continue here and here we go.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.530
Let's just close it.

03:53.350 --> 03:55.650
You can just keep it or move it to the trash.

03:55.660 --> 03:57.400
And now we have Anaconda.

03:57.700 --> 03:58.950
So I'm on a Mac here.

03:58.960 --> 04:04.000
So the way to get an account is just go to applications and then they'll click on Anaconda and then

04:04.000 --> 04:04.960
begetter.

04:04.960 --> 04:11.470
And for Windows users you'll find Anaconda in your list of programs you know by clicking the windows

04:11.470 --> 04:17.520
button and then find an icon here or you can just type and I can dial in the research bar.

04:17.770 --> 04:23.190
And again you have to open an account navigator and for Linux users same You'll find and I can then

04:23.190 --> 04:27.220
navigator in your list of programs or applications.

04:27.220 --> 04:29.340
Well I'm sure you'll find that very easily.

04:29.590 --> 04:31.870
So let's double click on that.

04:31.870 --> 04:39.820
This will open Anaconda and inside Anaconda will find several IDs and will choose spider.

04:39.820 --> 04:40.650
Here we go.

04:40.840 --> 04:48.220
So we are inside Anaconda and indeed there are several IDs including Jupiter notebook which is a very

04:48.220 --> 04:48.980
good one.

04:49.300 --> 04:56.200
And of course spider which is the one I will choose for this course as in fact any other of our courses.

04:56.440 --> 04:59.880
So to open spider we just need to click launch.

05:00.100 --> 05:07.510
And here we go this will launch spider and that is exactly where we are going to implement our AI solutions

05:07.510 --> 05:09.730
for the three case studies.

05:09.730 --> 05:10.030
All right.

05:10.030 --> 05:14.380
So when you open spider for the first time indeed you get this.

05:14.380 --> 05:19.720
And the first thing we're going to do is get rid of this Stemp that fell because it has absolutely no

05:19.720 --> 05:20.270
use.

05:20.410 --> 05:26.830
Once you want to do is go to the top and click on file and then click new file and then you can just

05:26.950 --> 05:31.040
close this tent up you I fell you can just select all this and delete.

05:31.270 --> 05:37.060
And now what we can do is save this file somewhere inside our computer.

05:37.420 --> 05:45.400
And so what I did and this is actually what I do in all the courses I created the whole course folder

05:45.640 --> 05:46.440
for the course.

05:46.510 --> 05:48.600
Artificial intelligence for business.

05:48.710 --> 05:56.110
Indeed if we go inside you'll see that it has three big parts of this course but one optimizing warehouse

05:56.110 --> 06:02.510
flows with Q learning point to minimizing energy consumption in a server with deep learning.

06:02.710 --> 06:08.680
And part 3 maximizing the sales in an online retail business with Tamson sampling.

06:08.680 --> 06:11.730
So this is the folder structure of the Course.

06:11.770 --> 06:15.070
This will be provided on the super data science website.

06:15.100 --> 06:20.290
So I recommend to get exactly the same because believe me we'll like to have everything organized in

06:20.290 --> 06:20.990
folders.

06:21.190 --> 06:26.260
When you know we start having many buys and sells for the first case study will only have one buys involved

06:26.260 --> 06:26.900
for example.

06:26.920 --> 06:31.720
Second one will get several bites and files because this is a huge case study.

06:31.750 --> 06:38.310
So make sure to have this for the structure with all these sub folders but we provide them in the Super

06:38.400 --> 06:43.100
Science website so that you can just download that and have this on your computer.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.530
And so what we want to do now.

06:44.650 --> 06:50.350
You know we were about to save a file and we are in but once we are going to save it in this folder

06:50.490 --> 06:56.290
Part 1 optimizing warehouse flows with coloring and now we have to name this file and I'm going to name

06:56.290 --> 06:56.740
it.

06:56.740 --> 07:03.200
Q learning all right and now we can just click on Save.

07:03.580 --> 07:04.490
And here we go.

07:04.530 --> 07:07.030
We are ready to start our implementation.

07:07.440 --> 07:12.800
But before we start I would just like to describe what we see here for the newbies and spider.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.390
So this is our editor.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.000
That's where we will implement the whole code.

07:17.260 --> 07:22.420
Then this is the council where the code will be executed and also to type any code.

07:22.420 --> 07:27.840
For example I can just type 2 plus 2 and if I presented this will just return me for.

07:27.910 --> 07:29.550
Here we go that's the output.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.780
So you can just like any good.

07:30.790 --> 07:36.900
But when we execute our implementation the code will be executed here in the council.

07:37.180 --> 07:41.670
And then we have this which is pretty practical because it contains three windows.

07:41.710 --> 07:46.760
First explore which is basically your browser on your computer.

07:47.070 --> 07:53.770
And so in fall explorer we have to do something now it's to go to the working directory folder where

07:53.770 --> 07:59.440
we saved our Biden file and that's in desktop then artificial intelligence for business.

07:59.590 --> 08:06.130
And finally part one optimizing warehouse flows with collecting and that's the working directory folder

08:06.520 --> 08:11.320
in which in general you should be when working on your implementation.

08:11.470 --> 08:16.840
And then we have variable Explorer where you will be able to see all the variables you create in your

08:16.840 --> 08:17.680
implementation.

08:17.680 --> 08:26.830
Once you execute and finally you have the help window which can give you some informations on the classes

08:26.830 --> 08:34.540
or objects or functions you use from the diverse libraries that you import to build your AI solutions.

08:34.540 --> 08:37.180
All right so this is Pitre welcome to spider.

08:37.240 --> 08:41.810
And now we're going to start our implementation in the next tutorial.

08:41.830 --> 08:43.470
Until then enjoy AI.
