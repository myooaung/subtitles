00:00.780 --> 00:02.070
All right welcome back.

00:02.070 --> 00:09.450
So in the previous toil we just implemented step 1 and now we're about to implement step 2 to select

00:09.550 --> 00:14.700
the strategy that has the highest of these random draws we took in step 1.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.130
All right let's do this.

00:16.140 --> 00:22.740
So what is the best trick now to get the maximum of these random draws that is the maximum of these

00:22.830 --> 00:26.310
random betas for each of the nine strategies.

00:26.340 --> 00:31.170
So we already saw a trick to get an element that corresponds to a maximum.

00:31.170 --> 00:33.330
Remember this is the ARG next trick.

00:33.330 --> 00:39.210
By and by however here this is not the best thing we can use because we are already dealing with a loop

00:39.390 --> 00:40.050
right.

00:40.110 --> 00:45.960
We are getting the random data that is a random draw from the distribution for each of the beta distributions

00:46.050 --> 00:47.490
or the nine strategies.

00:47.790 --> 00:53.550
And therefore what we can do which would be more relevant is to simply keep track of the maximum as

00:53.550 --> 00:56.930
we go you know as we progress inside this for loop.

00:57.150 --> 01:05.820
So let's say for example that we initialize a max random variable to 0 which will later correspond to

01:05.820 --> 01:06.800
this maximum.

01:06.790 --> 01:08.200
We're trying to get right now.

01:08.460 --> 01:14.550
And very simply lets you know each time we're dealing with a strategy strategy as it is the case right

01:14.550 --> 01:15.410
now in the loop.

01:15.570 --> 01:24.270
Well let's check that if the random draw no random data that we just got from this beta distribution

01:24.270 --> 01:27.840
of the specific strategy we're dealing with right now.

01:28.080 --> 01:35.870
Well if this random draw is larger than max random which so far is initialized to 0 then you will see

01:35.870 --> 01:36.950
what it will become.

01:37.130 --> 01:47.340
Well speaking of that if random data is larger than next random Well Max random will become random data

01:48.820 --> 01:52.240
write so that you know this is how it will go.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.200
We deal first with the first strategy.

01:54.370 --> 02:01.580
We get the random data the random data will be higher than zero so Max from will become a better grade.

02:01.600 --> 02:07.540
And then when we deal with the next strategy Well again we'll get the random draw from the beta distribution

02:07.600 --> 02:09.460
of this next strategy.

02:09.670 --> 02:15.940
And that's where we check if this new random data that we get from the beta distribution of this next

02:15.940 --> 02:22.690
Reiji is larger than max random which was you know equal to the random data of the previous beta distribution

02:22.690 --> 02:24.080
of the previous strategy.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.990
So is the new random data is larger than the previous one.

02:28.150 --> 02:34.750
Well we'll update our max random which will correspond to the maximum random data overall over the 9

02:34.750 --> 02:40.760
strategies to this one because it is larger than the previous one and etc. we repeat that in this for

02:40.760 --> 02:41.190
loop.

02:41.320 --> 02:45.270
And then of course we'll get the maximum of these random letters.

02:45.520 --> 02:49.540
So you see that's more practical and more direct to compute the maximum.

02:49.540 --> 02:55.540
This way rather than you know making a list getting all the random betas and then using the RMX trick

02:55.720 --> 02:56.990
to get the maximum.

02:57.100 --> 03:03.550
Now here we directly get the maximum of these random draws from the beta distributions of our nine strategies.

03:03.550 --> 03:04.610
All right perfect.

03:04.630 --> 03:06.250
So we get this maximum.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.840
And then of course let's not forget what we have to do essentially.

03:10.030 --> 03:16.570
Well we have to select the strategy that has the highest of these random draws and therefore to do that

03:16.810 --> 03:25.720
well why do we simply need to do well here as soon as we get a random draw that is larger than the maximum

03:25.720 --> 03:26.970
that we've got so far.

03:27.130 --> 03:31.990
Well what we can seem to do is you know keep that strategy.

03:31.990 --> 03:37.090
Now we're dealing with a specific strategy and if the random draw is larger than the maximum well that

03:37.100 --> 03:42.280
maybe is the right strategy we have to select that is the strategy that has the highest random draw.

03:42.460 --> 03:51.030
So at this point we have to keep it because so far in the loop it has indeed the highest of these run

03:51.090 --> 03:58.400
drugs and then no worries if later in the loop we encounter a random draw that is larger than the maximum

03:58.550 --> 03:59.690
obtained so far.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.900
Well this will be updated as the adder has a maximum of these random drops.

04:05.090 --> 04:10.370
And just to make sure we don't have any initialization problem where we can initialize you know really

04:10.400 --> 04:15.300
introduce this Roybal better we can do that right here.

04:15.440 --> 04:21.140
Just before introducing the maximum of these random draws and we can just initialize that to zero because

04:21.140 --> 04:24.150
you know we were storing this for loop from zero.

04:24.260 --> 04:24.800
Right.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.770
We are doing this route from 0 to D.

04:26.960 --> 04:32.190
So the first strategy we're dealing with is a strategy of index 0 and that's where I am initializing

04:32.190 --> 04:32.940
it at zero.

04:33.100 --> 04:33.830
OK.

04:34.160 --> 04:34.940
And that's it.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.660
With this fool who not only will get the maximum of the random draws from all the beta distributions

04:41.660 --> 04:47.670
of our nine strategies and each time we have a maximum Well we'll get the strategy that has this maximum.

04:47.810 --> 04:49.030
And in the end when the fool.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.500
And that is a full on the strategies.

04:51.740 --> 04:57.130
Well we'll get the strategy that has the maximum of these random draws.

04:57.530 --> 04:58.970
OK and that's it.

04:58.970 --> 05:01.160
Step two is done right.

05:01.230 --> 05:07.030
We just had to select the strategy has the maximum of these random draws which is exactly what we just

05:07.040 --> 05:07.590
did.

05:07.910 --> 05:14.490
So now let's move on to Step Three and to move onto Step Three Well we have to get out of this for a

05:14.500 --> 05:18.750
loop because this Foluke was just to find this maximum random draw.

05:18.800 --> 05:24.110
And the strategy corresponding to that maximum random draw and now we're going to move on to step three

05:24.410 --> 05:28.900
which is to update the numbers of time the strategies have received.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.700
One we want to run.

05:30.890 --> 05:35.450
And the numbers of times the strategies have received were we weren't up to round.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.060
And so let's do that in the next Tauriel.

05:38.060 --> 05:39.800
And until then enjoy AAE.
