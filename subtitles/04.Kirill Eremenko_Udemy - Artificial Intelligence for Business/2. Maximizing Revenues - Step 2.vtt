WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:01.010
All right.

00:01.080 --> 00:01.860
So here we go.

00:01.860 --> 00:03.430
Let's start with the first step.

00:03.430 --> 00:07.150
Defining the environment by defining environment.

00:07.190 --> 00:09.610
I will also of course define the problem.

00:09.720 --> 00:15.840
So the problem is basically an optimization problem again or more specifically a maximization problem

00:16.230 --> 00:23.550
because we're trying to get the maximum customers from this online retail business to subscribe to the

00:23.550 --> 00:29.880
brand new premium plan that was created by this company and which is a premium plan where the customers

00:29.880 --> 00:35.700
will pay a certain amount of money per month or per year to get advantages when they buy some drugs

00:35.710 --> 00:38.110
online or when they sell their products.

00:38.140 --> 00:39.750
Know they can either buy or sell.

00:39.750 --> 00:47.760
So these advantages can be for example faster delivery or price reductions on products or special deals

00:47.790 --> 00:49.070
or sometimes gifts.

00:49.170 --> 00:55.290
Well this is supposed to be a great plan if you subscribe to and of course since the customers are going

00:55.290 --> 00:57.360
to pay monthly or yearly.

00:57.450 --> 01:00.150
And with this brilliant plan there's still going to buy the products.

01:00.180 --> 01:02.330
That's also a big win for the company.

01:02.700 --> 01:09.230
And in order to convert the maximum customers to subscribe to this plan.

01:09.450 --> 01:16.500
Well the strategy team as we can see prepared nine different strategies nine different strategies and

01:16.590 --> 01:22.250
each of them is composed of four features first a specific form.

01:22.260 --> 01:27.810
So you know when the customer connects online to the Web site well there is going to be a pop up or

01:27.810 --> 01:34.980
you know an ad or something like that which will lead the customer to fill in a form and for each of

01:34.980 --> 01:40.200
these strategies we're going to have different forums so we're going to have more or less long forms.

01:40.350 --> 01:44.690
We're going to have forums of different designs and of course among these nine forums.

01:44.790 --> 01:46.160
Well one of them will be there.

01:46.170 --> 01:51.540
You know there will be one of them to which the customer will be more attracted more attracted to fill

01:51.540 --> 01:53.850
in the form and take action.

01:53.850 --> 01:58.020
And then as we can see in each of these strategies we also have a package.

01:58.020 --> 02:05.220
So this package is basically the offer that the customer will get by subscribing to the premium plan.

02:05.220 --> 02:10.710
So this can be for example if you subscribe the premium plan you'll get this and that you'll get free

02:10.710 --> 02:16.350
deliveries you'll get 5 percent discount on average for all the products or you'll get this free book

02:16.500 --> 02:18.750
and you'll get this gift wherever you know.

02:18.750 --> 02:22.710
There is an upward baggage whenever the customer subscribes to the premium plan.

02:22.710 --> 02:27.300
And again there is a different package for each of these nine strategies.

02:27.300 --> 02:33.540
And then inside each strategy we also have an ad so that you know the way we can catch the customer

02:33.780 --> 02:37.400
and incite him to subscribe to the premium plan.

02:37.410 --> 02:41.520
So this ad can be a pop up this can be ad inside an email.

02:41.520 --> 02:47.070
You know this online retail business of course has the e-mail addresses of the customers so at to for

02:47.070 --> 02:51.620
example in too could be an ad in an e-mail and at 6:00 and strategy six.

02:51.630 --> 02:57.780
Just an example can be just a puppet appearing on the website when the customer connects to it.

02:57.780 --> 02:59.370
So different ads.

02:59.490 --> 03:01.590
And then finally special deals.

03:01.590 --> 03:08.310
So each time a customer connects to the website and we get this ad with this pop up to suggest a customer

03:08.310 --> 03:14.040
to subscribe to the premium plan well he's going to be offering special deal like three months free

03:14.340 --> 03:19.380
for three months are going to be free or the first six months are going to be free or or I don't know

03:19.380 --> 03:26.180
you know if you subscribe the premium plan well you'll get a $100 free gift card or something like that.

03:26.190 --> 03:29.670
You know there's going to be a special deal for each of the strategies.

03:29.670 --> 03:34.680
So you know very different strategies with each time different forms different packages different ads

03:34.710 --> 03:36.060
different special deals.

03:36.120 --> 03:39.640
And one of these strategies will be of course the best.

03:39.690 --> 03:47.720
Like one of these strategies has the best conversion rate and the goal of Tums and sampling is to find

03:47.910 --> 03:51.460
which of these strategies has the best conversion rate that is.

03:51.660 --> 03:57.290
Which of these strategies will convert the most customers to subscribe to the premium plan.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.060
All right.

03:58.140 --> 04:02.900
And then now that we did this well let's define the environment.

04:03.030 --> 04:04.080
So let's go back here.

04:04.110 --> 04:09.980
And as you can see the environment here is now composed of only actions and words.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.270
That's how it is for the not been the problem.

04:13.380 --> 04:14.720
And let me explain why.

04:14.970 --> 04:16.590
So how are we going to do that.

04:16.590 --> 04:22.140
Well first the first important thing to understand is that we're going to do online learning that is

04:22.140 --> 04:26.510
that we're going to experiment with these nine strategies here.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.360
Customer by customer.

04:28.620 --> 04:31.450
So let's start with the beginning at the beginning.

04:31.500 --> 04:37.140
There is going to be a first customer who will connect to the Web site of this online retail business

04:37.140 --> 04:42.200
you know to explore the products or even to buy products that this customer has in mind.

04:42.600 --> 04:49.860
And as soon as he connects well we're going to deploy one of these nine strategies to attempt a conversion

04:49.920 --> 04:54.450
that is to try to convert this customer to subscribe to the premium plan.

04:54.480 --> 04:59.910
So at first we have no clue which of these strategies is the best so we're going to throw a strategy

05:00.030 --> 05:03.360
randomly let's say for example it strategy number one.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.980
So we're going to deploy it.

05:05.130 --> 05:09.600
And then the whole thing will happen know the whole process of pop up will appear or the ad will appear

05:09.600 --> 05:12.070
in his email and then whatever happens.

05:12.120 --> 05:15.960
But in the end the only thing that matters to us is the final result.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.830
Did the customer convert or did it not convert.

05:19.830 --> 05:23.850
If the customer convert it that is if subscribe to the premium plan.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.100
Well we will get one we wanted.

05:27.270 --> 05:30.670
And that's how the rewards are simply going to be defined here.

05:30.690 --> 05:32.120
We will get one we want.

05:32.130 --> 05:37.980
And if the customer doesn't convert that is if the customer doesn't subscribe to the premium plan we

05:37.980 --> 05:44.720
will get a zero reward for that specific strategy that was selected at first randomly.

05:44.770 --> 05:49.380
That is strategy one and that's it that's around that's actually a state.

05:49.380 --> 05:55.350
You know we can call it a state if you want a state or around it's just a customer connecting to this

05:55.460 --> 05:57.620
Web site of the online retail business.

05:57.810 --> 06:03.450
And we deploy a strategy then the process happens to try to convince him to subscribe to the premium

06:03.450 --> 06:03.920
plan.

06:04.050 --> 06:08.620
And in the end the customer convert or the customer does not convert.

06:08.790 --> 06:11.240
And if the customer converts we get one we want.

06:11.310 --> 06:17.850
And if the customer doesn't convert we get a zero reward and then we reiterate at the next round.

06:17.850 --> 06:23.180
A new customer will connect to the online retail business website will deploy a different strategy.

06:23.190 --> 06:28.080
Of course it will be that random this time but following the Thompson sampling algorithm will deploy

06:28.080 --> 06:31.820
a new strategy then this new customer will choose to convert or not.

06:31.860 --> 06:34.260
If he or she converts we'll get one word.

06:34.260 --> 06:38.460
If he or she doesn't convert we'll get a zero reward and that will be around them too.

06:38.640 --> 06:43.470
Then we'll come round them at three with a new customer connect into the online retail business then

06:43.470 --> 06:49.050
we'll deploy a new strategy that will be selected by the Tompson sampling algorithm and then the customer

06:49.050 --> 06:50.460
will choose to convert or not.

06:50.460 --> 06:55.320
If he or she converts we'll get one and if he or she doesn't convert We'll get to zero and the next

06:55.320 --> 07:00.750
round and the next round and over the rounds we'll repeat the same trial and error process.

07:00.840 --> 07:06.810
And of course we'll get the informations of all these won rewards we've received in the past rounds

07:07.050 --> 07:14.010
and all the zero reward because these are information that we will reintegrate into the Tompson something

07:14.040 --> 07:19.980
algorithm and that's how round by round it will return better selections of the strategies until it

07:19.980 --> 07:23.930
finds the strategy that has the highest conversion rate.

07:24.020 --> 07:28.830
We're going to see that with our own eyes because we're going to run our whole simulation and you're

07:28.830 --> 07:34.260
going to see you're going to be impressed by how fast and how efficiently it manages to find the best

07:34.260 --> 07:41.370
strategy that has the highest conversion rate and therefore very simply inside this environment.

07:41.490 --> 07:47.730
Well the states even if they're not really States as we saw them in Q2 earning or did you learn in the

07:47.730 --> 07:49.390
states are going to be simply the rounds.

07:49.490 --> 07:55.530
You know each round that is each customer connecting to the Web site is a state then the action is going

07:55.530 --> 08:03.450
to be of course well the selection of a strategy by Thompson simply to display to the user either on

08:03.450 --> 08:08.290
the Web site or in e-mail or by any other way than the process will happen.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.530
The customer will choose to convert or not.

08:10.530 --> 08:12.640
And finally that's when we define the word.

08:12.750 --> 08:15.100
If the customer converts we get a one word.

08:15.160 --> 08:20.420
If the customer doesn't convert and doesn't subscribe to premium plan we get as you where we work.

08:20.790 --> 08:21.300
And here we go.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.520
Congratulations.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.270
We just defined the environment.
