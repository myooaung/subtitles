Hello and welcome back to the course on artificial intelligence.

00:03.180 --> 00:08.180
In today's section we're tackling the topic of deep Q learning.

00:08.190 --> 00:11.150
So let's see how we're going to attack this in this section.

00:11.160 --> 00:17.220
We will learn a deep learning intuition the learning side of things so we go into separate deep learning

00:17.690 --> 00:20.790
the intuition behind it into two parts to learning and the acting.

00:20.790 --> 00:22.580
And we're going to have two trials in that.

00:22.590 --> 00:28.230
So first of all understand how the neural networks actually learn and how they update their weights

00:28.230 --> 00:33.920
based on what we are feeding them in and how the whole concept of learning works.

00:33.930 --> 00:37.920
How we're going to take that temporal difference concepts that we discuss in simple learning we're going

00:37.920 --> 00:44.130
to apply them into deep learning and then we're going to talk about how deep learning algorithm actually

00:44.130 --> 00:50.400
decide what action to take in what states we're going to talk about experience replay a very important

00:50.430 --> 00:56.370
addition on top of deep learning which actually enables deep you'll learn to read properly and you'll

00:56.370 --> 01:02.330
see why it's important from that Tauriel and then we're going to talk about action selection policies.

01:02.410 --> 01:11.130
We're going to talk about how deep kill earning agents are able to combine exploration with exploitation.

01:11.130 --> 01:15.930
So once they found something a good approach they can use that approach but also they need to explore

01:15.930 --> 01:18.780
so that they don't get stuck in a local maximum.

01:18.840 --> 01:24.600
And one more thing I wanted to mention about the section is it is highly beneficial if you have a look

01:24.600 --> 01:27.990
at an x number one artificial neural networks.

01:27.990 --> 01:33.540
So if you go and explore all those topics we've got some very powerful intuition tutorials prepared

01:33.540 --> 01:34.410
for you there.

01:34.590 --> 01:38.080
If you haven't done of course if you haven't done the deep learning course if you've done the discipline

01:38.100 --> 01:41.320
of course and you're you know all of these things and you can proceed with S..

01:41.430 --> 01:46.890
But if you want to get that additional knowledge about neural networks before you proceed with this

01:46.890 --> 01:51.960
part of the course this is highly advisable because it will help you understand exactly how neural networks

01:51.960 --> 01:58.170
work and why they're so powerful why we're leveraging them in this deep cool learning algorithm.

01:58.260 --> 02:03.240
And once you've refresh your knowledge or gain that knowledge on neural networks from that and then

02:03.240 --> 02:06.450
come back here and we will proceed with the pupillary.

02:06.570 --> 02:10.110
If you're pretty comfortable in neural networks then let's get straight into it.

02:10.110 --> 02:13.010
Let's start talking about deep learning intuition.

02:13.290 --> 02:15.380
And I look forward to seeing you on the first tutorial.

02:15.390 --> 02:16.840
Until then enjoy a.
