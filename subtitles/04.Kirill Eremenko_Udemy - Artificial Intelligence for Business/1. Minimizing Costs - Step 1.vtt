00:00.450 --> 00:02.750
Hello and welcome to part two.

00:02.820 --> 00:05.360
Minimizing the costs indeed.

00:05.490 --> 00:12.060
I remind that the main three applications of doing artificial intelligence for business is one optimizing

00:12.060 --> 00:19.650
the processes in a business to minimizing the cost and three maximizing the revenues we've already built

00:19.650 --> 00:20.690
in the previous part.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.520
And they that optimizes the processes.

00:23.610 --> 00:30.510
And now in this new part part two we will build a new AI and actually a more advanced AI that will minimize

00:30.510 --> 00:36.990
the cost of a different business and this different business will actually be about any business that

00:36.990 --> 00:38.580
has data centers.

00:38.640 --> 00:45.330
Because indeed in this case number two we will build any IDE to minimize the energy consumption in a

00:45.330 --> 00:52.890
server and we will do this with deep Q learning more advanced immoral than the one we built in the previous

00:52.890 --> 00:54.030
case study.

00:54.120 --> 01:00.160
And so why doing this you know minimizing the energy consumption in a server will minimize the cost.

01:00.210 --> 01:06.800
Well that's of course because the tech companies have tremendous cost coming from their data center.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.690
And these cuts come directly from the energy consumption and the different services.

01:11.700 --> 01:16.680
So if you're ready let's do this let's solve casted number two with deep.

01:16.680 --> 01:23.540
Q learning just a few words on deep learning deep learning is actually the model that was built by you

01:23.540 --> 01:27.750
know one of the top companies in the world today which is deep mind.

01:27.840 --> 01:35.170
They build the Deptula immoral or also called a dick U N D G network to minimize just as what we're

01:35.190 --> 01:41.670
going to do the energy consumption in Google data centers because actually that mind was acquired by

01:41.670 --> 01:47.790
Google with their dequeue when they managed to minimize energy consumption in Google's center and they

01:47.790 --> 01:53.530
were actually able to reduce Google's cooling bills by 40 percent.

01:53.550 --> 02:00.630
So if you think about the huge amount of data centers Google has we can have a pretty good idea of the

02:00.630 --> 02:07.350
tremendous amount of money maybe in billions of dollars that Google saved by reducing the energy related

02:07.350 --> 02:09.170
costs in their business.

02:09.330 --> 02:15.180
So there was a huge accomplishment in this field of artificial intelligence for business.

02:15.660 --> 02:21.060
And before we started the case study I just want to say two important things first.

02:21.150 --> 02:26.430
This is a special case study but the whole framework that were going to do you know that were going

02:26.430 --> 02:33.210
to build is totally adaptable to any other businesses because you know I will explain what the change.

02:33.270 --> 02:39.780
I will give the general framework of how to build an AI with deep Guler and to accomplish a certain

02:39.780 --> 02:42.620
goal which is here to minimize the costs.

02:42.630 --> 02:47.460
So if you want to apply what were going to do to your business or your work well you will only have

02:47.460 --> 02:53.460
to change a few parameters and a few lines of code too you know defined differently the different components

02:53.730 --> 02:56.860
of the environment such as how you define the reward.

02:57.030 --> 03:03.850
And now the second point thing that I would like to say is that this case study Number two is huge.

03:03.870 --> 03:10.350
This is a huge case study will have something around 500 lines of code and we will code everything together

03:10.470 --> 03:16.200
from scratch you know step by step as usual but I will not give you some code and say this is how it's

03:16.200 --> 03:16.770
done.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.430
No we will build everything together.

03:19.670 --> 03:25.890
But the downside of this is that you will need a lot of energy a lot of focus and a bit of passion but

03:25.890 --> 03:32.190
I promise you that after completing this huge case study well you will know everything about defining

03:32.280 --> 03:38.130
a real world environment to build a powerful artificial intelligence to solve a real world business

03:38.130 --> 03:42.770
problem which you will be able to adapt to many other businesses.

03:43.020 --> 03:43.620
All right.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.120
Thats the two important things.

03:45.120 --> 03:49.980
I just thought it was important for you to know and as far as I'm concerned on my side I will do my

03:49.980 --> 03:56.610
best to always go straight to the point because keep in mind that you know only have the video tutorials

03:56.940 --> 04:03.090
but you also have the book and here is the part 2 of the book minimizing the cost containing the whole

04:03.180 --> 04:03.920
case study.

04:04.230 --> 04:07.120
And there is much more detail to explain in the book.

04:07.140 --> 04:13.380
So as soon as you don't understand something don't worry go to the book and you'll find all the explanations

04:13.800 --> 04:17.680
I'm going to quickly walk through this part of this book in the first part.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.740
We define the problem to solve.

04:19.740 --> 04:21.780
We define the environment here.

04:21.780 --> 04:27.900
We get the assumptions that I'm going to explain soon Mr. Tauriel here I explain again the overall functioning

04:27.990 --> 04:29.640
to make sure everybody understands.

04:29.850 --> 04:35.820
Then of course as for every artificial intelligence we define the state we define the actions we define

04:35.820 --> 04:36.630
the word.

04:36.840 --> 04:43.470
And here we have a final simulation example which you will see will be very helpful for us to build

04:43.620 --> 04:46.770
not only the environment but also the training.

04:46.770 --> 04:47.610
And then what.

04:47.670 --> 04:50.530
Then I explain the whole AI AI solution.

04:50.580 --> 04:57.480
Here you have a couple of explanations given the intuition of what is dequeue learning and we will actually

04:57.480 --> 04:59.680
build the advanced version of.

04:59.760 --> 05:06.180
Because we will integrate what is called experience replay which improves the moral Kiril will explain

05:06.180 --> 05:12.170
all this and his intuition lectures and then you'll find the whole graphics of the brain.

05:12.170 --> 05:17.360
This is the brain we will build you know the brain of our AI that will make the predictions.

05:17.370 --> 05:24.120
This is the artificial neural network that is fully connected and which you will see we will build very

05:24.180 --> 05:25.990
easily with cameras.

05:26.230 --> 05:30.550
And here we have this very useful page giving you the whole dequeue learning algorithm.

05:30.690 --> 05:36.420
And then of course in the next pages I provide the whole implementation explains code sections by code

05:36.420 --> 05:37.510
sections.

05:37.530 --> 05:38.130
All right.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.550
So let's go back to our slides and let's get into this case study.
