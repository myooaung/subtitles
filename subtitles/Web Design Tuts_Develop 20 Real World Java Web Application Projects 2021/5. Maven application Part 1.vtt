00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:14.130
In previous videos, I already created that barbed and everything related to the fact that any close

2
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.330
anything and everything, so that's where you and which is basically 4:32.

3
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.490
So let us create one 17.

4
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.200
So we're lending people from your.

5
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.150
Let me create one new project I'm using here again engaged.

6
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.130
I've previously used.

7
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.590
It means to show that part will get married.

8
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.190
Choose your team, so I'm using this 16 for general manager Typekit.

9
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.270
So we decided to wait for something.

10
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.820
It will take those decades, and I don't think you.

11
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.010
Once this is done, we need to archive

12
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.620
it will for continued selling.

13
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.010
So me quote here.

14
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.030
Work needs as we project.

15
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:34.030
Samantha, you can finish, so it will be a new project for me.

16
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.840
So wait for something, it will automatically create a project so late it's building project.

17
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.830
Let's see why we should use Mallinson.

18
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:51.040
So this for all the Java class, because I already told you in the Mavin in merger control.

19
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.240
I don't want to use that dependencies directly.

20
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.850
So what is their dependency dependency?

21
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.210
Just basically connecting some between two classes?

22
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.580
I don't want to perform that duty.

23
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.200
Narrative design patterns that I used to remove the dependencies in the code, which is basically what

24
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.250
is in the control and they make it easier and.

25
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.290
He is for maintaining and each and every part, so for that purpose.

26
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.490
I prefer winning simple glass, simply it with additionally, which is often there, then.

27
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.860
Our booted teams will that in play at this, and I must say that this the new year, so you going to

28
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:49.560
hear the result directly dependency and coupling dependency Blakely's, if there is one error in employee

29
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.730
class, then added I could even address class also.

30
00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.020
So to remove this, what we require, we require IOC.

31
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.950
So here what I'm doing, I'm that's a complete faithfulness.

32
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.970
We cannot lose that eight months.

33
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.820
We cannot lose.

34
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.900
That wants easy.

35
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:18.870
So the IOC inversion of control IOC makes or loosely coupled such as there is no need to modify sport

36
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.220
or logical environment if we have a an employee as we are using this, not it's not at all directly

37
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.240
dependent to employee is dependent on this address.

38
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.370
So it's loosely coupled.

39
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.230
So in springtime work, it's mostly used, but I'm using here for my when.

40
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.190
Also, I'm not using the spring framework, but that's a simple file or annotations I'm going to create

41
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.260
here, and I'm going to add it directly.

42
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.770
So advantageous on the wind incineration is basically adding that dependencies in similes, its mix

43
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.410
quotes and it's easy to maintain and makes code easy to test and everything.

44
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.990
So there are different advantages opposed.

45
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.440
So there are predefined templates, hibernates Jibia.

46
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.760
Everything in Mavin that's loosely Kopel, and it is easily easy to test also.

47
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.610
So that's all it is.

48
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.780
So let's move to the irony part.

49
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.930
So currently, you can take it smoking.

50
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.690
And it will create need for some files, so this my phone protects women.

51
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.400
And this is my assertion.

52
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.440
So to see you having to try things in your life and resources and fund autism and having some excitement

53
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.070
for it, so.

54
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.700
Let me add some dependency, so currently there are no dependencies here.

55
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.280
So we need to perform some dependencies and adding some dependencies also there.

56
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:06.600
So adding independence is really easy to this disdaining who are just.

57
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:19.880
Comedy movies get only jokes, so there is one big board game for Java is one cool artifact.

58
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.980
Yeah, so it's taking time to Nixon as this is very unusual.

59
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.180
My system is ticking low, so it be big time to perform every action

60
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.570
movie for some time to compile these and everything.

61
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.580
So it's again indexing, so.

62
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.520
Complete, let me like this, only to conclude this, so.

63
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.460
People.

64
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.080
Dependency.

65
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.920
And this trickle down to the ground using everything.

66
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.860
So you will hear that dependencies adding there.

67
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.220
So while this is working.

68
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.830
So my suggestion is wait for some after developing this part.

69
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.960
So because it's adding the dependencies, so it's taking time to perform, these actions now will do

70
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.750
the job they will string and create here one and together.

71
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.720
Which is basically our app.

72
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.440
I'm going to post on the.

73
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.470
So right click on this, you mean a sassy mean.

74
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.910
You can go directly to the view of packets or packages your packages, you can directly access this

75
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.390
gala.

76
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.650
So it's taking time to perform.

77
00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.100
So, OK, it's not analyzing click here, right click go to this.

78
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:08.150
Oh, if you found Abdul job, I believe clear no need to create this, but I haven't found this, so

79
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.380
I'm looking here at.

80
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:18.890
Take with a friend, whether this is working or not, it is a simple thing you can put on.

81
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:27.290
He is the input because, as you know, he has been promised a deployment.

82
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.050
It's time to move on.

83
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.430
Not a lot, but in Alan.

84
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:46.660
Hello.

85
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.930
So that's the thing, I'm going to bring that.

86
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.890
Well, let me check there and there this is I on this.

87
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:05.740
So this thing that Iran is in, it is.

88
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.390
This is already personal for me.

89
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.580
No, let me run this.

90
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.880
It is running.

91
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.650
Draining training will build this are.

92
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:32.500
So I'm not going to create you waiting because I told you I was going to take more pain, so little

93
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.580
time constraint and do some files, and then we'll take that part.

94
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.500
Directly here.

95
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.890
So, lady, this is loading.

96
00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.680
It's building resilience building.

97
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.960
So what is hitting its footprint?

98
00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.340
Hello.

99
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:07.280
Nothing to drink and no one for me, as you can see you tell, so your programming note and it's only

100
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.320
be required to use this one.

101
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.970
Now we are going to perform or I'm going to work on another application.

102
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.070
So our team is very important.

103
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.390
Work is first.

104
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.420
We need to list our networking devices.

105
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.830
What do you do about inadvertently?

106
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:29.860
Vs. is basically a wooden networking interface, which is going to perform here?

107
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:40.780
So first thing I need to mention here is A. So you can you can check here everything we have done,

108
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.910
but everything so pick can.

109
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.290
Network interview, signing prevention.

110
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.980
So what are you going to do it and just being the goal here?

111
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.170
You can put your stop.

112
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.520
No hope we can use this.

113
00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:06.730
You can use this as a device device is equal to my device is currently not because it's not having anything.

114
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:22.960
So pick up is it comes with very convenient method for listening, so I will put your greetings to basically

115
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.240
to capture everything in networking devices.

116
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.790
So what I'm going to do is it's a game with one beautiful method.

117
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:38.710
We can see which invisibly in that if selector, which is going to select intelligently over everything.

118
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:48.530
So you shouldn't you strike cricket you can't catch already because so you should.

119
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:58.000
S. He is still on a not in.

120
00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.510
And then he.

121
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:11.150
So what I'm going to do here, I'm going to add that because, you know, the device is equal to one

122
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:18.980
beautiful thing is in life selector, new knife selector.

123
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:28.970
We've selected he's going to take select the networking, does select networking types, I have them

124
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.350
because it will assign to that part of this part.

125
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.180
This system brought out.

126
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.090
Not.

127
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.290
But in planning for India, I'm going to print my.

128
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.390
Putting.

129
00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:57.940
Need the work?

130
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.900
Interface and wanted to map interface, so.

131
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.010
And consistently US device plus.

132
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.930
What is Medivation vision?

133
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.120
So it can bring this?

134
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.460
And let me run this application.

135
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:32.820
So let me show you how it will intelligently bring select manipulation so it will go through every networking

136
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.020
available on my part and it will select that in light of selecting.

137
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.600
So it's currently building.

138
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:47.300
As you can see.

139
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.730
So.

140
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.610
It will take time to perform every action.

141
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.620
Now, let us consider why this is putting more release, not wanting to hurt anybody.

142
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:08.270
So.

143
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.250
Begin to clear this static binder.

144
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:19.490
Our application is not connected to any static binder.

145
00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:27.710
So for that purpose, space sigmoidal cannot be found to the Kepler body.

146
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.520
So for that purpose, we need to implement the blue cap also.

147
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:32.990
So?

148
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:42.720
For this, you need to develop some embedded dependencies or add some embedded dependencies that.

149
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:57.920
So.

150
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.830
Let me work on some.

151
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.360
Team here, which is basically getting it only wastes, which I forgot, actually.

152
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:16.400
So before printing this, let me live after this call.

153
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.870
Yeah, that's very correct.

154
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:26.720
I'm not saying this is wrong, but we haven't mentioned something so.

155
00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.160
Let me make this point.

156
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.830
For work, you mentioned some parts here.

157
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.440
So this is what network interface and let me.

158
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:01.520
And at this, I.

159
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:09.810
Then in these public debates, OK, now remember, this device is not working.

160
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.490
So for that purpose, we need one thing here.

161
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.420
So now what I changed.

162
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.050
I created this great codebase I'm using here.

163
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:38.130
Now, let's check whether it's bleeding or not, because specific model is not going to come here directly.

164
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:55.600
So currently, this is not if you want to take, you can take this part.

165
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.660
And you can check for the class port botany of the team.

166
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:08.120
So we need to add some more dependencies.

167
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.050
So.

168
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.260
We are in tune with this.

169
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.270
Now, let me add one more dependency.

170
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:42.770
So it is taking time to load everything in and this again.

171
00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:01.860
This is going to be building, so it will take time to be and it will give me the current networking

172
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.800
devices and everything on my network.

173
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:16.290
So it's downloading the dependencies, doing the on resolving the matter independently.

174
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:26.140
So there may be some time to perform this, but it will vote if you want, which you have to use this

175
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.060
on board as it is here.

176
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:43.910
It's resolving my bargaining, and I'm currently.

177
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:53.300
Including the sinking, the port, as you can see, it's indexing, so letting me in for their part,

178
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.310
I'm going to tell you how we can perform this.
