1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:09,590
So we are going to start a new project, which is basically Java email application, and you can see

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,990
immune system, which is already planning just being sold.

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:24,150
So if you know there are different email APIs to send e-mail, which is basically based email, I'm

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,530
going to send you two for that purpose.

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,020
I'm going to use different protocols, some APIs which are really stable at the moment.

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:40,020
So sometimes you are going to develop some bigger way back for a company or country one company, which

7
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:47,130
means that they are having some administrative error for each and every employee, but to send e-mail

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,930
in that condition.

9
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,880
You can create some microservices for that purpose.

10
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:00,810
So it's not exactly microservices, and I'm just going to replace server deployment from just application.

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,410
So this is it our project title, which is basically Java email application.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,610
So the project name change, basically we're going to develop email system Hussain and receive emails

13
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,240
using Java.

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,710
So receiving messages quite a of job while doing this because of I'm going to use your Gmail as my media

15
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:28,770
server.

16
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:37,560
So there may be some authentication error, some things so we can say, Oh, there may be some handshake

17
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,450
SSL errors.

18
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,420
So we need to recover from that.

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,290
Issuing mail is not a very tough job, but it's very complex.

20
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,790
By learning, using Gmail because it's not very open source, we actually feel you can try and other

21
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,000
means.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,950
It's also relevant and there are different.

23
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,800
So much for that purpose.

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,980
My assertion uses I'm going with German because it's very simple.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,070
And what if you want to use 100 percent open source mail and you can find everything code you can use

26
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:13,920
transdermal on ProtonMail also, which is 100 percent open source mail systems.

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,330
So you can do that or if you want to use another, you can use your own individual.

28
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,130
If you have, you can use that also for this deployment.

29
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,990
So our project team, the immune system to send and as you mentioned, first ask is sending in a present.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,540
We will see how we can receive automated shootings, hours of new technology and not using your personal

31
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,680
technology and using Java as my munising backing as it's already planning on.

32
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:49,670
So I'm using your disposal for printing part, or we can say, efficient for printing bar.

33
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,880
So step software development.

34
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,630
This project set up how we are going to set up our project first and different rules.

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,780
We are going to use your word, the dependency injection, everything I've can hear.

36
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,860
Then some Java basics mortgage today, some TV protocol here.

37
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,400
Then what we it is, we May six Java.

38
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,120
So less dependency related application and deployment on this, or what is the final straw?

39
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,750
So that's it about our project aim and everything.

40
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,100
So let us see application requirements.

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,270
GCP pages.

42
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:29,120
Finally, just be here, I mean, genuinely just images, but consider I am oh accessing the and also

43
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,740
see us as fallible move stuff I used to create some of us for this human.

44
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,750
Sending mail is very easy.

45
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,560
And we to create some Java libraries I'm going to use here.

46
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,080
Then Gmail account, you should.

47
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,450
How do you e-mail account or any here seem to be somewhere you have permission is.

48
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,130
I will tell your client since you needed that then job.

49
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,500
Six to create classes and everything you need to understand that Java Oops concepts object oriented

50
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,990
programming themselves because I'm not considering only one class to read or saying that I'm to create

51
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:09,140
some different classes and I'm going to use some oops concepts here and some software deployment concepts.

52
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,360
Why I'm doing server deployment concepts Deployment of control is very easy task for it.

53
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,790
But you should understand well, when developing, you may get it this so you still understand what

54
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,480
it is.

55
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,180
Then JDK 16 and some of my independence is also we are going to use.

56
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,370
I am referring principally because it's very useful ID.

57
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,230
By injecting dependency, it will automatically assume that mining dependencies and everything.

58
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,680
If you comfortable with that idea, you can proceed with that idea.

59
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,340
But I'm consulting with individual differently.

60
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,870
The last few server or conjectural.

61
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:51,530
I've definitely seen that bomb exploded because you can change your password directly of.

62
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:58,730
So no need to post it again and again for changing this without mentioning the domain on that server,

63
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,120
you can easily put two buttons on.

64
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,220
So these are the application requirements.

65
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,000
So let us see what are the functional requirements.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,570
So what is the difference between application requirements?

67
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:14,480
Application just for development, but functional requirements are useful to create some classes, everything.

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,360
So I'm not going very deep in that part, but you're the what are the functional requirements?

69
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:29,270
So just be pages and documents literally front, I'm creating here and then I'm not here using any database

70
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,680
to store such emails.

71
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,500
But in real life, what happens?

72
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:41,720
Actually, all that emails that we saw them so well back in my database to store their emails in their

73
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,320
database.

74
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,540
I am not using this because this is very pragmatic considering an email application.

75
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:54,860
If you want to create a database, also, you can go with that or you can develop on cloud also like

76
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,320
Google Cloud or Amazon.com.

77
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,980
There are different solutions available on the internet.

78
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,190
You can use more and what do you do for that database consideration?

79
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,830
Because email is not the biggest big.

80
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:12,440
There are files on, so there are images, so you can use that moment because it's very advanced database.

81
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:19,490
So for my purpose, I'm consuming only text and everything here, so I'm not using any database you

82
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,630
GSP page or these pages basically when sending ends and mail post.

83
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,360
Then connecting that logic.

84
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,960
It is a country and having some serious look at business, subject body of me, everything.

85
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:44,290
You can use with GamesBeat also, in addition, I need some serious facing, some water for injuries

86
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,400
before being template for receiving mail.

87
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:53,720
Then your programs, which is basically your main logic behind us sending authentication by handshaking,

88
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,520
but I'm going to use your access to an email service Java program.

89
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:04,490
Having that focus, but here I am using Gmail because it's very easy to create that part.

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,010
And similarly, seeing films printing in Chrome console, you can do that part also.

91
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,200
So that's it about how we are proceeding with the functional requirements.

92
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,910
So let's see, how are we can set up our project for us?

93
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,730
So let me go to my ad first and let me configure this first.

94
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,110
OK, so this is my individual idea.

95
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,480
You can change the front end part also here.

96
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:37,880
So.

97
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,890
Let me ask this, because.

98
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,440
Customers.

99
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:57,690
So this is my idea of on Facebook, you can see here you can choose the default team, say everything

100
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:57,960
here.

101
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,950
Well, I say blue light team.

102
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:10,620
So I hear you and see your previous projects, if you already could not even take care planting.

103
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,960
I'm using your endangered limitation.

104
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,280
Well, you can use community additional going to know who it is.

105
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,040
And there are plug ins and everything here before dealing with anything.

106
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,280
Let me tell you.

107
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,520
Oh, goodness.

108
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,420
Yet I'm specifying again and again, which are very important here.

109
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:38,850
First is download Smart Tomcat, which is HomeKit Server Plugin, which is very useful and right to

110
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,140
download this material.

111
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:49,860
It's not community preferred, but it's very useful when developing this and my event, which is already

112
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,210
developed.

113
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,950
But try to, if you installed already, try to update this plugin, which is we are going to use.

114
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,480
So just go to projects.

115
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:05,800
When you go to the projects, you can check your new projects, click on new projects.

116
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,690
So do 16 loan for me, it will take time to.

117
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:12,960
But this.

118
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,350
So it will be interesting to.

119
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:39,260
Oh, so as you can see previously, you can see this, well, not the previous employer before you can

120
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,060
take this window and then go to the Java Enterprise if you are using.

121
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,150
So not only 20 different communities, and you cannot see these things.

122
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,420
So just go with Java and you're going to add it later that part.

123
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,660
But my preference, if you're using this, you are going to create Java internalization.

124
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,260
Give the name here.

125
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,220
So.

126
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,460
Insisting on speaking for me.

127
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,200
So some you will face these errors.

128
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,440
I looking at this, OK, so the.

129
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,590
Let me give you the name as Evelyn.

130
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,910
But be patient.

131
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:47,720
Email application, you know, location, then verb application, if you cannot see any server, no

132
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,150
application server, go to new.

133
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:59,410
And to hear from get server and directly, I'll let no, don't get nine point 4.8 status symbol.

134
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:08,860
And you can use that click here Réplication or Tufnell in two language della G-Unit and James Grootboom,

135
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,520
as you would.

136
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,400
So I'm sitting here.

137
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,310
You mean 16 percent even to the knee.

138
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:22,800
So I'm using to think it will automatically detect, if not, you have to act the dedication you got

139
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,730
to do with this.

140
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,950
So.

141
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,600
OK.

142
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,220
It will take time to know that, okay, I know it's loaded.

143
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,480
Click next.

144
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,410
It will ensure that our aid even to this only because after this, Jakarta has started, so this index

145
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:44,890
is different.

146
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,030
Time is near to Java.

147
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,020
It wasn't.

148
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,730
Click here we proclaim on what you can do is instead of putting the weight profile, you can use it

149
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,830
at this web socket and the subject.

150
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,260
So that said, we are going to do this.

151
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,610
You know this on?

152
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,530
Not anything, not we are doing this here.

153
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,350
You can use your pin validation also, but it's not required.

154
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,900
Looking at your profile, you can see everything there.

155
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,240
But.

156
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:19,740
And so need external Web services also, if you want to add, you can add, but I'm adding you.

157
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,940
Don't add anything.

158
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,190
Link think.

159
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:35,210
So it will create default conduct for you with some index dog days if you find some solid funds.

160
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:42,440
So you are going to believe that phrase because these are not index orders, be as it is, but another

161
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:42,670
points.

162
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,850
We are going to delete that.

163
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,200
So.

164
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:53,920
This is all we can say about the project, so it will automatically create the system level project

165
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,180
as your requirements.

166
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:04,270
Sometimes it may take time because of some loading issues and everything because it's very useful and

167
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,260
it's takes time sometimes to develop everything.

168
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,790
So now it's loading.

169
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,820
It's preparing what works best for me.

170
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,470
So wait for some time.

171
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,110
It will automatically get written for me.

172
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:32,980
So as you can see, it's processing for pollution, which is we are going to need that because we are

173
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,990
not required for that purpose.

174
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:41,270
So we just require in these largest feed and solar plants, which are I'm going to create in the next

175
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:41,710
two billion.

176
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,910
But in this trial, I'm just focusing on the setup.

177
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,760
We are going to set up and some solid concepts also.

178
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,960
So let me tell you, what is the phone vortex?

179
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:01,550
This is a dependency injection, I'm using your mavin as my colleague Mark, and I'm using mine.

180
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,470
So beautiful thing off moment.

181
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,070
I don't regret any of it.

182
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:11,690
We are going to fully use that phrase through everything.

183
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,060
As you can see, this is my loaded.

184
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,900
And you can see here my main concern.

185
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,910
So let me minimize this part.

186
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,990
So this meaning don't use consumables.

187
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,740
Oh, and this is my hello solely.

188
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:32,390
So this package and here you can see, is that a scene if you go to these are the museum.

189
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,330
If I mean, look, that could just mean you can not see because it's currently loaded and mixing everything.

190
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:45,030
But if I go to Java, you can see in the compound, which is basically application park, you can see

191
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,340
this email and everything.

192
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,350
Oh, so email application and everything.

193
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:57,330
So I'm going to believe this later because I'm not interested in that part and then follow all the web

194
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,140
containing part.

195
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,700
So it's importing all the mounting gear.

196
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,760
Because no one is just leaving dependency injection won't dependency as a in the pond or examined,

197
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,720
and it will create everything for.

198
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,910
So indexing, as you can see, you know, once it's loading.

199
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,450
It will default polygamy.

200
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,000
So, ladies, loading, it's not loading.

201
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,810
Just go to your Tomcat and elite configuration.

202
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,300
This is the running configuration.

203
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,450
So hope you can see this.

204
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,520
So I did this file.

205
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,000
Then.

206
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,410
He deployed to redeploy.

207
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,580
If you want to change, I'm going to be dangerous.

208
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,460
So I am doing you because if it is caused by my service, so I'm going to change this.

209
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,250
I'm going to need apply here.

210
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:05,230
So as you can see, this planet is and that you are in the danger.

211
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,970
If you want to reject your application, is there any more innocuous, always correct or no?

212
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,400
Just click here then.

213
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,570
So now it's indexing, it will decline to suit analyzing.

214
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,120
Oh, so cute.

215
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,950
And so it started building.

216
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:33,100
So in this council, which is basically the download council, you can see that he's executing and incident

217
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,430
in the moment dependencies.

218
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,780
So while doing this, William does let us see what they do.

219
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,120
So as you can see, these are the property of Marvin, and this is the dependencies is asking, like

220
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,380
Java XO Ltd.

221
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,020
So I haven't mentioned any Java.

222
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,870
No, Tim here.

223
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,550
I just add this.

224
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,630
I mean dependency.

225
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:59,740
So it will take only dependency from the internet and it will mean you mean this GW is Jupiter files

226
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,740
also tasking.

227
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,350
So it's doing all these things on their own in the Mavin.

228
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:14,030
So I am using your my been because of these, because I don't want to download energy to play specifically,

229
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,320
John.

230
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,350
I do love this.

231
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:24,920
I can just do this bond auction so more people can use it here while developing these such cases as

232
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,500
initially.

233
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:31,040
Well, this is doing one regression me default from system to system like someone is using on other

234
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,650
words, and I'm using another way, so it will be useful for developing this part also.

235
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,500
So currently it's building and it will take time to build everything but.

236
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,000
Will this complete now you can build this conflict successfully, so for the first time building, it

237
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,120
will take time after that, it will not take time to build it because we are just adding the files so

238
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,970
it will compile the building next some one minute.

239
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:00,650
And is it going?

240
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:07,510
So as we're going to see and if we go to the service currently, it is not started, but it's building

241
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:07,670
on.

242
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,220
So for the first time building, it will take time.

243
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,770
Well, after that, it won't take time at all for the building focus.

244
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,660
So as you can see, it's finished now.

245
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,220
I'm going to do the service and it's running and its output is going.

246
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:40,060
So it's creating everything it's of being able to and or sometimes you may get some news.

247
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,360
Not any of the team.

248
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:49,390
You just try to stick and wait for something to deploy everything, as you can see connected.

249
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,220
This is what we do electromagnetically creates over for me.

250
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,110
So wait for something it will automatically deploy server for.

251
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:04,620
So as you can see, these are the starting over again, she these are the local news these.

252
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,160
And now you can see these are gorgeous.

253
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,620
This is the GST page for me.

254
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,390
And if I click, Hello, solid.

255
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,430
I can go to this hello, hello, world junior, basically my soldier.

256
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,880
So my so.

257
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,020
So what is running now?

258
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:25,930
Let me.

259
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:35,640
Will all this over, so as good as this thing looks on my system, sometimes it may take time to.

260
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,730
This needs to be on board.

261
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,840
And now I'm what I'm going to make it easier.

262
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:51,300
You can do this pretty little and you can clear out this disputes when it is.

263
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,380
Because there's no more required to.

264
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,180
Forest Service.

265
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:05,540
And you're going to delete this common good example, also seen for videos, and we're dying in degradation

266
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,300
and hope you understand this part.

267
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,840
I mean, even the basic stuff, so let's everything.

268
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:16,920
So in the next videos, let us also consider some this dependency injection.

269
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,060
Also, I read a few.

270
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:18,840
Thank you.
