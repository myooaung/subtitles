1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,060
So when I go read some part of you, if you closely look, I created different things.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:15,750
First, I created one employee service as an interface, which is passing the list with quite some data

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,310
that employees to employees and some fingerprint reader.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,270
It's just for page sorting files and everything is going to create sorting the fields and everything.

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,300
I created a page employee as my another list.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:37,060
In this, I created one model thing, which is purely based on DARPA, which is going to create columns

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,690
and everything.

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,810
Toward things like creating this, obviously is basically this is the interface, and to implement implementing

9
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,260
the class, I created one service.

10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,950
I mentioned one service.

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,950
It's very easy to do.

12
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,540
I mentioned some of the wired things and I'm putting in the list and I'm going to create that.

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,760
I'm creating auto generated.

14
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,560
So that just object oriented thing I created with some existing parts.

15
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,260
This is very important.

16
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,630
I'm well descending in the descending order.

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,580
I'm creating that quilt.

18
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,710
I created one repository to store the cashier files, and I'm using this.

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:22,330
So if you close and look, I already created one controller part in the controller, I'm going to mention

20
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:30,090
one class name as the employee controller to control the employee files.

21
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,030
So.

22
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,840
Let me mention employee controller.

23
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:45,120
So this is the main team which is going to handle the backend and featuring the data it's going to create,

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,190
it's going to excuse the editing part.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,370
So now it's let me mention the controller in the spring framework that is defaulting, which is basically

26
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,160
the controller again on the way.

27
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,290
It's very important to not create a manual connection, always.

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,950
We can mention the team then, but I would.

29
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,830
I need to mention service to employees.

30
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,220
So this I need to be here.

31
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,060
I'm going to mention employee service.

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,130
Two employees, so you saw it will access that employee service director.

33
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,910
Now I need to display.

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:41,560
I need what I need to do, display a list of employees that what are you going to sue Ford it all for

35
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,480
data or part of a statement by learning to display all the things?

36
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,410
So for that was I need to create one mapping paintings so it's easy to get my.

37
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,900
Because it might be.

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:19,250
So wide screen, the error is because create an additional human being and a memory.

39
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,960
Or I haven't added the great mapping dependency, so you need to access that dependency.

40
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:36,050
Let me show you it's very easy, and if your dependency is not added to here and out of my own dependency

41
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,160
in this, it will search for the tapping and click here and.

42
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,490
That you need to perform.

43
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,420
So wait for some time.

44
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,130
It will.

45
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,290
And my independency for you, which is basically the get mapping.

46
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,130
As you can see, it's resolving my dependency part.

47
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,090
Ignoring this, I'm going to create for my.

48
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,060
Is basically the destroying.

49
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,940
View home page, which is basically home page view.

50
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,110
As the name suggests.

51
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,050
Model.

52
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,370
Molly, I'm OK.

53
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,530
So it's me asking you to order dental to get that nothing bar.

54
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,540
So what we can do is just start to optimize the imports.

55
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,870
So that's it.

56
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,100
I need to mention here.

57
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,320
This is basically my meter, which is going to perform this new morality.

58
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,850
So default page is one basically page.

59
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:47,610
One.

60
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,820
So in this, I need to mention that you done.

61
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,000
And.

62
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,540
Basically, I need to mention that Beijing didn't think.

63
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,860
One, which is basically my one first name as my defaulting.

64
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,090
It should be all synchronized or you can say, Oh, ski park and we're going to in the morning.

65
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,410
No, you didn't ask me what is is so.

66
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,750
It's asking me to create the condition.

67
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,830
But the thing is, I already created creating.

68
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,860
Somewhere.

69
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,780
Let me check with OK.

70
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,730
I need to mention this one.

71
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,590
And the thing is.

72
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,610
I need to implement and do something.

73
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,530
So let us take wide the error because.

74
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,800
Newt, we will check it later.

75
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,540
The main, I think, is Memorial, So.

76
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,720
Let me explore.

77
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,120
Let me move on to.

78
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,990
It's accessing everything, but it's not accessing these unbelievably friendly things, right?

79
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,130
It's obviously not cheap, is it any?

80
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,380
OK, we will find find that little park.

81
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,260
So maybe there is one error with.

82
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,200
Mapping part of the energy.

83
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,390
So we will check it later.

84
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:35,690
So we created one mapping for the basic mapping, so it's not really complicated editing, I guess.

85
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,010
So it's just creating a mapping and it's creating one mapping part.

86
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:48,280
So what is creating is basically it's creating different things.

87
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,300
So let me do one thing.

88
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,980
Let me.

89
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,470
Divide this young woman, if Alexis is just.

90
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,780
Let me mention this as this and.

91
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,520
I guess this employee controller is basically the.

92
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,520
No, it's not that far.

93
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,900
It's not guilty for it on this.

94
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,710
OK, OK.

95
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,230
In the later part, we need to create one better than defaulting, so.

96
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,020
No need to.

97
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,310
What do you what do you see?

98
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,330
So in a similar way, I'm going to create different, different mapping system.

99
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,390
So let me show you what I'm going to do.

100
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,950
So as you can see, I created this part.

101
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,970
Already and is do.

102
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:43,130
Important job one, don't you do not start informed everything, OK?

103
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,720
No, no, we created this.

104
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,440
So let me tell you what I'm going to do, what I'm doing here, so I'm just mentioning you one paid

105
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,100
for one.

106
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,090
Our food first name with the ask you directly.

107
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:03,800
This model show new employer form two showing the new employee form that this employee with the model,

108
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,070
then same employee.

109
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:11,300
So these are my opinion bootstrapping methods like that you're doing so if you want to check, you can

110
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,010
put your own insert also to check whether you can or to.

111
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,570
While dependency, you can add and you can check everything in the generation generation part.

112
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:28,100
But let me tell you, this is for the ID purposes, then delete employee again, listing then pages

113
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,170
for the paging part and all letters those.

114
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,920
So in the later part, I'm going to create one extremely pages.

115
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:41,780
And after that, I'm going to show you how you can set up fluster database and that you can implement

116
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,000
that database in your application.

117
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,620
Hope we understand.

118
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,430
Thank you.

119
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,290
This is just a controller part which is accessing the controllers.

120
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,560
If you go to Old Insert.

121
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:57,350
Also, you can take your device dependencies with different, different dependencies, staff, scheduler

122
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,190
and everything.

123
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,330
Or you can check so you can directly create him live.

124
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,360
Also here instead of executing again and again, so you can it.

125
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,690
So this is just a great mapping and shoot mapping methods and creating post mapping.

126
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,870
And can you do so for the delete employee and everything?

127
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,530
So you were looking this you can check here.

128
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,610
It's very easy.

129
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,960
You can perform.

130
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,370
Hope you understand.

131
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,240
Thank you.
