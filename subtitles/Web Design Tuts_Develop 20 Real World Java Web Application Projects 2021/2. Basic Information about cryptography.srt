1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,540
So in the first part, I discussed about hope build up in different techniques.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,400
So let us give you a site, I guess, cryptography that is more focused on Viber using Java.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:25,340
So again, I'm focusing on JVM getting JDK or instead of, if you know, they're not, not very well

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,510
or link present languages like Python or somebody working on that.

5
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:37,020
But JVM is login machine so we can perform different delivery techniques on nukes and we can check that

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,320
part.

7
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,990
But JVM is basically java legitimacy.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,310
It's not physically exist.

9
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,220
Java is made up of different parts.

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,240
JVM Guardian JDK JDK is basically Java development kit.

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,600
It consists of Guardian JVM jihadis who claim this is a new and different JVM.

12
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,920
It's runtime environment.

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,160
There are dependencies.

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,610
Libraries draw files that are different lengths in that division, and they will exist on your system.

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,240
It's just no good environment.

16
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,660
Other virtual machine, which loads calls verify schools, executes course on Excel.

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:16,410
And so that's a very powerful thing in Java or a digital machine.

18
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,060
So we need a requirement to change those parts of an existing configuration.

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,930
Never limits Java program, so that's very important.

20
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,150
And then this is basic things JDK, G80, JVM structure.

21
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,050
This is my JVM if I this.

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,140
So in this.

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,730
And so this is basically in Bagram, then.

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:46,020
So just like this diary and the JVM here and there are two sets of libraries and different things here.

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,120
So now let me tell you what is the cryptographic?

26
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:51,810
Yes.

27
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,940
OK, so before going to.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,040
For a little fact, let me tell some.

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,440
Right.

30
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,410
Iraqi and what is the cryptography in the market?

31
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:17,130
There are different things like bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, if you know, to the bitcoin on to the

32
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,440
large point on the cryptocurrency.

33
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,610
So crypto is not about money currency.

34
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,120
The program is just basically the economy who pioneered things so highly blenders.

35
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:38,730
So let me, as I told you, Amy is doing that stops sending the data the outside world.

36
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,140
There are a lot of lot of 10:57 these articles on it.

37
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,140
These are my attackers which always want to penetrate this system more, these systems are needed.

38
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:59,690
They want to steal these information, all of this, but and we are very talented, all we can say,

39
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,770
intelligent persons.

40
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,410
They are talking in code language also always they are talking good language.

41
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,510
All always vigilant for that language isn't going for any.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,150
So that's a similar thing in cryptography.

43
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,630
What?

44
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,070
What are you doing is sending this message?

45
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,450
So this is my message.

46
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,590
This some key.

47
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,740
With some key, so this circle is my.

48
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,380
Just keep sending you this being north.

49
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,350
This is the key to encrypt their data.

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:41,390
These also having this data or weekends a key to encrypt that my this part is the mine data.

51
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,410
These my key.

52
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,190
Back.

53
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,000
No one God knows this is the key because there is no meaning for that.

54
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,110
There is no meaning for that data.

55
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,690
So the encryption key is happening here.

56
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,810
So no in beach access to safe.

57
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,490
So in previous part, I told you what is the basic things like?

58
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,390
Well, what is the semantics?

59
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:13,460
Margaret is basically for the encryption, and the decryption key is seen.

60
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,970
These same for encryption and decryption.

61
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,250
So immediately, what is the encryption?

62
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,610
Encryption is just basically plain inside politics.

63
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,520
Cipher text is basically no one can read it that there is no meaning for that.

64
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,450
We can read that message.

65
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,030
There is no meaning for that.

66
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:36,370
There are some symbols on, so we can include some SGX anything data, and we can have a space of that.

67
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,080
So keen for the decryption and encryption is key.

68
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,400
Same then it's known as semantic.

69
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,700
Then what is also meant there is a symmetric thing that would be awesome entity.

70
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,160
What is the ultimate team?

71
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,710
What are you sending data to be?

72
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,210
It creates bookies, Glenys polÃ©mique.

73
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,240
And another one is private.

74
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,050
For the inclusion of it, when his public and other is private to send it back.

75
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,490
So what it is doing?

76
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,130
He's doing all he's encrypting the data using.

77
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,460
Encrypting their data, using this public.

78
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,370
OK, encrypting data, this public key, this is my public key.

79
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:39,690
And sending these key bills to decrypt that data, they might be sending some data to a.

80
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:49,640
It is decrypting that data, who is private, so as you can see that there is lot of lot of security

81
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:57,290
in this and there are different Ignace like signature in hashing, different things happen here, all

82
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,430
in this data.

83
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,300
So let me move on to some important part.

84
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,860
So what is the cryptography thing here?

85
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,710
Let me do.

86
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:14,570
Cryptography is a study of different techniques to secure data from 2018, so cryptography is not always

87
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,670
related to encryption on anything.

88
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,890
It's a big need to secure data from unauthorized entity, entity and anything.

89
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:23,360
You want it.

90
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,970
In computer science, we try to develop strategies and practices to protect sensitive data.

91
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:40,830
Now if you have WhatsApp on dancing input and encrypting that, what it means you're checking is not

92
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,910
stored as a common text or your voice is not stored as a common text is encrypted.

93
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,010
So most of cryptography involves very advanced mathematical functions used to are used for securing

94
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:59,100
data may be required at once things because attackers are always changing their strategies, they're

95
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,470
always trying to penetrate the system.

96
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,550
So we're requiring very advanced functions, mathematical functions.

97
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:12,230
For this purpose, the sole purpose of algorithms to develop cryptography is hide data from attacker

98
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,980
or middlemen.

99
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:20,940
In this article, we're going to understand this part and also you may take off your things and we are

100
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,500
going to do that steps.

101
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,690
So this is a plain text.

102
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,310
I played one key.

103
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:34,370
Which encryption algorithm, so for things generated, decryption would have simply been they cisgendered

104
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:34,530
it?

105
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:35,940
So what is this?

106
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,730
I am getting some plain text is basically your original message already.

107
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,850
That is Hayden.

108
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,390
Then from view two of cryptographic encryption algorithm.

109
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,270
So what are they saying?

110
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,390
Basically, your output of encryption, which is not really, well, like in previous thing, I really

111
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:59,550
be meeting next to say, for example, keys a piece of data or corrected bit of data when input with

112
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,700
plain text in encryption offsite.

113
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,200
But it still gives basically just encrypting and decrypting it.

114
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:13,170
If you put in that part, you will get or you will understand the lyrics for that purpose.

115
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,120
And so is that a piece of data which is added to the hashing function?

116
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,500
So I will tell you what is the hash here hashes?

117
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:29,910
And looking back, all you have to create some map of arbitrary size of data or bytes in that data in

118
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:37,200
that main data to create some mathematical functions or create some mathematical attributes for that

119
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:37,770
list.

120
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,610
So there are different encryption algorithms.

121
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:51,080
Equality is obviously easier to understand those who fish blowfish idea modify you make shocking.

122
00:08:51,240 --> 00:09:00,990
256 is most like hashing functions of 256 bits of bitcoin is using SHA256 is really higher level algorithms.

123
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,860
Also, they are using.

124
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,170
So these are the properties of everything and all semantic encryption.

125
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,530
As I told you, public private key was created and they are shared to this.

126
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,460
So mostly the cryptocurrencies are using oximetry.

127
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,720
But for the simpler book with this, I'm deploying the simple new, which is basically no.

128
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,560
Cementing.

129
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,150
So now.

130
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:38,590
I'll let us create new treats here, which are very useful and let us see how we can set up our project.

131
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:45,220
So for the producer, it's very easy when you have to go to your I.D..

132
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,770
And choose your own I.D., you can choose anything.

133
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm not forcing anyone to stick to only one, and there is a reason for that because that's not really

134
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,630
everyone's part.

135
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,710
Then I'm going to endanger this if we wanted to go you with this.

136
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,480
You may have received this.

137
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,420
So when you're when I it's.

138
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,480
It will take some time to open, but I mean, wait.

139
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,510
Let me rephrase your piece.

140
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:30,350
Plain text is basically just original message, Jordan, that you do it on YouTube from cryptographic

141
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,690
encryption algorithms, then the.

142
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,800
There is one other thing is Cipher, which is input and output of encryption.

143
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,180
And he is a piece of data.

144
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,760
All is another piece of the damages to the Haitian commission, and I will tell you what is the Haitian

145
00:10:53,090 --> 00:11:01,180
later because it will not understand directly using this, but we have to check for different purposes

146
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,400
it.

147
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,310
So you need to create a new project in your own I.D..

148
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,330
So what I'm going to do is.

149
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,070
I'm going to create my new project in my alley.

150
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,170
So let me open my eyes.

151
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,590
Sometimes a good three minutes to look like assisting confirmation.

152
00:11:52,510 --> 00:12:00,400
Meanwhile, let us see what is Java class, and so everything in Java is associated with classes and

153
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,630
objects along with attributes and.

154
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:09,760
Considering the real life example, God is an object which has some attributes such as wind blows,

155
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:19,910
etc., etc. But oh God, he's also having like, construct or blueprint of creating objects in glass

156
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,290
holders.

157
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:28,480
Some user defined attributes to pass values on which objects are all used to create glasses, which

158
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,130
has already created an invalid.

159
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,580
So that's how we're going to with this end user.

160
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:39,550
Though some functional Java classes subclasses is a blueprint for objects or New Orleans, and class

161
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,580
is something to store different functions meters in one block of code.

162
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,270
And this is the syntax for tickling the classes.

163
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:52,300
So the next part and how are we going to deploy it and how we can run our own in the next play?

164
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,410
Hope you understand.

165
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,130
Thank you.
