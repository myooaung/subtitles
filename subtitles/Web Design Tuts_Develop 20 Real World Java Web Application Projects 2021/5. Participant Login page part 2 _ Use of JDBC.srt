1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,000
In previous session, I told you basic stuff in Java Servlet.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,780
Then we created participant login page with a statement.

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,260
Then we created participant sign up and participant logging.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,940
So participants sign up.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,640
What if the participant sign up?

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,850
No requirements?

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:25,480
We need to take user input from participant sign up, name their username, their password and confirm

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,110
password fill.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:34,540
So in previous session for the admin page and for the security purpose, what I created, what I used,

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,270
I just wrote to the Java program.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:43,420
Using that inside the Java problem, I mentioned the list of admins and their password listing default

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,860
passwords I'm going to create.

13
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,650
So admin will require that system default username and system default passwords.

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,700
So I'm not giving any changes for admin.

15
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,380
Admin restrictions are very I'm leaving the restrictions to admin we use.

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,510
I'll stick to that username and password, but for the participants, log in what I'm going to do.

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,940
I'm going to take username from them only.

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,670
I'm going to need password and confirm password build.

19
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,060
From there.

20
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:16,380
I'm not going to use some default participants or something in everyday life.

21
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,680
You can see the you can see the different websites also that see using this.

22
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,150
And yet I'm going to use this part.

23
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,080
So for the participants, log in our sign up page for you.

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,870
I'm going to create one Java, so next to me.

25
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,090
So what you can do is just go to source package.

26
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,300
You're right, click new and create Java solution.

27
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:45,160
But always remember in the folder process, you have to mention that in the next part, it will ask

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,260
you, Do you want to added that part and will be a big symbol or not?

29
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:57,700
But always remember you have to add it to the original, as you can see in some part.

30
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,020
Let me open a big symbol by here.

31
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,710
So vivid, someone you can see this is a solid possibility, validated then still to be.

32
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,610
I created two minutes on it, so these are mapping soulagement things and everything.

33
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:26,080
If you are not getting any solid mapping, the issue will fail and do our Java file on Java Solaris

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,180
and it will not attach to anyone.

35
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,880
So it's Emily's them attaching mold.

36
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,100
We can see or learn Java.

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,250
So always remember.

38
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,480
Take that back and say, why you creating this on it?

39
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,760
So let us see how we can get it sorted.

40
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,830
So as I told you, oh, in the folder, you have to ask for these request.

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,020
Now we are going to store this into the database, so we need one more thing.

42
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,380
Import Java not issued So these item before a library in Java is still not studied.

43
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,900
Your window is not stopped for all.

44
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,820
Libraries include all libraries inside this because I don't want to specify each any we.

45
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,630
So this would not start after everything in your library.

46
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,290
You will get all libraries you.

47
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:17,400
So after creating public lost story extends to its GDP solely because we are going to create its GDP,

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,850
so yeah, I'm going to use, I'm going to post metal.

49
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,390
Then this is I'm going to create a Studio B, so let request video request.

50
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:34,360
It should be so response VIDEO Well, as a response which throws an exception and solid exception.

51
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:44,200
I told you earlier while creating, I mean part admin validation, but so this is the response, said

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,670
content.

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,670
If things don't is human, why we are using this line.

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,820
So in further, I'm going to put some estimate tags in saying Java program, but Java doesn't know that

55
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,780
it's a stimulant.

56
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:05,720
If I'm not mentioning this directly, former Buddha estimated budget and estimate shows that part with

57
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,080
tag only inside the body, so it should be an interesting little part.

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,020
So I'm specifying this with tag.

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,620
So create print segment out.

60
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,370
Don't respond.

61
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,230
I would call to these funds arbitrator.

62
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,950
These are some default statements you are going to use.

63
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,170
Yeah.

64
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,430
So what I'm going to fetch is your.

65
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,180
Fiji.

66
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,830
Data from.

67
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,170
These same.

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,740
Not extreme.

69
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,110
I'm facing.

70
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,730
From.

71
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,010
Use user.

72
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,810
So I'm pitching this data.

73
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,590
I told you in earlier part of the show, I created this, so I'm going to finish this data from users

74
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:52,950
only.

75
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,740
And from.

76
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:04,970
They assume in part, so always remember your this name by name, username, B password, remember these

77
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,500
names and you just knew that names only don't change the name or anything.

78
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,440
Otherwise, you can just copy paste your backpack.

79
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:21,210
So these are people you can use these names also here, but I'm going to assign this to another.

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,850
So you remember it when you do it, three or four is really quite equal.

81
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:34,730
Or we can say, Oh, just for my comfort in a comfort zone, I'm going to use this, so I'm going to

82
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,180
assign.

83
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:36,690
Who?

84
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,850
And understand just I'm putting this.

85
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:48,490
I'm going to ask and this is one of those things, so no, this is not very required, but we can agree

86
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,000
on that part and you can use only these parts only.

87
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:59,040
But these are very specified name I'm going to use even for username it for password field entry, for

88
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,320
confirm password.

89
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,610
Why am I going to?

90
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,430
I'm not storing and phone password filling database.

91
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,180
I'm going to store only password field, but for the confirmation, I'm going to use this name too.

92
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,220
If I'm going to store if what name also you.

93
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,540
So if it means our password is equal to the confirmed password.

94
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,630
As you know, our password and confirm password should be seen.

95
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,170
What I'm going to do is die.

96
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,620
So if I'm not using try, it will escalate it inside this.

97
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,700
So for exception handling, I'm going to use your try.

98
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:44,050
Glass for a name to invoke Oracle Travel, as I told you to invoke this Oracle, Java, Oracle Duty

99
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,320
B.C. 14 Java, it will load up using this part.

100
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:54,110
Always remember or strong connection model with Jerebko Oracle team.

101
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,380
I'm going to create some default fights and I will share that, for instance.

102
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,900
So you can use directly, these are the system default.

103
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,700
You can change to your user if you've created another user inside a school.

104
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,570
You can specify them and use the password.

105
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,780
So you can directly use these.

106
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,240
You are in to this part, then password and system and everything.

107
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,760
Yet, but I need to do some strings.

108
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:28,430
And I'm going to tell this back, so I will just like username of the database, I'm going to use system

109
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,930
default database, you're not.

110
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,320
I'm going to create a password or assisting.

111
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,270
So that's my password and everything.

112
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,900
If you don't want to reveal your password or something, you can create text, file and you can take

113
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,110
that from the text file without displaying every information.

114
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,450
But this is a very complicated part.

115
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,630
And so this already this is a skill.

116
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,810
Segments are very complicated, so I don't want to focus on that.

117
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,080
But.

118
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,510
Very complex fight.

119
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,980
So now we need to create connections, so I will put your.

120
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,410
Weird connection.

121
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,070
So always remember the late breaking connection, what you are going to do, connection, which is basically

122
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,300
a school park, is full connection is equal to con connection.

123
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,290
And during the.

124
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,610
VIDEO I'll just you, manager.

125
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,940
Those are the driver manager or regular driver manager.

126
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,650
Not good connection.

127
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,070
With which connection you didn't specify, you didn't.

128
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,760
Is this and disease?

129
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:41,400
So in a school statements, you know, these are some school students I'm going to tell you, as I told

130
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,610
you.

131
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,080
I'm going to discuss this, and I'm going to be asking this first.

132
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:56,110
What we are going to see what you connect in, so it is connected and basically this connection with

133
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,920
connection, you as our driver doesn't know what is the connection to it.

134
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,440
And so the connection with the local news machine.

135
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,670
Anyway, now we are going to specify using a system similar to you and with the password.

136
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,950
So this is all about the connection.

137
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,540
It's good Stegman still while doing it.

138
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,250
What we are going to use, we are going to use this statement.

139
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,050
Now, what does this create statement?

140
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,410
So we need to create one statement.

141
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,710
Otherwise, it will not execute any statements or something.

142
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,750
We know our school statements are different than Java.

143
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,780
So we need to create one statements here.

144
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,930
So use this connection, not create statements.

145
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,740
Then I will specify this as a school statement.

146
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:55,090
Mentioned this insert string insert into pillow details, values are these these these?

147
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,670
So this is all about the values.

148
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:05,570
But, you know, the school segment, if you don't know how we can insert didn't belong in students

149
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,060
belonging to this is basically creating the database.

150
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,610
First, I will tell you how we can create a database.

151
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,800
Relational database is very simple.

152
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,780
This would create.

153
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,850
Able.

154
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,070
What we are going to use this year, vlogging students, these values.

155
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:27,210
This copy, this part, you can see and see this part copy this right here.

156
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:34,520
You can see this below in detention belonging to this committee, then this right group follow all things.

157
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,430
So first, I'm going to specify the username.

158
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:42,230
Medicated for the sting, you mentioned the length of Sting.

159
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,630
I'm going to put 100.

160
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,690
Password.

161
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:56,180
I will like this password again, radical two, this is before listing these and then name Barricade

162
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,660
two with 500, I'm going to suspend next.

163
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,110
You ended with the semicolon.

164
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,540
Now you can see our table is created.

165
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,390
Similarly, you can create another table for this.

166
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,350
Vlogging duties in your school community.

167
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:18,230
For values, what I mean is and even even feel for username to fill your password, I told you password.

168
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,900
This password if autofill for the name.

169
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,910
So always remember for that event, you do it.

170
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Otherwise it will not execute, it will throw the exception.

171
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,060
It's really efficient.

172
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,660
Use this single uncommon in the world.

173
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,780
Let's listen to this.

174
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,830
Follow these rules.

175
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:43,170
These are some really important things in this research said all this is equal to statement insecurity

176
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,020
to us, then request dispatcher.

177
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:52,020
This for executing could just be created, but you are not pressing the enter some level like that.

178
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,890
Your result?

179
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,820
Put this resource statement, then request dispatch it.

180
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,720
If this is correct, we're going to plug into details.

181
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,530
How to do that forward, Italy knows this connection is very important.

182
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,420
That's the exception.

183
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:15,360
If it is not corrected like our iTunes password and confirm password fields are not equal.

184
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,140
What it will print, it will bring.

185
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,660
Please enter password and password.

186
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,720
Same, and it will remain on that page.

187
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,270
So this is all about this.

188
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,010
These are very important part.

189
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,410
I will come in here also.

190
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,720
The nation.

191
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,790
And storing.

192
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,370
In to.

193
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,580
Database.

194
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,120
So that is about it.

195
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,270
It's very simple, I'm going to store only in four videos or tutorials.

196
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,380
We are I'm going to tell you, Oh, you can validate participants with log in information and everything,

197
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
but let us deploy this first.

198
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,070
So as I told you already planning click run or click Clean and William.

199
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:07,310
So let me ask you if your output window is not showing, just go to window your and you can see output

200
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,950
part here or you can press control plus for the hat on.

201
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,610
So your output part or anything is not sitting here.

202
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,120
But as you can see, glass of each server is currently running.

203
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,460
It will take time to run everything and it will just shorten.

204
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,560
Glass is an opening in Chrome or your default browser.

205
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,520
It will directly load that page.

206
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,100
So as I told you, we created a connection and everything here.

207
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,030
Well, you can see stories starting job security manager then.

208
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,170
These are some signature sort of created incentives, so.

209
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,570
Deservedly so.

210
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,570
No, I.

211
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,490
What is deployed?

212
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,520
And this, as you can see, our board is now trying to hold on to last resort.

213
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:04,760
So as I told you, we have seen through the glass, fish and everything first, and now I'm going to

214
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,280
say this is only the to load as then click to buy this one.

215
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,040
Again, you can see participant sign up and participant load and fish.

216
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,460
I'm going to use participants signing page here.

217
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,620
I'm going to play James name, username, Jubaland 01 password.

218
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,860
I'm going to specify one two three if I'm not pursuing password one two three four and confirm password

219
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,480
fillers four two five six seven.

220
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,170
It will try, as you can see.

221
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,300
Please enter a password and confirm password, see.

222
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:40,900
So now I'm going to enter everything you can use to capture your some statements and different things

223
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,520
you're on, so you can try with that, but also.

224
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,290
Then one, two, three four.

225
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,990
So.

226
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,360
As you can see, I moved to the participant loading, which I already created participants in waiting

227
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,500
for the readers, I will tell you.

228
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,150
So these are, I want to say, with information how we can take our information is stored.

229
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,280
So we'll put a single command line.

230
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,590
We use this didn't select.

231
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,450
Data from.

232
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,660
This pile of noodles.

233
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,440
You log in to our table.

234
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:20,290
And as you can see, our James password and its username are still always remember, the sequence should

235
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,590
be same as urine and drink.

236
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:30,500
Oh, in Java, file Java, so literally this even should be for username, A2 for the password.

237
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:37,780
And if little for Neal, if you want to put name first, then if and similarly you have to specify this.

238
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,570
Also inside the Romney School Command Line, these usernames should be below and the name should be

239
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:43,960
upward.

240
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,210
So sequence is very important.

241
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,920
Don't change the sequence.

242
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,030
So that is about how we can steer this party into the database in further videos.

243
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:59,750
I'm going to tell you how we can fish that part anybody thing and I'm going to tell different and more

244
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,560
for the on.
