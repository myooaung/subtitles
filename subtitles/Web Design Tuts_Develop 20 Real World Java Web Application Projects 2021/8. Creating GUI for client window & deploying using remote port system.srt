1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,630
So now we are fully developed with our code.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,050
So I will explain what I'm going to do.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,800
So consider these all the libraries I'm going to use.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,560
But instead of these, I created one class, which is an immense public class server.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,100
So by creating any application, client and server part are very important.

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:32,310
So what is for getting all the part of your client in our chat system?

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:38,440
So client is going to attach with server and through the server, we are going to send the message.

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,380
That's the basic thing we are going to see here.

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,940
So first, I'm creating your vector using this syntax.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,220
So I will tell you what is the function here?

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,030
So Vector is going to hold the instance of all the classes with the handlers.

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,490
So I'm creating your static vectors, which client handler?

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,460
You can schedule the object, which is reasonable.

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,130
I will tell you, you can take your two classes, know this and extends to object, and I'm giving the

15
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,030
names sockets.

16
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,460
So Socrates is just like electrical sockets.

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:16,200
Client is going to attach judicial and mentioning azure sockets, and I want to run any method in order

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,530
for the running purposes we need method, which is main method to running the list over which is going

19
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,810
to total input output exception that took common exception.

20
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,410
We can find in silver until then.

21
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,100
Server socket is I'm creating your socket, which server socket.

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,810
So you may ask me, like, what is this server socket?

23
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,890
So it is basically J1 dot net package.

24
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,790
We can use zero, which is the default package in Java, and you can use your server socket.

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:54,360
Then I'm giving you that I'm going to little increment it later because I need to name the plans ideas

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,680
as when we incrementing.

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,540
So I'm currently giving as a zero.

28
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,080
Then it will print, build common ground or console that it's waiting for connection.

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,970
Our server is waiting for client connection.

30
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,740
No current plan count is depends on socket size.

31
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:19,100
If while two is basically being in the of role for not opening police officer, there is always true.

32
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,860
So Server will always exert life on the network.

33
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:31,580
So I'm considering network as not the internet, it's a network I'm considering.

34
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,050
It's a loop of networks.

35
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,700
I'm what is always louder then.

36
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,840
For that purpose, I'm giving the way to then.

37
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,580
What is the significance between this system, dot dot print and what is this thing?

38
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,780
So basically current Glenn Count, I'm giving as a shock.

39
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,890
It's not safe.

40
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:58,510
So as it says our vector, which is released here, I'm using it as a list year so we can use this as

41
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,880
the defining look lenses, then socket connection.

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,050
I'm creating connection as object and which is going to accept the clients.

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,610
Then client IDs is going to plus one, which is basically I'm adding the client IDs your.

44
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,940
Then print writer, I'm using your print reader output to get output as the output stream, connection

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,230
output stream with then input stream, I'm going to create your which is buffer reader because lines

46
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,190
need to input and output both things.

47
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,990
So I need to mention that then this is Glenn Handler is going to hold some defaults, which basically

48
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:42,990
Line NIM connection is basically able to accept connection output, base for output stream and inputs

49
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,800
for input stream.

50
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,240
Then Add is basically I'm going to add the client and you may ask What is this?

51
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:54,480
The client look, and I created your trade and I'm starting the trip.

52
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:03,780
So why I'm so we're currently I'm deploying on local, so I'm going to specific lengths on my own.

53
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:11,160
I'm not going to disclose it later, like I'm not going to know I'm going to choose only my own clients

54
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,140
as my for this deployment.

55
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:21,480
But working on current systems of MultiJet systems, you can assume that new client wants to get connection

56
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,580
to the server at the same time.

57
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:30,530
Like, if you call someone, you may get busy, but while you check system, you should not get that

58
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,980
busy calls in the server part.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,520
So for that purpose, we need to create trade.

60
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,730
So each client connection will be handling by a thread.

61
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,430
So there is basically a small part of the process.

62
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,840
I told you earlier, and I'm going to start here.

63
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:53,490
So this is just part of connection, but I need to print it out as a client handler, methods and everything.

64
00:04:53,490 --> 00:05:01,800
So this is just for close streams and everything I created, but or for that purpose is what I'm going

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,270
to create.

66
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,900
I'm going to create a public run method to create one re-enable interface.

67
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,900
So again, we try and catch block.

68
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,390
I'm going to accept the exceptions.

69
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,900
But in the wild, true, I'm accepting the message with two this--you method and the is basically input

70
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:26,220
dot ruling, which is basically input, cinematic and plant and let again the connection.

71
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,090
And I'm mentioning as this is my construct of Alkaline Handler.

72
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,740
And this is for the animal interface is going to class, it's going to use here.

73
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,020
And for that purpose, I created this.

74
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,330
This is done with the server part.

75
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,670
So remember why you're giving the server?

76
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,630
This is your server.

77
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,090
I'm mentioning as 2020 as my server.

78
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,520
No.

79
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,200
Let us see what is the client here.

80
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,790
So forget about all these things and let us see what I'm going to do.

81
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:02,420
So in Bakersfield, I'm going to use our text chat window and we're going to mention I mentioned your

82
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,180
two friends if when and if if we need to just put in the name.

83
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,360
And if Cruz's full message connection and everything I'm going to specify, then I'm creating your first

84
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,850
set up with DreamHost as argument.

85
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:22,060
Then if Lenny's new frame, which server host and I'm going to assign it, so no, I created your GITEX

86
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:27,320
studio text field with the button and everything I explained to you, and I'm just giving a recap for

87
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,620
this.

88
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,220
Then I created to get a bottom panel and everything.

89
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,390
Oh, and bottom penalties for the bottom purpose.

90
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,340
I'm giving the bottom panel button on there for accepting the connections and everything.

91
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,370
Now let us see how we can run this.

92
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,310
So running is very easy as part yet.

93
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,460
So first is, I'm going to bring my server so.

94
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,690
For any purpose you need to run for server, then you can run lines.

95
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,870
So I'm not currently running my server.

96
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,300
So we'll wait for some time, it will be and it will deployments over.

97
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,540
Again, sort of what he's always like.

98
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:18,090
So it will accept connection at any time, like I'm not giving any or this time they took time to sort

99
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:24,360
of work, so it will not at all stop for anything and so it will always accept the claims.

100
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,370
So it's building, sometimes it may take time to build everything.

101
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,710
So it will take the resources and it will take everything depends on your system speed.

102
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:56,370
Without any like line mentors whatsoever, mentors who can not run any direct mentors like.

103
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:05,680
Well, so what needs to deploy force on your system or you can take on your local host?

104
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:12,130
So normally successful, my will be successful and you can take surveys waiting for connection and current

105
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,570
plan can be zero.

106
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,680
That's usual.

107
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,740
I haven't created any client, you know, listening to my client.

108
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,250
And let me run blind.

109
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:28,120
And so if you're going to care, I'm going to run my client, which is client start running.

110
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,550
I will tell you, what is this post later?

111
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,620
But if I am currently running on my local horse, so there is no errors I'm not getting because it's

112
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,360
a direct part.

113
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,830
So now you can check.

114
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,570
Currently, my lease is running and this is my.

115
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:57,170
A blank check system, so I'm mentioning as a B C as my name, and I'm submitting it so it will open

116
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,290
me on the next things.

117
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:09,320
So this is my client one, and if I pressed high here, so ABC will be I know why it is mismatch, I

118
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,020
will tell you and what I'm getting your error.

119
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,790
It will run on your local host.

120
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,420
No problem.

121
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,500
But the thing is, I'm mentioning as my defaulting, so you can check here if I run again, it will

122
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,790
be another clamshell.

123
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:30,260
Currently, it's giving me the error because of this post, because I mentioned the host 60 kb in Europe.

124
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,830
And what is this?

125
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,460
I will tell you.

126
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,870
But the thing is, my client is not running on local host.

127
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,030
It is running on some another interface.

128
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,080
And this is my server, which is running on student client is not connected, actually.

129
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,800
So that's the error in my program.

130
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:55,940
So how I'm going to use that because creating on a local machine, it's not a very useful case for multi-threaded

131
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,190
system connection between establishing between two systems or you're between two friends chatting with

132
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,770
two friends is the full approach of this.

133
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,460
So let me stop all the processes here currently.

134
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,780
So it is getting stopped and you can check your link.

135
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,570
Let me stop this also do just about anything.

136
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,720
And no one stopped.

137
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,620
So what is this, I will tell you?

138
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:31,180
So in judokas of service, you can check your in Europe is a free service, which is useful to form

139
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,120
through your network or for your local news on the internet.

140
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:42,730
So it's a local like exposing your local host on the internet, but it's a security and it's not like

141
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,960
any cyber security bubble.

142
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,910
It is very secure and directing, and you can connect to services and you can establish the connections

143
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,480
from anyone.

144
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,630
So I downloaded it for my system, which is basically for windows.

145
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,650
I'm downloading it.

146
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:07,170
You can unzip and you can use different things, or you can sign up also to your ideas and log in with

147
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,340
your attorneys and you can pass your token on tool.

148
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,820
So let me move in this and let me show you how the in Europe is going to work.

149
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,050
So this is the new document.

150
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,870
Once you open so you can check your different, different boards are giving your examples already given

151
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,870
FTP, then TCP also given.

152
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:33,370
So my protocol is TCP PCB, which is I'm going to use your PCB traffic to handle TCP traffic.

153
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,180
And what is my port?

154
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,810
It's basically 2020, my server port readiness.

155
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,970
So let me mention this command.

156
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,270
Indie-Rock PCB 2020.

157
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:54,030
So sometimes what I think I forgot is basically all.

158
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:01,400
I haven't mentioned that or two or three things, so let me open in Europe again.

159
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,190
So it will accept.

160
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:14,420
My team looking when it again, because I haven't mentioned the inaugural not easy BCB.

161
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,040
And 20, 20.

162
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:23,860
So.

163
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,650
OK, so I'm getting the error as in Europe and a local port is not available for.

164
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,500
Let me open it again and.

165
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,470
Let me check it again.

166
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:44,910
In judo.

167
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,380
DCB going deep.

168
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,570
Twenty.

169
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,300
OK.

170
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,020
No, my story is low, you can check here my server is low.

171
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,430
So this is the web interface.

172
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,420
You can check it later.

173
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,540
But what we required, we require this line.

174
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,620
So this is my TCP IP protocol, then this is my host.

175
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,160
I will I this is my host and this is my code.

176
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,900
So now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this part.

177
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,290
You can copy my control here.

178
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,390
You can copy this, go to your ID.

179
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,140
You need to make changes to client only.

180
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,570
Let me put it down this, so I will use it later.

181
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,450
Copy paste.

182
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,390
So I will use it later.

183
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,630
Let me comment on this.

184
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,520
So it not useful.

185
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:42,170
OK, so what we need to declare, we need to paste this six to this six, so it will start all of it.

186
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,120
So I already mentioned you six only.

187
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,440
So I need to check this portable and let me copy this.

188
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:57,000
And you need to mention about that, about the port, as I told you, you need to change the port about.

189
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,320
So let me check, where is that all?

190
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:10,550
OK, so in the void, connect to server, oh, I need to change the board, which I got, which is.

191
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:17,380
Basically, this food, you can dig your baby interface and you going check for that purpose also.

192
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,790
But for me, it's going to work.

193
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,490
Oh, and now we are done.

194
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,900
Now we are done.

195
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:30,140
And now what I'm going to do is, as I told you, I need to run my server first.

196
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:38,590
When my server is running one 2020 port with the local host, what it will be doing in Utah and Utah

197
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:46,360
will love that localhost 2020 server request to that client part, which is basically to this.

198
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,100
To this, it will pull up, and no, my client is not connected to this.

199
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:58,720
So basically, server is running on my machine, but or it is connected to my machine, to my machine

200
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,690
is act as a server part, but the client is not on my server.

201
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,010
So let me do one thing here and the client part.

202
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,130
Let me run this and let me show you how I.

203
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm going to use it.

204
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,400
So this is my client I'm going to use.

205
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:21,980
You and which is I'm going to using currently running currently click so it will take time to build

206
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:32,270
once it is fully built, it will render and and it will deploy me one window, as you can see here.

207
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,060
So this is my window and let me mention his name ABC here and let me submit it.

208
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,350
So now you can get connected to this IP, which is basically.

209
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,000
This port, this IP a.m. connected connection.

210
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,360
And let me mention as high.

211
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,510
Now, you cannot see your any messages like there is no error.

212
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,100
This is my blog.

213
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:02,580
But if I go to RentPath and if I go to Server Park, you can check my gland when it's connected.

214
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,490
So I want to connect another client on my son's team.

215
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,720
Only you can check with your friends so you can connect between two friends.

216
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,390
But I need to do blood on my machine.

217
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,020
For that instance, I need to read the configuration.

218
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:22,890
Yeah, if you want to check, you need to install one plugin in Algeria, which is my patron plugin.

219
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,760
So go to plus icon in order and debug configuration.

220
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:36,270
Then or go to download and check for my PSN as I'm doing here, my Deran letting them give the name

221
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,540
as.

222
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,990
Client one.

223
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,670
This is my client.

224
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:48,800
Let me add one thing, Ron Plank, which is my method, or don't give anything after launch and click

225
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,190
apply.

226
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,970
And he took so in this.

227
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,460
Now you can take this is my main methods, but this is my material.

228
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:01,070
So what we do is we do it will create and unedited instances for a client, and it will call that.

229
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,160
So you can.

230
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,310
The basic purpose of these things, I can use another window.

231
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,880
So currently in this, you can check this is my ABC.

232
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:16,280
And this is my another window, which is I'm going giving the name x y z.

233
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,320
And I'm entering this.

234
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,090
Now, what do you think?

235
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:29,860
If I am put in here by, you can check your exposure to the police printing, printing by if I'm printing

236
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:37,000
here high X, Y and Z, you can check I'm getting high x z another.

237
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,330
So this is my x y z and this is my ABC window.

238
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,080
And in the server listing, you can check the client code.

239
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:44,650
So.

240
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,990
So what is basically giving, not giving?

241
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:53,710
They need you, but please, because it's command line interface, just but for the clients, I created

242
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:53,890
one.
