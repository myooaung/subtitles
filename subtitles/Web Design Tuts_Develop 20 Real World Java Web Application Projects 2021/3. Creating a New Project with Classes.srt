1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,470
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:10,750
So I hope you all have went through the introduction part of the noted down job application that we

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,520
are going to build today.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:22,780
So after getting through that introduction, I hope that you have gained an insight of what we are actually

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,850
going to make in this project.

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,810
Our text editor or something that we call it.

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:36,930
So to begin this project, we have to create a Java phone, sorry, a Java project.

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,570
And then.

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,500
Start the project going, so let's get started.

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:49,550
We have opened the welcome page of Visual Studio code and then trying to write our code.

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,350
So.

12
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,310
On clicking this explorer icon.

13
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:04,160
We get the option of creating job uprising, so clicking on this icon, we will get an option of creating

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,880
our project.

15
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,730
You will click on this.

16
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,270
Then we will select No.

17
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:20,140
Remember, we have no need of Springwood Quarks or micro in this program project so vividly.

18
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,850
No, because you also have to select this in your system.

19
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,570
So, yes, now we have to select a park for our project.

20
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:41,310
Suppose I want to create my noted down in my next up folder, so I will cool that next door and select

21
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,560
the project liquidation as Dexter.

22
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,550
Now clicking we get the text fee asking are asking for input a job project name?

23
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:58,440
So think about a name that you want your project to be named as an input in this district.

24
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,940
So I want to name my project as noted down.

25
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:12,760
A folder, not a noun, will be created if I hit and then so me on projects carefully and then press

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,180
enter.

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,150
So after hitting enter.

28
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:29,050
So we navigate to this folder, not down head with some inbuilt folders inside it, so you can see that

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:37,240
this loaded down folder contains this dirt, this dirt with a school name, which is for libraries and

30
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,800
A.R.T. folder.

31
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,070
So that fancy folder is the main fun of.

32
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,140
Any job up?

33
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:56,420
So if we open this expand, this is folder it already is created in.

34
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:08,530
So these are the inbuilt folders which are created after hitting the Create project option and opening

35
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,910
this Abdul-Jabbar file.

36
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,330
We get this thing on our screens.

37
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,580
So this Java is basically a class of them.

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,140
This class is named as app inside this class.

39
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:23,710
We have.

40
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,310
I mean, my.

41
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:34,360
Which contains which is specified as public, so any class can access this throughout this project.

42
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,910
And inside this, we have a strange argument first.

43
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,080
So what this function returns us doing, of course.

44
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:54,740
So when this function is called, when an exception is thrown, this part of the project is outputting

45
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,450
hello.

46
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,170
So what is the exception?

47
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:07,800
You may be wondering are exception is that type of error which arises and the runtime in any program?

48
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,810
So suppose we are running this program and there is some metal.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,170
So this exception went through this.

50
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:30,620
This part in the console that whatever you want to read that supposedly want to write it, does it begin

51
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,030
writing anything?

52
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,280
By default, it isn't written as Hanover.

53
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,270
So, yes, if the program is any exception.

54
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,880
This is called as an error.

55
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,260
So if they run this far or whenever this party's goal.

56
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,210
Yes.

57
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:58,220
So it displays that are so exception handling is one of the perverse mechanism to handle the runtime

58
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,480
data so that the normal flow of application can be mundane.

59
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,260
It is very difficult to find the box on your own.

60
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:14,690
It with the help of the compiler, we can do that on baseline and on which part of the code we are getting

61
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:22,790
data and it becomes easy for us to debug this and run that code again to get our successful output on

62
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,450
the program.

63
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,040
What we want to run, it does so after this.

64
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,550
We are going to create a note in Notepad loan application.

65
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,910
So we will create the new file.

66
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,300
In this as the folder itself and name it does not.

67
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,430
But not Java.

68
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,000
So this is the name of the file.

69
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:58,620
I am going to create a notepad on Java and this file will go to goingto display the main window of the

70
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,670
application that we discussed in the working part of the code.

71
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,380
So after hitting enter, a notepad class is already created.

72
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,300
So yes, we want a class name does not pass.

73
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,710
Now we want to frame inside with the notepad application is going to be consistent.

74
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,660
So.

75
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,220
We have to import the libraries for creating the functions.

76
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:30,960
Yes.

77
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:41,390
Let us import the Java Swing Library, which is going to give us components like free panels and so

78
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:41,630
on.

79
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:48,080
We have many other packages inside the swing.

80
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,860
API Soyez importing.

81
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,070
Java X Swing.

82
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,810
Yes.

83
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:07,870
So this asterisk here, they note that we are going to import all the classes and components of this

84
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,740
swing package.

85
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,990
And apparently it today as we haven't views anything from it.

86
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,880
Once they will use it, it will automatically change its color.

87
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:30,460
Now, inside the notepad class, we are going to extend it 10 to you to different.

88
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,020
Yes.

89
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,840
So this difference is a component inside Java Singularity.

90
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,460
So you can see it in the suggestions.

91
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,520
So yes, we have imported.

92
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:52,690
Swing Library and use a different component from it now, is this not one class?

93
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,540
We are going to create a constructor.

94
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,900
Or we can say that we're going to invoke a method called not bank inside this.

95
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,040
Now.

96
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:16,650
Suppose that we want to give a title to the official, calling it the sect title.

97
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:31,140
And think about a title like, yes, for me, that title goes up, not down.

98
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,490
We have sat tight there for our programs.

99
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,070
Program, sorry.

100
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:49,150
And yes, I missed Brace after this, after creating any constructor, you have to enclose everything

101
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,380
inside braces.

102
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,980
After setting the title, we are going to set bound like there is a heightened risk for this thing.

103
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:06,400
But we have to decide how much we're right and how much law we want it to be.

104
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,760
So I am setting bound.

105
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,220
Yes.

106
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,540
I think tank.

107
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,230
I think so, yes.

108
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:21,670
And I suppose you can create any things you want.

109
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,890
Now for him to be.

110
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,170
Extending, yes, so.

111
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,620
I have created Bounce.

112
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,020
Now I am going to.

113
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:43,610
Senator, default close operationally on exiting programs, close the window is going to close automatically.

114
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:53,890
So setting default clause operation, I have said before close operations and.

115
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,680
The should be closed on invoking this matter.

116
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:08,290
Exist on clauses, so the suggestions are life.

117
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:17,380
So that said, before the operation is going to close the frame when we did the program.

118
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:24,580
Now, let us try to run this and see what it is going to give.

119
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,990
But before running the program for us live, we have to create a function which really made us possible

120
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,910
for running this spyglass.

121
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,140
So creating a public class.

122
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:48,450
Call it does mean and not said it will be a string.

123
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,620
Yes.

124
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,030
No.

125
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,070
So I think this.

126
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,430
New CNN-ORC Bank Plus.

127
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,230
Setting the visibility of this glasses through.

128
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,240
We have to call set visible.

129
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,360
Yes, set visible.

130
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,290
And it takes automatically a Boolean argument.

131
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:21,560
So we want to see the application, so we're setting this visibility below.

132
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:28,270
Now let's try and run this class and see what are what we are going to see.

133
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,140
So perfect.

134
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,070
We have created a frame.

135
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,040
Yes.

136
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,180
So these are the dimensions for this frame.

137
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,670
The name in the title.

138
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,330
And then we click on the close.

139
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,750
It will automatically close and none will say so perfect.

140
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,280
We have created the right frame of this program, a mainstream which we inside which we are going to

141
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:07,380
add all the components to be performed for editing, writing in saving our text document.

142
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:15,960
Now, in the next part, we will learn how to earn nav bar items such as fine and help.

143
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,590
And what these buttons will consist of.

144
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,810
So see you in the next five.
