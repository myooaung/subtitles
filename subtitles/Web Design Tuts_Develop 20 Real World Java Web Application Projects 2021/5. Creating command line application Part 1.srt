1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,680
So we are really creating disinfectant.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,200
The key generator part, which is generating a semantic game of.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,860
Cipher takes using a yes algorithm.

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:23,380
So we don't regard this because Java security in this package will take care of this easily, so we

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,190
don't belong here.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:33,640
And as I told you, already developing this corn, I told you will always create another key difference

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:33,940
here.

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,070
So you required this Milosevic's Java execs combined.

9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,410
Or you can use by example, you may find this on internet.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,370
This is Java you have to download.

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,530
It's another dependency.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,670
If you are using marijuana, you have to use dependency injection behavior and not using heroin.

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,780
So I need to.

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,100
Mentioned this directly.

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,180
So let us see, we already created this.

16
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:15,440
So no one will get full throated for this, so we closed out outpost and sold it for more than two billion

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:15,810
small.

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,460
I'm going to get you one at so let can give the name is Abdul Jalil Java class at.

19
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:37,020
So what am I are creating this semantic game is for representation, but for the Gila family at and

20
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,410
to proceed with this then modern dimensions.

21
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,710
Atheists are included first.

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,480
So, again, that's simple but enforced.

23
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,350
I used your public static.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,410
No, I'm going to use private here and private.

25
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:04,360
I need to mention or I don't want to change this algorithm later.

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,440
So no one is going to change this.

27
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,310
This is the two time dimension of this.

28
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,060
Using Block.

29
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:30,780
Safe would say, for blocking technique, CBS technique, commonly known as CBS, to ensure that predicts

30
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,670
that it won't change steady.

31
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,040
Fine, then.

32
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,150
Green, oh, I'm giving.

33
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,630
Site for an eight this cycle.

34
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,250
No, kidding.

35
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,320
Yes, atheists slash each other with CBS board log of seven.

36
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,620
OK.

37
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:03,560
All CBS Remember there is another Cameron B key scheme.

38
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:12,640
So you remember this for 30 oh, package for you.

39
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,300
Also, package it is for you.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,120
Planning and willing to use it.

41
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,500
So these are all about who his name.

42
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,200
I'm going to create one static scanner, private static scanner.

43
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,080
Scandal and listening in for the message, but.

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,450
So long we've done with this.

45
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:44,830
No.

46
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,200
I hate to mention mental.

47
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,360
Here's what I'm going to do, I need you to stay.

48
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:10,500
OK, well, because as I told you, in previous order against a tutorial or previous video, we created

49
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,120
that part already.

50
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,470
So similarly, one equals we required one strategy here.

51
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,700
Step two All security secrets.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,390
Step two So let me create one secret.

53
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,060
Method to create security.

54
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:39,670
So again, it's simple, as we already created this, it shouldn't be public only standing.

55
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:48,130
Secret give great secret, you always keep on going to the secret key.

56
00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:00,450
Create yet atheists, because it's easy, so it shouldn't be easy.

57
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,190
You know, we learned this.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,570
So it shows you've got to be so alone in securing something that wants to get random java for randomizing

59
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,930
and everything securing them.

60
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,900
Let me be honest, man.

61
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,110
And it means you.

62
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,700
It's a good thing, so that's for.

63
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,080
Bring the mines.

64
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:39,110
And, Jim, I need to randomize again when I hear putting new messages.

65
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:47,050
First, I will tell you what kind of message key should be different if I could next message by for

66
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,560
anybody.

67
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,610
He should really always.

68
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,100
Then you generate revenue, abuse you generate, but that's not me.

69
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,020
You don't let me squander this, but can you generate a.

70
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,480
He generated.

71
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,870
Don't get instance gives instant wisdom.

72
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,240
I need to mention them a you know, it's.

73
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,200
So, right.

74
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,580
An exception to the rule search algorithm.

75
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:45,020
So anything exceptional to you then cumulatively gives you generator the generator, I need to initialize

76
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:53,800
it, not because I haven't created, I need to initialize degenerated in it basically issue 256 similarly

77
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,250
to slash securing the moment to boost.

78
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:08,820
So could let me OK, don't I need to create security here of security?

79
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,890
This is my security.

80
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,270
Jail under greater scrutiny.

81
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,970
Equally, he didn't to.

82
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:31,950
And not disputed game that he delivered oxygen rated, not generic, which is default better and which

83
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,190
is going to really look.

84
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,700
So let me tell you, what is all these things?

85
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,600
We already created here.

86
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,100
So.

87
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,560
Let me mention this again, you're who?

88
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,710
Or the confusion, confusion part, so it's going to.

89
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,030
Now I need to create one the third part.

90
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,700
So let me you, what is this matter who you need?

91
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,650
We don't.

92
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,960
And create Victor, which.

93
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:25,240
And even so, when you look to pass a message, bye bye, bye, so for this purpose, I'm standing.

94
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,840
Bite me, bite.

95
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:38,000
What you did not only despite, I mean, create mission.

96
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,050
So I'm going to mention is create an issue.

97
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,130
So this is my name known in Michigan.

98
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:02,070
You can read initialization reports I'm mentioning as the solar radiation.

99
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,180
This is my name.

100
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,780
And I'm giving you some criticism.

101
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,650
I used encryption.

102
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,420
I need to encrypt something.

103
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,670
And this is just what he's proposing, what I'm going to do, right?

104
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,740
Not long remember, I need to create initialization.

105
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:38,290
This initial question you get.

106
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,300
Perpetrators.

107
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,500
There's.

108
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,290
Let me use Camel case.

109
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:09,260
So there may be no it is using gambling, it's not like we is equal to me, if you will, by mentioning

110
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,060
60 by 60 Minutes, it seems expensive.

111
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,740
It will let you 256, then I need even see good random.

112
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,280
Now, remember why I need random cause, I need to again create secure random thing here.

113
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:36,190
Randomizing every part I need to create, every king around them is not only the Egypt park, but also.

114
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,440
Achieving the under two percent randomizing.

115
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,610
Secure, random, not mixed by mixed, but.

116
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,610
And what I need to mention is the Victor party, which is exactly.

117
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,180
Initially, we saw.

118
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:09,360
That our new dimension and what it should, if do today, we should have done.

119
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,370
That it should be well, it should return this far to.

120
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,610
And.

121
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,650
We will do this later.

122
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,220
What we going to is good start.

123
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,520
And let me optimize the imports because.

124
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:44,590
It's very useful to optimize imports from just about optimising imports to avoid.

125
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:58,630
Maudlin delays, so I created this now I need to create which functions is going to make plain text

126
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:05,530
the key with the initialization and its return, and another way to convert plain text will say four

127
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:05,770
days.

128
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,820
So we need to create that part also.

129
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,130
So.

130
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,360
Meantime, who?

131
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,800
A plain text.

132
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,660
And when he converted to.

133
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,930
Ciphertext.

134
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,730
OK, so I need to get details also.

135
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:39,000
So public static static, but again by.

136
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,930
And military engineers who eat this encryption.

137
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,130
They need to get this encryption.

138
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,730
And said this encryption warning.

139
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,770
Bringing the string.

140
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,390
Glenn IGST wants to.

141
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,810
Secret key and regression secret keeps secret.

142
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,220
And need to engineer it.

143
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,710
Now it is the long, metaphysical.

144
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,780
We really created by.

145
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,920
Small, small talk, but.

146
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,470
So let me tell you one thing here.

147
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,010
Let me put these two, says Mark, as my Oh.

148
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:58,620
Kings, and let me tell you why I'm here as it's happened, because all teams are determined.

149
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,910
Initiate.

150
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,570
Oh.

151
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:25,020
With her and Rooney as like this, including this, because there are many things you wish you would

152
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,660
do to me that exceptionalism.

153
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,030
To that, we require all risk.

154
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,270
Well, these are the plaintiffs secret key and initial victories, their attributes.

155
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,340
And now we are going to create one site for next and everything you.

156
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,610
So let me mention so for you so far.

157
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,420
Safer is building.

158
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,070
So full.

159
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,800
The great instance can get dangerous.

160
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,730
Atheists.

161
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:13,120
So it is that it is so full.

162
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,220
It is so fluid.

163
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,810
I'll go get them.

164
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,500
So.

165
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,520
It is all we currently.

166
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,880
That's name is a you see it.

167
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:55,870
Well, our decided is that OK, so this a CBSA for the block algorithm eat cake.

168
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,920
I would say put on with them.

169
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:10,710
Well, what I'm going to do this first, I forbid I'm required some I.V. parameters, pics of that part

170
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:15,960
and everything, so we will do that back later.

171
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:24,750
So consider I created two vectors with might, which is initial vector for initializing the randomizing

172
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,200
the part.

173
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:31,650
And so again, these take plaintext and keep going and the donkey can work with the ciphertext.

174
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,370
So hope you understand in the next part, we are going to complete this.
