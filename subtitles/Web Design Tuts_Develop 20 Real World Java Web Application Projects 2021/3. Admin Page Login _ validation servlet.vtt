00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:09.120
So we already have seen how we created or set up over the Java so late for this project.

2
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.230
And we know the basics of Java, so how we are going to use it.

3
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.990
So first we created in the exotic scheme and as I told you, for for the previous things.

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.110
And I added some cases while also your.

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.330
Known for Aramin logging on islands, you log in, I can read one page.

6
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.010
Basically, I told you in that video, I'm going to create that bridge.

7
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.920
So I created a log in page for editing, logging in for that, we are going to see how we can create

8
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.610
participant log in page on the same page also.

9
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.550
So in this this page, I'm going to create a logging union.

10
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:53.320
So now we can produce different images in Web pages, web page contents, all the web related or front

11
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.160
the related part.

12
00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.270
So just go there in that little part, right click on web page new and you can create extremely pages

13
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.660
from here.

14
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.770
So I created I already created this due to time constraint.

15
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.720
I will tell you how I'm going to create this.

16
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.950
You did this.

17
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.080
So this is the admin log in page.

18
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.540
As you all know, you can remove this part.

19
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.240
This is by default, but I'm going to remove this part on Zoom.

20
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.840
So this is a statement.

21
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.460
This is part of our project and everything.

22
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:30.870
And for this, I'm going to put log in video editing, and this uses so main thing and this is the fun

23
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.100
basically in what we are going to see is the form.

24
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.570
Basically, we are typing username and password in the form in the estimate.

25
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.700
So this is how we can get it from some later this post, we are going to post that form.

26
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.170
So here is the action action rules that what is action is going to do is validate any.

27
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.770
So what is the validity?

28
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.090
The validity is the name which I'm going to create one Java.

29
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.860
So look for validate that part.

30
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.930
So this name is very important.

31
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.500
So for the validation of I mean, I'm going to use its name from name or action as well.

32
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.260
Then this is user name.

33
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.970
I'm going to put device user name.

34
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.920
No need to put this username.

35
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.660
Then this so placeholder it should be using.

36
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.770
You can see the username placeholder, but name again the name.

37
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.980
And this action is very important due the meaningful name for this.

38
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.600
This parameter so this parameter name is a username, so it is on like that its validation name, or

39
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.810
we can see how we can recognize that spot user name partner by designing a username.

40
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.990
Similarly, for the password, this password if we password and each Typekit password so we can see

41
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.100
that the third part is extremement Bartlesville, and that's about all.

42
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.060
So I would just created Cintron for centralize everything and put it in single code.

43
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:07.560
So this is all about our creating a log I will reform and this just ensure that this is looking good.

44
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:31.430
So always remember the name for that parameter should be very significant and this action do meaningful

45
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.690
names for these things, don't get some random names or something like a B or C U the meaningful names.

46
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.040
So as you can see, our extremely partisan we can say log in partisan, but we can validate that.

47
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:53.300
So I'm considering admin have some or we can do the admin username and password by default.

48
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.760
No need to put in the database and everything.

49
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.030
So for that, I'm going to create one Java servlet, or we can say a Java program so we can clear Java

50
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.510
program.

51
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.380
All Java programs should inside ensure packages folder.

52
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.820
So just right click on source packages below the packages.

53
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.580
As Lapidus, you can see source packages like new and you can see third option is Java, so let's look

54
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.970
on there.

55
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.600
So when this is done, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this part because the name and

56
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.330
application lowercase is very important.

57
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.000
Validate it.

58
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.660
I'm just hoping this and I'm going to create new solid.

59
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.470
So this is so rude, there's no need to specify a package or anything because this very simple project,

60
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.100
if you want to enhance it more, you can create some inside that choose package.

61
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.090
You can create some default packages or some packages also late next year.

62
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.830
These are very important.

63
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.460
Add information to deployment descriptor, which is basically the list deployment descriptor.

64
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.250
So bookmark this.

65
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.210
This is very important and click finish.

66
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.540
Once it is done, it will create some default template in that default packages where literally, as

67
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.830
you can see you can to delete this despite coming out, then this is a little sweeping, related, deleted

68
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.150
also.

69
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.850
There is there are some default things mentioned in.

70
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.240
So you can delete this also, and you can delete this strike edge and everything.

71
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:35.440
So this is done now, so you can see this is validated really partisan and these all things are accepted

72
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.770
to minimize this, you can just I would not stop to not mention this part.

73
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.630
And then again, this is also even done with Java.

74
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.980
So let the likes of which is basically Java.

75
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.800
I'm inputting North Star.

76
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.880
Who and this is also Ugandan, which is pretty busy over there.

77
00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.020
So what are you going to put study on so you can remove this part of the slogan?

78
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.020
So I'm going to minimize this on things, important things.

79
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.110
So now you can see we are done with this part, but.

80
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.570
Or there is nothing inside this, so we are going to write Logic Logica.

81
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.650
So.

82
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.650
They're destroyed when logic.

83
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.080
Are we going to see a logical thing here?

84
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.380
So let me just like this and.

85
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.770
I think something is missing, OK?

86
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.580
You're.

87
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.420
What happened?

88
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.800
And.

89
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.780
OK, OK, OK.

90
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.870
You're going to delete this part of what I'm going to delete this culture because it is we are going

91
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.310
to create our own material.

92
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.980
And we have some.

93
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.530
Usually I'm going to do this, so that's it.

94
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.660
We already created this part, so let us begin with how we can create.

95
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.160
So always remember this public word or we can say so late class validated.

96
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.810
This tend to be so late.

97
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.930
It is a beautiful class inside Java.

98
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:29.350
After that, you can create your own method so you can create private or public method.

99
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.190
I'm going to create a public method or you're going to get it protected.

100
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.100
So if you want, you can create private or public.

101
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.380
I'm going to create public materials public.

102
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.370
Void then do post what is possible.

103
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.220
Page the data from that extreme page, and it will post something so do mean for taking the time posting,

104
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.510
and some are printing some things, so it'll be so late.

105
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.380
It is waste basically class, nothing more solid.

106
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.500
Now, this is a very important request.

107
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.110
For this request, I want to request.

108
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.350
So what is doing that for the request purpose?

109
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.750
It is creating some request, similarly for a response.

110
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.390
HTP, so let.

111
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.070
This.

112
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.760
Apartments.

113
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:28.180
What it will create, it will ask for a response so you can change your variables, according to that,

114
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.110
I'm getting response and request here only for this forward.

115
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.590
And what it does, it's to some exceptions.

116
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.620
What is the basis?

117
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.500
Basically exceptions rules.

118
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.730
Are you exception?

119
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.670
I exception.

120
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.830
So let exhibition.

121
00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:02.120
So instead of using Always Try Edge, I'm going to use this.

122
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.590
So.

123
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.900
It is showing me the error, basically, what is that?

124
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:10.830
OK, OK.

125
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.380
You did, asking you to create glass and everything, so no need, no need.

126
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.950
I created one glass and wanted to mention this.

127
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:26.030
In fact, we're going to delete this one after that, I will tell you how we can invoke this.

128
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:29.940
OK.

129
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.370
It will take time to reload everything.

130
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:44.820
So as you can see, we're not done with this party's GDP, so it's literally no exception, with solid

131
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.300
exception.

132
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.800
Remember, you have to put always the clothes and everything here.

133
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.300
Otherwise, it will not work.

134
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.670
So now let's build the logic.

135
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.730
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create some print right out of the statement.

136
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:07.670
So it is basically I operate off on Java, not daughter, you print, right?

137
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.470
Print writer.

138
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:13.730
I would.

139
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.830
Is equal to.

140
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.770
What I'm going to create, I'm going to ask for response.

141
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.600
Response, not great, writer.

142
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:27.860
So.

143
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:37.920
It will create some lingering precedent for what we will do in the out statement, it will respond and

144
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.110
would that part in the order?

145
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.390
But main usage of this is very important.

146
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.190
Always remember.

147
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:51.420
I mean, printing that statement, so it is very important to mention what these mean, but here you

148
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.600
can new ideas just to name, but you should use print writer for them to respond.

149
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.600
You cannot use anything here.

150
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:03.600
So I'm going to use string you in to fetch user name from a logging method.

151
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.390
So what I can do is I'm going to ask for a request request dot get parameter.

152
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:16.290
As you know the I mean, I'm the parameter method, so I'm going to ask for a good parameter.

153
00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:23.470
So this will ask me for the barometer, but which parameter I want, I won't hear a user username,

154
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:30.040
so I'm going to copy this in eLong initiative and a username because I mentioned that the name is this.

155
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.340
So similarly, I will put for this.

156
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.980
Which user?

157
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:44.830
Name and likeness, similarly, I'm going to fetch password, but for that, I'm not going to write

158
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:49.300
again this, I'm going to just P.W. here UW.

159
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.350
And I am going to change the name on this, you can copy paste this from here.

160
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.050
No need to check and tape it again.

161
00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:58.860
Just copy this.

162
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:00.610
And based.

163
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.200
I'm going to mention this is.

164
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:05.200
Which?

165
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.510
Password, so you didn't switch from that.

166
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.460
So let us see, I'm what I'm going to do.

167
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.950
I'm going to mention the setup of some username and password.

168
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.660
So for this case, I'm going to consider only four minutes.

169
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.820
So now, so now we are done with this part.

170
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.460
So I created a one zero one eight one zero room for you when you do you do you feel like we are seeing

171
00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:31.700
this?

172
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.730
So these are the four items with username and password.

173
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.230
So what is the logic, basically?

174
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.770
I told you I can use this VW.

175
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.130
So what I'm going to be, I'm going to create a defense letter here.

176
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.140
Let us see how we can create.

177
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.660
I will put me is.

178
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:50.650
Else.

179
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.550
Neither, Jake.

180
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:55.500
Entries.

181
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.160
Entries.

182
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.020
So let us see how we can create events.

183
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:10.260
So if I'm going to use this P.W. dog, you know, there is one job either you can directly use equals

184
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:17.850
as if you know you can use your equal if BW equals to be one.

185
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.330
OK.

186
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:20.860
And then.

187
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:29.100
BW, I also read you in that part of the username unbought equals.

188
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.850
You can see this is coming up one.

189
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:35.730
What he's going to do is.

190
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.380
It is going to create a request better.

191
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.970
So what is the request this budget?

192
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:47.930
It will dispatch that request, but I can say for that response, it is dispensing or dispatching the

193
00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.060
request, this dispatcher.

194
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.800
This is just by default.

195
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.470
The method already is my username, although I can see for variable.

196
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.300
Request Dot.

197
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.120
Request dispatcher.

198
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:11.770
I'm going to copy this, but I'm not going to print this again because this picture where is going through

199
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:18.340
this dispatch, I need to mention next page as this is our password and usernames are correct, it should

200
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.640
forward to the next page as best practice.

201
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:27.430
So I'm going to give the name as admin event for the next which issue and.

202
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.380
So it will respond to that also.

203
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:38.610
So, OK, before that recall displeasure, I forgot requests.

204
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.320
Don't get.

205
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:47.910
I thought it would get tricky with this budget, we are creating this, but where it should be getting

206
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.160
so it is not a request, this venture.

207
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.740
So there is one important statement here.

208
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.110
This is not what I consider dispatching.

209
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.710
It is just creating that it should go there.

210
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.390
So using elseif I created for you, do you do seem to be anywhere in this game?

211
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:13.390
I'm going to forward this similarly for this BW all things I created, if the credentials are incorrect,

212
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.780
we are going to stay on this page.

213
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.430
So I'm going to mention here is the beautiful thing in the Java.

214
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:24.050
So look, you can use instruments in Baltimore center one.

215
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:29.510
I'm going to bring this please undervalued and valid username and password for.

216
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.590
And we.

217
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:38.510
So I'm going to bring this on extremely page, so it is not going to print on our command line or something,

218
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.410
it is going to print on.

219
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.590
So it should be some instruments indexed universal.

220
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.700
I would this.

221
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:50.550
Now I'm going to stick with this, but what is going this is going to forward, but it should stay on

222
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.620
the same page for those staying on the same page.

223
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.670
I'm going to include I'm going to use include.

224
00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.890
So this is all we've done.

225
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:04.690
But remember, we are going to use your this sentence.

226
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:13.180
But how the Java program will understand that this is the word I'm telling you something and fixed or

227
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.610
something is given for that purpose.

228
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.640
I'm going to say the content for this.

229
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.200
So no content checking is very simple.

230
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.350
Response Dot set content.

231
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:34.780
Contained by Capital Day, remember, these are the too default detergents are Jell-O.

232
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.750
You can put this next.

233
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.170
Slash estimates it can be text or estimate.

234
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.860
So something is wrong on.

235
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:50.890
OK, OK.

236
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.040
We are done with this.

237
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.630
No, we are done with this.

238
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.420
So we are done with this hour now.

239
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.430
I will deploy this and I will tell you how it's going to work.

240
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:10.560
So as you know, if our deployment, as I told you, this is created by this is our next thing.

241
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.830
So let's go to the Army Logan, which, as you can see, we created alter ego Adam in Logan.

242
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.580
Or you can change the format enabling you.

243
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.390
So I'm going to put the username.

244
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.430
So I'm going to put username e one zero one four eight one zero one.

245
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.130
We know the password one two three four.

246
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.160
As you can see, four, zero 04 is not one because we haven't cleared it further.

247
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.390
That pipe later on, we are going to create that part everything.

248
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:42.220
But before that, what I can do, I can put some different parts of two, three, four or five.

249
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.150
I'm going to pump.

250
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:49.390
So you can see, please enter a valid username and password for as you can see, our password is different.

251
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.470
Similarly, I'm putting a one zero eight.

252
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.740
That is not to mention that admin is not mentioned.

253
00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.810
I'm going to put some random thing here again.

254
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:05.710
So it is going to validate everything, and it's asking, please enter username and password for username

255
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:05.980
four.

256
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:12.900
And so this is how we are going to validate admin page for the participant log in what we are going

257
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.320
to create.

258
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:19.620
We are asking two participants or your guest to first sign up our page so that.
