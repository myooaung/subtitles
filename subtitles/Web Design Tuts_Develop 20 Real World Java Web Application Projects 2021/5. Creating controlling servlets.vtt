1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.910
In previous material, I told you how we created everything.

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.860
So this is basically beautiful.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.570
I already created this inside the deal.

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.400
And it's very simple and this would deal with him.

5
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:24.040
So it is similar to a library and where it's required some mediapart already created in this Tudor.

6
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.160
I'm going to create some let's and I'll part, and in the next room, I'm going to play on the server.

7
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.350
So let us create how we can create this volume.

8
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.150
So let me close this part first.

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:46.370
OK, so long, what is required methods we need now to see first, because we need to add some to your.

10
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.530
So let me create one.

11
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.730
Soledad, which is basically and inside let.

12
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.340
Next, yes.

13
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.660
Let me close this part.

14
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.360
It will create some different things, you didn't close this.

15
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.040
And now I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going to import some exceptions and everything was.

16
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.500
In two different libraries and using no, I'm importing some methods here, which is basically benign

17
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.980
deal.

18
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.810
So I'm importing.

19
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.860
Beings not start.

20
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.960
I mean, 40.

21
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:44.270
Bill started, so it will ask me for every method inside that package, so no need to add it again and

22
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.600
again.

23
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.380
Let me create notation here, because I mentioned you and we're doing it because.

24
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.940
So let's not.

25
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.490
So we are done with this, and let me add some methods here.

26
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.620
So this is over at local level in part.

27
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.090
So as you can see, this is done, but we need to create some more methods also, which is basically

28
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.960
a book form and everything.

29
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.850
So we will create it later.

30
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.070
We are now focusing with this one.

31
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.680
So this is basically I'm creating print statements and everything, and this is all about human.

32
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.300
And this is a dispatcher, and I'm including this part.

33
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.240
So what is doing this you do as an equal number call and all these parameters with that form name and

34
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.300
book, then book so successfully if this is done and soon to be part.

35
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:10.260
Or any of them is natural settlements, and it will bring that and it will be related to that part.

36
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.140
So this are not Jonah.

37
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.910
Let me create one another thing which is basically a book form.

38
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.610
We haven't created a book format.

39
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.400
Why it is required because.

40
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.270
No.

41
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.970
We created a mini log in, similarly, we need to create this part also.

42
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.350
And Boots first.

43
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.560
Then close this volume just to copy the code, basically, because you I am concerned, I don't want

44
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.730
to focus on that, but I'm going to focus on the simpler things here first.

45
00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.090
So let me import some libraries, default libraries, then let me import some.

46
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.030
Bill Dodd started because I'm going to mention that, but also you.

47
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.060
Then let me create one annotation you'd.

48
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.370
You're the first.

49
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.690
And let me add some different things.

50
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.200
I'm getting.

51
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.090
Well, so.

52
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.070
So this is all about this and in this.

53
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.140
It's OK.

54
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.680
So now we are done with book on what we need to create some extremely points in the next two roll,

55
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.000
I'm going to tell you how we are going to create the fence.

56
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:47.600
So it is all about this ad from the new ad, but from what will do, it will do that on Mujtaba and

57
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:55.610
a form that in the proposed back in part, but it should be very helpful by deploying in the solid.

58
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.790
Similarly, we are in meeting with our library and.

59
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.150
We created eye level library and form, but we haven't created a librarian method was.

60
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.830
So.

61
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.550
Let me clear that part, also a librarian mentioned it to the live broadcast, I mean.

62
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.050
Let me close this first.

63
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.790
Let me.

64
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.760
This.

65
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.620
Then.

66
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.810
In both.

67
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.310
Deodorant star.

68
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.580
Import.

69
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.700
Being North Star so long, I mean, putting everything you.

70
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.150
No, let me.

71
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.070
You some 14 year.

72
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.160
So now we're done with this, our librarian.

73
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:10.520
And why am I'm importing this part, you will understand when deploying this in a library, in a stimulus

74
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.120
and everything.

75
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.420
We need to invoke that part and we are using that method with library and being and being everything

76
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.250
in would be being onshore.

77
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.390
So this is all about how we can get to a library and form.

78
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.930
He's already created admin log in is also created, but the lead book is going to be retrieved.

79
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.780
So let me create one delete book method because we mentioned that we are going to delete edit.

80
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:40.430
Also, you should consult with local terminal for the local library and when we were created, we need

81
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.190
to mention some delete a written issue, book purpose.

82
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.350
So let me create one delete book material.

83
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.200
So let's salute again.

84
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.540
This is the click finish.

85
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.290
Then.

86
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.590
If you're going to your ID, you will understand everything.

87
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.030
Let me do this for us.

88
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.020
If you want, you can keep that part, but.

89
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.220
I already mentioned that.

90
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.250
You can create some code already, and you can use that again and again.

91
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:22.260
Let me import delimiter because for this, we are creating that delete book part and it is clear that

92
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.250
delete part.

93
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.770
Again, this is basically so only.

94
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:37.260
These are no longer required because it's not operating in existence, so you can do that and oh, let

95
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.000
me check is the view of you.

96
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.040
We haven't mentioned it.

97
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.380
So we need to create a new book methodology here.

98
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.490
But before this, all.

99
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:55.400
We need to create some or new book also, so let me mention all the things you.

100
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:07.530
So when mentioning this alert, because it is intended so that if you did this a librarian, you have

101
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.880
to check all the things you're.

102
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:17.470
The job also is extremely lonely, so no need to mention this always due to fully specified names.

103
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:18.820
Your.

104
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:25.830
So similarly, in the I'm going to read some of your book letters on some.

105
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:32.050
So this is done by the library in mythology, remaining well.

106
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:38.200
So in the next part, I'm creating only this and I'm going to explain this delete and everything.

107
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:39.840
So.

108
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.020
Let us clear, don't delete this part of.

109
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.870
So I am not mentioning this again and again, because it's very simple logic.

110
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:03.530
OK, now, and what is this the rule book is do do get any ability it will get a request or parameter

111
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:09.230
using call number basically from their delete part, and it will look really solid and it will display

112
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.160
on the viewable part.

113
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.270
So this is all about these things.

114
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.350
So let me also.

115
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:23.220
So I'm what I'm doing is just I created all the parts, but I need to mention the methods since and

116
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.920
disadvantage because it's a controlling part who.

117
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:34.140
Leading, except also because said the deal, only I mentioned all these things.

118
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.410
So I'm using the new method again and again.

119
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.750
And View Library and is also done, but.

120
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.350
So again, this will be delayed librarian metal using similar methods.

121
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.970
So in the four other things, I'm going to create a little library in a library and some issue issue

122
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:16.930
level, inform local library and library and log in, then some written book written books on view book

123
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:17.230
form.

124
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.800
So I will explain it in the next video.

125
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:26.500
I will briefly use that template and everything in this video, and I will explain this part in the

126
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.120
next video.

127
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.260
So you understand this part.

128
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:36.730
What I did is I just created the you and Bean method, which is purely based on that part or logic.

129
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.760
But in so limited, I'm creating some controlling part because we've mentioned everything, but I'm

130
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:49.240
creating all the data in the subjects only, and I'm mentioning that in the end, I'm using logic of

131
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.790
deal and packages in search of it.

132
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.820
So this is it for this tutorial.

133
00:10:55.150 --> 00:11:00.970
In the next thing, I'm going to mention you and I'm going to tell you how I used everything here and

134
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.730
I I'll I will create some web pages also here.

135
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.240
So this report issued earlier.
