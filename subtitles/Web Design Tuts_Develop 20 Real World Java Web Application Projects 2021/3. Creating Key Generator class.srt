1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:09,210
So now we are going to be available for our first order on the steps of development is understanding

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,290
what is looking to see it.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,910
So this project is, we can see deployed in blue box.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:25,530
First, we are going to create on console or console team here, which is unsought application for Java

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,850
to understand the different algorithms and how the would have to later on.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,330
We will discuss the solid part which our application we're going to see, which is providing encryption

7
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,680
and decryption interfaces.

8
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:45,420
So was this really relevant, which is you are alluding to the previous projects to customize that back

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,360
in the preferences?

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,120
I certainly welcome page or.

11
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,570
So hit new project here.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:05,690
Well, you mean the new project window for, you know, there will be no lag, there is some lag, well,

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,940
deploying this for me.

14
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,720
The statement.

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,660
OK.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,010
So for me, new project is started.

17
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,430
It will do one thing I do dear previously my mentor.

18
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,660
We don't want many.

19
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,670
Really glad you had a Java project.

20
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,730
So let it be loading, it is taking decades for me.

21
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,170
Saw Jews go abroad, you.

22
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,960
You're sitting in my new 16., didn't one to virgin it next.

23
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,830
Oh, don't do this it next.

24
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,210
Oh, these are some of the things most mentioned in.

25
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,510
Encryption, key electromagnetic encryption, encryption.

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,450
See this.

27
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,820
And you finish so it will take time to get a building for me.

28
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:44,660
So if you want to change different things related to cryptography, you may check on internet.

29
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:52,610
There is a lot of information available for different algorithms, but most common algorithms I already

30
00:02:52,610 --> 00:03:02,480
know new and I already shared the previous information about cryptography, how it's important for different

31
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,080
purposes.

32
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,650
So wait for sometime.

33
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,220
Do these ideas based things need to be created?

34
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,790
The source told anybody thing for me, and we need for something to hide.

35
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,980
What happens?

36
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,880
So he's looking for me now.

37
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:45,970
First, I'm not going to or directly, I'm going to created for Steve.

38
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,090
My name is forward.

39
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,700
Oh, hold the keys generated.

40
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,710
So let us see who actually key generation part votes.

41
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,030
OK.

42
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:05,090
How is actually eating smoking here and what is the basic thing, so I'm going to explain here.

43
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,440
So let us do that by trying to create that part.

44
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:19,280
So let me mention one thing here, which is I'm going to create one class here.

45
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:06,760
So for some time to response the idea, it will automatically detect your bias and everything.

46
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,440
This.

47
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,630
So in the ICRC folder.

48
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,280
More to the ICRC team here.

49
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:20,740
We'll start to see you and choose your new glass.

50
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,520
So for me, I'm sitting to the semantic as my last name.

51
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,250
There should be one complete cluster mentioned as a symmetrical.

52
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,580
And he didn't do it, he one class for you, for me to make me miss so much.

53
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,040
It will take time to create your own glass, and it would appease.

54
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:02,540
So once you go to this, you can check your semantic glasses created, and now let me minimize this

55
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,440
because this is no longer.

56
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:15,870
OK, so this is my semantic glass, which is going to have some glass, which is going to create an

57
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,650
evil.

58
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:22,410
So for me, I'm for this really only or this tutorial.

59
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:28,520
What I'm going to create, I'm going glass the idea.

60
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,610
You mentioned to me.

61
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,430
Submitted to kill.

62
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:50,610
Oh, then it's been mentioned on screen, I'm using it good, so.

63
00:07:51,940 --> 00:08:00,860
Yes, let me mention well before that, it shouldn't be final, so let me mention public static final.

64
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,160
So I mean.

65
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,460
Hopefully, not only for me, so I'm enjoying this, it's fine, a little one can taste this.

66
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,150
Yes.

67
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:18,980
So I want to stick it to that, but then I'm going to create one function.

68
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,560
To create one secret look.

69
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,820
I'm going to create one solution to store the secret.

70
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,000
The saying, why are you there?

71
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:41,830
It is as final arguing you shouldn't be given OK function to create some security by ammunition is final

72
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:47,200
because yes, my algorithm we mention algorithm for.

73
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,830
Encryption.

74
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,700
For encryption.

75
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,100
This is my final algorithm,

76
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,750
which is a advance encryption to make a deal with them.

77
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,440
I would use them.

78
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,800
But let me mention one.

79
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,420
Function public spending.

80
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,210
Secret.

81
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,680
He.

82
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,310
Police, state security.

83
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,560
Secret key.

84
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,240
All there is one before things.

85
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,930
Three, eight, three eight.

86
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,980
He is 80, yes.

87
00:09:53,430 --> 00:10:04,850
So from here and us, so ultimately, so why I used your Orlando crypto job security is going to you.

88
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,970
Oh no.

89
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,880
Richard Cruise.

90
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,820
Exceptional because there is exception, it should throw some exception.

91
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,450
Then.

92
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,060
I'm going to create new instances of insecure random glass.

93
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:40,560
In new instances, when you see object instances for new classes, you basically see good random classes.

94
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,490
And you mentioned Glass on that maybe not erode.

95
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,750
We will understand why been this?

96
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,270
So.

97
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:04,680
Good, random, I'm going to mention good, random as secure, random.

98
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,010
We want done.

99
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,250
Secured random.

100
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,000
Is equal to new.

101
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:25,080
Securing them so this is my object for good random team, which is going to be the random class for

102
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,130
me by since the string to each other.

103
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,180
OK, now what I regret string to 300.

104
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,900
Since June, I need to pass this gene in.

105
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:50,100
So passing screen is very easy key generator.

106
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,150
There is one default function generator.

107
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,860
He can be done if he wins again.

108
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:05,120
He generated physical new key generator.

109
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,610
And I need to mention the algorithm.

110
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,780
So what is the matter with?

111
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,770
He was j used only.

112
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,880
But, you know, I need to mention here instances why I need instances.

113
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:26,720
So for the East spoke for this key generator, which are good them I'm going to use.

114
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,790
I need to ensure they get instances.

115
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:32,810
So.

116
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,430
No, that is for me to do.

117
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,240
Let me.

118
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,950
And this again.

119
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,130
You you generator.

120
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,540
Dick.

121
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,420
In this.

122
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,940
So there might be.

123
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,670
OK, I need to go.

124
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,010
Don't go into space.

125
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:15,900
I will.

126
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:22,510
The role of new because I'm not creating any instances I'm mentioning directly instances yes or no,

127
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,660
no, not one way to specify a new thing here.

128
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,410
Then I need to mention the initialize the key generator.

129
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,360
Initial rise, Ye Jin.

130
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:44,480
Initially.

131
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:52,880
I mentioned here with 256 256 bit that we will be initially.

132
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,310
So that's a data breach, which is going to convert 256 bit risk.

133
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,250
It's going to randomly get 256 bit sticky.

134
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:10,730
Then what I'm going to do is, oh, you generation initiative, so it's very easy to generate a and

135
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,780
you need to 56 and we're going to do this.

136
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,310
This is my disease.

137
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,090
No.

138
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:28,080
Not with this one guy I need to mention, which are going, you know, securing them and intervention

139
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:28,770
securing them.

140
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,650
So what will be happening 256 bit random randomly?

141
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,880
It's not independently.

142
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,220
Then I need to mention security.

143
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,810
Security.

144
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:59,760
Vic Bridges instance, security as my key part for which, but police won't let me mention a small key,

145
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:11,000
right, with which key generator will keep the generator gripped the nation off key, which is basically

146
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,690
generating.

147
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,060
So it will generate key foreign.

148
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,580
No return for.

149
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,850
So, no, you should listen.

150
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,160
So this is a metaphor for creating the key generation part and everything.

151
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:42,610
So in the next part, I'm going to create and I'm going to summarize this because this is not completed,

152
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:50,830
but it's just instances of its algorithm which isn't going to create class to create key with symmetric.

153
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,520
So it will randomize things like it's going to work.

154
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,050
Welcome.

155
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,130
Kathy?
