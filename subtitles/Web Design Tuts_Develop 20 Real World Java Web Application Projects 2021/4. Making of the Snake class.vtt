WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.660
So now, after the successful creation of the flame, we are going to have some customization to the

2
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.820
flame where the game is being run.

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.750
So you must have seen that on running this snake dance class.

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.870
The flame opens to the top left section.

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.950
Let me run this and show it to you.

6
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.950
Yes.

7
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.200
So the frame opens at the top left corner and there is option to maximize it and minimize.

8
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:44.300
So if it won the game in a limited frame like us, fixed height and fixed rate for this thing to be

9
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.850
colliding and all completed again.

10
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.510
So we have to fix this to fix our border.

11
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.710
And also, it should be open in the middle of the page, not in the top left corner.

12
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.500
The top left corner is the origin light.

13
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.220
Here it is zero two locations.

14
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.000
So we have to move this to the middle.

15
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.450
Not open here.

16
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.570
It should be opened in the middle of the page by default on Romney.

17
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.490
So like this, right?

18
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.710
I think some call for doing so.

19
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.820
So we have to set location.

20
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.840
Relating to natural.

21
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.990
Segregation, a letters to companies and passing the argument as no.

22
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.360
Also for.

23
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:52.370
For the size to be not altered, a fixed name should be fixed in the beginning, so I have said resizable

24
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.630
as false.

25
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.590
So the frame can't be minimized or maximized later towards.

26
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.520
Now let us try to run this.

27
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.710
On running this.

28
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.450
The frame opens in them office.

29
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.820
So now we have said, let's say, to design the false positives are false parameters.

30
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.020
The frame is now not able to be maximized or minimized.

31
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.820
It is showing up like invisible part is shown for the maximized.

32
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.910
But then we can close this and open this and escape from this.

33
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.960
Now our aim should be to set that guidance for this scheme, like after this Java coffee mug option.

34
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.700
We have to show our side.

35
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:54.480
So for setting the timer as we have already used this feature, serve the title as inside this.

36
00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.860
They have to pass their title for the game like suppose I am passing it as Snake or Ophelia.

37
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.560
No, snake, Ofelia.

38
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.910
Yes, perfect.

39
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.120
So I have said that done for the game.

40
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.760
Now let me try to run this and see if the title is perfectly on.

41
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.900
OK, so we have said the title for the flame inside which the game is going to be played.

42
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.170
Now, after sending that title, moving the frame to the middle of the page, setting the recyclability

43
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:40.990
two floors, we will have a black screen like a document screen for Disney for a better appearance of

44
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.560
the game.

45
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:50.350
Now we have completed this snake glass moving towards the board glass in the Boulder Java file.

46
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.090
We've set up magnum color for the frame.

47
00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.500
So inside the board object, I am going to set goal this set background.

48
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.150
Yes.

49
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:16.410
So I am calling this segment down Mentone and inside, which I am passing no color as color, not black

50
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.740
as they want the background to be black in color.

51
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.580
So let try and run this if it is perfectly working or not.

52
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.340
So waiting for the execution.

53
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.510
Yes, it is perfectly, said Tony Blair, our background in black, our starting is done.

54
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:49.740
Now switching to the fact that they have been a prototype and see what tasks are so be performed after

55
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.120
the creation of the same.

56
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.680
So yes, we have created a our project.

57
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.190
Are there the images to the project inside Dyck and folder?

58
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.110
We have created a frame.

59
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:09.630
Now we have to place images inside the frame and complete the images section after which we will be

60
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.020
ironing keyboard events and action is next to the project.

61
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:23.550
So let's begin closing this and now trying to add some more -- for the image section.

62
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:34.910
Now in our of finding images inside the frame, firstly, we have to create a function called as public

63
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.390
law images.

64
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:45.960
So firstly, we have to load the images to our program tree and then only we can set positions for it,

65
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.540
or we can say that we can discern the places where they're going to be.

66
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.180
So calling a major icon?

67
00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:04.990
I suppose for the first one, like it was Apple, so naming it as I one image, one this implies and

68
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:13.750
imagery going again and inside this, they are going to call Glass Lauder companies.

69
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.120
Plus, Northern Dart gets system.

70
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.280
Plus system resource.

71
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.080
So that's a hard one.

72
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.150
And inside this, we have to call the parts for they need.

73
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.280
So we have to this inside the bracket.

74
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.780
I am testing it.

75
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.360
And inside the name, they have said that far right, we have.

76
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:52.310
So we have to tighten up up Afghanistan's before too, like if we close, we have to ride the path from

77
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.730
hell.

78
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.770
So inside a side, see, we have an icon.

79
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.890
So I am writing it.

80
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.360
Does I then?

81
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.220
Inside, I guess we have applejack brandy.

82
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.510
So I think it does.

83
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:11.020
Icons slash apple, not BMG.

84
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.590
So this is the part for the Apple object.

85
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:31.870
The program has lawyers now, similarly for the boat guards, the green one and the one, so copping

86
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.520
this part from her.

87
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.610
And trying to paste it.

88
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.720
Normal times.

89
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:51.870
Father, green daughter and the red dot, which is the head of changing it, does let me see the path.

90
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:59.460
It says daughter Benji the green one and Heather Benji for the ride.

91
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:05.700
So each second one should be simple the head.

92
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:16.320
So the head one is the head nod Benji and the third one green door as.

93
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.210
Dot dot.

94
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.270
Do you think it was a strike?

95
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.050
Yes.

96
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.110
So there are no letters, no.

97
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.880
That is a great underlined in this story today.

98
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.280
So firstly, we have to.

99
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.630
Call it in the.

100
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:46.610
Class board, so inside the class board, we have to create the private like a global variable for all

101
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.750
the tremendous.

102
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:57.370
Without which we are not able to call the images anywhere in the program so far globally declaring it,

103
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.010
we have to do this three more times.

104
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.650
Image by letting.

105
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.370
Let us copy this two more times.

106
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:13.840
So pasting it two more times for the Herald and the North.

107
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.260
So far, they're not.

108
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.370
And for the head.

109
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.650
Yes.

110
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.030
So this is done now.

111
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:35.630
So after earning the images as the global body was now so up make the images are bad enough and we have

112
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.460
the quality.

113
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.300
I do not get it.

114
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:48.020
So using that image mentor, we are going to call these three images now for the Guardian in part,

115
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.560
like, let me show we have a coordinate.

116
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.360
This is the y axis and this is the x axis.

117
00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:01.940
So thinking it does a coordinate, we have the X coordinate and coordinate.

118
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:11.330
So we have to call global variables as an array like X and Y, and we have total three hundred dart

119
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:12.440
total.

120
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.170
Three hundred into three hundred is nine hundred.

121
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.680
So we have three hundred as our Vic.

122
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.280
Let me show this to you in the more section.

123
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:21.680
Yes.

124
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.760
So we have said the preferred sizes three hundred by 300.

125
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:33.740
So love all our small sum up to nine to nine hundred like handed this to me.

126
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.880
Under this, every line contains three hundred dollars.

127
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:48.020
So on multiplying it, we can see that there are nine hundred dollars in total and we have set a random

128
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.880
position for the snake.

129
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:54.040
So under our daughter's ten.

130
00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:02.630
So basically the size of their daughter is ten units in the beginning and then no position for that.

131
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:08.960
But we can see that the Apple changes its position after every stone like this.

132
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.410
Try to run this and see what I am talking about.

133
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.340
So when we try to run this snake, but if I.

134
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.460
We can see that the game begins and the snake.

135
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.260
So this is the new program.

136
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.300
Let me show this to you in the minute.

137
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:35.820
So when we started the game now but have a random position anywhere in the frame and the snakes start

138
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:44.460
from this point, you see the cards thus need stars from some disposition every time and opportunities

139
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.150
position.

140
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:52.580
So we have a fixed position for the object and a random position for the Apple.

141
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:58.020
So they're not is fixed and the Apple has a random position.

142
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.310
After this, we have said all the positions.

143
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.300
Now we have the images of images.

144
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.780
In the beginning we have three dogs, so we have to add one dart after another.

145
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:21.990
And for this, we are going to use a funnel inside the new public image class.

146
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.660
So public static.

147
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.850
A public void in me and inside me.

148
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.940
I am going to create a follow so that images can manage one after another.

149
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.210
It's like void and inside.

150
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.330
We are going to have no follow up.

151
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:49.570
So we have created a for loop for the imagination in this next morning.

152
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.170
So initially we have three doors.

153
00:12:52.810 --> 00:13:03.820
Let me be clarify, some let here as private and as the dark sizes integer, so we have to initialize

154
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:03.980
it.

155
00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.940
That's private and not.

156
00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:16.370
So after this, the deadline is vanished, so after which the final part is executed, that we have

157
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:24.290
a starting position for the first remains and it should be less than two hours initially it is three

158
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.370
a.m. It is no.

159
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.230
One size as the snakes eat Snapple and grows in size.

160
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:39.560
So the initial position is that as the x axis is 50 minus then and y axis, so the distance from the

161
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:47.870
X and y axis for this NE is so this is the distance from the y axis and this entire distance from the

162
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.680
x axis.

163
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:55.100
So the body of this may have this distance from what the axis in the beginning.

164
00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:03.940
And after creating these new functions, we have to call it inside the board object as loading images

165
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:13.310
on a need to do so, we have successfully created two parts of the four them AV node images and you

166
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.980
is now in the next part.

167
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:22.770
We are going to create that position for the apples and the rest, apart from the filter type we have

168
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.340
created.

169
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.540
So see you in the next five.
