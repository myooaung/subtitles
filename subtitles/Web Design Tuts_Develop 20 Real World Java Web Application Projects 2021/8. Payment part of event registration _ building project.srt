1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,830
So in further cases, I don't see how we can create event and everything.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,280
So no, I will go with those some fast methods I'm going to tell you.

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:17,750
So for them, these all in, we're completely in for the admin part or the version of events and everything

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:24,440
inside this, I'm going to deploy all things or as I told you, so first, we need to create the registration

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,360
of our participants.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,670
First entry, I'm going to create one instrument registered instrument, so as I don't do that in the

7
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,810
partnership participants even.

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,260
There is one view event.

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:44,000
So let us deal with the View event or I don't want to go to the extreme, but I want to display everything

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,350
inside the job only.

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,050
I'm going to create every form the starting instrument tagged with the ending of the body.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,310
I want to create and display the instrument based through the job, only for that purpose.

13
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,030
I'm going to create one so that we went to one instrument.

14
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,940
Oh, it's funny, you one Java.

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,440
For that purpose, I created this.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,250
So after this, I told you, I already told you how we can going with this.

17
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,390
So for these members, we can go in with this part for outdoor learning everything.

18
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,840
And with the morning.

19
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:27,180
So you can create in one single plus and then can all these and send one statement.

20
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,690
But for the simplicity, I'm considering different, different segments.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,380
It will not change your image, you or anything it will do, mincing then with the Oracle database and

22
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,860
setting this all the connections and everything, then create statements.

23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,690
I'm getting the statement for part of moving the data from the event database.

24
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,410
I'm going to use statements.

25
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,300
Let's start from event, which is basically event details.

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,280
So for that event, it is.

27
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,820
It will.

28
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,710
Jake, every event details you're details reading, so I'm going to show in tabular form.

29
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:09,000
So using the CIUSSS, I need to improve this on so you can improve your courses, things you ought to

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,300
do.

31
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:16,470
But for the simplicity, I'm going to use your table simply so this simple, able, able bodied with

32
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,500
one with the little and everything I'm specifying here.

33
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,960
So no need to worry about this is one and how we can proceed with this.

34
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:30,840
It will take care of older, more ratings than these that some titan see no event name.

35
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,790
Even name then coordinator and coordinator contact.

36
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,130
And I mean, remove this part of the show because.

37
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:52,990
It will take more space, coordinated contact fees when you did so you can add more fields like this

38
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,220
picture and everything, you can add image part on to there.

39
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,170
You have to upload the image of something.

40
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,940
You can use different parts like that.

41
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,940
You can create some cookies to store passwords and everything data.

42
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,370
So there are more things you can search and put into this.

43
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,440
But I'm going to be sitting inside this.

44
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,340
So.

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,970
As these are done, what is while are so new executing.

46
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,960
So I want to display each and everything inside this event table or event database to what I'm going

47
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,730
to do is I'm going to create a report next as this lobby's endless.

48
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:35,530
This will not end at all or we don't need until we reach the end part like this is the end of this year.

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,490
This is the last known of this database.

50
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,250
It will in the pilot.

51
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,950
So for these, what is going to your desk?

52
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,050
It's going to fetch in them what is in here even numbered?

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,940
But how would my extreme string in them or the significance of enemies?

54
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:59,450
The Enum is the similar character name, or we can see similar to that variable, which I used for the

55
00:03:59,450 --> 00:03:59,720
store.

56
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,310
You ain't no inside.

57
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:09,790
Database, so always remember, these names are very significant, always remember what you do on that

58
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,150
school, run the school command line to create a database.

59
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,380
It's very important.

60
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:20,260
Then I'm going to do this and I'm going to be inside the Rose Garden.

61
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,180
I'm going to insert dirt roads.

62
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, then connection commit.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,220
I'm committing this connection and closing this connection and being all the times which I invoked already

64
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,660
the table and everything I decided to do for the event.

65
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,560
Or you even for a part similiar part, I'm going to show on the participant part also.

66
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,430
You can create another meter or you can hide something like you can hide some coordinator.

67
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,080
No, no or anything.

68
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,630
But I want to show everything, do not publicly.

69
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,950
What are the participants?

70
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,830
So these are done, but for the participants, I'm going to show the two things.

71
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,300
What are the participants of what?

72
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,590
I'm going to show two things.

73
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:05,200
One is you were in securities registration for the registration and you mean what I'm going to do is

74
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,110
I'm going to create another one form for you to action register so that you study to basically the loss

75
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,410
of learning to register their all things like, you know, even no even name, card number, expiry

76
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,610
date, CV, etc., etc. So you can include this also.

77
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,630
Otherwise, you can put the View event as another.

78
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,780
You can create one another address to show the event.

79
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:36,370
In the next part of the part, you can create one event register button there and clicking it will proceed

80
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,630
for the registration page on.

81
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,320
So I'm creating one simple scenario fill the form.

82
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:48,490
Because I'm using the CSIS and everything here, it will take time to check everything, every part.

83
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,810
So for this, I'm going to go through with an even name the no enter interguard expiry dates.

84
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,870
And once this is actually posted for the payment gateway.

85
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,030
So I'm proceeding with this.

86
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:08,350
So this is all about how we can create that, it is just an estimate of what it is, but we need to

87
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,830
create one registers the disturb civilians.

88
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,140
So go to the register that this so before that, you need to create.

89
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,910
So let's go to this source packages right click on new and so it.

90
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,350
Again, I'm telling you to click that, but also to add it to them.

91
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,790
They got not examined flight.

92
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,480
So go to that register, go up.

93
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,830
And I already created it at each and every call because it takes time to run and go to the court about

94
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,780
why you are writing in the first time.

95
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,590
It will take time.

96
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:48,460
But if you use to this part, this is very easy, but I'm telling.

97
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:55,610
So I am preaching from where I'm going to email bomb on this.

98
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,910
So these are again, I'm going to use the post meter.

99
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,130
But with all that, you should remember what I'm going to use the areas in view event I'm using get.

100
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,970
So why I'm using the word method is.

101
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,470
I'm not I'm this lineage publicly.

102
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:22,360
Second thing, I don't want to waste time full of users on this to show that we went is so do through

103
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,440
this very fast.

104
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,040
They do post if I'm using do post, I'm not posting anything.

105
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,620
I'm just sleeping this and I'm displaying.

106
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,250
So do get method for reaching the request.

107
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,620
It's very efficient.

108
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,020
So I am using this tool inside this registered or Java.

109
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:46,060
As I told you, this is print writer I'm facing from dual form, from that card number and everything.

110
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,190
So inside this, my sequence is different.

111
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:49,880
Not, no.

112
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,520
Don't worry about your sequence.

113
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,890
Your form sequence is different and the sequence is different.

114
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,970
Nothing will happen.

115
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:01,570
So for my purpose for storing inside the database, I'm using this sequence was card number.

116
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:08,140
Then event date didn't query then cardholder name, ID, name and your name.

117
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:16,430
I'm going to stay tuned to the card database, so you'll notice the listing or let me, well, some

118
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,390
part of what you're.

119
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,220
I'm pretending that connection with data database.

120
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:31,970
So you know how we can connect to this, our database system similarly like that you can show it to

121
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,910
the database or connect to the database.

122
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:41,780
Then again, I'm printing or inserting this into the database until basic values all the values inside

123
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,200
the card.

124
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:49,610
So always remember you have to create that similar or those inside the table of card like these.

125
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:55,640
If you see an extra connection or commit connection that goes to inside the registration, you always

126
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,730
see the which should be in the password will make Dot Dot Dot CVB.

127
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,400
Then you can also use that if equivalent is not more than three, then there is the error.

128
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:14,960
If card number is not exist on its value, you can check or you can check for the expiry date for that.

129
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,220
You can create such.

130
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,300
But once it's done, you can go with this payment.

131
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,460
So supplementation, you doing lose nothing but showing the information in your payment is done or something

132
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,840
or proceeding to the payment gateway, etcetera, etcetera.

133
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,820
You won't do that or proceeding or printing some.

134
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:40,460
Our transaction history page or transaction or anything you can do, so this is all about the list of

135
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,690
each.

136
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:48,790
So as I told you, you need to clear the one payment for payment is likely not very simple.

137
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,210
I will bring you this welcome to payment for Audible.

138
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,070
You can use similar things didn't like.

139
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,600
Beaming beach, cetera things here, are you going to add when it is going to back, be anything you've

140
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,490
entered into your reading, just this.

141
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:14,180
Once it is done, you need or you created everything to insert this transaction details.

142
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,010
So I told you this is all about the.

143
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,360
These are the for the participants.

144
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:28,280
And but you can create one another method like which the participants should look like, which you inside

145
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,540
distilled, which you and I don't.

146
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,650
Traditionally, you can do that.

147
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:37,090
Also using their databases, you can create some foreign key, public key or private keys, also not

148
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,930
in elevators, also inside their database.

149
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:44,180
I'm not considering very higher level database here, so I'm proceeding with the Simple Database Europe.

150
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:52,830
So for the admin part of the admin, then we will left with one another method, which is transaction

151
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,390
details for the transaction details what I'm going to show, I'm going to show one meter.

152
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,620
You need each transaction history for the issue.

153
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,910
So in this part, I'm going to create one issue inside the job.

154
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:13,230
Only two transaction history will look like this, so it will ask me for everything we'll get, whether

155
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,920
I'm going to use because I'm just fetching this from the database.

156
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,480
Then I'm going to use similar data database, select start from card transaction details.

157
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,650
And there were no even named the name of on that then payment date, etcetera, except I'm going to

158
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,520
display.

159
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,920
So this is all about this now, let's see how we can deploy on the part.

160
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:41,520
But before that, let us see what is the difference between these include and forward a method.

161
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:48,360
So, so let requests these tragedies on different things because this budget provides the interface,

162
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:55,380
with the facility dispatching the request to another resources location and will let just be extra.

163
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,400
There are two methods for forwarding the request from the late one.

164
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,990
Other sources include content to include the content of the resources.

165
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:11,730
So how it's look like forward methods If requests you so ladies, then it should forward to the solely

166
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,450
to other.

167
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,000
For the response response.

168
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:20,220
Again, another response is generated and response and to the back to the browser or user.

169
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:27,420
I can see inside the inaugural method what is doing requests, then to do so let it include those only

170
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:27,690
two.

171
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:34,320
And again, this led to the oh so we to one only so let one create creates another response.

172
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,650
We just find no response and it's showing to the incubator.

173
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:44,950
So it's very simple, as you can see inside our pre already created with log in so we can use this sort

174
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,620
of username and password does not exist, or you can use a welcome username, anything you can use.

175
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,060
So let us see how we can deploy this part over this.

176
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,820
Well, I project on them, so I'm going to run this first.

177
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,590
So we are using your local server if you want to publish this globally.

178
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,940
There are different things you can use.

179
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:16,250
You can use Babel Sting, which provides Java Sea panel you can use, then Heroku app is also available

180
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,300
on Web Europe, who use this Postgres virtual.

181
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,400
Inside this, you have to create one phone or text email, which is properties similar, which is available

182
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,320
on internet, and you can see that.

183
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:33,530
But for the chicken bubble, I'm going to use your last resort only with the one host.

184
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,860
So let us see how we can proceed with our project, and we are already done with our all things I told

185
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,760
you in starting this project.

186
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,640
You can enhance it more with using some different techniques also.

187
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,080
So let us see how we can proceed with this.

188
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,900
So this is our main page, as I told you, we'll do the early logging I told you, then I'm printing

189
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,990
this username, I told you we already moved this part.

190
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,000
So we were given details.

191
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,320
Then I told you we went so far to this.

192
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,390
You can you with this floating.

193
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,820
So we already checked this far.

194
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,160
Let us see how we can add another event here.

195
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:18,280
Event number is to help in this event, namely what it actually effect, same this.

196
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,100
Anything you can name coordinator name by renting this as a real.

197
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,530
This only coordinator, no, you can print anything.

198
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,610
No need to worry about that before registration and printing 250.

199
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,680
It'll be like this when you offer you in.

200
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:41,510
Due.

201
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,430
You can do in building general.

202
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:55,070
In law, anything you can think, I'm just giving the example I'm renting like, well, late 2020 when

203
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,280
I'm.

204
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,590
I'm printing here, or you can use 2020 your of your choice.

205
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,610
I'm clean, I'm clean submitting.

206
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,110
So now you can see you added.

207
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,210
So let us see how over a year in desert area.

208
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,420
So go to The View Yuengling, as you can see our view and this is added to this park.

209
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,530
Event details.

210
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:25,520
So let us see how we can proceed with our participants agents, the participant of events, one suit

211
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:30,950
participant log we already have seen we can create sign a page with the log in page, then go to the

212
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,610
this given Zululand already created the user, then submit.

213
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,680
Now we can see our view events, so these are two events we already have seen.

214
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,420
So let's see how we can register for it.

215
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:51,410
So enter even name, I'm reading this virtual effects, even number two, then enter card number, I'm

216
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,130
printing anything nine eight seven six four one.

217
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,390
Well, I'm pretty excited it is on 09.

218
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,830
2020 CBB, you can print anything your CBB cardholder names, some printing.

219
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:17,580
John will see two women, so nothing new you can proceed to the payment will tell or anything you're

220
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,000
going to do.

221
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,970
I'm just printing premium payments, don't go to Backpage, so I'm creating a simple thing you can proceed

222
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:30,480
with some like I'm willing to proceed with PayPal only, so you can put it in the PayPal page or of

223
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,270
some third party payment portals also.

224
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,450
So this is all of this.

225
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:41,550
So let's see how we can see in the admin part of this transaction history.

226
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,260
We go to admin, log in again.

227
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,130
I'm printing.

228
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,470
I'm going with username.

229
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,820
Your submit.

230
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,820
Transaction details.

231
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,060
So I want to transition details, so as you can see, even nobody to even name is this name is this

232
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,780
and payment.

233
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:03,740
So for these done, this is done, so you can create a one filter option to filter that even names according

234
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,610
to the payment data.

235
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:11,530
Also, you can do so exaggerated or you can do these things or you can add some payment date earlier.

236
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,780
So this is all about how we can proceed with our project.

237
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,820
So we are done with our project now.

238
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:24,200
You can move it further, some are the ones see things inside this.

239
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:31,330
So or our well event registration portal is done for the admin part and participant part is on.

240
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,660
Thank for this.

241
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,880
So thank you for attending this.

242
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,910
And we already have been all the parts here.

243
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:40,960
Thank you.
