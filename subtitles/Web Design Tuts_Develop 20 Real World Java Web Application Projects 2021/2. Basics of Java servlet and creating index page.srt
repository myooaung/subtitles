1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:09,350
We have already set up our project for Java Servlet now we will learn what Java sold.

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,150
But before that, I will summarise the first part what we learned was so in it.

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,220
What I did, I just created Java, the project with Anke, and we just built that project using Glassie

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,670
server.

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:24,900
So that's it.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,010
Setup is done.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,480
Knowing what we can do, we will learn about some Java solid.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,470
So what we can say.

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:41,050
So, ladies, a Java technology to create the application, so so so we're letting Java basically dedicated

10
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,580
for the creating web application sort of difference between a web page or web application.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,360
I will tell you that, but in short, I can tell you where the application is for performing a single

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:58,330
task like we are no more task of creating event registration portal.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:06,220
So this digital application web pages for marketing and everything about that particular company and

14
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,080
usability anything organization, but web application is particular for that purpose.

15
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:20,260
So, so when it is API, so so it is known as API and it is using the API basically so it can use to

16
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:26,410
create APIs to provide many interfaces, glasses, including documentation and everything.

17
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,040
So.

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,370
So let's try to able to create a.

19
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:37,690
So if you know what this API API is basically application programming interface.

20
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:44,080
So if you want to create some interface, application programming will be used that so similarly like

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,880
that API gives you the.

22
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:56,480
Application interface with interfaces, glasses and documentation, everything, so so will it will

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,700
consist Bluetooth interfaces and glasses.

24
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,160
But will he be doing that?

25
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,430
You will understand what is the difference between that interfaces and glasses?

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,580
Both are looking similar, but both are very different concepts.

27
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,740
So let's see first what is solid.

28
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:20,190
Interfaces, so it is an interface that must be implemented by creating any solid.

29
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,520
So as the name suggests, interface it should.

30
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,850
So some application on interface.

31
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:36,930
Also, the class also is a class that can extend the capabilities of servers and responds to incoming

32
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,990
requests like hold of a pay, each working use client or we are sending something on Google.

33
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,990
So if we are charging something on Google, we send the request for that request.

34
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,650
The server, which is located on the internet like from you, send some search on Google, something

35
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,860
about a car and you want.

36
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,050
This is the request saying something.

37
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,530
Some information for car in that response, the Google server will send the response for.

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,590
It will certainly respond for that request.

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,300
So basically, it works like that response and response requests.

40
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,880
Sensibilities of the component that deployed on the server to create dynamic Web pages or an older dynamic

41
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,140
web page means you can change everything inside the static web pages or something.

42
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,380
Well, like static, you cannot change.

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,290
These are some informal do or die knows.

44
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,060
Web pages like company wants to know that they are all information home.

45
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,460
Then some about those.

46
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:45,230
And that's it for giving information in dynamic web pages like the event portal.

47
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,930
Or you can say Amazon Web Site is a dynamic.

48
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,610
You can search there.

49
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,230
They can edit something on that.

50
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,720
So this is known as dynamic pages.

51
00:03:54,050 --> 00:04:00,440
So, so are basically used to create dynamic webpages and did so a web component that deployed on the

52
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,010
server.

53
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,990
That's why we need sort of audio.

54
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,740
Otherwise, we can use only HTML and web browser and we can create but nothing like that.

55
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,460
We need one server, so we created one locally.

56
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,420
As I told you, we downloaded the glass server to deployed oversold.

57
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,180
So this is all about the solid introduction.

58
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,380
It is just too basic.

59
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,510
So first, what we know that it is technology to create with replication.

60
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:34,190
So we need this API that provides interfaces and classes, so it works as both interfaces and classes,

61
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,400
interfaces to implement that UI, user interface and everything.

62
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:45,900
And glass, which serves as glass to extend their capabilities like, you know, the Java.

63
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,460
If you want to implement logic in achievement, you cannot implement logically, you cannot add something

64
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,390
to numbers there.

65
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:59,960
You can go through with some logical expressions that in extreme in cases, you need the back end.

66
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:06,790
So Java will provide this backing in this Java Python as well as JavaScript EU.

67
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,070
And so much so it is very important because it deployed on the server end, not on the user.

68
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,340
So that's because it will create dynamic widgets.

69
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,710
So let us see how it will work to the diagram.

70
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,260
So this is a client.

71
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,450
This is our client or we can sell over machine.

72
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,340
This is sort of a client will ask for a request or send a request.

73
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,090
That's how the network works.

74
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:39,860
Basically a client which means our system or we are using the next system, we are searching our mobile

75
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,130
phones, anything on which is available on the internet.

76
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:50,030
So this client, if I'm searching Google dot com on the internet, the Google dot com request sent to

77
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,600
the server.

78
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,840
Now what it will will do sort of what it doesn't have any application or something like that, it will

79
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,590
search everything.

80
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,770
There are some pre-built applications based on Java, JavaScript, anything.

81
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:08,300
The server will generate a big pain response, so the response is generated at runtime.

82
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,130
From that data, here is the data I can see this is the database, and that response is sent to the

83
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:22,090
client that so the whole network works in solid and request based on requests and responses.

84
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:29,170
So now let's see our project a bit like what is the important thing in our project?

85
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,830
So far, the front end part is D.M.C.

86
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,120
It and this is good.

87
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,280
I'm not using Jacir for this project.

88
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,650
I'm going to use a stimulant to use this.

89
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:46,960
So you should know the prior informed prior knowledge about these devices is not very deep, but very.

90
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:55,410
Basic knowledge about the stimulus is this you should know Java, so we can say Java programs basically

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,620
the what is the classes, what is the method for how will we can easily text between them, then data

92
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,160
or handling it in Java like little Typekit in Java?

93
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:11,490
So second parties Java Servlet, which is the main backend part we've got, which contains logical methods

94
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,480
and everything.

95
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,470
So you can see these are both are different.

96
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,710
So we need one link between a stimulus.

97
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,080
This is also the stimulant java.

98
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,320
So what will I can?

99
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,060
Well, what I will give the example like in the train.

100
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:38,480
There is the energy and there are some other compartments also in the train, like other cabins and

101
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,130
everything.

102
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:45,440
So to connect in June and other that could be next and everything we need to link similarly is imminent

103
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,420
for that particular image.

104
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:57,710
Stephen Page There should be a Java link if external pesos take input from user number in books and

105
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,730
print ads is there.

106
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,080
Some of these are.

107
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,490
These is the basic application.

108
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,980
So I want to handle this.

109
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:11,890
So how would you estimate you will tell that this female is this number and it should give that to the

110
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,340
next job and it will take the addition and everything for that purpose.

111
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,670
We need to look very simple.

112
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,180
So what they're going to be a big symbol is a control for.

113
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,660
No, we won't know for that to be a bet.

114
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,170
It's linked, particularly to the specific webpages.

115
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,350
So Solar Project contains three important parts.

116
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:42,130
Estimates its origins for 400 or anything related to the deployment siguientes Java programs, which

117
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,260
are basically beacons.

118
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:52,530
And also, we required very big cement of a big cement is for Lake Shore.

119
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:59,160
What I can say with a big smile, as I told you, it's linking that particular park.

120
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,870
So these are about the least important parts.

121
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,320
So let us see what is the thing.

122
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:19,870
So late before that, I mean, I want to totally go from for the web application on some application.

123
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,910
Is application accessible from the web?

124
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,870
As you can see, there are several options on mobile.

125
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,390
You have WhatsApp video editing as similarly on web.

126
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,880
There are some applications created nowadays.

127
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,320
You are mostly seeing them.

128
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,590
So basically web applications based on Java solely based on your Java script.

129
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,790
Python anybody like Amazon Web Services?

130
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,150
It's a sell for.

131
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:56,380
Web application, so web application compose of web components like solid speech filters and other elements,

132
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,750
instruments uses JavaScript editing.

133
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,150
This piece basically jealous pages.

134
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,010
We are going to see further what is the difference between Java, so let programs and jurisprudence.

135
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,380
So Web components typically executed in Web server and respond to the request.

136
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,870
So basically web application workflow.

137
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:24,560
Now, what is the difference between CGI, the normal requests and responses and what it does?

138
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,010
So let's discuss what is CGI?

139
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,200
CGI is basically.

140
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,870
Common gateway interface.

141
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,330
So let me go with the project, I the do for fun.

142
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,460
First part of our project, then I will tell you more mostly about this and everything.

143
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,670
So let us see how we can proceed with our project.

144
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,420
So as you can see, this is our project.

145
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:59,150
And I created an exotic animal first, like it's before we created the.

146
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:07,480
So that said about index or human, but what is our first pages I'm going to create?

147
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:16,040
Is log in page, so if you know the was in Texas of Yemen, you will understand this.

148
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,260
This is for just commenting out loud and I will.

149
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:31,690
Oh, creator, then I'm going to use one before us, I can see which I already created and I'm going

150
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,010
to use that to, she is just pulling all things.

151
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:46,420
So if you want, you can directly use some other cases file to provide a better environment, or I can

152
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,360
say better funding for your project.

153
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:56,560
So I, as you can see, I'm using, I'm using, I'm going to use this distances for you.

154
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:03,670
You can directly use this also or it is available on the internet and you can use it, usually use this.

155
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,370
This is basic, you know, to assist with some military one common and everything.

156
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,680
So let's see how we can link this.

157
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,050
So this is human in the title.

158
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,230
I'm going to give you the log in, but you can do the similar things.

159
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:30,070
This is all about over index, not A.T.M. I just use this default.

160
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:36,310
So in order to analyze our front page, I can see I use your total purchases to assist.

161
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,850
So I will tell you what is the significance of each tag here.

162
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,350
So this is for linking the other two uses.

163
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:50,850
Total loss is this I'm going to use only simultaneously to you the other night you have for our project,

164
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:57,760
then this is not enough to do the one on there.

165
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm using science open science here.

166
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,640
Then this is mercury for the please choose the below links to log in to your account, something like

167
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,320
that on the web pages that scrolling.

168
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:18,940
But the important part here is I read two images on the member for the admin page for admin image or

169
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,040
admin logo just in for the Part B engine for participant image.

170
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,570
So here what I created, I'm going to create two another extreme elephants.

171
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:35,680
This is all about front end, basically a log in Yemen, which is for admin logging and that admin log

172
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,980
log in and they will attach to another Java.

173
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,980
So look, to create that logic, we will see in the further part on that.

174
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,400
But before that, I created this admin logging similarly for particular logging.

175
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,260
So that said about the individual instruments, what you need to create, you need you are going to

176
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,190
create two links there.

177
00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:02,890
You can put links also there, but I am representing it as a button for simple scenario.

178
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,340
As you can see, I created button and I'm going to assume it will be looking very good for us.

179
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,560
So let us deploy this, as I told you, for the deployment simple steps.

180
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,950
You can right click there and you can.

181
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,070
Let's clean and we.

182
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:28,960
Now in the output below there, you can see it is clean and are doing all this to be successful, you

183
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,050
can see now let's do this.

184
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,690
It will starting glass server.

185
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,560
So we need a glass feature where we don't we can not deploy anything.

186
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,080
It will take time to blow with bootstrap and everything.

187
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,480
But.

188
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,560
So this is all about java's solid.

189
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,470
And this is basic, so always remember don't change in big starting statement to another fight, what

190
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:07,160
it will recreate, it will create some anomaly in this new distributed starting page, so it will proceed

191
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,300
with that further.

192
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:17,420
Well, now you can see this creating and deploying over on this webpage on the server, as you can see

193
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,470
successfully deployed.

194
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,740
Now I will show you that web page also.

195
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,990
So this is our Web page, we just theater, so as you can see, it is no leaving registration podium.

196
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,280
And these images, I'm alluding to the cases by default on the internet available on the internet,

197
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,540
you can change as you want.

198
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:50,980
And this is all about our admin login in our discussion as this is very basic, I can see and this is

199
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,990
investor testimony, including, as you can see, log in page, you can see here and everything.

200
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,780
So what I am going to show you is when I created this admin log in.

201
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:13,130
You can see the full status for 04 is not that is not fun because I haven't created any admin in what

202
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,660
against the Bill Finder or web page.

203
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:23,310
Similarly, for participants logging in for their videos, I'm going to tell you how we can create admin

204
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,190
log in and each page and how we can attach to the Java solid.

205
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:32,730
So this is all about the beginning of the setup of our five to four hour setup and everything.

206
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,570
So this is the landing page opening page of all of your important.

207
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:44,490
So as I can told or told you about that, this is our web page or I can see web application here.
