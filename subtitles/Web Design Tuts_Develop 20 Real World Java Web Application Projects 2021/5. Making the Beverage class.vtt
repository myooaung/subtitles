WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:10.840
So till now, we have covered all the items in the form as the select size, the number of glasses,

2
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.180
the selections of menu items in the form of a new model.

3
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:26.140
Now our next concern should be adding button, so add an order in order to make and those items to our

4
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.000
site or to check out from the card and confirm our orders.

5
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:40.900
So we will be adding our button and holding this as we plan, and this is going to be a new J button.

6
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.410
And inside this work on the string that is going to be displayed on the button Nisan.

7
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:58.260
So call it that an item and item is going to be the size like the string displayed on the back then.

8
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.590
Now, in the similar way, we have the set size and location.

9
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:12.670
So I am going to copy this from hell and paste it here, and I'll just change this glass.

10
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:25.880
So and so adding this button, setting its size and location, and then far to settle.

11
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.020
Like our dedicated size and location for this button is very important.

12
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:41.600
So changing the size 200 and suppose to 30 from the left.

13
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.900
OK, so we have added this is a potential label and should be replaced with Raytheon.

14
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.000
And there's also methane.

15
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.360
So we have added this add button to our frame.

16
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.130
This is that Martin, which that currently adding now our next concern is adding on their button to

17
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.730
the frame.

18
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:16.340
So in this new military, we will be adding the order, but then also so pasting this and just changing

19
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:24.110
the name and the size is going to be the same, but the difference is going to be in the.

20
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.660
Like this distance from the Alaska border, so suppose all the above one was a hundred from the left,

21
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.840
so it should be supposed to be from the left and OK, so this is going to be.

22
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:49.830
So all we have seen one thing in the beginning or we have to first place this order in order to make

23
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.250
them.

24
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.930
Dedicated for suggest pressing and as long as we have this narrative.

25
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.000
So you do not have to.

26
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.460
Called Typekit again and again, so you have this or that, but then so one thing I was talking about

27
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.960
that by default in the initiative in the resource sector was that like disabled.

28
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.610
So this order button was disabled in the beginning to get it back down.

29
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.310
So we have to set this on button so disabled by default.

30
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.690
So.

31
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:37.800
This is going to be built in order and we have to set it all like disabled.

32
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.580
So said.

33
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:49.170
Enable and be a Boolean input, which it takes, this certain inverted function takes more inputs.

34
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.950
So setting this move into force.

35
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.730
And this has made us possible for disabling the button by default in the beginning.

36
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.350
So we will be adding functions in order to make this button enable in future, and we will be adding

37
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:16.340
code responsible to back those off now so that we have added these select size radio back then selection

38
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.910
option.

39
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:25.970
These input text field, which will be asking for the number of nurses and as the last days we have

40
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.200
added, add button and order button lower frames.

41
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.510
Now, one more thing which is being displayed in the form is the number of items which we have added

42
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.130
along with the add ons.

43
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.970
So the code responsible for that is this.

44
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:51.710
Basically, we are calling this as LV End report, which is giving us the report of the items which

45
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.580
we have ordered.

46
00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:03.320
So basically, it is not a like log of what is being ordered throughout in that step that specific steps.

47
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:13.090
So after each order, this label will appear like unique label will appear after each a unique ordering.

48
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.840
And I suppose we have ordered the order.

49
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.080
So that will appear also again.

50
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.610
If the order be, then a different report will appear that we have ordered the supposed to million glasses

51
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.680
of tea.

52
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:35.420
So this report is responsible for that part of the form and after which we have said the size and location

53
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.530
for that also.

54
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:44.270
So by far, we have completed all the things associated with this label class.

55
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.650
Now we have to add actions inside this.

56
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:56.600
So in order to add actions, actual listeners to everyday, but then they do, but then add combo boxes

57
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.470
and everything.

58
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.460
We have to write code inside this action perform function.

59
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:10.580
So in order to attach actions, firstly, we have to create classes for the rest of the requisites for

60
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.200
this application.

61
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.230
So add in the prototype part.

62
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.780
We have discussed that as a whole.

63
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.800
We will be requiring six classes in this project.

64
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:31.640
So the second class, which is concerned with this label class like these two are attached.

65
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:41.510
So creating a new class, calling it beverage, dark java and our class beverage is being created.

66
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:51.200
So this beverage class is going to be responsible for the size, the prizes of the items in the menu

67
00:06:51.560 --> 00:07:01.190
and the amount of the items, like how many items we have ordered and what is the total cost of the

68
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:10.280
whole cost items summed up as a whole and everything attached a size price and amount is going to be

69
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.590
a response in this class is being responsible for those things.

70
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:26.390
So initializing some global animals, which are going to be required for this class creation, this

71
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:37.190
size and similarly size and amount so private on the size is going to be an integer.

72
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.330
So sorry, the amount is going to be the integer.

73
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:51.230
So into my own and then private or double prize or prize could be our decimal also.

74
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.060
So we are declaring this as double data type.

75
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.370
So size, amount and price.

76
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.310
We have Duignan now.

77
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:12.380
After this creation of the beverage class, we have to create a constructor which is going to contain

78
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.290
the beverage object.

79
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:27.650
So beverage and the argument inside this is going to be the size and one more the amount.

80
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.440
So its size and the amount.

81
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.350
Are going to be the.

82
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.520
An argument for this constructor.

83
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:47.420
OK, so we have passed the argument successfully now inside this beverage object.

84
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.830
So part is going to be the dito's.

85
00:08:52.010 --> 00:09:03.020
So initially there is no title for the beverage frame, so we are leaving this as empty after this.

86
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:12.950
This northside is going to set the bus size, so this game is responsible for accessing the objects

87
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.860
from, like private objects from class.

88
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:22.560
So we are using this given the floor amount and size.

89
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:31.460
So we have been successfully accessed the size and the amount of damage.

90
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:38.510
Initially, it applies totally zero as initially we have nothing ordered in the car.

91
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:46.520
So setting it up 0.0 0.0 is neutral that the is the entire declaration we have made.

92
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.240
So the prize is initially zero.

93
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:59.210
Now after this, we have to create all functions for get size, set size like we have to use, get them

94
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.620
set the methods for setting the size an amount.

95
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.260
Also, it applies.

96
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.210
We have three things, so we have to set and get all three of them.

97
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:19.790
These three are declared as a private access specified in the class of globally.

98
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:28.880
So in order to access those private objects, we have to use that guest and set keywords in our midst

99
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.660
will be responsible for accessing all of them.

100
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:40.430
So suppose I am using public string as the size.

101
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.070
It is strings, so get size.

102
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.300
That size, I am going to call.

103
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.120
And a rocket.

104
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.430
So this getting my TARDIS gone, which is going to return the size.

105
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:03.320
So we have successfully did this get a of size?

106
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:13.460
Now, in the similar way, in order to update the size, we are using the settlement, so said the size

107
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:24.260
is going to be responsible for updating the size of the items, which we are ordering through that application.

108
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.550
So this is like using size as that human.

109
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.620
And inside this, yeah, we have to like access the size.

110
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:43.070
So this large size should be accessed in order to make any update to the size and after like setting

111
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.540
the size, we will get this size with the help of that size matter.

112
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.850
So we are done with this size by now.

113
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:56.450
In the similar way, we will do this for the eyes and amount.

114
00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:09.230
So let me copied this part and pasted two more times to set it for price and amount case or possibly

115
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:14.120
changing this get size to get.

116
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.490
Price, yes.

117
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:25.640
So and the prices double short, changing it to double has.

118
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:36.420
OK, so this will return the prize, and this year the mantle will return the prize.

119
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.030
Also setting the prize.

120
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.540
And this is our third double double.

121
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.890
OK, so we're done with this.

122
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:59.520
Now, after this doing this for OK, so we have to change this also rise.

123
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.110
And this dark price.

124
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:15.880
So the nice part is also done now for the amount, so the amount is data integer, so we have to call

125
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.230
it as in and then they turned them down.

126
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:26.680
Now Montazeri, don't you think using this get method all for Java?

127
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.040
Similarly, set amount.

128
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.590
Like to build the amount we have to.

129
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:37.520
Changes to wind.

130
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:45.730
And this is going to be responsible for updating the amount.

131
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:52.250
Also, we have to change this size had also inserted supplies.

132
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.120
So we are done just changing the carers.

133
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.060
And similarly here.

134
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:13.280
OK, so we have successfully get and said all three of the object major declared inside this beverage

135
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:13.890
class.
