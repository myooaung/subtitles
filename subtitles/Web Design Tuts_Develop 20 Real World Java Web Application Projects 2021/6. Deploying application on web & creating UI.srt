1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:10,510
In previous part, I told you how I created each an extra controller.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,410
But let me.

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,840
Well, with some more advanced in your.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,010
So let me.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,830
Do one thing you.

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,160
So, as you know, these are looking back, I will do it or I will.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,530
I'm going with that part, but they're just check whether our application is running or not.

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:44,180
First, because I'm curious about that, whether it's running or not.

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,670
So.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:47,970
Family.

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,210
I already created that method.

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,440
I'm listing home.

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,730
Which is going to determine.

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,340
Know.

15
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,170
What is the home?

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,080
So home is I'm going to create incentive template.

17
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,900
So home is nothing but the team.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,690
I am going to create so this is all about I'm going to duplicate, so what I did is I just created this

19
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:28,150
part and now what I'm going to do, I'm going to deploy it on the web.

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,850
So if you have seen this on my crontab and I'm going to mention that you are enforced.

21
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,170
And before that, remember what I'm going to do, I'm going to check applications.

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,310
These are not very important.

23
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,320
Statement checking application applications, very important was whether it's running or not.

24
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,040
For that purpose, I'm going to use this so.

25
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,960
Let me check whether it is running or not.

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,630
So.

27
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,580
Inside that template, go to template part.

28
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,620
Click right click you can click new file, you can use this directly, even under extreme.

29
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,030
I think what you do you create when an extreme environment for me.

30
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,030
And this is it.

31
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,250
Let me mention it, one slash.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,670
It's one.

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,100
Hello.

34
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:25,910
Would.

35
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,830
So this is it.

36
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,990
Let me run my application.

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,550
So this is currently running, but what are you going to do?

38
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,110
You can go to your local state.

39
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,560
And you can check that part, so once it starts running, but.

40
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,580
Thank you so much for what application is running now.

41
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,940
Well, let me move to my.

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,240
No closed.

43
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,750
And let me turn this.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:13,360
So this is really extreme there, because it's fluid and sleep mapping is showing here and why they're

45
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,550
still in the home control.

46
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,550
I mentioned this explicit mapping.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,290
So what are you going to do?

48
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,440
Might label it, are you going to do on what you can take?

49
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,580
On.

50
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,840
New fall back or not.

51
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:36,230
It would fall making you can do one thing, you can check your bombed out, examine whether it's working

52
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:36,680
or not.

53
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,350
So.

54
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,870
If it's working.

55
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,230
Let me do one thing, because.

56
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,050
I haven't mentioned this earlier.

57
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:01,930
This is.

58
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,780
Let me tell you why it is showing deliberately because I haven't mentioned this controller kidnapping

59
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,170
part.

60
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,320
So this is very important because it's not mapping at all.

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:19,510
So let me run this again, and now you should understand why it is showing me the error because this

62
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:19,930
is the home.

63
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,140
Yeah, I mention world to this.

64
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,960
But what is the kidnapping mapping method?

65
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,660
It should be mandated.

66
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,770
So let me run it again.

67
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,340
Localhost.

68
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,730
And let me go to the microphone down now you can see the Helloworld is not painting, so basic thing

69
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,540
is that I mentioned this local news, Jennings that's OK.

70
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,270
But inside the elite body, get my be controller is very important and basic the injection part of our

71
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,680
database.

72
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,310
So let me remove this.

73
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,740
Now you should understand or you can understand what local history is running.

74
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,120
Let me go with this.

75
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,600
Our full review started.

76
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,360
University of the Wired.

77
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,020
Then they'll get mapping method.

78
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:24,460
Then this list, which contains all these things, which contains all the things.

79
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,570
Well, currently, most of this part.

80
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,480
So no application is no running.

81
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,710
But the thing is, we haven't mentioned any further part yet.

82
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:44,030
No, we are remaining with some things here, which is basically in, first of all, let me create one

83
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,520
in total reported cases here.

84
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,060
So in.

85
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,810
Totally.

86
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,770
Reporter.

87
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,710
Is equal to what I'm going to do.

88
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,740
I'm going to put inside the.

89
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,520
All stats basically on stats don't.

90
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,310
Now what I'm going to do, I can stream this part.

91
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,940
Stream this part inside the location, part steam board.

92
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,200
Map and where I'm using this map to.

93
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,080
So basically, I'm going to map to end.

94
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,120
And basically that.

95
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,590
We begins to that's sort of the thing that they used.

96
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,970
STAT only stat.

97
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,950
This is the mapping.

98
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,790
And let me just do this.

99
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,560
It is going to print me on everything here.

100
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,270
OK, thanks.

101
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:10,120
OK, so it will mean this current live here and the turnover thing, so I need to return the listing

102
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,700
also later.

103
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:16,090
The home park but no, I'm going with this only.

104
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,370
Similarly, I'm going to create this.

105
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:21,940
STEM.

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,640
And total new cases, no, I need to create more alert.

107
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,230
And attribute, if you know, the spring party, you need to add the attributes here first.

108
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,320
So adding that tribute is basically location stats.

109
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,130
Location.

110
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,670
That's.

111
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,120
All.

112
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,170
On stretch.

113
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,480
Let me check with the.

114
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,520
OK.

115
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,520
Like it's going to.

116
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,900
You mentioned this part on.

117
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,370
Mentioned is my own.

118
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,840
Similarly.

119
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,180
I need to mention this.

120
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,300
And by law, no, not at.

121
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:48,210
Tribute, OK, so and the things I'm going to have done.

122
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:49,660
Well.

123
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,740
So what is going it is going to create is.

124
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,980
You know this home.

125
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,470
It is going to.

126
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,810
We'll put that in the home part.

127
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:12,350
I'm going to that to the home park, so coronavirus data service, it is going to face the data from

128
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,460
a very early December you are in.

129
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,700
Then location starts is going to get the all data.

130
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,070
Basically, these all the data from.

131
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,880
This and it's basically modeling.

132
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,980
So it is going to take my everything here first.

133
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,000
So this is all about how I'm going to create, but.

134
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,030
The thing is.

135
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:49,630
Very important here, as I created this moral part or what it specifies, since that good search is

136
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,560
going to use it.

137
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,700
But this is going to say that it each and everything.

138
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,080
So let me use the part first to basically Helloworld.

139
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,980
And if you want to use, you can use directly the template part or if you want to change your template,

140
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,840
you can change your template also.

141
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,970
So you can use any bootstrap program or anything.

142
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,190
But as I told you, I'm going to this directly on the web.

143
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,530
I will tell you what is the basic thing you saw?

144
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:32,250
These are the tables, I'm going to use this and it's a total reported cases to open a new case is going

145
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,590
to users which span each earning.

146
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,120
So.

147
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:45,700
All this is all about how I mentioned this, so it contains some controlling jump apart with this is

148
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,880
the controller for the running, with the location statistics.

149
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,460
And these are all the things.

150
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,200
So let me mention this for sure.

151
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:59,530
These are some p.m. If I'm going to use, they shoot with the container and.

152
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,920
Let me change this earlier, I mentioned this as a COVID 19 for.

153
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:23,810
This new cases reported since previous day with total cases in the table and these changes since last

154
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:29,150
day, each and everything you can get sick country, each and everything state in the country and start

155
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,310
started all from the other data country.

156
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,060
And I'm going to use the pool.

157
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,720
If you know some useful thing, you can use this.

158
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,020
If not, you can zero here.

159
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:47,060
And so just a tabular format, the home controller, I'm mentioning the home controlling part.

160
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,620
And you can check here and see if it's working or not going to check it from here.

161
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,440
Controller is just controlling everything here and go it alone.

162
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:07,740
Let me run this again and it is going to first build the project that it will run throughout this project.

163
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,050
If there is an error, you can check your case before you first, whether it's running or not.

164
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,250
So currently.

165
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,110
My data is running low spinning and work is running low.

166
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,670
Don't get Tom Sawyer original running.

167
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,770
Let me reload this.

168
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,620
So sometimes there may be some errors in data.

169
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,770
Although sometimes there is all.

170
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,400
There is not an error in data, so.

171
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,310
Why sometimes you showing me the error because the room is empty, so let me go to the Graham application.

172
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,860
So as you can see, this is my final way it's looking, so.

173
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:03,660
In different states like not New South Wales, in Australia, total cases reported and changes since

174
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,470
last day zero.

175
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,990
But sometimes in this country.

176
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,300
So these are my new total cases reported.

177
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,710
We visited these.

178
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,850
These are the these things.

179
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,910
So this is all I'm getting.

180
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,580
I'm that I'm getting from this.

181
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,070
You are in Oregon City.

182
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,680
I change you to tell you what I have to get done in budgeting.

183
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,070
Then I created to response to get response.

184
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,700
And I created a cleansing to send that request.

185
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,210
Then using for each loop, I'm going to invoke this.

186
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,490
Then of hail doing this all the stops.

187
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,940
What I'm doing here, I'm creating here location sets with more than.

188
00:13:50,950 --> 00:14:00,100
While developing this or there is one tricky state you can see, I need to mention, at least at least

189
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,690
you can use it.

190
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,320
I'm mentioning, at least here.

191
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:08,550
Then I created one for each loop to in throughout this process.

192
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,300
And it's going to bring me down, if you want to do one thing, you can change this star.

193
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,810
Who this one?

194
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,700
So what will happen?

195
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,810
Let me show you.

196
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,340
You can run this again.

197
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,790
It will started running.

198
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,650
So it will bring this.

199
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,940
And it will started turning in each and every one second, so it will be updated each and every one

200
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,260
second so it can be done this again, you can check your reading again.

201
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:57,480
Total cases, new cases in the state, country and each and everything, so some having not in states

202
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,720
like Brazil, it's not showing any state because it's the whole country.

203
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,450
So these are the cases and all the things in.

204
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:13,650
So if you have seen the present data there, you can check it's not very useful because there are no

205
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,360
what we can see such differences in case we fail.

206
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,010
So what I'm doing, I created one web application to check each and everything.

207
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,800
So now it's very useful to check.

208
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,470
Is there any thing inside this?

209
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,050
But unfortunately in that data, there is no Indian method or we can say not India.

210
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,920
If you all want to check for India, you can check.

211
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,930
And you can use similar logic here.

212
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,900
This you'll need to change the you worry and you're good to go with this fight.

213
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,120
So this is all about how we created everything.

214
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:56,100
Let me go to the contacts list, so this is our application, and I told you so this is the state and

215
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,590
this is all is taking from the U.S. and not printing anything you do taking from the URL.

216
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,080
This is the Australia, the kisses and the kisses.

217
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,460
So why would bring need a zero?

218
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,690
Because it is not updated.

219
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,040
If you want to check any updating thing, you can do so in the ID.

220
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:20,280
You just need to require to create three things coronavirus data service to create service in spring

221
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:26,820
application location search to create modeling home controller to control in each and every part one

222
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,490
that estimate no home control.

223
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,930
It is just controlling the park, as in the cellular data, are accessible for the mappings.

224
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,530
We removed this example in the spring and we created one controller to print this morning here, as

225
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,170
you can see, and I'm printing this return home.

226
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,610
If I change it in return home, you can check that changes in that part.

227
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:54,600
Also, as you can see, I created this code on all my this I can mention as a COVID 19.

228
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,090
Cases.

229
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:58,850
Let me.

230
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,260
Sue, this if I.

231
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,500
Notice you going to check here, also committed against drop in.

232
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,830
So it will be the parallel running.

233
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,590
So this is all the world I created.

234
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,750
You can check here this is running.

235
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,310
So this is very useful in.

236
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,250
Why are you creating such applications, which is basically realtime applications?

237
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,420
It mingled with the chrome type again.

238
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,780
And let me read on this again.

239
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,500
Look closely.

240
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,050
Now you can see things, so it is not displaying this.

241
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,870
If you want to check, you can check it.

242
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,590
And another thing.

243
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:50,180
So that we're told we created over oh, application, hope you understand you can extend it to further

244
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,700
more like in the mail for the other purpose.

245
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,770
What are you going to do?

246
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,030
You even mentioned some search methods also.

247
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,970
I just the simple up here, but you can check that part also here.

248
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,810
Now you can move further with some useful things like go with Ben.

249
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:11,510
That's also if hospital beds, you can check for that purpose, you can create log in log odometer for

250
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,350
that also.

251
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,250
So these are the simple application I created, but you can extend it.

252
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:23,400
Furthermore, now, while developing this, there are two simple steps Never change this coronavirus

253
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,660
data.

254
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,750
These are the default things.

255
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,000
No need to change because it will apply this.

256
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:38,390
Then create default on what we can see some specified names, packages to display all the things.

257
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,970
So this is it about how we created our data visualization application using spring.

258
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,770
So this is it all about COVID 19 replication?

259
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,100
Hope you understand.

260
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,150
Thank you.
