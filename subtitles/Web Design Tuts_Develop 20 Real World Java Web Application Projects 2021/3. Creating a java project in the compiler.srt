1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,190
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:11,210
So in this series of main Java projects, we are going to make a new project again and going to end

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,680
this snake was really a game we your list of making Java projects.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,860
We have already covered many projects.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,160
Now we are going to make this project also.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,610
So let's begin making that project in our favorite tidy visual studio code by creating a new Java project.

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:33,870
So.

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:42,040
Clicking on the file python and clicking on Create a project inset enough, I liken.

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:51,720
So after clicking on this button, a pop up asked for an option that what are their doors we are going

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,790
to use while making this browser?

11
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:04,100
So we have no use of these libraries, so we will click on this no fatal option and select this after

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,660
which it asks for a pack that we want to store our project.

13
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,250
So suppose I want to store that project inside my next door.

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,630
So selecting that project location and then.

15
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,910
It asks for the name of the project.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:34,190
So my choice of name says that I should name leaked as Snake Australia trade the snake as we are going

17
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,170
to feed the snake in this game.

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,640
So I've been putting that name for this project.

19
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:47,630
We have to hit enter so that we will enter in the frame where we have a new Java project.

20
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,580
So after hitting enter.

21
00:01:50,780 --> 00:02:00,620
OK, so I have already a project name like this, so I will try something under like the Snake of India.

22
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,150
Yes.

23
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,470
So the folder will be named as the Snake Australia.

24
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:07,760
Yes.

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,530
So we are here inside a new Java project with some inmate folders inside.

26
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,160
If we have the starting window right, we have our dart.

27
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,830
We have Golden Dawn based extension folder and we have a live feed folder.

28
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:31,550
So that assigns the folder is going to be the core of this project inside the folder only.

29
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,690
We are going to bring the files required in this project.

30
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,090
The classes will be consistent inside this SIRC folder only.

31
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:49,940
There are three folder already has Dark Java file, which contains that app plus veterans whenever there

32
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:57,740
is an exception in the application, this file is for the handling that exception if the project is

33
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,420
not able to run or there is any runtime error in the project.

34
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,760
So we have already listed the fact this error handling exception handling in the previous videos.

35
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:19,970
Also in the previous video, we have given how to install this application and how to run the execution

36
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,980
of the compilers that JDK and everything.

37
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:33,590
You can check those video if you already have no visual studio code and get in your system and then

38
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,290
come here to make this new Java project, which we have created right now.

39
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,730
OK.

40
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:48,740
So we have successfully created the frame inside which the project is going to be made in this compiler.

41
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:57,560
Now we have to import the requirements of this project like I have already told you that we required

42
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,130
images of Apple, which is going to be the object.

43
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:09,110
And for this name, we have to import images of dogs we had and rendered our icons show you.

44
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:09,780
Yes.

45
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,970
So we have a green dot, a red dot and this app.

46
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,600
So we have to import these three images first to begin making this project.

47
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:26,450
So before going to start the programming, let me import the item.

48
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,510
So here we have an apple that's in default.

49
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,830
That file are not being defined and had not been defined.

50
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:43,250
So this is inside this icons folder, and I am going to drag this inside my assets folder.

51
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,530
So here we have Icon Folder, which contains a green door.

52
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,610
I can zoom in.

53
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,390
Yes.

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,820
So it is an apple.

55
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,490
Yes, we have the green dot.

56
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,870
Which is going to be the body and the tail of destiny.

57
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,900
And the head of the snake, other dog.

58
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,140
So we have successfully imported the requirement for this project.

59
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,540
Now we have to start making the project by creating glasses.

60
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:26,810
So in order to create the flames, we have to create a class called snake, not Java as a new file inside

61
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,160
this folder.

62
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,270
And this is going to give us the snake love.

63
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:32,870
Yes.

64
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,920
So here it is.

65
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:40,460
Similarly, for the board, this is that board which will consider the doorframe.

66
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,770
So to make the more we have to create, the more Java file.

67
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:55,390
Inside this R C folder as well, that is not the fact that we are going to clear the folders, so it's

68
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,950
only necessary for that.

69
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:03,880
We have our icon, we have our app, the Java file, we have world, not Java and Snake Gabriella.

70
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:12,550
All the classes are inside this exact same folder, only now switching to the prototype, which we already

71
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,990
made for the project.

72
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:22,000
We will check the points which we have covered, like we have created the new Java project.

73
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:29,350
We have added the images to that project and now we have to start creating the flame.

74
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:37,570
So to start creating the flame, so the snake glass is going to be in the main file, which will be

75
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,610
responsible for running this snake game.

76
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,540
We have created a Boulder Java class also, so we have two classes.

77
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:53,980
Of course, we can make it in a single class also, but the code will become complex and it would be

78
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,200
difficult for you to handle.

79
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,380
That's what function is doing was so to make that things distributed.

80
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,630
I created two different classes.

81
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:14,260
So to begin with the coding part, let's create constructor called Snake and inside, which we are going

82
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,220
to add the functionalities what the game is containing.

83
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:27,630
Now, just after creating that snake object, I am going to call this object inside a public static

84
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,510
main function, public static void main.

85
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,110
And the argument goes as string.

86
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:38,640
All right.

87
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,900
So yes.

88
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,970
The object is created.

89
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,750
The function is created.

90
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,650
The object is going to be called inside this.

91
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,940
So we have created it and now.

92
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:03,870
And embraces and inside the flame, no part part of the prototype was to create a frame.

93
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:12,030
So using that new keyboard, I am going to call the snake object, which we have just created in the

94
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,350
line number three.

95
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:13,950
Yes.

96
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,490
So no, visibility is by default.

97
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,110
NULL, all false.

98
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,050
So we have to set it to true.

99
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,710
Don't see the frame on our screens.

100
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,930
So we have set the visibility of the frame astral.

101
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,980
So it is showing in that.

102
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:43,580
So let's just check what the error is showing lying.

103
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:51,020
So we have said certain access specified as public, we have to change it to private.

104
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,040
So there it is.

105
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,650
Coming to.

106
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,770
So that it is still there.

107
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,110
We have to remain the class axis specified as family.

108
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,910
Let us check for the other way that all this is, said the VISIBLEMENT said visibility.

109
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,180
Some typos on such a hard.

110
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,140
So we have said the system is going to grow.

111
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,320
Now let us import that.

112
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,360
We are setting the frame to travel so fast we have to import that frame.

113
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,820
So that frame is inside the Java Swing Library.

114
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,560
So it is important as Java starts going north.

115
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,160
It is like all of the components are imported, so we are giving it.

116
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,290
So perfect.

117
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,780
Now that class has to forward inside the frame.

118
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,990
So I will extend this class.

119
00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:01,970
As defining as the difference is that component of the Java similarity inside which we are going to

120
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,620
create that application.

121
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:10,730
So we have extended this to frame important Java swing library and.

122
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,700
And perfect.

123
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,580
So we have created a flame.

124
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,740
We have set it's visibility.

125
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:24,400
Now switch to the more dark Java class, showing that more glass.

126
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:31,200
Similarly, we have time for the swing package as it is needed everywhere.

127
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,640
So important the swing.

128
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:40,210
And after that, one more package is Nakatomi important, which is AWP.

129
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:45,140
As string is built on the top of the WD Java.

130
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:52,090
Unattainable WD is also needed with same importance for this project.

131
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,140
So Java?

132
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,000
No, no, no, no.

133
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:03,250
And similarly, that's true as we have to use most of the packages components of this package.

134
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,460
So yes, we have created the world class.

135
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,950
We will extend it to Japan.

136
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,280
Now you may be wondering that we are extending the.

137
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,510
Snake, as do you frame, and we are extending this, as do penance.

138
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:27,020
Sure, there is a panel inside which the frame is to be consistent.

139
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,090
We can't put a frame head on here and the both places, which is not practically possible.

140
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,780
The program will give an error.

141
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,910
So we have created a panel inside which we are giving the.

142
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,690
So the board is a panel extension.

143
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,710
Now we will create a board object or construct whatever you wish to see.

144
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,880
And in the similar way, setting the dimensions of the frame.

145
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,790
So said prayer for the size we have to sacrifice from the frame.

146
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,080
Like if!

147
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,960
Will, if there's new.

148
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,550
It's like mesh size should be seen as a new dimension.

149
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:25,170
And removing this unwanted lines from the all new dimension.

150
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,870
And suppose we want to give the high bandwidth down the frames.

151
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,300
Three hundred and ten on this.

152
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:39,300
So we have given the size us 200 and 300 for both done better.

153
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,610
This is unmonitored, so we have set the frame size up.

154
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:55,550
Three hundred and two hundred now switching to the snake glass and calling the board, they're so far

155
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,130
calling the border, we have to add a border object inside the snake object.

156
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:13,230
So that board object as new are not known simply newborn, newborn and the rockets and clothing.

157
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,990
So let's try to run this and see what happens.

158
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:29,700
So the snake glasses ominously outgoing to run the Java program soirées the frame is perfectly clear.

159
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,220
You can see it on your screen.

160
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,660
The frame is created.

161
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:41,160
Now we have to open this in the full size window, like in the middle of the.

162
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,590
Page, so adding.

163
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:52,490
One more line in the cold, which one responsible for doing so.

164
00:13:53,030 --> 00:14:00,410
So we have gone back and now they will try to run this and waiting.

165
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,140
So perfect.

166
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:11,640
We have a full frame, which we have theater of size three hundred and three hundred on running Java

167
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:17,370
for the snake glass, after which we have successfully created this.

168
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:25,470
Now we have to add the snake and the apple object enmeshed inside this room, which we will be covering

169
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,620
in the next five.
