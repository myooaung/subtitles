1
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.930
So we're already seen.

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:11.970
Are going with our project and will be establish our team, so I will tell you how we can proceed further

3
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.580
regarding to this.

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.260
Different things, so.

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.940
Currently, you can check here.

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.860
I created everything, so now in the bombed out example.

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.370
At 11 a.m. dependency, you can add it directly from the dependency manager or do this Oregon, we'll

8
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.580
do these packages also.

9
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.050
So here you can check that out when only one package is added to the list.

10
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.580
So packages you.

11
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.360
So what?

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.200
I'm going to tell you.

13
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.100
Or basically, what we can do is really easy things just go to this package.

14
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.720
He entered.

15
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.490
Or who do they go to new?

16
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.020
It will take some time for the first team of product.

17
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:19.030
It will then go to package your packages package or don't believe this package, but keep at is for

18
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.510
the back.

19
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.160
I'm going to axioms and he did it, so it will create a service package for so indexed that we package.

20
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.600
What I'm going to do, I'm going to add some more services or Java course classes, so I will show you

21
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.090
how we who I'm going to add that part also.

22
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.350
So let's see how I'm going to end.

23
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.060
Well, let me add one thing here in this obvious is it?

24
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.980
That being again.

25
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.830
Plus new employee suits.

26
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.250
So it will create one class default class it will create for you for this purpose.

27
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.430
Oh, so it is mind blowing.

28
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.250
And let's see how we are going to use glass and.

29
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.500
So.

30
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.010
Let me.

31
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.520
OK, so now we're done with this, so.

32
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.220
Oh, no, you need it.

33
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.870
Are you three different, different exemplars currently, which is considered some more than anything,

34
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.020
we are going to later take that part.

35
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.540
But let me change this class to interpret.

36
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.430
So I will tell you what is interface?

37
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.280
Interface is nothing but some 30 percent instruction you can see.

38
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.380
It's it will occur to me.

39
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.690
It will give me 100 percent extraction of thought in this book.

40
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.040
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to add some list of employees and create a list of employees.

41
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.010
So let me at least.

42
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.500
So I'm going to add one class also faced that Paxil.

43
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.050
I'm going to add that class directly because I'm giving the name currently.

44
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.460
The name is not accessible yet, as you can see.

45
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.200
Great.

46
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.530
So I recreate that my first little book, Get All.

47
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.230
You know.

48
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.520
So currently, these items giving me a because I haven't created any employee parts, so I will tell

49
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.600
you how I am going to add that part then for you to save employee.

50
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.110
I'm going to create one method while they.

51
00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.790
Employed, which is basically saving that employed part with against him.

52
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.640
Lloyd.

53
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.220
Employment Bill.

54
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.020
What I'm going to do is I'm.

55
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.890
I created one million employee, which consists employed, so I've created a class Java class later

56
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.130
in another package, but it will move that employee and it will store their employer in the saving part.

57
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:29.050
So now with Ivy Park I.D., but I'm going to pitch in blue, get employed by OTA.

58
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.710
I need it.

59
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.690
So let me create employment.

60
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.310
So I'm adding here.

61
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.740
I already created some parts, so I'm going to add that part in later.

62
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.840
So I'm mentioning this part earlier, but it may be very helpful by.

63
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.370
Employing by 80.

64
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.530
Later part.

65
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.750
And.

66
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.950
The long and deep so.

67
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.550
Let me move it to this on here, so there will be no error.

68
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.970
It's a new look and I'm guessing then know again to hear some.

69
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.380
Believed employing.

70
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.440
Don't want to believe deeply.

71
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.750
But I.

72
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.280
Long.

73
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:44.040
IBM and the next part of what I'm going to do is I'm going to add one page here and I will tell you

74
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.060
when do what will be the later?

75
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:56.630
So first thing, you may hear some errors, but these ignore these errors I'm going to create employed

76
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.430
by later.

77
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.280
But let me add here, which is basically.

78
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.950
Well, I believe it is very simple in Rhode Island or in framework.

79
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.290
Then I need to add your data.

80
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.570
Not booming.

81
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.370
You can and start.

82
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.380
I'm going to add to your page.

83
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:34.740
So when we polled our library to incorporate the data with the page itself, the basic loading, and

84
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.620
we'll use it.

85
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.670
So in the next part, what I'm going to tell you this thing and everything, so to see what it was and

86
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:50.480
how it's going to work, well, I don't know about this thing, but what is the spring spring having

87
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.860
some inversion of control?

88
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.140
I will see so that our debate pattern is to remove our dependence on programming.

89
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:05.750
So if we all learned jalla, you need some external libraries, Jonathan, also for that purpose, but

90
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.280
in out of control.

91
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.610
What we can do.

92
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:19.930
We are not performing independence and complete complete means if one is dependent on second, then

93
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.480
if one values changed.

94
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.370
Second, lose until change.

95
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.760
So that's really dangerous by deploying any application.

96
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:34.930
So regardless of what you think you can use, New Scotland thinks you know, let me consider one example

97
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:41.520
employee, which contains every service in this class measured and employed.

98
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.770
Am I saying this is equal to new ideas directly to the class?

99
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:53.320
So what happens if in the employee class engineering the value of some different attributes it will

100
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.190
appear be changed?

101
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.770
That part is also.

102
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.120
So that's very dangerous thing going.

103
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.440
So it is incomplete.

104
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:11.930
But in Najaf, then you can use this are U.S. to humans but do difficult enough, but you can use injection

105
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.550
dependency.

106
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.680
So that added dependency backing one another to make it basically injecting dependency.

107
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:25.370
Each advantages of injection dependency on independents injecting using easy to maintain, easy to best

108
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:31.520
because you can take that dependency, said it or not, it's not very no job for that purpose.

109
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.070
But you can choose that part later.

110
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:41.000
So I will tell you advantages, ladies, these pre-defined opinions on the ABC hibernate nuclear technology

111
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.870
go already, so no need to create some mystical view.

112
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:51.210
You are getting some default templates for that purpose, like creating steam room statements.

113
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:51.990
Creating connection.

114
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.390
No need to require to.

115
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.730
And you just need to act properly.

116
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.480
It's very easy, then loose coupling that I'd already seen.

117
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:07.530
Dependency injection string framework is easy to maintain and easy to do because egbin since supplication

118
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.870
are required to sober, but in the springtime.

119
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.780
Nathan Embraceable with Noble Indeed, Noble stated that what is really embedded in that?

120
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.130
So no need to worry about how I'm going to add external Sjoberg.

121
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.430
So for the requirements such, I'm not mentioning Union External.

122
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:29.090
You just need us strengthen that party's already added in this principle.

123
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:36.050
So let me move with the I.D. part and well, we already created this part.

124
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:44.710
So in the project thing you can do here in the next piece, I'm going to add some things, but I interfaces.

125
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.200
I will tell you that you will understand that, but little hope you understand.

126
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.220
Thank you.
