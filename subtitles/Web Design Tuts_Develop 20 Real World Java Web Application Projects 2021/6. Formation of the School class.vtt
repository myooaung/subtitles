00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:09.280
So in the previous video, we have talked about the total money earned by getting it and updating you

2
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.050
now.

3
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.860
We will discuss about that total money spent, like if a score will pay to the teachers.

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.770
We have to return it via function.

5
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.840
Total money spent.

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.880
So let's write it.

7
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.500
So the total money spent is return through this function returns.

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.690
Total money spent by the school.

9
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.170
Yes.

10
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:48.280
So this returns the total money spent by the school for paying the salaries of teachers or anything

11
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.030
like school.

12
00:00:50.230 --> 00:01:00.730
Now suppose if school earns twenty thousand and the salary of a teacher is seven bucks.

13
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:09.130
So if the school pays 700 to the teacher, what will be the fund left with the school?

14
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.360
So it would be like the thousand minus seven hundred, and this equals No.

15
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.710
Thirteen hundred bucks.

16
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:27.970
So this fine does the calculation for that only public static void update total money spent.

17
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.420
So this update, the money spent.

18
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.760
Yes.

19
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.630
So.

20
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.100
Explaining this.

21
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:48.580
Subtraction, fun like suppose, initially, the total money earned by this spent by the school was

22
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.110
zero.

23
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.850
So the total money earned would be like.

24
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.900
Oh, here it is spent.

25
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.670
So, yes, I suppose initially that total money spent was zero, so it resulted in suppose that the

26
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.850
total money spent is zero zero is equal to.

27
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.560
Zero, minus seven, 700.

28
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:34.950
Or we can assume that in the beginning, the school has spent nothing but when the school has earned

29
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.610
a fund of 2000, Bucks School has now 2000 those spent.

30
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.140
So it would be like 2000 minus the argument past that is money spent.

31
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.770
Suppose we have spent seven hundred, so the output for this variable will be today.

32
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.930
This is like.

33
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.500
Subtracting the money spent and what is left with the school.

34
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.780
So guess it would become thirteen hundred.

35
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.480
The variable will be updated retail value of putting.

36
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.620
Yes.

37
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:25.740
So in this way, we can construct this class of school with our teacher student.

38
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.310
Total money and total money spent throughout.

39
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.170
Now we have successfully completed this school class.

40
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:45.640
Moving forward towards the middle class, this is the means by responsible for running our school funds

41
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.050
management system.

42
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.960
So let's begin with this.

43
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.150
So this main class is responsible for testing and running this program.

44
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.880
So initializing it as a means function, passing a strong argument.

45
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.000
Let us declare a feature object.

46
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.460
Let us create a teacher led her class and then talk.

47
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.010
Yes.

48
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.040
And there's a new feature.

49
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.050
We are adding the teacher to the dataset.

50
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.580
Yes.

51
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.600
And.

52
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:33.500
Yes, as far as I did not pass anything to this nature object, it is asking me for an I.D. string name

53
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.550
and the salary.

54
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.900
Yes.

55
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.270
So get the.

56
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:47.730
As far you declared a teacher of the year, it will ask you for these variables until you do not declare

57
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.910
it.

58
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.990
They will keep asking for it and showing and ever, so let us give her to it.

59
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.500
One.

60
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.810
Name hot as Samantha.

61
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.520
And sat Saturday off, I think about five a.m..

62
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.350
Yes, fine.

63
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.920
Now let us have a new teacher to.

64
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.740
I will copy that data from here and paste it.

65
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.340
So they did her two times.

66
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.390
I'm going to get two more pictures, so named the seven second teachers.

67
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.920
Like Marla.

68
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.120
Yes.

69
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.590
So the second teacher is Marla, her ideas to.

70
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.090
The string of name ups and the salary support she gets.

71
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.170
Nine thousand she is an experienced due to.

72
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.050
The third one is so they've.

73
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.170
Yes.

74
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:07.970
So the third feature is currently they is free, as we haven't called it anywhere in the program.

75
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:18.840
When we will call this, the color will automatically change, so name the teacher, said the I.D. and.

76
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.370
The expected salary for the third one is supposed six thousand.

77
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.940
OK.

78
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:37.360
Now, in the similar way, we are going to a few students to this main class support student, one name

79
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.250
her thumb on.

80
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.280
Yes.

81
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:50.250
So we have declared the objects to then name that object, someone suppose the student is new.

82
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:58.400
So new students and in a similar way, it is asking for ID name in the face of repeat.

83
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.800
So yes, the I.D. for the minor is, suppose one.

84
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.810
Name is.

85
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:15.950
Demonized in inside a string quartet.

86
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:24.910
I mean, and the grain, suppose she scored 40 out of 100.

87
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:37.250
She may improve it later and not let me copy the student that evil to Ms.

88
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.400
Same as the teacher and named the second student.

89
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.580
Or should we name her?

90
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.290
Suppose she's proud.

91
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:48.860
Yes.

92
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.540
The string to her name and the new.

93
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.360
So Bush scored 70 on Sunday.

94
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.810
That third one is.

95
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.110
Jonah?

96
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:08.440
Yes.

97
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.010
So, yeah, I forgot the gene, daddy.

98
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:12.750
This, too.

99
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.380
I do for the days three.

100
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.980
String to her name.

101
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.710
And.

102
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.100
Good for you, that could be marked.

103
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.850
50, we can see that, yes.

104
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:40.140
So we have successfully created three new teachers and students, no way to store them.

105
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.570
Our question arrives in your mind.

106
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.860
So go to the previous part and.

107
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:55.640
Remember when we talked about adding, like we talked about adding this there, remember?

108
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.480
Yes.

109
00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.530
So had the use of analyst arises?

110
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.230
The significance of fairness is felt here.

111
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:14.150
Now creating a list or teacher as we want to add teacher, right?

112
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:15.510
So, yes.

113
00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.700
We created a list name, a journalist, yeah.

114
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.470
Naming future list, you can name linked, whatever anyone to name.

115
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.390
So yes.

116
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:38.240
Now, no analyst displayed it, at least.

117
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:38.960
Yes.

118
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.020
So you can see that the Arab list is important automatically.

119
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:47.710
Yes.

120
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.850
So that at least for teacher is created now.

121
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.320
We will add features to this ad in this.

122
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:16.980
Now that soon Texas's feature is not like memorizing numbers in their demo, Phi Phi 16 and so on.

123
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:28.350
So we will have teachers in the same room and someone tied to the list and my to the list and then lost

124
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.610
list and Marla.

125
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.960
Marla and the third one.

126
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.670
A journalist starts and must do.

127
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.520
Yes.

128
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:56.250
So the teachers have successfully added to the list, or at least you can see now in a similar way.

129
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.590
We will add students to that list.

130
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:08.010
So after successfully adding students and teachers to the list now, how do we have to create a school

131
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.370
that their teachers and students will consist?

132
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:20.220
So let us name this school as ABC and this school contains the journalist and student list, which we

133
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.010
made earlier.

134
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:25.710
Now we have to check whether the.

135
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.720
This function is running properly or not.

136
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:37.760
So let us say this out that the school has done what what the school has done in the beginning.

137
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.460
So I want to run.

138
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:50.120
I'm expecting up zero output as nobody has raised enough fees or nobody is credited with the salaries.

139
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.410
So.

140
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.170
On running.

141
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:53.970
Yes.

142
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.800
So the school has to be perfect.

143
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:57.700
So, yes.

144
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.670
In the beginning, some money on why the school is zero.

145
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.680
So let us add something to the fund the box.

146
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.210
It's like the now dog.

147
00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.410
Base fees.

148
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.950
And it is what free shipping.

149
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.590
Suppose he paid sixty thousand.

150
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:29.980
Soyuz.

151
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.160
So firstly, we have to create this basis in the student body.

152
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:42.020
Like if the student fees Duffy, what changes are there?

153
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:48.880
So yes, when a student pays fees, we have created a function for it.

154
00:12:49.600 --> 00:13:00.130
This updates like like we specified this day, the fees of student suppose.

155
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.890
The total fees for a year is thirty thousand.

156
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:10.840
And student pays twenty thousand in the beginning, so the amount left to be paid is thirty thousand

157
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.340
minus twenty thousand.

158
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.650
So yes, we have created this pay fees function here.

159
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.790
Now getting back to this, I hope now this.

160
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.100
Yes.

161
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:32.100
So now after running this, so running this function.

162
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:41.420
Mr Tracey, then I'll put off the fees paid by someone, which will be the fees earned by the school.

163
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:48.660
Soyuz perfect school has on rupees sixty thousand students.

164
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:55.620
The money has been Ducey's, and it is added to the total money earned by the school.

165
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:02.030
So, yes, that's all for this in the next review.

166
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.740
We will talk about adding more features and more funds to the school.
