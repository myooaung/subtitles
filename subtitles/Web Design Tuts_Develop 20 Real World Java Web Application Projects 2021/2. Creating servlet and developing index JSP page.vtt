00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:09.600
So in previous resolution, I told you all I created in this bar and know what I'm going to tell you,

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.720
I'm going to create here this part I already created and introduced me.

3
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.820
This is just the French capital.

4
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.130
Let's see how we can create this thing.

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.330
So let me mention some steam here, because it's image.

6
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.990
So as you can see, it will automatically move to that part, then let me create one state yet, so

7
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.530
I will copy this part and I will tell you what is the significance of this?

8
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.770
Because I'm mentioning this directly.

9
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:56.230
I'm not going to direct Berkshire, which is a nation I'm mentioning State-issued here.

10
00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.660
OK.

11
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.750
No idea.

12
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.150
So this is my stylesheet.

13
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.600
If we want to add title, you gave me a little body who.

14
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.150
I don't think this need.

15
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.760
Show me.

16
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.980
Tonight, let's sit down to end.

17
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.780
So these are the collecting and hiding, and this is just a statement.

18
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.360
The main part starts of notice.

19
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.270
So let us see what is the body and when do you see it?

20
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:47.780
So let me add Bob Lickteig here, because all the teams are in only body part, not your anything.

21
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.830
Quite so I'm just writing this, but then I need one thing.

22
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.740
Then why I needed a phone to create the one post action or to feel.

23
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.250
Then some carry forward feel everything I'm going to edit form.

24
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.430
So let me add some

25
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.310
clues, but let me add some more attributes here.

26
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.100
So form is basically constant.

27
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.390
Contains action.

28
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.870
Mean, client.

29
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.370
Then me turn.

30
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.370
Post from Miami to this post, so you can only smell flan because it's during the day here.

31
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:46.030
Then let me add some formations here and I will tell you what is the formations these teams here?

32
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.650
OK?

33
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.230
So I already created this up, so I will tell you what the significance of these farm actions.

34
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.030
So this is the same thing.

35
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.580
Are we going to see Styling Park?

36
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.590
I will tell you that as it goes on to train nearly playing distinct.

37
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.810
So I will tell you what is.

38
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.640
So this may look like and what I'm doing here is you restart images speaking.

39
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.380
So I'm accessing that equation to get that message part first.

40
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.840
So as my H3 to bring the message here, or we can say, being the message, you know, really started

41
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.100
inside the foam tank.

42
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.110
First is email, who could email, well, who?

43
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.720
I want to send that email, but emails to bark, then subject difficulty.

44
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.010
But that takes some time placeholder.

45
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.220
But then I'm adding some next idea to common sites for email, but then de RBD with some input they

46
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.280
submit and I mentioned here menu.

47
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.320
So I will tell you what I'm going to do here.

48
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.530
So these are all things of GCP.

49
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:06.130
As you can see, all these stages of industry time for printing music and creating some value of some

50
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.400
part of ego.

51
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.890
He just basically I'm going to create one glass and say this.

52
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.220
So these are the all things and I will tell you we are going to in working years, be closely following

53
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.770
the how when accessing this part, I will tell you later.

54
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.380
But these are all things I use here.

55
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.130
So this is it part of the part.

56
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.090
I'm accessing the button and I'm sending you to you lose basically just me to I'm going to use them.

57
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.650
This may look like that will be legible, which you then use here, Operation Room.

58
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.700
So I will tell you what is the significance of this in the later part?

59
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.900
But first, let us see what is the basically all functional requirements I created with orbits the sun

60
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.650
life archaea.

61
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.380
So if you know, printing them by the end of the week pages, so I'm creating your dynamic page.

62
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.210
It's not stating it's not for you.

63
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.390
Little information I did.

64
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.680
I'm going to create some responsive team here, like clicking on that movement and increasing the mailing

65
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.900
to use you.

66
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.260
So this is not only the static thing, I'm going to create some dynamic for that purpose.

67
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.860
I need to make it back into just basic logic as a stimulant uses having not exactly programming language.

68
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.330
These are some frontier language.

69
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.350
I began scripting language for the visualization part.

70
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.340
These are not exactly like they can add some different my mathematical models in that also.

71
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.810
So for the EPA, Bart for that purpose, I need a new language.

72
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.730
So here I'm using Jello.

73
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.170
So walking the da da on it is technology to create application.

74
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:52.010
So let's use an API which provides interfaces and classes to connect to streamline some backend facilities

75
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.050
for the backend database, anything you can.

76
00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.580
So Solarte is an accessible interface and classes, so it is an interface must be implemented by creating

77
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.760
in.

78
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.110
So you have to create the one solid.

79
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.370
According to that, you need to your interface, which also acts as a plus to having some capabilities

80
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.300
of service which responds for incoming requests.

81
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:21.380
So if you know how the subject's working on holding the next what, it's basically on request and response

82
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.740
when Glenn you the response and the response and everything requests.

83
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.870
So these are holding a little words.

84
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.460
So lyrics are an important part in this.

85
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.340
Not only the soldiers in our different teams also not like some Java scripting things also.

86
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.860
And so we're Byton also no place for that.

87
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.910
So these are the different things we can use.

88
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.540
So ladies and we have component that plants over to create endemically which.

89
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:55.610
So you used a solid part actually potentially creates this is the climate, and this is the Third World

90
00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.060
part, and for this purpose, it will request this over these points you've generated and the runtime

91
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.510
and Wisconsin will look like.

92
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.260
So how will this vote actually depend on your service?

93
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:14.800
So my so, so liberal when I'm deployed on the sofa and land, we see only the Jewish people who do

94
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.740
so or in this space.

95
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.490
So I'm playing.

96
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:23.490
But if you want to plan on instead what you can do lose 18 A-levels cloud or anything you can use,

97
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.680
then here request dispatching subleader.

98
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.470
So what is the request?

99
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.890
Especially because this veterans interface provides a facility of dispatching any requests.

100
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:41.400
So basically, if you want to check any link directly from the dollar like you would submit button and

101
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:47.420
do you want to do like, you want to find some another bit, you want to do more for that purpose.

102
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.680
We are using request this better material.

103
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.380
So we are using your text format.

104
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.540
I don't include attack so that you and that Gilchrist metal in.

105
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:09.070
Speech, good, attribute it just basically for that forward proposal and this my will, so as you can

106
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.720
see that to my independence.

107
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:20.030
So this is the forward word amateur and forward is for forwarding that book and including that, including

108
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:26.210
the same board, then let me tell you so important part is doing is exasperating Java.

109
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.380
So programmers beckon and we make some money for the control for.

110
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.780
But here I am onboard Exxon Mobil and we make simple.

111
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:38.890
There are two different things here form useful properties and maybe some broader control flow for holding.

112
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.880
So let me go to it and let me create one glad we can skim milk land.

113
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:47.230
So.

114
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:54.720
As you can see here, I'm mentioning my client as male client, male client.

115
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.450
So you can complete this part.

116
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.150
Then what I'm going to go to this Java.

117
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.460
I'm going to create here one package, so I am developing another packages because it's very important

118
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.180
for you've got different packages and you can use that later.

119
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.550
So let me create one package here.

120
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:22.270
I mean, she as we saw in this meal package, I'm going to create one Java class named as many of them.

121
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.780
So this is it, and in these days, people are trying to do this.

122
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.480
I just want to invoke that.

123
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.360
I just want to inform that so far the important thing is very simple.

124
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.010
Just go to this.

125
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:46.950
They can assure you, Oh, I'm due for this, okay, so I'm importing this.

126
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.110
Let me capitalize this because it would be really capitalized.

127
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.210
Let me.

128
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.110
Well, to the effect of I'm being immunized.

129
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.560
We'll see you.

130
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:07.870
We have them.

131
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.070
So what you're going to see more.

132
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.040
OK, OK.

133
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.650
Create number two you.

134
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:28.580
This.

135
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.940
You do disodium, because they changed, the naming is very important here.

136
00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:48.010
I just want to men Minh City and not mean because each client was misspelled and.

137
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.120
You can only see it is done.

138
00:10:54.010 --> 00:11:00.290
And let me mention you email, simply know the M., C. A..

139
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.600
And later, I'm going to be here, that will be limited, I will tell you, working as a team.

140
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.880
So this is it.

141
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.130
I'm going to do so before proceeding with this.

142
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:21.250
Let me, I have some undertake similar failure, which is basically very useful.

143
00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.470
DEP. I'm going to add here.

144
00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.570
So let me add one dependency.

145
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.920
Which is basically Java me.

146
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.820
Dependency one for one simple object.

147
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:48.780
So let me tell you, when we do this, we go to any dependency aimed at a park, and this part of me

148
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.010
is this.

149
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:57.720
So this is the male dependency you can take from the internet and just take this and it will resolving

150
00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.240
dependencies, it will dissolve it.

151
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.060
I don't agree.

152
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:06.510
Oh, then I'm going to add another dependency, which is basically Java, which is basically for the

153
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.130
dependency part of this little.

154
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.100
We had this and it was seeing this again.

155
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.750
So it will sink the dependencies economically.

156
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.200
So Java is merely for the purpose for creating email application.

157
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:30.210
So instead of downloading LibreOffice or we can see dollar data files, I can deploy this and this is

158
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.400
the latest version you can directly download this.

159
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.740
So this for me.

160
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:40.050
And let me just OK, this is India's largest.

161
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.910
And now let us create some military involved here.

162
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.020
So in the meantime, what I'm going to do is.

163
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.610
Let me extend school up.

164
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.420
If should be solely.

165
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.590
Needs to be sold.

166
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:19.580
So as you can see, just ahead and this and we don't want to get into one thing in stocks, know what

167
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.270
is important, obviously.

168
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:32.490
Oh, again, I'm adding some and auditions here, also adding an audition is really useful while developing

169
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:32.760
this.

170
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.540
Give all your it's so late.

171
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.380
Not.

172
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.170
Auditions don't start.

173
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:52.600
What I'm going to add this year is them, so let's not some simple we've solid.

174
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.660
In this, we have solid.

175
00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.890
What I'm going to mention here is this mean.

176
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.350
She.

177
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:04.770
Deal.

178
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.650
So it will be helpful for me to.

179
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.470
You mentioned that this is a male client.

180
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:14.210
Some of it.

181
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:23.770
So I'm going to create here one Syrian woman genuinely, which is very crucial for creating any Muslim

182
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.670
part to private.

183
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.410
Again, steady, I mean, daily wages steady.

184
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.340
Final.

185
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:39.620
Oh, it should be long because I'm reading her cereal, Virginia.

186
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.620
See this user agreement more.

187
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:56.460
So I created this, but then cleared, let me create one public static.

188
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:01.670
Finally.

189
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.770
Here is the part of Engel who beat.

190
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.500
Go.

191
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:13.880
Is equivalent.

192
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.070
And I mentioned in the same.

193
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:27.030
So if you go to this park now, you can check the operation is not successful, so it will people blind

194
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.240
them.

195
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.450
Then let me create one constructor here.

196
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:35.800
Well, it.

197
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:39.540
The.

198
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.680
And.

199
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:54.740
Male citizen, this is my constructor, and I'm not mentioning it manning the super you.

200
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.000
Superhuman.

201
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.160
Supreme Auto generated constructor.

202
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.690
This is just auto generated.

203
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:10.610
You can use all teams are totally you who created anything you can see constructor so already.

204
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.950
So you can create auto generated constructor.

205
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.840
I'm going to construct it is just to pass your everything.

206
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.190
Make sure you can be anybody team so you understand this part.

207
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:27.860
In for their part, I'm going to create application with some dubious methods and everything.

208
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.630
Hope you understand this part.

209
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.150
And in for the part, I will tell you that it is been missing.

210
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.060
It seems to be a basic console, which is basically simple mail transport.
