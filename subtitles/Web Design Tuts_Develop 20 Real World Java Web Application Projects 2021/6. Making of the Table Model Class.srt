1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:08,700
So by far in this project, we have covered the download manager Glass and the misgendered glass.

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,370
Our next concern is to cover the light good table more than glass.

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,740
So firstly, we have to create our download table model glass.

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:29,420
In order to add, like good structures to the table, how actually the table model is going to be look

5
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,380
inside the frame.

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:38,780
So if the glass is created or download the model now inside this glass may be light.

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,410
Or firstly, we have to import some of the packages in order to use the.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,060
Components of those specific packages, are you?

9
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,450
This is the first component we are going to use after this.

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,440
The second package?

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,730
OK, so it is import.

12
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,300
And the second package we are going to use is Java Swing.

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,950
So import Java X-Wing and.

14
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,240
After this, we are going to import job X-Wing.

15
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:27,900
So it is going to be similar, so we will copy this and just add them stable to it.

16
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,220
Yes.

17
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,470
So awesome job X-Wing, stable, not astronaut.

18
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,940
So all the components are going to be important.

19
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,750
That's why we have added, I stick to all three of the packages.

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,890
Now we will be extending this download, they will more than last.

21
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,280
So struck, they wouldn't want this component of the frame.

22
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,180
So abstract table model.

23
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,710
And had this.

24
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:12,400
So inside this download table, more than Class B will be like adding O string, adding for the names

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:20,360
of the columns, we have already discussed that we have a table supposedly like we had agreed for.

26
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:29,890
You are the size of listing the past speed part and then Spain and after which elapsed time and then

27
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,800
running them and the last for this status.

28
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,910
So we will be like creating a string at a direct start date.

29
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,380
Final spring.

30
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,690
And square races, so.

31
00:02:50,640 --> 00:03:02,650
Like initialize, so column names is going to be the name for this story and the consistency of this

32
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,880
that is going to be you are in.

33
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:15,680
The second one is going to be OK, so we have all of them the size in and we broke this speed.

34
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,810
Average speed and both of their times is remaining time.

35
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:33,590
And the status, so it is like this after this, we have to like asset classes for each column in order

36
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,860
to set specific one for each class.

37
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,750
Like, suppose that you are all is going to contain a string form and input.

38
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,270
The size is going to contain like integer inputs and be not integers.

39
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:55,630
The size could be in this in this, so we will be using like a float data type for storing the size.

40
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:03,200
And similarly, for progress and speed, we are using the like.

41
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,420
So similarly, the flow database.

42
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,530
Similarly, for a further time on the meaning than on this date doesn't go going to be a string, which

43
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,630
is really be showing downloading completed past error and all of them.

44
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,750
So yes, after this, we are going to contain classes for each of them.

45
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,170
Private static final class.

46
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:39,690
And in a similar way, it is linked to be an editor and the name is going to be the column glasses.

47
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,350
Column glasses.

48
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,710
It is not slow.

49
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,140
They will be copping it from here.

50
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,100
And.

51
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,680
So I guess this is again going to be.

52
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:07,250
So we can simply set all of them toasting in order to like, avoid any kind of inconvenience, Sting

53
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:15,290
takes all of the inputs that need to be a numerical value or not.

54
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,120
So we're going to be using strings as at last.

55
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,810
Everything is going to be displayed in the form of string.

56
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:31,610
So we are going to copy and paste for all of them one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and

57
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:31,840
eight.

58
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,360
And we have.

59
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,580
So we will cooperate seven more times and.

60
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,840
And we have done before by six and seven.

61
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,660
So, yes, this is done.

62
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:55,340
We have created a string class for all the columns in the format of fire.

63
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:02,150
And after this we are going to like create a buzz list on download.

64
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,010
We are adding rules.

65
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,320
So what is going to be the next time to add new artists to the frame?

66
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,800
We will be using at least we have already discussed what they listed in the previous CDs.

67
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:24,830
Also, I am quickly summarizing and that list is due to start with me using Java.

68
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,460
It is basically a type of edit, but it is desirable.

69
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,610
We can input any number of for like a de facto decided list.

70
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,740
There is no fixed size.

71
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,100
We can increase the size according to the need.

72
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:47,660
It is going to be like an infinite size it, so that makes it more useful.

73
00:06:48,140 --> 00:07:00,000
We can use this analyst for a starting like a team, which is not fixed to specify what we can see specifically.

74
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:08,120
So calling this analyst does download and the name is going to redownload a list.

75
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:17,270
So a download list is going to be the name of the object and a new analyst.

76
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,330
Downloads will be created.

77
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,070
So inside this, we are using now, not again.

78
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,670
And this is going to add their downloads to this ad and this.

79
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:32,680
Yes.

80
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,020
So head of the.

81
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:42,420
We have created the two areas for all the columns in the table more than we have created are the list

82
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,440
for their downloads.

83
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,360
Now our next step will be creating a new download for the table.

84
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:56,370
So a new download function we are going to create now after creating this item list for all they want

85
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,680
is to be stored inside this sadness.

86
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:05,370
Now we are adding new downloads to the table, which is going to be like visible in the window.

87
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:13,680
So we are creating this add download function, which is taking download out of human, and this is

88
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:23,580
going to add that specific download to the list after which they have to like, set to account for all

89
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,170
that cause.

90
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:32,820
I like this file tomorrow insertion notification is decreasing their role count whenever a new download

91
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:41,930
you are is added to the program and after which we are like getting an download for specific a specified

92
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,240
role.

93
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,960
So yes, so this is their table model.

94
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,940
Suppose our task is downloading and it is then.

95
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,570
So what happens after this is completed?

96
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,350
It will be showing hundred percent heard of.

97
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:05,830
You will be seeing a completed in that status thing, so that specific role will be downloaded now.

98
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:16,150
No actions need to be performed otherwise of clearing it, and that specific role is like finished action.

99
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,180
Now the next part is to remove that down removal from the list.

100
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,990
So suppose if we want to remove that are specific at all.

101
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,990
So we have to first select the download and then only we can remove the download.

102
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,850
So how to get that download?

103
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:39,720
So once the download is completed, I suppose if the download is taking place so we can firstly get

104
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:47,130
a download by selecting their specific role and then we can perform actions like removing that specific

105
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,060
role from the list.

106
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:56,940
So this is doing that only so forgetting getting a specified rule and removing the download from the

107
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,410
list.

108
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:03,390
That rule will be removed and the rule can't will be changed at all, minus one.

109
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,280
So suppose initially we had potatoes, we have cleared that third row.

110
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:16,860
Then the raw count is going to be three minus one, which is two at the end of awards level.

111
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:24,390
Like we have covered, though, getting and removing specified at all the deleting part we have seen

112
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,600
now get stable columns count.

113
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,650
So we have like a column saying we have eight columns.

114
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,450
We have already discussed it.

115
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:40,410
So for getting the column count, we are using this column gown function, which is going to return

116
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,240
the length of the column.

117
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:49,890
Similarly, for the names we are using this string get column name function, which is taking column,

118
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:56,150
ask them both and going to return that specific index of the column names.

119
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:05,220
Plus, suppose if we are talking about the status, then this index of this column names will be written

120
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,520
similarly for count.

121
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:15,270
So are we like increasing the number of hurdles once we are adding a new download to the list?

122
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:23,100
So this is going to like return the size of the rule, which is present in the table more than at present.

123
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:32,610
Now are forgetting all the things four columns now, like discussing what actually happening inside

124
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,900
each of the columns to check what is going to like.

125
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,990
We are using this switch case for this column.

126
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:49,110
We have total eight cases from zero to seven for all the indexes of the column after which we are using

127
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,480
this rule.

128
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:58,380
So for a specific rule, we have to get all these eight columns like in a unique way.

129
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,220
So what?

130
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,660
You are going to return?

131
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:06,960
So the case zero is going to return the for that specific role.

132
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,570
Suppose you are talking about this first rule.

133
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:16,140
So if they select the first rule, we are talking about the first rule, then we will be returned to

134
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,080
the other side's progress.

135
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,670
Read everything of this rule.

136
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,460
So they switch case is doing so.

137
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:31,980
It is going to return all of the values for the column, things like whether it be the size that prerogative

138
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,670
surrenders.

139
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,230
And there are.

140
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,860
All of them, we have slowed for their download.

141
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,530
We are going to return to Spain.

142
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,100
We are going to return that time and similar leader status.

143
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,760
But whether it is completed or not.

144
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,950
So all of this is coming from the download manager.

145
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,800
Plus we have already talked about this status on time.

146
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:05,880
Now our next concern is to notify the user that what is actually happening with that specific role?

147
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,810
So, yes, update is called whenever a download notifies its observers of any changes.

148
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,290
So we have done this in the previous part.

149
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:23,890
Also, we have used this observer observe it will function as an argument for that update.

150
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,240
We have used it in the progress of Android, I think.

151
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,830
Oh, OK.

152
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,630
So it was in the.

153
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,740
Let us check the download manager.

154
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:43,940
Yes, so we have called this update whenever there is like change any update, then this update function

155
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,910
is going to be gone in all of the functions.

156
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,340
Similarly, we are doing this for the download stable model also.

157
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:59,540
And this is going to like return the index of that specific column whenever the index is.

158
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,060
Suppose that is the second row and the fifth column.

159
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,970
So we will be concerned about this.

160
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,090
It's been around two three four.

161
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:18,470
Yes, we will be concerned about the average speed up there of that specific you are to which we are

162
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,280
talking about.

163
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,000
So by far, we have completed this download.

164
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,250
Stable function is now.

165
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,170
Yes, the download table model class is completed now.

166
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,640
The last part is going to cover everything which is left.

167
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:44,390
We are going to conclude everything about this code execution in the next review and it is going to

168
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,700
cover about the speed design.

169
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,900
Like you can see that everything there, which is showing a rectangle line, will be varnished after

170
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,050
the creation of that download class.

171
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:08,390
So it will be covering the status, time, speed and the size functionalities, and we will be looking

172
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,700
up to it in the next part.

173
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,260
So see you in the next.
