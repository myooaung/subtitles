1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:10,860
So in previous scene, we found one error and error is related to Java e-vapor application.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:21,660
So my suggestion is, ah, this dependency in Java API that you'd known there is no other errors and

3
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,520
these very similar things are created a new ticking.

4
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,400
So let me move on to it and close these things because we are already seeing these things.

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,670
So what I changed now I changed to treating.

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,930
Should I need one involves just feet to create one in now.

7
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,140
What do you mean I'm using?

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,420
I'm new venues for treating.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,110
Also here.

10
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:53,400
So I told you, creating the embossing is complicated because you need to handle with the file extension

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,150
and everything.

12
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,730
So creating in walks is legal team using Java.

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:09,570
Other than this, you can use sort of these verbal javascript is very useful, but it always not very

14
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,150
common thing.

15
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,460
So I created this.

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,910
It's very similar, I added.

17
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,710
Some would say file using case file, and I need this for these four words.

18
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,040
I need my listing, which is me limiting, and I'm passing the file name for my email and everything

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,730
I'm doing here.

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,140
And bullfighter, I'm acting is just music I imagine is missing in an increased use element mining and

21
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,960
the password learning protocol is outdated, don't you?

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,740
I read the horse to Centipede is deceased and I'm going to his to my urine.

23
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,040
Now, I don't want to specify the more detailed thing here.

24
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,710
I just go with some booty old images, not new ones in my inbox.

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,360
But oh, let me show you how we can forcefully do this in these.

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,110
And previously I bought either.

27
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,660
And that error is regarding to so now I rectified that error.

28
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,550
And let me show you this email you deleted also.

29
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,580
I changed a little bit, which is basically thing and email client also.

30
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:28,260
Or I have one link I never mentioned, but this thing which is basically overloading team where I'm

31
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,770
loading the overload with GDP so late.

32
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,660
So no need to choose anything yet.

33
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,460
Just this because I didn't my independency.

34
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,980
So you do in boxing.

35
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:48,600
So you need to do this thing, whether these are upended or overrated or not.

36
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,210
If not, you have to write it again.

37
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,600
Manually select one error I rectified.

38
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,560
I changed.

39
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,790
Email utility.

40
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,640
You did not really deeply.

41
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,400
And it delivered some variables.

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,880
I changed.

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,840
Oh, then let me do one thing here.

44
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:20,300
Look, you start to optimize imports like optimizing imports is a good thing to do because I don't want

45
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,250
to spend that much time this year.

46
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:32,410
And it's OK now I can remove all these things directly.

47
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,330
It's no longer required.

48
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,860
So I created this.

49
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,620
Now it's time to test it.

50
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,420
So testing is very easy.

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,910
We'll do any configuration for you and.

52
00:03:52,390 --> 00:04:01,040
One required thing is, Jake, you're you're a Tomcat server who told him to call my bootloader and

53
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,520
also not use, so I'm using this.

54
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:15,920
And similar to what I'm going to this, so it will take time to build and performing the actions while

55
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,850
building, you can keep these.

56
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:27,420
So let me show you what it's doing, all these things and it's sexism going on, compiling everything.

57
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:36,030
So new ideas to do these things while regularly developing this app, you need to add some application

58
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,470
things and maybe independency.

59
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,080
Also, you can add to your database on.

60
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,470
So now you can take this, and I don't get sort of what is an old building successful, as you can see,

61
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,610
will be successful in 13 seconds completed and the service is running.

62
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:58,650
So you can add, oh, you have to add some dependencies here in 1.6million to perform every actions

63
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,480
that PostgreSQL he took.

64
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:07,710
You have also providing the was this girl dependency, and you can perform these applications directly

65
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,730
using this.

66
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:09,870
So.

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,620
Let me show this is my e-mail application, if you know this.

68
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,330
And.

69
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,180
Let me show you all these things.

70
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,710
So.

71
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,530
So.

72
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:52,780
So this is my e-mail, basically, and we are going to review this and this is my email application,

73
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,230
so let me send this is my main test.

74
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,870
Let me put this in my best.

75
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,690
Application mean.

76
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:17,770
So you can add as many as we want, you can use that things are small and to send here, so it will

77
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,630
take time to perform actions.

78
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:29,730
While performing actions, you can take all the actions in your dorm, get local or server their log

79
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,830
where you can find that it's connecting or not.

80
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,360
So let me show you one thing.

81
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,590
You can check your roots adding and doing deals and everything it's doing cloakroom.

82
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,200
So.

83
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,590
You can check my emails sent successfully.

84
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,800
Let me reload this.

85
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,750
So it's lowering them, and you can check on my email I received.

86
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,150
So this is my another e-mail I use for the temporary connection and everything.

87
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:13,470
You can use any other thing and can work as many people.

88
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,340
So let me put this.

89
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,390
And so this might establish and now it's working.

90
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,540
So let me show you how I created that.

91
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,710
Another thing?

92
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,990
Even then, the spirituality you with this, OK?

93
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,030
So this in my inbox and everything I read and you can check mail has been saved successfully.

94
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,980
You can change the look of results.

95
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,870
So let me go to the box.

96
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,720
So Inbox is not very performed.

97
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:53,160
I created I just created as a prototype here for you to time constraints.

98
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,500
So I added some things here.

99
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,900
So this is my old tenacity, not new thing.

100
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,610
I'm facing this very old thing.

101
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,230
I was eating all the e-mails and editing and not telling everything here.

102
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,610
So lengthways this, you can create your own inbox.

103
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,770
You can hear different things like contacts you can search through.

104
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,140
I created this also using the steam so you can click on this.

105
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,570
So this is a tool you can perform.

106
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:33,990
And as I told you, I had assumed that me, but you can check your losing connection.

107
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,320
They seem to be sober where I am accessing what I'm doing.

108
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:44,130
You can check everything and you can check what you're passing and everything information from you.

109
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,420
Hope you understand.

110
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,890
Oh, thank you.

111
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:57,820
And or you can go to more extended to most professional thing because this is not just isolated from

112
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,660
what you can do now.

113
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:08,260
You can extend it more and you can build your own API team as you can create API values mostly used

114
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,300
for APIs.

115
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:15,720
You can create your own API microservices for this in the Nordics in May, which is basically properties,

116
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,510
properties, Immelt's.

117
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,710
You can perform these actions directly.

118
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,520
So let me show you on the Nordics and then we were living on location.

119
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,630
This is my home of experiment or

120
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,790
this is my bond of excitement.

121
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:44,880
Oh, so what are you going to do instead of adding your own email artifact?

122
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,050
It is different.

123
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,370
So.

124
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,250
OK, now this is done.

125
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,560
Now we are going to go with this point or symbol.

126
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,800
So you need to action do three things here.

127
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,690
While developing on the server, you need to add a Lynnfield wound up your API.

128
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:25,330
These things again and again, plus all you need to create one more thing to add database because this

129
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,860
is limited to only one user.

130
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:34,120
But when they were looking for company out of industry, you need to find data from the database console.

131
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,420
So that's very easy.

132
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,300
You can use the exclusive means directly there.

133
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,810
So next, sift and hope you understand.

134
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,560
Thank you.
