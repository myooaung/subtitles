1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:14,380
So in previous part, what we have done is we already created one in New Jersey, which is for the in

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,570
part like this government fly and we are importing some failures.

3
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:27,490
So we are importing this page and what is page import is basically I am just accessing this melodic

4
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:34,180
land lampooning me because the packages mean here, as you can see this bombed out exactly which is

5
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,000
my property.

6
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,210
A daily record.

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,240
Is this basic needs?

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:43,780
If you know this, this is just basically the injection dependency dependency injection I use you.

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,320
So I use this as a dependency part.

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:56,250
So late, I'm putting this, you can see I'm accessing this may look like you and I already wrote a

11
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:04,980
program for this, so my client is nothing, but it's accessing data on GCP police and.

12
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,710
This is going to indexing, so it will take them indexing.

13
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:17,060
So more then let me tell you, was in previously with some short recap.

14
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:23,480
So what I have done here is it's very easy.

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,520
I have a here.

16
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:29,830
So.

17
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,770
These are the teams.

18
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:41,860
It may look like I'm creating here, albeit string, which is saying basically then souvlaki what I

19
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,360
used as a constructor here.

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,770
You mentioned this is the constructor of this, so you can minimize this as it is the only platform

21
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:56,350
that actions sometimes indexing will take you a little bit of more time.

22
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,150
But what are you going to do?

23
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:05,050
You can just load this from, you know, independence is a big part of that indexing.

24
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,180
So.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,380
The building parachutes went to see this subdivision.

26
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,910
As you can see with the cloud.

27
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:22,490
So we created this message and everything, and it's going to dispatch and I'm using it two methods.

28
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,920
When is due post and one is doing it?

29
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:33,760
So this is it about how we perform in Maitland, so news just for accessing the daytime, everything,

30
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,240
then what is the mood in some individuals employed?

31
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,760
This can do one thing you.

32
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,400
If we were to open this and and.

33
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:58,420
What I'm going to do is you can just reload this because sometimes it takes more time indexing so you

34
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,500
can hide the process.

35
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,820
So it will take time.

36
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,880
But I know I can potentially beat my furthermore indexing part time.

37
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:15,310
I don't want to stop for this on this, but what I'm going to do, I'm going to create the one more

38
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,750
thing is email you.

39
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,090
So let me copy this.

40
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,550
OK, I got this, but no, let me go to the main line for.

41
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,040
What I'm going to do now is this gleaming new gel like glass.

42
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,270
Based on this e-mail utility being the.

43
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,670
So that's it.

44
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:50,530
It's created for this part, so it will take time to indexing and doing everything here.

45
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,370
Sometimes it takes more time than this.

46
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,470
We are not sorry about that, but we will check it later.

47
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,050
Let us start with coding part.

48
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:11,050
So I already created this, but we are remaining with some final strings, which is basically a special

49
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,430
socket factory.

50
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,360
We are going to factory is just basically for factory resetting and doing everything.

51
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,690
So if we go to the bottom.

52
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,240
I mean, over the mean.

53
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,220
But I read.

54
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,530
Let me mention one thing here is

55
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,240
this, too.

56
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,900
I will tell you, what is the significance of this?

57
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,090
So essentially, it's just handling this, so I'm mentioning this, but I will tell you later how it's

58
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,900
going to work.

59
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,550
It's not actually I'm as a comedian and I'm commenting.

60
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,230
This part is, I will tell you later.

61
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,870
You just it's a silly factory invention.

62
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,240
So that's not required at all.

63
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,560
But sometimes you just use more references for that.

64
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,820
Let me get one.

65
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,120
Private.

66
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,150
Steady.

67
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,060
Oh, I needed properties.

68
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,570
No, these props you can rent out, you can add anything so.

69
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:36,440
Sometimes it takes time like you can check your bag around us taking more time due to network issues

70
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,340
and more things.

71
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,870
But you can go to war with this new.

72
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,080
Properties.

73
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,790
So, you know, the job on properties, then what I'm going to perform here is I'm going to create one

74
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,780
static part.

75
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:09,150
So if you know, are instead putting all mean or or we can say between the Israelis commenting, it

76
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,440
will be like complete study or.

77
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,840
It, that would be a stream.

78
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,600
Instead of doing this matter, what I going to do, I can just mention a starting block.

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,430
So it will execute for me, steady.

80
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,280
I can create a standing block in Java.

81
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,990
Similarly, I created this.

82
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:40,570
So now what I'm going to do, I'm going to mention some properties of my assembly protocols.

83
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,790
These are good.

84
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:52,150
First is mentioning the host, which is basically me, not a simply the host.

85
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,950
So what is the host for me?

86
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,000
Let me put here.

87
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,900
It's MTV, which is G-mail, Moltisanti TV, Jimin Lodgement dot com.

88
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,210
So this is my sympathy for what you mean.

89
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,700
Then what is the pool probs?

90
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,550
Not good.

91
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,580
Tourism imports.

92
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:25,380
Next thing is, I want to mention the poor information, do you remember it's always so mentioned indirectly

93
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,860
monitoring China's extreme.

94
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,770
And I need to mention the authentication part, so why we need authentication, we need authentication

95
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,400
always.

96
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,440
We don't want to stop it.

97
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,910
They seem to be more.

98
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,380
Well, let me put Mike off, it is on this report, the you.

99
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,130
I am performing this through Baqir.

100
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:57,520
Then we are remaining with star BP, and all we can say is start fearless, start this.

101
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,080
So what are these things?

102
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:11,350
So let me mention here these are no proper fees of SMP server, so I'm mentioning all the proper people

103
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,340
who seem to be sort of like may not seem to be posted online.

104
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,130
Do you mean dot com?

105
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,760
All these fires to an authentication is so lame you need authentication or places you how do you e-mail

106
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,200
account and, you know, password?

107
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,400
We are mention here.

108
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,780
So I want to mention that authentication is always true in this case.

109
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,500
While sending e-mail is authentication is always true.

110
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,810
So you can say this and it will.

111
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,240
You mean the authentication on this.

112
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:44,740
But what I needed before is, I need to mention here.

113
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:56,110
One thing may not seem if it is simply not stop, be a closer we saw of we can see the.

114
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:09,590
Anybody else is a very common thing in what you can say, you need a new program if you're taking it

115
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,120
through this.

116
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:20,910
It's basically transport layer security and we have to enable it always this way using GM India.

117
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,140
So now we are done with this.

118
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,700
So let me check in.

119
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,470
Nixon is operating in the Nixon.

120
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,510
So sometimes it may take time according to your network connection at the moment.

121
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:41,820
So even though this, could it be done from this project that it will take, butI mean, and sometimes

122
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,500
it takes more time also.

123
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,120
So keep it as it is and move forward with your price.

124
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,260
So what?

125
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,190
We have done it.

126
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:58,720
Let me tell you again, I'm mentioning the WHO says this all has this authentication and the transport

127
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,920
list is going to be I won't be anyone mentioned as a trooper.

128
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,010
So that said, I had done it.

129
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:13,680
So no, what I want to mention is I want to mention here one sand mail message or saying the mail team.

130
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,480
So for that purpose?

131
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,240
We've seen me.

132
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,660
So I went public spending.

133
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,250
Right.

134
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,190
If you know why I'm mentioning it's not running anything.

135
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,550
So what is the reading, if you know the basics?

136
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,910
If you're from Italy is returning something re-allocating or getting this help getting some memory.

137
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,170
It should be here.

138
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,020
It's not doing anything.

139
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,790
Send is my method.

140
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:57,790
I want to mention one parameter is email message, which is my email.

141
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,840
Message.

142
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,940
The so another barometer I mentioned.

143
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,730
So these are the main parameters, not.

144
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,220
Anything you mention.

145
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,220
So, you know, you strike out instead of using triage.

146
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,840
What I can do, I need to.

147
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,710
Mention string saying that to me.

148
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,670
So.

149
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,390
Or you're going to lose.

150
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,980
Notice your e-mail, I mean, something like this because I I'm going to.

151
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,210
I will tell you about your e-mail.

152
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,010
Andrew, do you mind if you call this?

153
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:47,710
Second is that is password, because for the authentication purposes, I'm authenticating this and always

154
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,750
do well on which parameters I'm going to take your email address, which is basically username and password

155
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:59,000
for login in any as individual, whereas you want specific username and password for you.

156
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,590
So similarly, I'm mentioning this single email.

157
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,630
Plus, so I guess you're.

158
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:20,400
You mean, so this is not my e-mail password, and it's not on my email also.

159
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,570
I will tell you later what I'm going to put here, so I'm mentioning as you.

160
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,060
Tim Incursion.

161
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,320
Farah, Lucas, OK.

162
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,280
So these are the authentication parameters, which is basically saying the email, which is this the

163
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,380
username and password is for the password basis.

164
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,990
So I will tell you what I want to do.

165
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:49,080
You know, let us consider this a very routine I'm going to do here.

166
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,030
It's a security.

167
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,380
No, not at all.

168
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,270
Because when using your ID, it's public void.

169
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,360
Anyone can take this as a security service.

170
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,920
So I will tell you later what I'm going to do here, I'm going to use string handling and everything

171
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,880
I'm going to do here.

172
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:11,760
But I will tell you later for simplicity and keeping ladies in for a little part, I will change it

173
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,200
to more complex thing.

174
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,160
But.

175
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,580
Let me make a connection with Servlet Foster.

176
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:27,060
OK, so I need to create one session here session.

177
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:38,540
So once this is in next news, don't know, libraries will automatically be added here and everything

178
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,520
will be done session.

179
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,390
Not yet.

180
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,890
Default instances.

181
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:57,120
This default in systems, which is basically a very common thing I'm going to do here is.

182
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,590
Props.

183
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,660
I don't want to mention props, properties.

184
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:04,980
And.

185
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,590
His proves.

186
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,310
We don't take me to your office because.

187
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:28,430
France, which is basically properties then new, the new Jaguar XE not mean, which is overwhelmingly

188
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,050
male, not OK.

189
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,150
Or to Google.

190
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,300
So this is my instances where what is going to do in accessing these properties.

191
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,050
As you can see, this property will be accessed because this is the state.

192
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,880
These are the properties of same degree.

193
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,320
So it will come this team, which is basically my name.

194
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:59,500
Mr Object ought to be going to class its object, and it will ask me who this makes me a him to get

195
00:14:59,530 --> 00:14:59,710
done.

196
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:08,560
No, these are decisions I need to mention to do things here, which is password protected thing and

197
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,820
everything and information.

198
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:14,740
So in the further part, I will tell you how we can create a connection with the server.

199
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:24,430
Plus how we are going to handle this thing because now it's currently very unsecure method.

200
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:37,770
And let me tell you why this is unsecure, because this is public and I'm directly putting my password

201
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,080
in, so if anyone having some injecting in our political analysts server injection, they can follow

202
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,990
this directly.

203
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,860
So instead of this, what you can do is, I will tell you later.

204
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,830
There are many a lot of options you can do, but for this condition, I'm going to use some more other

205
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,290
simple options if you are testing purpose.

206
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,090
You can do this and other things I'm going to mention here.

207
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:08,430
But I will tell you in later regarding, you know, if somebody before any help you understand.

208
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,390
Thank you.
