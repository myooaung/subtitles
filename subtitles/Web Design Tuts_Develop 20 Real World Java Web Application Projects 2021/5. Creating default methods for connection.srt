1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:07,820
Well, now or in the previous thing I told you, we created one line there, which is extend straight,

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,760
I mistake that in both parties.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:20,410
We close that sort of glass of only, you know, these glass doors are planted inside only that sort

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:20,990
of glass.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,740
Otherwise, it will not run for that purpose.

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,930
I'm going to using inside only that sort of glass.

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:35,180
Now we are created already this concept that we are remaining with some methods, which is basically

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,790
that get input each and every thing, as I told you earlier.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,990
So first, create the one input on, or we can say we can create the one method, which is great user

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,210
name or getting the user name.

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,540
Inside our.

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,300
Client.

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,160
So let me create one public way.

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,310
Get.

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,120
User.

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,150
Name.

17
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,590
Which is basically.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,270
Returning.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,640
Username.

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,350
So.

21
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,010
Why it should be strong, let me tell you, it is returning as a string, so it's a mystery.

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,360
OK.

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,460
It's not returning void or anything.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,760
No, I need to set the username similar method oblique.

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,850
Now it's what it should be, said username.

26
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,530
Again, this.

27
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,260
Oh, so let me check first.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,760
If I use this third username anywhere.

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:01:59,780
Not.

30
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,010
So said username is the first time parts so no need to require.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,550
I told you because.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,960
This is very well what we can say, sometimes it is very good.

33
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:23,930
Sometimes you mistake us the some part or, you know, writing or you can say uppercase, lowercase

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,490
or always remember you should.

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,860
We will soon be using the same username to the username.

36
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,580
So done so this formal setting, the username and all letters.

37
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,190
So what I'm creating here, I need to create infinite loop.

38
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,980
Late in the night and late night.

39
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,790
New to read and forward a message.

40
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:02,140
And so what it's actually going to do, it is storing as a object inside of their client, really,

41
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,750
we can see and ought to begin to add a glass at least and what it will be do.

42
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,050
It will print that in broadcast to be.

43
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,490
So I knew the void method, public void.

44
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,290
Run run is basically for the running that.

45
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:27,640
Ted, as you can see here, we go to the one symbolically, what is this thing is exuding the third

46
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,010
glass classroom then, and you can step out of your trunk in the overriding control of this.

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,070
Never change that, but I've been telling you that before laboratories.

48
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,440
You know, Andy.

49
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,190
Novel.

50
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,690
So what I'm going to do is, Will, then, you know, keep going, I already.

51
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,910
Bullion keep going is equal to.

52
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,710
Well, they keep going.

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,850
I need to mention the reading back.

54
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,110
So read.

55
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,910
Stunning.

56
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,430
OK, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to read that story.

57
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,560
So are the things we required here is very similar.

58
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:33,480
I need to try block or I will tell you what is going to do is you did object to this news chat message

59
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,380
and chat messages to another class in this class and it will go to that issue.

60
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,450
And each and every.

61
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,770
So as I mentioned this earlier this morning, what is remaining glass, not phone team here?

62
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:55,320
So I'm mentioning what we can say will specify the cage block for expression, different classes not

63
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,600
only accepting different because these are very important partner.

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,570
If you are mentioning exhibition, it will bring all the exceptions.

65
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,760
But for our client user interface purposes, I'm using this.

66
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,590
Then.

67
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,520
I'm going to get the message, I should get that message from that part.

68
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,820
What I'm going to do is I'm mentioning this part of the show, so I will tell you where I'm going to

69
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,910
create this good message in the chat messaging each and every day.

70
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:32,070
So what I need to do is I need to get a different action based on the type of data messages, as I told

71
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:38,750
you, or if that username part is different and each and everything I can create.

72
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,750
Switch gears here.

73
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,710
So I will explain this, which is first you.

74
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:52,970
After this and we mentioned this, OK, now, what are these things after this disturbing and said,

75
00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:00,920
I'm going to switch the tape, which is basically in the chat message chat room, which is a message

76
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,380
which some broadcast will?

77
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,800
What do you think the user name and the message?

78
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,180
And what is the confirmation if the confirmation is blocked?

79
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,830
No such use that exist.

80
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,630
So what is this part, actually, as I told you?

81
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:29,150
Why I'm asking if I I'll check for that ad, but it's symbolic to the region.

82
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,730
It will go to that private message board for such purposes.

83
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,680
What I'm going to do, I'm creating here that broadcast part here.

84
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:45,020
You can see I can say that, but if I'm printing logo from the user, it will be disconnect for the

85
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,240
who isn't metal.

86
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,120
It will print all user name since that date part.

87
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,120
So this is all about things how we can create.

88
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,300
So I need to create or.

89
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,470
If you're out of the loop or disconnected, I need to remove that idea and accept the things I need

90
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,070
to mention here.

91
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,660
Then it will be asking for all the.

92
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,440
OK.

93
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,310
So this is how we can create this part.

94
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:26,960
So.

95
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,050
Let me do two or three things here, first, as I created here within matter.
