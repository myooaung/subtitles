WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:09.020
So in previous cases, what we have done, we created a well-planned and we done everything like handling

2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.200
that files and everything, and it's mixing.

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.770
As you can see, it is the time to indexing and doing everything.

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.450
So let us it take everything and it will take time.

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.940
No new e-mail message and I created the guidelines, say the methods.

6
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.930
So.

7
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:40.010
I will tell you one shortcut to do this is I already told you listen in, so when all the insert is

8
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.780
your name, you can check for me Transito methods good.

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.540
And once you click this, you can check the URL I already created translating statement calls for everything.

10
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:59.670
But instead of this, you can use this keep it as it is defaulting, and we created this part already.

11
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.920
This is my mail plan where I'm accessing the face, using the gate and everything you get and not accessing

12
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.280
the face.

13
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.860
I'm accessing the data from the GSP file, which is basically this will disappear.

14
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.480
So your email message?

15
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.460
What's happening actually is creating a transfer denominators your translator, Metrojet, but emergency

16
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.400
mechanistically in Java.

17
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.970
So for your time, consumption and everything and for smart coding, what done I use default is using

18
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.810
all and I insert in these things so you can use these things directly.

19
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.040
So now what I'm going to mention here, it's very simple.

20
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.480
I already created this indexing part, and now we are remaining with this, OK?

21
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.820
So you can see the new Java mix.

22
00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.040
These are not found any meeting, so I will tell you what I won't create here and everything but before

23
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.430
this.

24
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.100
Remember everything you owe?

25
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.850
So email, do you just basically properties of this individual world I mentioned and you're going to

26
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.720
remove this thing?

27
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.540
Also, it's not at all required, but I mentioned you.

28
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.030
If we are having any trouble in my case for G.M., you don't require that.

29
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.230
But if are using another thing or you are using your own 70 percent, what do you need?

30
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.620
But then I created one properties object.

31
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.870
They seem to be properties, props.

32
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.080
I'm cooking my host as it seem to be accurate or missing large realtor.com all these favorites, and

33
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.090
you cannot change the model I'm mentioning as or an occasional withdrew.

34
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.440
And I mean, it really still is this transport layer security.

35
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.580
I created this new deal with some message and it's really unsecure limited A380, but I will tell you

36
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.600
what I'm going to use here.

37
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.440
So new job I cleared it and session.

38
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:08.360
So let me move further with some more creative team here, which is basically a purposeful authentication

39
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.000
on many things, but password protection protected.

40
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.970
So.

41
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.130
He's taking them from victim protected.

42
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.780
Password.

43
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.260
Predicted password authentication, Java X-Men Team here, authentication get.

44
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.800
Slow communication for.

45
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.630
I didn't not usually get +1.

46
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.650
Indications the blockages is, of course, I don't think so, no communication.

47
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.880
We've done.

48
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.320
New.

49
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.990
Password authentication and what I'm going to mention easier.

50
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.200
To me.

51
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:38.380
Former sender emailed us there today to mention you.

52
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.030
OK.

53
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.640
And let me close this barb known.

54
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.780
I think remaining with some more here, which is basically probs, do I close this note?

55
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.180
So no need to declare too close.

56
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.210
We need to close this here.

57
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.480
Well, you no.

58
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.900
I mean, when you say more because of this parenthesis, OK, now we are done.

59
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.720
So let me tell you what she's going to do.

60
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.120
It is going to create decision, beautiful instances, properties of these properties with an image

61
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.390
of a smell, authentic individual, basically an external authenticator file, then protected password

62
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.820
authentication, password protected authentication, which is going to return me the same three minutes.

63
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.390
And remember.

64
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.760
So I will tell you who I'm going to change it later.

65
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.240
Then I need to leave this.

66
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.680
So.

67
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:56.320
Station, not St., D-Mo., which is always it is going to be true, always, so this is it about how,

68
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.870
when going to work with this, but we are up for a little more required utilities.

69
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:12.660
So what I can do instead of doing these things again randomly makes messaging this and sending.

70
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.760
I'm going to create the one package insert, this one begins the filing service.

71
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.380
So what I'm actually going to do is very common.

72
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:35.750
Thing I've been mentioning is my boss will not be OK in this, but I'm going to mention my password

73
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.620
as my password.

74
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.190
And I'm going to handle this.

75
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.210
And no, I'm going to create one security secure method of all of these purposes.

76
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.680
And also, it's very easy but failing.

77
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.940
Equal.

78
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.710
But if.

79
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.550
So, but sort of.

80
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:10.280
And it's old anger for more actions in world plus of.

81
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.500
And let me mention my fund so you can use your password.

82
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.420
Not easy, I'm going to use it as it is.

83
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.850
So sometimes you can.

84
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:33.540
OK, so showing me this, but what are you going to do is it shouldn't be handling breakage always.

85
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:44.460
You mean black and white in black edge because I'm handling as this so needs to handle with dry scheduling.

86
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.910
So let me try here.

87
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.120
Let me move stranger.

88
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.620
And let me mention catch zero exception.

89
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.420
He.

90
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.130
System.

91
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:05.730
Don't.

92
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.250
I don't think, Dylan.

93
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.380
So sometimes it made you irrational.

94
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:28.680
Let me add this in my win, so it gives me the ability to change that my own dependencies and everything.

95
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:28.950
So.

96
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.740
It's Saturday.

97
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.580
Yes.

98
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:33.940
OK.

99
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.380
My independence.

100
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:42.070
So it can take time to do mixing, nixing, anybody will know what I'm going to mention here.

101
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.910
Once this bomb ambassador leaves to some password is like this, it is going to handle mine.

102
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.570
This team fight.

103
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.690
If they get off fetching the water, we can send data and say this.

104
00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:05.350
No, what I'm going to do is I'm going to mention is that face to face not releasing.

105
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.450
It's metal, it's cheap.

106
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.070
So is this mainstream leaning?

107
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.430
My limb is variable, so it will be interesting for me.

108
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:29.540
And what I was mentioning is suing us.

109
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:42.870
OK, so now instead of putting Larry password here, I can look like this and this is no longer unsafe.

110
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.790
Why the password to steal?

111
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.510
I can store it as already safe.

112
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.760
I wouldn't exclude basically encrypted place.

113
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:59.620
You cannot change that, but you can store it very securely, but you can use databases for this purpose.

114
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.590
I'm losing this fight against you.

115
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.600
It will take care of everything.

116
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.540
So let me mention this as it is.

117
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.420
Let me do one thing here.

118
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.990
Sort of putting on with this would stun start.

119
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:27.180
Then he had also stop because it is basically just optimizing the imports.

120
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.700
This is no longer working.

121
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.210
Okay, so we are going to.

122
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:35.710
In this.

123
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.240
Including.

124
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.430
The important thing, the Lebanese saying, no, we can win this with station d-bergen.

125
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.310
And so we are not remaining with the message.

126
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:55.290
Same message then doing that, speeding for everything we need to do.

127
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.650
So firstly to see how we can create the message here.

128
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.940
So it's very easy to create a message.

129
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.400
Hear.

130
00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:08.790
The message will, OK.

131
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.120
We can see clear messages on the screen.

132
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.730
It will go to the next page basically.

133
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.750
I mean, so clearly messages back in part is very easy.

134
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:27.530
A message is going to engender new message.

135
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.660
OK, Kate Winslet, what happened?

136
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.650
Okay, so oh.

137
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.130
It created everything for them.

138
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.980
Well, I want to mention Diesel iMessage.

139
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.340
And what I can do is my message to.

140
00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:05.390
It's basically Java likes messaging, my message is just for willingness, as it is my message, which

141
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:15.050
is going to handle my session session is this Zoom session is going to handle this with this, then

142
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.600
what I need to mention is.

143
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.790
Maybe you should think, because these are not at all of us, OK?

144
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.690
So they knew when to create a message then.

145
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.330
I need an address from which one to put, so.

146
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:37.990
Internet.

147
00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:50.080
Internet access later this year, basically IP address, nothing but so.

148
00:12:52.350 --> 00:13:05.160
Address from the new end, new all living rooms make this phone book so that women at it from new internet

149
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.850
address and it's very easy.

150
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:08.460
Me.

151
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:20.410
But then after this message, you get from the mansion you get from.

152
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.610
What is to get home, which is basically at risk from?

153
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:42.550
So the message you can find out that part, so why say, the eight or six, I need not sit and sit.

154
00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:43.150
OK.

155
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:50.680
So now I can say that the message was not getting the message and going forward the message, so I need

156
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.210
to sit from it and not get from.

157
00:13:53.570 --> 00:14:03.350
So now we are done with this messaging part, so remaining to certain to do is seem to address and doing

158
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.370
everything so they can copy one thing image ladies.

159
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:17.090
Which is basically one the fish that singularities in 'cause this is going to mention.

160
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.780
So this is my sister, this and what is going to do if I am puddings.

161
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.850
Oh, bless you.

162
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.840
Come on here is going to add in that image, lady.

163
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.630
So I'm using here a string, as you can say, relating.

164
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.030
So it will be added in the address and everything.

165
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.110
So these are my two words.

166
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.940
If I'm writing the comma, it will my CC address.

167
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:48.550
Then for me, Chris, I'm going to use same thing here.

168
00:14:55.270 --> 00:15:02.830
So let me do this again, so I will tell you what is going to work for them because this would slash

169
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.020
your address to your team, ladies.

170
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.670
And this is the length.

171
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.000
So it's going to put and it's going to run.

172
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:14.620
Thank to all the ladies a given and it will put me for that purpose.

173
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.810
So in further videos, what I'm going to do, this is done.

174
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:26.830
But now we are required to do some messaging part we are going to when look to invoke it again and again.

175
00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.230
So in the later part, I'm going to do this.

176
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:36.790
If you want to check you, then directly use this form, Lord examine and seating and analyze as body

177
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.420
of requirement.

178
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:44.500
So remember when putting this, it should be like this your password here.

179
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.000
And can you use this method to put password?

180
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.370
But instead of putting password, you can use this with her hope, you understand.

181
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.000
Thank you.
