1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,080
Previous Park.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,170
I told you I will go up against Wolves.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,670
So bankruptcy just started dividing their day small small fragments, you can see to perform different

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,650
directions on the network.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,910
So we are going to capture that whole package using Java.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,980
But the first step is we are going to take our client disconnected blackboard doorknock.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,670
So I considering here two random turns, I'm not considering they're very common plans, so I will tell

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,330
you, what is these transcend politics?

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,280
So as this is all made to work security, what we can do, we have to shape our client is going to take

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,300
the board or not.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,830
It's online, all the more so for that purpose.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,690
What I'm going to create, I'm going to create here one glass.

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:57,250
I've already created one project name as new monitor and I'm going to create one glass here as Nature

14
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,820
Monitor.

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:07,170
Nick wanted so little glass he'd enter, it will automatically create your own glass.

16
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,530
No, no, what?

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,150
I'm going to look at private dream.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:23,940
So I'm going to declare here Keaton's source, target and source and going to.

19
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,450
Source.

20
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:39,310
So let me make this case, and this is my source, so I use shortcut to repeat that line Stargate.

21
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,660
All these not string.

22
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,540
So these are my full private students, or you can say private data, see it, I'm considering.

23
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,570
No, let me put it here.

24
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,470
The issue of leaks, I think, would mean.

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,910
But said Wortman certainly killed.

26
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,850
I mean, time and these are my.

27
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,400
Data base here, I'm going you.

28
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,580
Later.

29
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:38,910
Mostly, it's very different because I'm not going to invoke it later, so they're just going to use

30
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,690
it as a private.

31
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:47,580
So now I'm using here some commanding arguments to use some command line arguments.

32
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,690
You know, if I'm going to put arms.

33
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:03,230
So if I was if you basically arguments, you know, not lent is not going to.

34
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,040
Three Oh, OK.

35
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:17,980
It's not going to be what I need to perform here is I need to display a few things here I'm going to

36
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,340
display.

37
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,020
Which is basically a very common thing you can check, which is.

38
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:37,370
Warning the new system, not a dog friendly force,

39
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,410
compile Java all using.

40
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,980
Do you have a comment?

41
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:00,820
So I'm using your combined command links directly system not only don't bring in.

42
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,520
Then.

43
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,730
Use Java.

44
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,730
So for my team, what here is Java.

45
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,930
The name is Nic Monitor class, name it Monita.

46
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,810
But basically.

47
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,370
And also.

48
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,880
Upcoming.

49
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,010
I will tell you how we are going to use it then.

50
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:40,500
Sauce is so getting could make this a saucy sauce IP.

51
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,190
Then.

52
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,190
Destination IP.

53
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:48,920
Then.

54
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,200
All.

55
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,960
So this is our basic command.

56
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,000
If you're not using this, we are.

57
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,380
We have to perform this.

58
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:08,100
The street and justice, so it will return all lettings in local only if you are not performing or if

59
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,090
you are not opportunities.

60
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,760
So these things are done.

61
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,310
Click here to monitor.

62
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:25,150
And more, and I'm looking here and I got my object in the monitor, so you might need them.

63
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,000
So this is my object.

64
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,600
Working plus.

65
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,690
Object to this, what is this?

66
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,070
How?

67
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,220
Oman is going to work.

68
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,340
So this is how the government is going to work, we are going to use it.

69
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:56,020
So I was here seemed completely as my direct influence.

70
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,130
So let me get it, Embarek said.

71
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,240
Saws, jigsaws.

72
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,420
These are some things here you can use.

73
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,400
So simple source, safe source.

74
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,840
So this is very you know what?

75
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,750
I would kill.

76
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,330
Odds zero.

77
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:24,600
So what I'm going to do, I'm sitting here like my arms as long as I'm almost zero.

78
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:31,770
But this port, oh look, I will create the one six set the every elemental a year later.

79
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,030
But let me put this first, because it is very important.

80
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,260
Bargain argument is one, the humanities.

81
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:54,540
It's like editing in Java arguments, commonly not so it's started from zero one two three, and I will

82
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,200
create that part later and not start.

83
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:10,610
That's Maine Common Limited, so I will tell you how it's going to work on the team vehicles so you

84
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:17,140
can perform it later with six swords and everything.

85
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:26,800
So let me perform good treatments here, which is basically one, but I think you.

86
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:33,070
So again, it's in Maine, Mittleman, Oregon.

87
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:44,790
Close this meeting, if you want to use such beautiful things or brackets, you can use it in lubricants,

88
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,680
it's when plugging in iodine.

89
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,010
So let me create one.

90
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:56,840
But I won't I want to introduce sip sauce.

91
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:57,870
OK.

92
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,070
What am I think sauce?

93
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,210
Bring as?

94
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,200
And the critical string is now.

95
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,310
Same source we have seen.

96
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:23,330
So and assigning this source to sort of a method is then I need one syllable.

97
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,380
But before that, I need to create started method because I haven't created in this document.

98
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,400
So let me create one, but I will.

99
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,490
Started.

100
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,710
Which is a very common method.

101
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:47,720
It's starting method, or we can say, definitive cause unknown, most exception.

102
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,780
Oh, so.

103
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,500
Unknown.

104
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:00,380
Course, exception and exception, which is a very common thing, are you exception?

105
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:10,310
Because if there is an exception, we need to perform this similarly for this dark matter unit to Crozier.

106
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:19,400
On the Moon Horse exhibition, and you need to draw, are you exceptionalism?

107
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,480
I.

108
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,820
So now everything is done.

109
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:35,050
So let me put here when I'm writing what is needed, so I will create that part in later New England.

110
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,880
It me in Rhodesia.

111
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:39,730
Okay.

112
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:49,320
So if you OK, are you would happy for the timing part, and let me put it this stuff so you can create

113
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,230
your own time working in Java always falls to you because you never stop.

114
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:02,790
So it will invoke this command again and again and again and again, sometimes the the activity of source

115
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,960
and destination again.

116
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:11,940
So it's not like, Oh, we are done with some part, we need to put this of schedule.

117
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,910
We need to get, you know, its status.

118
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,460
So let me tell you how it's going to work.

119
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:24,610
We need to create one new this morning, so task, it's very.

120
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,940
Commenting on.

121
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,380
So actually, it's.

122
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,450
Iconic, so is not.

123
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,810
Let me take the it's working or not.

124
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,360
So.

125
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,330
Oh, and.

126
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,720
It's just because I need to.

127
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,830
Perform it again and again, so I need to use this, so

128
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,310
I will create that this last letter, which is basically a tamer task.

129
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:33,300
Oh, and the common thing is your next gig going so fast is nothing, but it's very warm.

130
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:41,550
You can see a robust team who creates soccer, sign everything boards and legal and binding that part.

131
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,590
So now I'm going to grill.

132
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,530
So let me put him.

133
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,220
A sane source.

134
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,300
So told.

135
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,750
The same old.

136
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:11,620
So similar winter in St. Paul and one here in FT.

137
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,690
Or is it going to be?

138
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,070
Which I already told you, we are going to quote here and

139
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,370
the same.

140
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,340
So again, but I read when?

141
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:44,840
Stargate scheme Diamond created Target and Target is equality.

142
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,710
So now we're done with this part.

143
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:57,270
So why more discriminating is basically over glass of glass, which is basically subclass here, you

144
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:57,950
can consider.

145
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,950
And currently, which he is using.

146
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,550
Public clergymen who do not listen to I need to invoke that part also.

147
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,290
So in these only I'm going to create one some plus.

148
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,980
And you can copy this.

149
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,680
West Coast.

150
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:47,630
And I will tell you what is distressed trying to find what is the extreme security and what it does

151
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,460
not.

152
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,790
Then what does?

153
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,210
So.

154
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,660
I will tell you how we are going to perform a routine like first.

155
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,600
Remember, it's based on does and which is going to work here.

156
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,660
So it's going to be shown me the error because I'm not implementing any.

157
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,950
Glenn Matassa had a solid middle oblique.

158
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,130
Boy.

159
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:40,180
So now you think it's overriding this system, so LightStream, the air support.

160
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,970
Simple.

161
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,780
In the state.

162
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:02,830
I to change this part, so I will change it later in the year, basically nothing, but I will tell

163
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,190
you who I'm going to put here to work and everything should be.

164
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,930
Oh, so.

165
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,720
Teacher, you.

166
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,950
Which is basically it's going to take the integer value of these arguments.

167
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:40,280
It should be in private, in private, and it should not change.

168
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:42,780
OK.

169
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,430
No, you can check this thing anonymously.

170
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,550
Okay, so basically arguments is always extreme, but not in digital parts, so there might be errors.

171
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,080
So in the next part, I'm going to implement this round metal and I'm going to declare this.

172
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,370
Hope you understand this.

173
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,850
Thank you.
