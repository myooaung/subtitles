1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:09,010
So we have seen this is suitable for our project, so we just created one package known as the Image

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:14,670
Lab, and we created a class which is basically publicly specified class no.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,470
I will explain what is our blueprint of our project.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,510
And then I will explain some basics of classmates and objects, etc..

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,910
So let's see, let's see what is the blueprint of our project.

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,210
So Project Blueprint is considered this is a package package email app.

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,410
This is middle class and methods.

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,160
Just I created.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,800
So this is Project Blueprint packaging the lab.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,670
And this is email class methods and which I created before Eileen, I showed.

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,420
So now this is done, these things are done in future.

12
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:05,120
What we are going to do as we move our budget, we we will create one main class.

13
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:13,000
We will load all the methods related to this using objects, and we will execute these methods in say

14
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,090
this meaningless.

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,850
This is our main project blueprint.

16
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,810
So let us see what is basically.

17
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,610
Ujjwala classes and methods.

18
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,540
So Java class, let's see first class.

19
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,550
Everything in Java is associated with classes, an object without classes and objects, you cannot create

20
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,030
any.

21
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,370
Or we can say any method.

22
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,120
In Java.

23
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:48,420
So it contains attributes, methods, attributes that are basically what we can see plus plus plus attributes

24
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,960
create some environment for mating.

25
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:59,910
So for example, in real life example, you can consider Kadiza Object has attributes such as weight

26
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,800
and color and metadata, such like groundbreaker in something like that.

27
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:14,220
So basically, what we can create, we can create as a class which attributes which color their model,

28
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,870
numbers, etc. and methods can't stop that I break, etc..

29
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:26,290
So classes like Object Constructor, we can see to the object or we can constructor off the object.

30
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:34,820
Or it can be a blueprint for creating objects, so objects are basically just invoking the glass.

31
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,640
Classes, also, which some user defined attributes to pass values or input from user.

32
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,650
So we can, you know, use their different attributes also inside the glasses.

33
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,500
Know what you mean by objects in Java.

34
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,660
So objects are basically associated with glasses, but.

35
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,790
What is the simplest form we can say that we use a glass objective used basically.

36
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,700
So if you define some glass and you want to use that glass, you have to define the object as glass

37
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,870
is already created.

38
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,760
We have to only just create the object for that particular glass as we created an alternative object

39
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,430
of glass.

40
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,380
We can easily create that object.

41
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,470
But like glass, then we can create the object.

42
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,710
So this is this is all about the glass.

43
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,980
No lyricism.

44
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,500
What we are going to do in our project.

45
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,200
So before moving any further, I will proceed with code or project.

46
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:37,920
It is.

47
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,620
So inside this.

48
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,010
I created this class, so I need to create some methods.

49
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,140
But before that, we need to invoke some libraries.

50
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,840
So for the libraries, I'm going to work.

51
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,760
Import.

52
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,480
Java.

53
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,210
Don't you did not start?

54
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,630
I will explain what is this mean, I'm not going to use this, but I'm not currently using this, that

55
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,860
you're showing it is showing this, you are not using this label recurrently.

56
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,960
But what is the significance of this is very important.

57
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:23,160
Library Java not you do not start not star meaning in the you bill, I'm using you up all things related

58
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,580
to that.

59
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:30,990
What we can say is very basic levity inside Java, another steam library I'm going to use is import

60
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,350
Java, not are you not stuck?

61
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,840
It is basically Input-Output Library for invoking and taking user input.

62
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,090
It will be helpful library.

63
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,050
So.

64
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,570
As these done.

65
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:59,620
Our first thing I'm going to explain here is how to take user inputs in Java so you can do this scanner.

66
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,920
It is the by default method to begin selling a default method for taking inputs.

67
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,900
I'm going to use this.

68
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,120
So I'm going to invoke inside Glass only because I'm going to speak to the public.

69
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,630
So what I can do is public scan the public access to a public scanner as you can.

70
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,740
Have you been seen on the job?

71
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,120
I told you.

72
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,560
It's started.

73
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,360
So scanner, this scanner glasses belongs to this celebrity java, don't you?

74
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,100
By default, nobody.

75
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,260
As is equal to new.

76
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:40,380
Scan this index, basically this index between scanner system, which is again one when I've done by

77
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,370
default glasses system, which is basically a method.

78
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,880
So this is done now, I'm going to set up some variables here, so.

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,390
For this, I will explain.

80
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,590
I just put your scanner class on explanations.

81
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,040
No.

82
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:05,990
Sitting.

83
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,620
Variables.

84
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,740
Setting the rebels and women to set some variables here.

85
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,940
But.

86
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,100
For the security issue, we can say I was going to create some abstract in Europe.

87
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,850
What I'm going to do is I'm going to use.

88
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,220
Private here, as this is public, given I'm going to use your private.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,280
So let us consider this private thing.

90
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,530
I'm going to specify posturing, everything basically first name.

91
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,610
Similarly, private string.

92
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,160
Last name.

93
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,790
Similarly like that, I'm going to create some or.

94
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,450
Similarly, department.

95
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:02,390
The beauty department or department, then for email.

96
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,580
Then for password.

97
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,100
Now, consider this, I'm going to specify all these things in the.

98
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,620
String metal like string as a string variable.

99
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,170
Now I'm going to specify it's merely capacity, which is in integer.

100
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,110
Capacity.

101
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:35,770
The call to I, I'm considering my report 500 500.

102
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,950
Then, David.

103
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,520
Spring again.

104
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,750
Alternative energy, basically.

105
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,090
She.

106
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:45,850
After.

107
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:55,890
It so we are done with invoking now, remember, these are the global order we can see all these streets

108
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,020
can be accessible throughout this class.

109
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:06,540
So in the class, I can create as much as I want for methods so I can use this throughout this class

110
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,620
as you can see this class and I can use throughout this class.

111
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:16,140
So we are done with creating some variables and I'm setting it to the private to.

112
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,940
Not you access directly, basically.

113
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,790
Once this is done, no one can access this.

114
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,510
It's expensive, it is private.

115
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:38,650
So let us see with some constructive my thoughts on what is meant, my mental --.

116
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,450
OK, so.

117
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:52,330
Java class we have seen, as I told you, I will tell some more about plus classes of blueprint.

118
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,870
We have seen two classes something like it, the functions automated in one block, basically.

119
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:06,200
Consider an example of how is a class, then it condense all details about the prototype of house doors,

120
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,860
windows, etc., etc. Who is it?

121
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,300
No one who see the object of that class sketch of this guy created this sketch.

122
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,240
And they know how he sees the object.

123
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,710
So what we are going to do is class contains all properties of that object.

124
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:30,200
So syntax to declare class class name as we created it, and I'm going to specify exit speechifying

125
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,680
before that.

126
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,990
Consider if you are not given any access to this, if I did.

127
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:41,660
By default, it will be default Texas based, in fact, we did basically public only in Java.

128
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:49,070
But if you don't specify public, private and protected protected is fully protected, you have to invoke

129
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:55,490
it's more than what we can a method for privacy and security.

130
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,290
So or as I told you object, we are going to create object.

131
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,420
I'm not created here any object, but we are going to create an object for that purpose also.

132
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,650
So it's basically used to call class or executed that glass.

133
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,320
I would also call it an instance of glasses without object, we cannot call glass, always remember

134
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,710
that all the glass we have to use object.

135
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,970
So for that example, previous example, as I told you, sketch of a glass cage off those doors and

136
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,400
windows are some methods that we can see functions inside this.

137
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,210
So this is the main method if you know that in the Java public static void mean is a default method

138
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,760
to execute any program in Java.

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,700
Without this, you cannot create starting the program.

140
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,140
Or you not execute the program or that switch off?

141
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:52,740
I created this object object, you can see object one like this and execute that object.

142
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,090
We are going to see in further details about dollar objects.

143
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:07,830
So no job, I'm now having nearer meetings, so I will show an I.D. basically if I want to print something

144
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,320
in it.

145
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,210
My default Methodist system.

146
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,020
Oh.

147
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,600
Now you will see the error here is still not allowed in error.

148
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,580
It is not.

149
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,120
Or involvement in inside in Nicholas, why?

150
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:33,790
The thing is, it's only defined to the matter was created to create class insert that creates a method,

151
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,520
then you can invoke that momentum.

152
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,510
As simple as that, so matters are declared within the classes.

153
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,390
It contains a whole code of particular functions.

154
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,870
Mr Contents, return value and accessibility features.

155
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:57,450
They are the object classes as object classes are created, we can easily access methods using that

156
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:57,840
object.

157
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,210
Main method is the foreign minister, as I told you, to run our build for or project anything.

158
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,460
Main method always remember public sector involvement and it's always written strings.

159
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,870
You cannot change to integer or something like that.

160
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,760
You you can print integers, but you can not return in business in seven minutes.

161
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,790
Packages are in the Java.

162
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:28,370
I've told you I'm against telling that it's just creating a folder and I'm storing all the classes inside

163
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,530
it.

164
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:38,770
Known there are two methods I use their different methods and standard laboratory methods used different

165
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,390
methods like I created.

166
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,230
I'm going to create some methods here similar like that, though you can also create some user defined

167
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,130
methods, basically.

168
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,820
It's also shows that you delete different methods.

169
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,200
There are some standard delivery methods that I created Scanner System, all the same standard delivery

170
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,060
methods that are built in methods.

171
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:08,140
And so if you want to a number even on the data, you can create some or even all the functions that

172
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,770
the user defined.

173
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:13,090
But I specified some library method like random system.

174
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,200
These are not in basically our system different methods.

175
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,770
So now let's move on to our good.

176
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:32,010
No, I'm I told you about, oh, let's see, how do how we can proceed with building our project.

177
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,320
So we created all things, you know, I want to create one constructor.

178
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,120
Know what constructor will do.

179
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,050
It will print what I want basically first thing.

180
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:51,940
Second thing it will give me the output as well as creating on itself is the light.

181
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,190
But I was sitting inside it.

182
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:03,080
I am going to invoke or I'm going to run only constructor, so it will not use this private string or

183
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,650
something like that.

184
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,790
It will take value from that, but you cannot change this value.

185
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,020
Or we can say third party cannot change this value.

186
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,240
Just I'm going to create so constructeur, I'm going to specify that.

187
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:28,640
You're not receiving first name, last name and everything.

188
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,650
That's it.

189
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,240
Well, I'm going to tell, like only for that, like Flushing last year, that's a.

190
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:47,540
You can change it to some other names also, but be careful about the name.

191
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:55,940
Now consider I'm going to create this as a public always remember class and constructor have same name.

192
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:04,940
So I'm going to give the constructor attributes if the name same name I always remember in the constructor.

193
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,770
You have to use synonym.

194
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:09,520
After that.

195
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,860
You need to specify something like this if this if economy are totally different.
