1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:12,200
In previous team, I already told you we create an email application and we are most interested in the

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,310
dark part.

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,550
So what we have done here is we created one in next door, Justine.

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,370
If you want to check how it's looking or anything, what you can do, you can just go here.

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,090
You can check your other options and.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,300
You can check for that purpose where Web servers or.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,760
Is configured if Web servers are not configured.

8
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,630
Oh yeah, I would check for the web server configuration for that purpose.

9
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,340
So currently, no service is running for me.

10
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,540
So if you want to check, you can go to the settings and you have.

11
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,290
Check for the silver.

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,740
This is for by Spitzer, who begin.

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,570
Was.

14
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,280
So you can check for that here, I was sure you can check for.

15
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,040
News, So these use our GSP anything but the.

16
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:35,610
So this campaign, which is committed to send one e-mail application with some people saying, I'm writing

17
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,520
something here, so remember this will be good just from this minute planned.

18
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,500
So these are my glass.

19
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,440
We're also near term going to work.

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,680
So this is my glass.

21
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,880
I already preferred or I already told you about this.

22
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:58,390
So in this class, what I'm going to do, I'm going to create one method to handle, request and response

23
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:58,890
to everything.

24
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:11,040
So what is known is once this is constructed is closed, I'm going to create one method and then request.

25
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,070
Request.

26
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,840
And just response.

27
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:32,530
OK, so what is the request for response and so any class warfare initiative is certainly I need to

28
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,740
get two mentors.

29
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,590
If you do both stand to work, which are very popular, but in such case.

30
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,800
There is an order requiring new post motor vehicles and not for wearing anything or doing any complex

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,510
application or selling which only do it.

32
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,030
So what are going to dictate?

33
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,520
You can use us also, but remember who I am protecting?

34
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:08,290
Well, look, this is a matter of budget and safety you do get what I'm going to do is etched deep.

35
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:16,430
Answer and choose for legal response on everything, so it should be a response.

36
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,020
And.

37
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,510
OK.

38
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,690
Then what I'm going to initiate.

39
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:37,870
So let me do one thing here is GDP, so it's not responsible to be solely responsible.

40
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,870
If we were to add to be.

41
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,710
It's a solid response.

42
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:00,610
So a little response is both an extradition request on some.

43
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,260
So you think what you just so late?

44
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,390
Increased.

45
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:17,690
What I can do is also because it's no longer required Johnny Galecki and we look.

46
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,400
Yes.

47
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,070
But.

48
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:32,020
No, I need to handle this better and need also to let me do one thing, let me minimize this so I can

49
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,280
display this one.

50
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:43,300
If you know, there is one request in this budget, so you can refer any name here, as I told you,

51
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,680
I'm with already, which is very common in the dispatcher.

52
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,090
So it's a request not.

53
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,320
Request, dispatcher, so it's basically going to fetch the student body, so which street parties,

54
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,490
when crews index.

55
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,280
So please don't speak.

56
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,770
Well, now we're done with this.

57
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,980
So what is going to do it is going to fetch all the data as a stream format from next door.

58
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,460
Basically, when, say, the location of my index dog day spent providing.

59
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:30,410
So remember, always handle any exceptions, no more exceptions.

60
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,350
You might find the reason for this solid exception.

61
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,010
So let extortion, you have a solid exception.

62
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,090
Plus, if I'm not providing input and output, I always.

63
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:57,620
So that's it, I'm going to let you know when we learned some things in, you may not get any exception

64
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,340
here on Meet.

65
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,690
You may not get any input by the user.

66
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,630
If I'm not providing any input output, then this will not proceed.

67
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,120
So for that purpose, I'm putting this exception.

68
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,890
I'm the exception to bring that part, then R&amp;D forward.

69
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,240
Response request, response

70
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,290
response.

71
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,370
I'm going to handle this request in response, so you just don't need to do anything.

72
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,090
So.

73
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,570
Right.

74
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,810
What's being made it is OK, first time you get to exist and then having a good response.

75
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,240
So I made an error here.

76
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:49,420
We just don't want you to know this is bad, because remember in the article forward first to request

77
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:59,050
the response, there is no first response from the first is request on this sort of brutal force.

78
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,450
Is on always.

79
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:13,170
Newcrest, any so far, so do the solid work you remember just getting part of the weekend fetching

80
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:13,500
data.

81
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,390
If I want to put any message, I also need everyone to post metal.

82
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,090
Remember my posting any message, I need one.

83
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,680
Most important here.

84
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:26,790
So.

85
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,390
I will put your great metaphor.

86
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,800
So let me put one thing here is May to bring.

87
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,220
So let me message to.

88
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,470
Page, so this is.

89
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,560
Fortunately.

90
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,170
Similarly protected void.

91
00:07:59,210 --> 00:07:59,960
Who post?

92
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,820
The funeral is due to be sold to sponsor.

93
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,560
Request, so let me do one thing here.

94
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Let me pocket this point because it's as it is.

95
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:21,900
No need to change in the group was trying to get rid of the sin and expose this again.

96
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,060
I extortion and everything.

97
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,850
So why it's doing exceptionally well relevant while developing any application, you now may find that

98
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,260
part.

99
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,300
So what is going to ask?

100
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:42,840
Sure, it will ask what is going to fetch it is going to which it is going to fetch some data.

101
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,880
So we did not string email list.

102
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:55,290
So if you don't request, don't get me get parameter.

103
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,850
If you're not doing this, get very interesting.

104
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,670
It's going to fetch.

105
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,610
Stringer's image is going to feature.

106
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,250
So let me copy these things again.

107
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,790
Let me tell you what I'm going to do is so news for them.

108
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,560
This then and this is just to sentiment which receive us.

109
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:24,200
But even then, subject for these photos and what your subject subject is basically anything what your

110
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,700
title of your mind and body so you can put anything here.

111
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:36,740
I'm cooking as a musician, musician and just change also music.

112
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,100
So which are these drinks in the subjects?

113
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,820
And if you don't know?

114
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,350
Let me show you.

115
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,290
Well, putting this, I use the name here.

116
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,000
This is e-mail.

117
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,760
Fish e-mail, subject and message.

118
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,510
So I created a connection here and I know featuring this guitar as my everything.

119
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,240
So let me do one thing.

120
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,530
I can create an operation team here, so let me tell you why I'm putting operation because white and

121
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:17,390
green and accepting that in an e-mail application, once you put that part request, don't get barometer.

122
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,700
And it's operation.

123
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:34,610
So I'm mentioning Operation New Single On Me, initial operation this operation, so I need to create

124
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,130
this upheaval and everything, what's going on?

125
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,710
So these are done, but email.

126
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:53,810
We go, which is basically the same thing we're not equals, which is basically going to equal signal

127
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,890
case, it is going to, you know, the cases will be.

128
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:05,390
Basically, these open implications here don't have that much on their part.

129
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,990
Now I'm going to say some messaging team here, then I'm putting some things here.

130
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:18,740
So let me just copy these things and I will tell you, what is the significance of this and what you?

131
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,470
You can copy an instance in a cable just so you.

132
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,870
I haven't created this part sending me.

133
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,480
So what is going to do it will.

134
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,030
I'm going to create an e-mail message last year, which is going to handle safe set subject, saved

135
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,310
message suit message, stay clear, which is extremely, extremely misleading, will be mentioned here.

136
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:55,380
So all the things is consist in this e-mail message part, which e-mail you did.

137
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,600
And it's going to send that message.

138
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,690
So it's related to all these.

139
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,000
Quite.

140
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,250
But I want to mention this part, so let me do one thing.

141
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,750
Let me handle this first.

142
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:16,900
Did you basically request a request not to sit and review the first extreme Cindy's message?

143
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,570
And what I'm going to mention is the oldest meeting.

144
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,030
Has been sent.

145
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:39,880
Successfully so once this is sent out to do a redo, it will bring this that issue Milpark, or we can

146
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:46,810
suggest people, so I'm going to do this part later, but I just copied this and I already created this

147
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,000
part.

148
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,180
I will tell you what is the significance of this letter?

149
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,480
It is the main function to send any e-mail here.

150
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,700
So this is done in each loop now.

151
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:08,020
Let me handle decreased this budget request, it ought to be a lead is going to request not get requests

152
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,760
dispatched to get requests dispatched to deal with endangered jobs.

153
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,690
Just that location, which is a single location.

154
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,620
I'm going to Griffith and already not.

155
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,460
Forward.

156
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,640
Request slash.

157
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,870
This box.

158
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:35,070
So, no, we are done with this mail.

159
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,590
So medical and handling is very simple.

160
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:43,410
It will handle some it will be asked for and the data handling that despite it will do.

161
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,830
It will handle that.

162
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,390
But this e-mail message is going to work with male flag.

163
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:55,940
So considering if I told you earlier, Oh, my sympathy is going to work every day later, but what?

164
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,150
This class is just great.

165
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,560
It's just that they act as a reaching the data from their JS people because we are moving in just people.

166
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:09,810
We as a user, we know that, that we are putting in that meeting, but we don't know how the vaccine

167
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,490
works, actually.

168
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:16,560
So that's making parts for this milk gland going to face data in order to realise I'm going to tell

169
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,060
you how I'm going to create.

170
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,560
I'm explaining the same and also how it's going to work each and everything.

171
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:29,860
Plus, I'm using your Gmail as my seem to be again, telling you if you're familiar with there is simply

172
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,480
this there are a lot of services haven't even begun to freeze and give you services also looks so you

173
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,760
can use that part also.

174
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,520
But I'm going to hope you understand this.

175
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,150
Thank you.
