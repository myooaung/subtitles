1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:10.110
In previous things, I told you who we are or the celebrities and how we are going with this only so

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.920
in for nothing, I'm going to mention how this is very efficient.

3
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.340
So as I created everything here.

4
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.430
So do you basically see this as these are the police that see us?

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.280
We call my spirit if I need to create in tabular manner.

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.740
So I'm using your dependency or we can celebrity, which is basically comes apart.

7
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.830
So for that purpose, what I'm doing here, I'm just use dependency injection.

8
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.900
I mentioned in the bombed out example that dependency this dependency.

9
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.140
We close this so I can use this clear, so you can see this.

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.630
So what is the beautiful thing on dependency?

11
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.160
Dependency injection is I don't want to require download this and thing.

12
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.430
So my idea is being free and will take care that to invoke that.

13
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.930
So it is all about how we are going to do this.

14
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.900
So, S. history record, I need to create 20 or so you can create a class for that or you can mention

15
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.860
that part also.

16
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.020
Holding the.

17
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.060
OK, so I didn't mean to imply that library, Ordsall Lane, there is a default thing you can do here

18
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.360
is basically just being adding the lines is you if you don't want to put that, you can put the star

19
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.350
here and it will involve that part.

20
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.450
So let me show you I'm going to do this if I'm looking here.

21
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.130
Star what is happening?

22
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.060
You can see here.

23
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.300
OK, so like, what is that?

24
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.780
I'm going to do this.

25
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.400
So this is basically it's.

26
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.190
What is the iteration iteration in the.

27
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.960
If you know the four loops, all sort of loop looping part is the basically iteration.

28
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.730
So I need to create one loop here.

29
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.480
So while the loop is required as other data is very which I don't want the space of only one string,

30
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.470
I want to go to the next thing also until the data is not over.

31
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.980
So I need to mention the loop here.

32
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.380
So let me go to the looping part.

33
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.190
What I'm going to mention is here is some or this looping part I am going to create.

34
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.980
When Lou.

35
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.010
What did you see as we?

36
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.720
The record, because it's a recording, yes, we record.

37
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.210
Which is basically record.

38
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.920
CSB record, because it is the default thing you can see here.

39
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.050
Which is basically the courts.

40
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.810
So this is the looking back.

41
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.100
So I need to mention some locations that's here.

42
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.520
So let me go to this location statistics.

43
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.200
So I will tell you what I'm going to do is creating a location state and what is the location sexy regenerating.

44
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.010
These are some default things you need to mention, because in my CSP file also these things are there,

45
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.890
said country, each and everything.

46
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.300
I'm going to create that part later with some integer piracy things because these are the same excuses

47
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.860
and privileges and disadvantages, and these things are distorting things.

48
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.050
But I need to create and project.

49
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.980
Even so, I'm doing this to integer part.

50
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.260
Then.

51
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.450
Let me do one thing more here.

52
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.310
OK.

53
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.570
Well, I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do this year and.

54
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.530
Before this things after the recording.

55
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.150
OK, so the significance of this is basically new statistics I mentioned in the statistics each and

56
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.630
everything.

57
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.540
So for one thing, it's.

58
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.860
It was non-threatening, but OK, so there are errors.

59
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.700
Forget about the errors, and I will tell you what I'm going to do.

60
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.270
So this is the only things I'm going to mention, but I need to mention one annotation, which is basically

61
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.630
run this as a service because my spring family doesn't know this is the Java pilot.

62
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.770
What is the doing things?

63
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.930
So I need to mention it as a service.

64
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.240
So let me.

65
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.420
And then will this as a service?

66
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.020
So then this as a service, but.

67
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.120
Let me in for Java, because innovation doesn't support this.

68
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.850
OK, so.

69
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.500
I need to mention Java and annotations of all then.

70
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.840
Spring will also.

71
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.850
Because these are some important libraries, your dimension, which is basically service as a service.

72
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.970
I think now we're.

73
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.920
Then.

74
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.300
So that's it, I'm going to mention easier.

75
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:55.690
So it will involve the service part here and what is this doing is it mentioned that it's also servicing

76
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.370
with spring look so it will look an enemy.

77
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.350
And it will use this as a service, consider this as a service before moving further.

78
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.410
I need to mention the post construct, but also in this phase detritus.

79
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.210
So let me go down here, utility back, so.

80
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:24.870
Let me mention this as a post construct post, one stroke is nothing but the main method you can see

81
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.770
your.

82
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.720
Most construct and know what is the main thing I'm going to mention is you're basically, I need to

83
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.350
schedule this.

84
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.940
When I need to schedule this.

85
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.070
There are two things here for the scheduling purposes.

86
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.890
OK, so this is the scheduling.

87
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.720
No idea what the schedule is going to work this year.

88
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:59.460
It will run it again and again with Crown or weekend psychology with some simple thing.

89
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.500
Let me mention you have grown.

90
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.060
Is equal to.

91
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:15.830
In this only so one, two three four five six two, the six Wiggins symbols of this thing.

92
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.120
And let me specify this gap between all the things.

93
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.600
So this is four seconds, minutes of all the and all the things here.

94
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.620
So what are you going to do?

95
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.800
It will invoke, according to the clock.

96
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.870
So I need to mention and reach them if need signal.

97
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:42.200
So I'm considering one hour of each day now know that if our files or we can see this file is updating

98
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:48.460
every day or we can say it's updating every other you need to mention you have one minute, not this

99
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:55.420
one would survive it that I mentioning by the day, only by the one hour it will enable.

100
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.990
But if your data is updating again and again, you need to change that.

101
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:08.230
So for my case, I'm doing this only no need to mention this this topic more because this is just a

102
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.220
chronological thing.

103
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.400
You can change it to this one and you can put the start here.

104
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.620
So what is the thing it's going to do?

105
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.740
It's going to take care of that part.

106
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:26.350
So now in the folder thing, I created everything, but I created the services part.

107
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.050
But I need to mention the model part here.

108
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.850
So what is the model parties?

109
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:38.140
Basically, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create one models thing to store everything.

110
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.790
As I told you, I created locations that each and everything, but I'm not mentioning it.

111
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:49.480
As I told in the folder, I created that great country each and every year, so I need to mention this.

112
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.730
So let me show you what I do in this country so that I'll get into each and everything.

113
00:08:55.090 --> 00:09:02.290
So instead of putting this in directly in this part, in the services part, what I can do, I can do

114
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.980
or I can move, create an underclass to invoke this.

115
00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:10.210
So.

116
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.100
Let me do this in for the part, but let me mention this first.

117
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:23.490
What I'm going to do is we'll do the project, but as accurately as services, let me create one more

118
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:23.700
thing.

119
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.110
Here is Java class.

120
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.900
And let me mention everything here.

121
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:34.440
The first is basically modules more analysis of a spec page in this package.

122
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.750
Location starts, I'm going to add.

123
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.550
So I'm going to store only locations.

124
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.990
I'm not going to store each and everything so they can create here class.

125
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.080
Enter, or you can say this is loaded and this is the location of glacier.

126
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:59.000
Sometimes it gives error because I need to specify here one more time.

127
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.500
He's basically.

128
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.510
Important.

129
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.710
This is giving me error because.

130
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.730
I need to import locations that Syrians.

131
00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.560
So let me form this package.

132
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:29.920
So I mentioned here, oh, and why it is, look?

133
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.710
OK, OK, OK, OK, I made one edit because.

134
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.170
I mentioned my another failure does not belong to this project.

135
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.560
So, OK, so locations that successfully are.

136
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.930
So we are required with this one and so on.

137
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.550
And the further part, I'm going to create one location stretch and I'm going to mention how this is

138
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.540
going to work here.

139
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:59.810
So in this, you think understood everything I'm mentioning and I mentioned everything.

140
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.780
So in later part, Oh, I'm going to deploy location stacks and I'm going to create model everything

141
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.080
here.

142
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:15.270
So stick to this project and take for the spring frameworks on so you can check and you can see the

143
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:15.950
loading part.

144
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.870
And this is the thing I'm going to mention.

145
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
So if you want to run it, what are you going to do?

146
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:26.570
You can just ignore that part and you can print this in your command prompt.

147
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:32.420
So I'm not going to do this, but you can do because I never mentioned this part.

148
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.940
I need to mention in this location stacked on.

149
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.440
So in the further back, let us see how we are going to create locations that's eugenics era.
