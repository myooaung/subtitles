1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:11,070
If you carefully go to this, my first tutorial, I told you how we created Mary Gland, so Mary Clark

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,720
is just going to the data.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,310
And if you are, this is a very important part for locating the data.

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,450
It's very small code, as you can see, and I'm using the most to get the method.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:30,470
As you can see, these are the overrating methods and you can check here in the in full annotations,

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,160
so you can check here.

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,850
So this is related to mail client and why I created two methods here.

8
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,630
Do is just going to create a connection and getting the data.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,800
It's my independent Syrian and the post is to handle everything and request and response.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:55,830
So now what I'm going to do, I'm going to tell you what is the same to be Baqir so you can see this.

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,380
So it's basically symbolic, meaning transfer protocols in the world of internet.

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,230
If you have seen there are a lot of many protocols for chatting, then then normal web surfing.

13
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:13,080
So if you are looking on, you are looking for advantage tips.

14
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:20,040
So these are also protocol explained who we are providing information on the network.

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,190
So these are related to the networking protocols.

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,790
But let me go deep into this little bit.

17
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,650
So what is the protocol here?

18
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,950
Just like a standard?

19
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,350
If you have seen there are a lot of applications only available on the internet like nowadays, we can

20
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,020
call to an internet also, which is basically we are used through internet protocol rules and there

21
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,990
is voice also.

22
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,440
But for that purpose, you cannot use one single stream for that.

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:02:00,020
So to maintain, do what we can see the logic behind this, then maintain the ethics of internet enabled,

24
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,640
getting rid of all sort of media.

25
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,010
So first of all, it's nothing more than a set of rules than a set of layers that are here that defines

26
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,110
everything automated and all the protocols.

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:16,940
So I'm not going to go into the telling part of this and when our context also with project context.

28
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:26,090
So every email application available on the internet, you just simply so seem to be so what's available

29
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:32,330
on the internet also may simply be sort of what is basically just for me, simple of one.

30
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,940
So these are sort of moves which is providing some deep function over the internet.

31
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,170
So Jimmy, we are going we can use for that purpose.

32
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,860
We challenged some submitted reports and they seem to be addressed.

33
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,200
Similarly, you can use any other is simply booting three services also available.

34
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,890
You can use that.

35
00:02:52,460 --> 00:03:00,050
So it's a program used to sending a message from one computer user visiting to another artist.

36
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,210
So if you know the email address are specified, you can go do that part also.

37
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,780
But remember why so many e-mail?

38
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,450
It's not like girls who need 20 minutes of useful and other service.

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:19,570
You can send email from Gmail service to Yahoo Mail also, or you can do for Outlook email to give me

40
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,350
a lot so you can send from anywhere.

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,340
Similarly, for that purpose, we need one email or some TV.

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,210
So it provides email exchange between users from similar or different computers, which also supports.

43
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:39,080
So sometimes again, you can send your own mail, so there's nothing more complicated in that part.

44
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,690
So you can send single message, you can send text the latest video graphics it I'm considering when

45
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,220
you text only because we are going to hear definition for video, voice and graphics.

46
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:56,100
Also, we need to handle that file using everything, so it's moving to more complex part for that purpose.

47
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:02,390
So instead of this, I'm mostly focused on text because we can get streams easy in Java.

48
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,020
It can also message on the outside of the internet.

49
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,800
So if not, continue here to internet as well land or local area.

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,170
And it could be instead of putting on nobody, then you can check other people also.

51
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:22,670
So it is just short multimedia user, a user to be able to use mailing systems.

52
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,110
So use it.

53
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,620
A user mailing system empty is just a mail blank.

54
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,650
It will go to the internet.

55
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,920
These mail gateway.

56
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,000
It will use and deliver another system.

57
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,360
So how this some TV works actually delivered?

58
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:43,130
So this is all the things it needs, or we do in the rectangular part out of this interview.

59
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,300
So you can see.

60
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,490
So it simply works on the host and automatically host is basically had this anything, it's going to

61
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:49,730
work.

62
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,300
So what is our application is going to work here is very simple.

63
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:02,750
It just gives your web view over what is going to publish our view about a job program and what is going

64
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,970
to do is it is going to.

65
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:13,130
Would that just be just also it really asks for that extension, so let me do one thing, you can put

66
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,820
this as this also this is also correct.

67
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:17,630
You're.

68
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,760
It is going to go through this and it is going to do as you.

69
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:29,890
So now let me tell you this, what is this so you cannot see like this onslaught?

70
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,910
It is going to sort of look at the experience.

71
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:39,660
This job problem is going to be solved, which is going to find the sendmail to given or you can use.

72
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:46,500
Authentication fails also required their username and password to gain in the S&amp;P and using IT service.

73
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,300
So this isn't about it, simply behoove, you are going to perform here.

74
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,230
So if you understood this latest move with our e-mail application part.

75
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,220
So we already created this sign integrated e-mail message.

76
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,080
So let me copy this to.

77
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,250
Let me go, please.

78
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:19,700
You know, music and what I mean is that email or mail package and we to create new glass.

79
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,150
So you can see your new getting grade window.

80
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,740
I already opened this part, let me paste this in an invitation.

81
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:43,930
Plus, it entered the default class will create for you, so you can.

82
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,720
So we created this, but we haven't mentioned anything yet.

83
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,550
So as you can?

84
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:52,660
OK.

85
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:01,000
As soon as you create this, it is announced for you, but we have a greater say to these things out

86
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:01,690
here.

87
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,870
So let me go with this.

88
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,250
So more time it is here.

89
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,190
But I would say I needed some packages.

90
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,180
Also, I needed, so I needed more things here.

91
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,600
So.

92
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,290
Let me add one here.

93
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:27,460
One by one, look at this private screening group.

94
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,470
It's my first requirement to message.

95
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:43,580
And let me be wanting to supplement and let me one too small because hear the case so.

96
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,160
Then I have what I need, it is for my address, also

97
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,200
from Qantas.

98
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,480
So I'm going to mention your former list, but.

99
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,250
Oh, Link, for handling any purpose, I need this from you.

100
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,770
I'm going to put this with you on.

101
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,840
So why I mentioned earlier, if I'm not mentioning it, will assume it's not ready for you.

102
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:19,380
So there may be some error cases or anything you're going to do, then address, mix, address, you

103
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,770
can add here, Oh, I'm going to add it so.

104
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,980
So you see, and we had this.

105
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,420
So let them do it for us.

106
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,220
I'm not.

107
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:52,790
Focusing on this point because the carbon copy in the U.S., let me complete control is just for the

108
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,750
opening of Berlin.

109
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,840
I mean, you can lose that childhood.

110
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:05,840
So all these four string because these are just all important things for message and everything here,

111
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,880
even for these purpose.

112
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,270
I need all the consider, which is basically.

113
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,430
Subject.

114
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:23,420
And message again, it's private string subject is important.

115
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,600
And similarly for.

116
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,310
Message.

117
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,680
So now we are done with this.

118
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:42,160
So but now we need to check whether the five messages estimate if you are putting a statement or text,

119
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,640
if you're using HDMI 2.0 to will be, as you know.

120
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,910
So I need to do this.

121
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,490
So let me put up here.

122
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,630
To me, slash each DML will hey.

123
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,450
So for that purpose, I need to specify who treated this year.

124
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:15,680
So let me just copy these things, but I don't want to focus on this.

125
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,920
OK, so we are to do this, but we are remaining with some.

126
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:26,490
So let me to tell you, I'm I'm using strategies because these are the statistics here, even if given

127
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:26,900
in Michigan.

128
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,550
So these are very important to see it.

129
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,810
So let me add a methods here.

130
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,200
It is basically steam strength, so it's it magic in that it's.

131
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:45,750
So.

132
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,940
You can take me there at least.

133
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,630
OK, now they're are.

134
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:04,380
So let me tell you how all the things that I did hear all the noise and they get confused here.

135
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,650
So let me tell you who I do some things.

136
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,110
These two are unable to console.

137
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,280
Let me just.

138
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,820
And what they need, so.

139
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:31,020
Well, I don't want to focus on getting sick when it looks, what are you going to do in India, Julia

140
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,950
Priest or concert or your shortcut key on your keyboard?

141
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,630
For me, it's all in, so you will get general operating.

142
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,540
You're going to get through text.

143
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,550
Press control and choose for these things.

144
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,200
And it does case.

145
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,640
And therefore, these days, I'll put in all these these things to render.

146
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,890
You got all the things, you know, what are you going to do?

147
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,470
You're going to change this according to your papers.

148
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,010
And what is your going to use change you?

149
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,940
So these are the gates you see from interviews you can.

150
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,550
So you can change it, according to your part.

151
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,690
It's not compulsory, but if you want to change, you can change it.

152
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,290
You're.

153
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,930
So we had mentioned this, but we are remaining with said message I.

154
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,550
Said message and everything good message to both of them.

155
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,450
OK, e-mail utilities, meaning liquid a liquid is included in that thing in later part.

156
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,460
So let us go to this or she is going to be here basically evil message.

157
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:54,070
So if you look at this FAQ, this is sex objects and this is going to work here.

158
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,190
But what is going to work?

159
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:05,770
So you're like, get get used for getting that, who is putting in this to similarly get from this and

160
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:11,350
from who Buddhist this to see to get sick, sexy similarly.

161
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,090
So these are some important I'm quoting here and what?

162
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:22,270
I don't want to hear this again and again, so I would will take care of me and I put that back for

163
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,970
me instead of typing it again and again.

164
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,760
So now we are done with this.

165
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,080
But so.

166
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,470
This is the E.M. is it's all what is going on behind it is her new email message is going to handle

167
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,790
our data as this is made, planned mainland is going to face data.

168
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,070
Email message is going to handle the headline.

169
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,860
It's going to create some lawmakers who handle it later as our email application is going to use here

170
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,430
so I can pay for the name as meal service.

171
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,530
Or let me check here.

172
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,240
What is it?

173
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:04,260
My name is this female utility, so email utilities going to mercury sending service for my application.

174
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,220
So for a lot of videos, what I'm going to create, I'm going to create email.

175
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,020
So once email utility, then we can perform email action.

176
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,930
How do we can say we can send the information after that?

177
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,060
But I'm going to handle some e-mails.

178
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:25,830
So handling emails like phishing emails is quite a tough job in Java because sometimes there may be

179
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,250
media files or anything.

180
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:33,000
So for that purpose, we need to file handling everything with her, but sending messages very easy.

181
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:41,340
And it's a very helpful way of saying because for the faking the data, it's very easy or an easy job,

182
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,050
but via sending data.

183
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,790
Maybe Hank, she can get us or anything.

184
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,430
So we will check that and we are going.

185
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,170
We will create one email class which is going to have some send email function.

186
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:59,270
So just to handle on what to do, and that's it.

187
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,480
We are going to perform here.

188
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,800
Thank you.

189
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,030
Hope you understand this.
