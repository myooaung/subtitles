1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:09,640
So in previous scenes saw I created two simple logic things, you're basically if you win, win a game

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,270
and if you lose your game, I believe that if you are an aborted please post was that part.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,290
And now after this, I need to mention basically keystroke things.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,870
Yeah, which is very simple, which is I'm going to create some key events.

5
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,740
Let me mention as public or public worried again, because I'm not returning anything.

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,640
Let me mention as key press events, which is a key press.

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:40,980
With.

8
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,570
Key event.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,810
OK, unique evening.

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,130
So in previous cases.

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,280
We're doing it divides United.

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,030
OK, now the reason one is just floating.

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,230
OK.

14
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,750
So in previous things, as you can see, I created the one thing which is basically public void pink,

15
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,670
meaning that part the graphics for us.

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,980
Now I need to mention key, even for the main mechanism of battle moving playable unanimity so it will

17
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,730
hold all the.

18
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,530
Key mechanisms here.

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,140
First condition, if.

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,960
You're not guilty.

21
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:30,400
You can check here, get equal to each, give me some key equals, which is basically right to left

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,180
or something like that.

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,950
Oh, I saw these things and again, event I need to mention here he.

24
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,430
Even.

25
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,710
And you lost, you're going to take here every key location key, so know what I need to mention is

26
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,910
basically giving you not one to three I need to mention.

27
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,600
We care about all these law abiding people and you can check your everything.

28
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,260
No.

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,550
I will take this because it will be one for each event.

30
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,150
Not, Vicki.

31
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,980
And once I am giving this right, you've been here, right?

32
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,560
So it is not right parenthesis or anything, if I press right, it should be moving to the right.

33
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:30,120
So what I need to mention is just basically moving that burden on a player if this is done.

34
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,480
No, I need to mention concern to that panel and it not moving to the highest part.

35
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,980
So again, it's coordinates greater than not is equal to.

36
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,380
Six hundred, if it's greater than equal to 600.

37
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,520
What didn't should mention as Blur X, which is basically X coordinate.

38
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,360
So there's six of them, which is basically not going away from that.

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,800
And.

40
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,210
As I'm mentioning, right, it should be going to the right counsel.

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,560
I need to mention mood lighting here.

42
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,950
So just let's move our.

43
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,610
So I will later create that mood, right, anybody thinks so what is the mood, right?

44
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,330
I will create it later.

45
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,840
So this will be the user defining returns, which is I'm going to create it later by.

46
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:34,380
Similarly, I need to mention all the things for left, so I will competition, let me paste and now

47
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:41,010
I'm going to change a few parts, which is basically here if you assume that we can left only.

48
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:50,580
Now at the end, it's Blair eggs, and it should not be greater than or equal, it should be strictly

49
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,630
less than 10.

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,570
So why not go to that part so it should be banned?

51
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:06,590
You feel less than or equal to Tent City 210 again and move left, not move right, move left.

52
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,130
It should be moved to the left, so I will.

53
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,940
This is again you different method, which I will create later.

54
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,890
Now another thing I need to mention is very basic thing.

55
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:31,300
If you are closely looking this part and everything, OK, now enter into thing is basic, so let me

56
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,680
again copy this, which is.

57
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,760
Do you think if a user presses enter?

58
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,880
Enter, which just basically simple selection you can get yourself into.

59
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,070
If.

60
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,650
Play which players you can kick your that's a bullying culture.

61
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:01,810
And as a starting point instead of do now, I need to mention that at tarting I mentioned as follows

62
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,110
Now I'm making it through.

63
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,390
And no one.

64
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,040
Would that users and into a.

65
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,130
For that purpose, if users and those in Turkey just.

66
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,400
Authorities in Turkey, I need to mention ball position.

67
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,510
Then I'm mentioning of right at random positions or and.

68
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,610
I'm limited to one position.

69
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,140
Why again, I'm putting its random position 350.

70
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:41,260
So for the toughness of the game and starting only in one direction, it should be moved downwards,

71
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,860
not upwards.

72
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,980
So its direction should be minus one.

73
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,630
It should not be going downward.

74
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:46,930
So.

75
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,010
And bowl valediction I'm mentioning is minus two.

76
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,470
Now.

77
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:08,760
Blair, as you can assume, Blair should be aired and to student a score and the score should be zero

78
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,440
always total because you can choose as much you want.

79
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:22,290
I'm mentioning S21 only, so 21 will be higher score and it will create on the map so that we I'm going

80
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,610
to generate later.

81
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:23,880
But.

82
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:34,230
To avoid any enemies I'm mentioning earlier, despite gender and I guess three soon enough.

83
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,270
So I will create that letter, and I will tell you, what is this and this will do?

84
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,490
But now?

85
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,380
Only these things are not enough.

86
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,360
I need to mention one thing here is the deep end.

87
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,920
So I will tell you, what is the reprinting here?

88
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,430
Oh, OK.

89
00:06:51,970 --> 00:07:01,390
Let me show you what it is dipping is basically creating a rectangle or creating plate in Java, NWT

90
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,050
again.

91
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:12,940
So it's just like the creation of that void again, deep and this is my, yeah, this is my this look.

92
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,970
And OK, this is my ball position.

93
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,540
It's.

94
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:27,830
So now all I need to mention ratings, move liftings, action, perform things because action event,

95
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,640
which is basically the bouncing part and some more things like collisions and everything I need to mention.

96
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,630
So.

97
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:43,450
The game plays only dumb job encoding, otherwise we are creating you, and everything is very easy.

98
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,660
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to the moon left and these things.

99
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,620
But before that, I need to mention public void.

100
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,410
Gives me a 30 year.

101
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,950
And let me tell you why I'm creating it earlier, because if.

102
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,600
He went.

103
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,380
E again, if I created this earlier.

104
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,100
There may be chances.

105
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,380
Our players will not move that part is not.

106
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,770
Let me mention again, I don't see it in one important thing.

107
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,610
Even.

108
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,240
E!

109
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,180
So I'm mentioning these methods earlier.

110
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:39,070
And this note, I'm going to create public.

111
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,200
Void.

112
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,370
You are right.

113
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,080
I already moved on.

114
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:56,280
Well, let me move in this moment, please, equal to two, because it's single game only.

115
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,000
True.

116
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,170
And politics.

117
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,090
Position always goes to.

118
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,380
Is it 20 by 2020 positions, it will be?

119
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,480
Similarly, I need to mention four of my.

120
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:22,820
But with little difference, as I'm adding here, I'm again putting this left.

121
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:32,830
As I'm adding in the right position, which is basically plus, but for the left condition, I need

122
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,150
to mention minus.

123
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,780
So, no, these things are done now.

124
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:44,960
What I need to mention, which is basically actions by starting in doing all these things, I need to

125
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,050
mention which is again another matter.

126
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,310
Public void.

127
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,670
Public void.

128
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,660
Action performed.

129
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,640
Action evening.

130
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,540
So, which is basically dependent on action, not on pressing.

131
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,690
They were the first time I mentioned already it should be start at the starting position start.

132
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:24,200
After this, if Blair is going to play, so if play, which is always false, the starting.

133
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,790
But it will create a new rectangle forming so new.

134
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:37,650
So action performed is basically creating a mean layout of your energy, you so.

135
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:45,180
I already created inside parts of that, that ball and everything, but what about the net templates?

136
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,990
I need to create one template, so I'm going to include that in everything rectangle.

137
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,530
With bold position.

138
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,140
It's.

139
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,850
Omar Ball position.

140
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,050
Why now?

141
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,130
I guess don't debate to induce enough friction for me.

142
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,940
With some intersecting methods, again, it's a very complex thing.

143
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,910
The six.

144
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,090
With another new rectangle.

145
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,580
So it's just like overlaying on two rectangles with.

146
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,180
Player X, because there should be a player also at the start.

147
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,810
Otherwise, it will be no use of Game 30.

148
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,840
And I guess it isn't OK, how it is mentioned and everything is mentioned.

149
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,930
And is, you know, not.

150
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,640
In general for this launch.

151
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,080
Very, very much so.

152
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,530
So I'm no gender rectangle.

153
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,740
No, I need to mention one by direction.

154
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,740
Is equal to minus of worldwide addiction.

155
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:17,010
She's basically very similar, like it should be Clinton and the starting point and one direction.

156
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,160
Just starting, it should be minus two.

157
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:30,710
And if I need to create another key because I need to create random things here, so I will create different,

158
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,280
different parts.

159
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:38,800
I'm going with three parts here, so and see if I'm going to create here another method and see which

160
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,570
is another condition I need to mention.

161
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:49,920
Similar things I need to I'm going to create a bit more positioning, small position, why and everything

162
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,190
here.

163
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
So let me do one thing.

164
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,660
Let me copy this part.

165
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,250
But I don't want to use such things.

166
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,000
Let me mention, so what are the different things series or Player X?

167
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,700
As I'm mentioning, it's 550.

168
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,680
It should be five.

169
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,280
They didn't know it.

170
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,960
But let me do one thing.

171
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,450
It's basically here that we mentioned, I totally.

172
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,620
With 40, this is enough and.

173
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,610
That's how it is.

174
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:34,210
So I created with this image lifting, or let me do one thing here.

175
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,150
Let me go with first 20 Park.

176
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:43,720
Twenty 550 and 30, ritualistically you deal with but part.

177
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,150
Of anything.

178
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,600
And.

179
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,410
In this, again, the similar thing.

180
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,930
But I will change a little bit here.

181
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,360
His bold direction is going to become bold.

182
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,770
Its direction.

183
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,410
Let's once or.

184
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,790
It will move a little bit, but no, I again copying this.

185
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,560
And this time is something new, which is basically.

186
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:16,730
With 30.

187
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,590
You should be what should be it only?

188
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,550
I'm not going to change the height of you to basically paddle.

189
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,040
Ball position, and this time it's the one single condition only.

190
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,440
So this is basically over in logic.

191
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:41,190
No, I need to mention the collision with a football song.

192
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:50,870
Collision with the ball, I need to mention then, oh, let me check for I've created already, it's

193
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,550
not actually random, basically.

194
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,140
Also.

195
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:03,720
In this section, you won't even need to book, so I will create one thing here, which is basically

196
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,600
our ball collision in an expert in that thing.

197
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,660
What I'm going to do is I'm going to create one method which is going to collide on that ball or collide

198
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,250
on that platform.

199
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:22,140
It will bounce, so I will create such thing in next momentum.

200
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,600
Hope you can understand.

201
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:24,690
Thank you.
