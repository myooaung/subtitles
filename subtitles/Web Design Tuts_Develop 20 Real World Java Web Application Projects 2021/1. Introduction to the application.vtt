00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.310
Hello, everyone, in this series of learning how to make projects in Java.

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.770
Today we are going to start learning a new project that too in Java.

3
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.930
So the name of the project is phone ordering system.

4
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:27.460
So this is an application, a DIY application within Java, and it is headed as auditing system.

5
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.530
So this is the like interface of the application.

6
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:42.370
You can see it on your screens that the the frame contains like a service field to ask for a selection

7
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.020
of size, select which type of beverage you want to order.

8
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.780
And there are some great new photos from which we have to select.

9
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.990
That's what we want to order like.

10
00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.210
There is the input three, which asks for how many light glasses we want.

11
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:10.620
Like a quantity of these items, we have to enter head in numeric form so that the on our system like

12
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:19.450
calculate how many glasses you have to order and according to it, what will be the prices of the whole

13
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.870
card.

14
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.410
So this is going to be the home page of the application, like when the window opens.

15
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.280
This interface will be visible to the user.

16
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.920
Now I'll start with this dropdown button like select size is the name of the label, and inside there

17
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.560
is a dropdown asking for the size of the item, which we want to order.

18
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.230
So there are three options here.

19
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.960
Small, medium and large.

20
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.850
So we have to select one of them from these today, after which we have to select this type of beverage

21
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.290
like we want to order.

22
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:08.020
So currently I'm showing four options mentioned as you've ordered the coffee and like we can change

23
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.820
it according to our convenience.

24
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.850
When we are making the application, it's upon us that what we want to keep in the like button options.

25
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:26.620
OK, so below this that is yes, you heard you can see I have entered five and this will be the quantity

26
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.830
of water I want to add to the cart.

27
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.400
So there are two buttons and order.

28
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:43.360
So on taking the add button that a like a checkbox will appear like not a checkbox, but a dialog box

29
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.560
will appear asking for eyes like if I want to add ice to the beverage, I want to order.

30
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.110
So if I wish to add ice, I have to click Yes in this dialog box.

31
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.630
And if not, then I have to click No.

32
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.790
So then I will click Yes.

33
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.230
Then automatically.

34
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.850
The Olive Garden will be updated with a glass of water lakes ahead of you.

35
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:17.530
Five glasses of water medium size of glasses and also adorns eyes will be added to our glasses.

36
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.790
OK, so we have total yes.

37
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:31.330
Five medium glasses of water with ice added will appear on the screen so that you can see that the water

38
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.530
actually you have added to the carton or actually you have ordered.

39
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:43.450
OK, so in this, there are two buttons on hot corners as an order.

40
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.190
So on, clicking on the item will be added to the guide.

41
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.200
And you can select the other options from the menu.

42
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.890
Also that I suppose you want to store this so you can order this by using cards.

43
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.150
And once you have, like, completed all the selections you want to make, you have to click on this

44
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.020
order button.

45
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:16.200
So in the next slide, we can see that yes, we have order options and on clicking order options, a

46
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:25.360
message appears like it is also a dialog box containing the total sum of our order that we have ordered

47
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.760
for.

48
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.440
So five random glasses of water with the ice and this is not like paradise.

49
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.730
We have to pay.

50
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.400
So five million glasses of water with ice costs twelve point five.

51
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.490
Like what is the currency?

52
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.570
You can set gift according to your own, and these two buttons functions in a totally different way.

53
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:58.090
This and button helps us to add items to our cart and then again, gives us the option to select more

54
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.970
items from the menu and.

55
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.550
Then again, added to God, and once we finalize our Audrey, then we can make on this order, but then

56
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.220
then this message dialog box will appear.

57
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:18.770
So showing us that what we have actually finalizing the order and one's name and click OK, then another

58
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:26.900
dialog box will appear with showing a message of you should pay twelve point five and whatever the currency

59
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.290
is.

60
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.740
So, ah yes, they aren't making this OK.

61
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:39.080
Finally, your order will be completed and your will again, like the same homepage like this.

62
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.210
So on finalizing the then you can like to complete everything.

63
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.880
So this was the basic like idea of the application.

64
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:58.700
Now next, we will look up to whatever specifications from the project, which we are going to make

65
00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.180
today.

66
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.460
So this is basically a food ordering system.

67
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.370
So we are going to manage everything about the food and drink system.

68
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:16.460
We can add items to the card and attach Add-Ons to it, like we have seen that we about attaching ice

69
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.480
to water.

70
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:26.640
Also, we can confirm our order once we have finished, like selecting the items and cart is full,

71
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.920
then we have to check out.

72
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.500
Then we will click on the other button.

73
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.430
Also last on the completion of the order.

74
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.940
That pop up will appear like our dialogue box weekends.

75
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:48.080
We have already seen which will part what is the money to be paid by the like user, and the final amount

76
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.680
to be paid will be also displayed on clicking OK.

77
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:58.500
A separate, separate dialog box will appear in the final amount of money, which we have to pay for

78
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.840
whatever we have ordered.

79
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:07.850
So these are the specifications of the project, like the food ordering system, which we are going

80
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:08.810
to make today.

81
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:18.800
So now you may be wondering that on making this project, there should be some concept based like logic,

82
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:25.010
which we will learn after completion of this project, like on successful completion of this project,

83
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.330
then the project will be working fine.

84
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.700
Everything will be alike with no bugs.

85
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.120
There will be no exceptions.

86
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:39.800
Then what are the things which may will logics concepts we will be learning on completion of the project

87
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.210
and you are no wrong.

88
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:50.330
So this question will naturally arise in your mind that what will you learn on making this project on

89
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.730
learning the concepts of this project?

90
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.790
So this project is made in Java.

91
00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:02.900
This is basically a Javadi UI application, which will have a desk window interface.

92
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:12.050
We will be like operating this application on our desktops, and the interface will open and in a separate

93
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:17.840
window, the app will have us like, I think we have items in our next job.

94
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:25.310
Similarly, this app will have an icon and again, and that will open a separate window of the application,

95
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.230
and then we will be performing the tasks involved with this application.

96
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:38.600
OK, so the concepts which we are going to learn on completion of this project is object oriented programming

97
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.260
in Java.

98
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.580
So this project is based on object oriented programming.

99
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.360
OK, so objects are real world entities, which are we like.

100
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.180
We have to handle the real world and get these real world data.

101
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:58.190
Real world objects are going to be handled by making this project.

102
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:05.330
That is a difference in object oriented programming and the conventional, process oriented programming

103
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.790
that we do not have any methods of tackling real world entities.

104
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:17.840
But in object oriented programming, we have that facility that we can tackle everything about real

105
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.710
world entities.

106
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:25.010
So yes, we are going to learn the object oriented programming concept and handle all that real world

107
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:25.610
entities.

108
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.200
Also, we are going to be building agile application.

109
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.640
So of course, we we will learn a lot about Java programming language.

110
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.790
Java is a very interesting programming language.

111
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:43.250
We all know that that's why we are here and learning how to make applications.

112
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:50.960
And so this is the first benefit that Java is a language where we can make like real world application,

113
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.770
real life.

114
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.110
This applications as applicable in our daily life.

115
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.790
So Java is that beneficial?

116
00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:59.930
With the help of.

117
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:07.860
It's celebrity, we are mentioned, two of them head swingin W.T. Famous, so in this application.

118
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.180
There will be extensive news of swing any WTA frameworks.

119
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:21.030
So these two are basically like will kick slot in which we are going to like, put up things and then

120
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:26.190
add functionalities to everything like, I suppose there will be afternoon.

121
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.500
So the flame is going to contain a panel.

122
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:36.420
And inside the panel, we were really having our input fields, buttons and the like.

123
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:43.890
Yes, the drop down box and everything like the dialog box, well, was a batting asking for yes, no.

124
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:51.840
So once we will be checking out, so everything is enclosed inside a toolkit and that toolkit is provided

125
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.880
to us with the mercy of these libraries we call string and AWP.

126
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:05.910
AWP stands for Abstract Windows Toolkit and this helps us in making DIY application like best window

127
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.650
interface applications AMI using destroying any WTC name.

128
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:19.770
So yes, these are beneficial to the like learners who aspire to develop applications in Java.

129
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:27.270
Also, we will be learning a Java food ordering system, which is like, no wonder we have.

130
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:34.590
We are making a food ordering system, so we will learn how to make a food system in Java as well,

131
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:40.590
and classes and objects are going to be extensively used inside of this application.

132
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:47.940
So if there are object oriented programming, there will be classes and objects for sure, and that

133
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.710
is no wonder.

134
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:56.430
And so like everything, we are going to learn why we're making this application is listed here.

135
00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:01.500
We will be learning a lot of things after the completion of this project.

136
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.470
We will be like with a full mind.

137
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:14.670
Concepts of object oriented programming swing any D frameworks like giving like what we can say that

138
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:16.530
are bizarre.

139
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:24.540
Like that these are those going on in WP is a J Flame text on a menu bar.

140
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:33.600
And there are so many components of these packages which we are going to embed in our application and

141
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:42.480
then see how easy it becomes to put up things by just importing a simple component of these library.

142
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:50.820
And things make them so simple that we do not have the light right up plenty of code to fix things.

143
00:12:51.150 --> 00:13:00.240
We just have to simply add a single line statement like import this and everything is going to like

144
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:06.630
the already imported to your project and just you have to call it again and again, and then everything

145
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.470
will work properly fine without any complexities.

146
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:17.700
So, yes, I hope you have gained like a rough idea about what actually we are going to make today.

147
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:26.000
This is a food ordering system with up functioning functionality attached to these buttons and then

148
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.640
order, and we have to select these options from.

149
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.250
Well, so they will be asked for the addons.

150
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.420
We will be asked for size.

151
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.210
We will be asked for these.

152
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:46.230
We want to order and then we have to add things to the card if we want to add more things, or we can

153
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:53.820
simply press this order button to checkout from this cart on clicking this or that, we will be like

154
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:55.770
shown a message.

155
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.780
That's what actually we have ordered.

156
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.600
This is a sort of confirmation.

157
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.700
And also at last, you will be shown what actually you have to pay.

158
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.700
So yes, this exactly it was.

159
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:15.300
Now in the next part, we will be learning how this application works, actually.

160
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:21.900
And then the prototype to the code, which we are going to write in order to make this application.

161
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.610
So see when the next pass before that complete project tutorial?

162
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:27.810
Yes.
