1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:10,050
So in previous scenes, I created one JPA with model, so I will tell you, in short, how we are going

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,990
to perform better in the advantages of hybrid.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,220
Let me explain.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,710
First, you see the open source and lightweight.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:23,630
Anyone can perform different actions over hibernation by a range of hibernate glasses, and everything's

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,780
already created with the different databases because each database provides different kind of utilities.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,260
So for that purpose, for each database, different hibernation already created, then fast performance.

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,330
Its performance is fast because it's force level katchi is it enabled by default.

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:49,560
So if you know the coaching level, get GS basically storing the local some data inside the variables.

10
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,060
So it's not always switching from the proper database.

11
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,040
It's sometimes switching from the Kashi files on the database.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,520
Independent query because HQ will hibernate, query language use object oriented with a general physical,

13
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,790
which I already created that hibernate and each by which grid language.

14
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,870
Basically, it's not a school, it's a hybrid integrating language.

15
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,500
So it's some kind of object oriented language.

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,280
So I created one objects and I can use it later, but also so that's about how we are going to perform

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,490
here.

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,250
So let us see it.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,840
What are the things we are going to create and everything?

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:39,300
So if you close, look, I created one routines, two classes, one is in play service, Interface says,

21
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,880
putting that in the least part and putting and creating some.

22
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,170
You can catch it here.

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,320
I'm creating here to get you.

24
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:53,220
Then in the employee, I created one GPA to perform the database actions and everything.

25
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,850
Now, in the service part only, I'm going to create one class.

26
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,950
So if you know how we can create class, then it's very easy.

27
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,570
And.

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,400
Let me mention that class name is emblazoned with and B, because it's important, so I mentioned those

29
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,110
in place and we say this then.

30
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,810
In this employment.

31
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,120
Employs service, so let me use this implementation part.

32
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,790
So you're just going to use that part.

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,380
Now let us know how it's going to work and everything.

34
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:35,700
So.

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,410
Let me mention some annotations and everything here, oh, so.

36
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:55,980
And Bob Jordan, don't you to stand up to the important and involved, what did you don't bring framework

37
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,280
on then?

38
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:07,180
I needed different things here, but OK, which means I needed means music means.

39
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,940
And I tree inside this factory

40
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,560
and patients.

41
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,280
Not start.

42
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,220
OK, so this is very important for.

43
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,900
As soon as we are developing it, are doing to clean planes and played some libraries for diesel.

44
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,260
I'm not going to work here then.

45
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,780
Let me mention this as a service.

46
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:48,590
So, OK, it would automatically deploy any service, so it is the service service is basically for

47
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:55,280
the deploying and up and then or toward an intervention afterwards, basically for generating that part

48
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,060
of the wildly.

49
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,620
And in the wired part, I need to create one repository.

50
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,860
Private employer repository taking.

51
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:14,450
But before the day, the employer depository let us create one repository last year, so keep it as

52
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:20,900
this and let us create one more package inside this mansion as the repository.

53
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,070
Because we haven't created any repository, so let me create one package.

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:37,290
Repository and inside this repository, I'm going to create one another plus employ repository, so

55
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,250
it will help me to create one employee repository here.

56
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,090
So just basically JPA, we're going to provide me some extending part.

57
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:56,990
So while developing this, you can closely this very easy part in creating a new repository, so you

58
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,010
minimize this and.

59
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,510
OK, so let's see.

60
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,930
And in this, what I'm going to mention is

61
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,680
the repository, so it will default.

62
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,640
If you use this, then I need to extend it to some more part of your repository.

63
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,380
So exchange GP.

64
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,440
Repository, as you can see, is in my repository and to three things I need to mention here, it is

65
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,450
basically all.

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,510
Its name.

67
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,430
Let me mention the name as employee, no decision of employee.

68
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,560
Long.

69
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,160
And OK.

70
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,760
But again.

71
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,510
So if you use the meaning here, OK?

72
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,760
There is a good.

73
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,200
Let me import one thing, you know.

74
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,510
I mean, with me so.

75
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,970
Well, the team.

76
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,180
OK, OK.

77
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,930
So I need to implement methods on these things.

78
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,180
So, OK, that's it.

79
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:53,750
In inflatable therapy, so I will create that method scene controller part, which is basically the

80
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,340
controlling part in later.

81
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,580
So let me mention one controller here.

82
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:07,010
Also, because I haven't created one controlling part which is going to handle the mapping part and

83
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,180
everything later.

84
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,910
So I will create that part in later.

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,390
But.

86
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,490
Let us assume we need to implement teams you.

87
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,110
In the morning.

88
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,400
And.

89
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:25,650
Okay.

90
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,310
Okay.

91
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,940
So I'm implementing this and.

92
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,030
I'm accessing everything you.

93
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,070
You said 80 percent.

94
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:46,860
Yes.

95
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,770
So let us in this part.

96
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,400
She's basically employee service.

97
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,370
And they can create one of the waiting.

98
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,120
Altering the.

99
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,990
So it will import Douglas.

100
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:28,860
So it will automatically implement this, but I don't going to implement every part here in services,

101
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,480
so I'm going to create my own methods here.

102
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,830
Basically.

103
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,620
For that purpose.

104
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,600
Let me use that team.

105
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,940
OK.

106
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,820
So what I'm going to do is I'm accessing my own methods here.

107
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,250
So I advice in import class.

108
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,380
Then mentally mentalism.

109
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,300
Then Beijing will impose.

110
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,040
Then.

111
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,960
And what we do here, three things here.

112
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,760
Which is basically the repository, all.

113
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,060
OK, because I mentioned as a class or accessing as class or union to create interface.

114
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,400
So that's the problem I created to mention as it interface to.

115
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,550
Remove these things and then.

116
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,230
OK.

117
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,400
No.

118
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,200
And.

119
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,470
You need to be reviewed again and again, because sometimes it gives the data.

120
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,760
And what is irrelevant here we should be.

121
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:22,670
OK.

122
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,220
Well.

123
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,700
Why employs me?

124
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,990
OK, I need to import the glass just anything for the class, and I need to learn from museums or.

125
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,980
So that's when I've done this or it'll get removed.

126
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,470
And.

127
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,540
Class is not working, so let me mention what I created, just I just debug it.

128
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:08,580
One of the things I mentioned is already it's so related to speeding, so otherwise it is just I created

129
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:15,370
an employee repository as an interface to create a repository, as you can see a repository to store

130
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,580
the cashier for you so you can see inside this employee.

131
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,010
What I'm going to do, I'm going to create one two three methods.

132
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,260
So first is or going to create and implement the private repository.

133
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,930
Then in this, it's overwriting this list employee and it's getting it from the employee.

134
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,340
So this at least part.

135
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:41,930
I mentioned the Gate SEAL Gate employed, delete anything there, so I'm not creating different methods

136
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,130
here.

137
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:49,280
First is overriding this overriding is to find all methods to get all employees safe, all in place

138
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,830
to save all these employees and this employee, as is my object.

139
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:03,100
Then in the override part, I created an employee with two overriding methods and.

140
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:12,760
It's a very simple thing I created in the get employed by Ali with this employee as method, a bit different

141
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,060
things.

142
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:22,450
And now in the overriding pain, these things, I'm accessing this sort of material.

143
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,350
And so it is very easy in spring, you can actually see the matter in the spring.

144
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,930
It's already implemented this and you can use this part as a pages.

145
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,900
So now we are set with this, but we haven't created any mapping part.

146
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,010
So.

147
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,200
For mapping purposes, you need to create or do three things.

148
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,400
First is mapping, mapping, using just basic water mapping of what if this became the front end?

149
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,650
So I need to create one controller part.

150
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,770
So in the later part, I'm going to create one controller.

151
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:05,210
So it's very easy just to package and you need to mention controller you.

152
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,250
So I am going to create one package here, I created one package.

153
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,290
I'm going to use it.

154
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:16,960
And in the Resources tab, I'm going to mention the template basically in this new millennium, written

155
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,060
in little part to create the printing.

156
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,070
So hope you understand.

157
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,210
Thank you.
