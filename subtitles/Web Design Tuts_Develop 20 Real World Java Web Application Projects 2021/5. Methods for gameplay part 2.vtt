1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.560
Well, already created the rectangle and everything, no, I need to mention the ball collision part

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:07.810
here.

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:16.050
So let us create that jack map with the ball or even chicken eating by mentioning as ball collision.

4
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.200
Material.

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.020
Now, for that purpose, an ingenious effort.

6
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.360
Which is risky for each.

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.320
You can check it.

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.020
For.

9
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.050
And I is equal to zero again and again.

10
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.330
So I mentioned like a four year.

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.520
I use less than map, I'm in ecstasy, which is I'm going to create it later, in later part my billing.

12
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.420
Otherwise, I will explain the code.

13
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.840
Also, it will be beneficial for you also.

14
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.760
In that also, I'm going to check here other mental.

15
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.690
Geez, listen again, my.

16
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:14.170
And zero pollution have not met, which is basically what everyone I'm going to use here is my primary

17
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.210
dataset for my plant.

18
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.920
And joblessness as usual.

19
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.540
So I'm going to use your as you can check here just again and again for.

20
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.020
You can check your internet for Loop that link that.

21
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.700
Now, if.

22
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.940
What a map.

23
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.000
Not, man.

24
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.740
Is going to exceed then I out of.

25
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.330
If we're going to achieve that, then I object.

26
00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.000
Schools should be plus plus, but our worry and everything should be changed, so for that purpose and

27
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.600
mentioning.

28
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.700
Indique.

29
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.970
X is equal to G-Star.

30
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:20.130
Matt, which is basically nothing but changing the world and everything which is going to create later,

31
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.770
let's 80.

32
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.620
So we can assume that it will be disappear on their part.

33
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.250
And now with similar.

34
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.370
But here I'm going to mention why.

35
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.260
51, which is again increasing.

36
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.290
And.

37
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.870
And.

38
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.990
But would.

39
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.420
Is equal to.

40
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.570
MassDOT Brickwood.

41
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.340
So that's a little creative with.

42
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.590
So it's giving me a because it's not defined with a malfunction is not generated and.

43
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.540
And for good ginger ale, it's not liquid, always.

44
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.260
Deduced, which induced state.

45
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.470
And with this, I'm going to create.

46
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.620
Similar thing again, Brick.

47
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.440
Right.

48
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.820
The recount would be quite.

49
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.640
OK, so I need to mention this.

50
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.280
No, I need to create one rectangular thing here.

51
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.620
Which is, again, one map function, you can check rectangle, correct?

52
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.950
Integral to new.

53
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.590
Again, I'm taking part of rectangular with brick.

54
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.390
The I'm going to use your.

55
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.320
Brick by I'm going to use here.

56
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.910
Really come going to use you and with Brick.

57
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:38.340
I did basically my four dimensional everything's brick height, not wheeltug in height.

58
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.160
So.

59
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.500
That seems like it, OK?

60
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.180
No, similarly, I need to create a rectangle for a ball.

61
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.540
So I created a ball, but I need to mention ball in a rectangle.

62
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.830
So this is not visible actually, but its act like a rectangle to check bouncing and everything.

63
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.290
So.

64
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.810
New rectangle, always as in Java.

65
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.260
The term ball position.

66
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.360
X ball position.

67
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.710
Why?

68
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.760
And I guess his starting point is doing enough.

69
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.510
And the one thing remaining is a rectangle.

70
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.520
And the tangled.

71
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.650
Correct.

72
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:43.720
New York is equal to it, so it will need dramatically while anything on exactly that part.

73
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:52.310
So no, I am going to create or right or left bouncing part, so I'm going to create one.

74
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.950
You're bouncing mechanism of over.

75
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.930
Also mentioned is bouncing off.

76
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.560
Give.

77
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.680
Balancing mechanism of basically.

78
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.940
So if my bone.

79
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:22.610
Game Ball is going to react with ball rectangle a intercepts that middle part, which is brick.

80
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:33.540
So, OK, so what I will do is first, I will create your one brake mechanism, not bouncing brake mechanism

81
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.050
motion game.

82
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:42.250
Which is very important to I will create a big mechanism after that, I will create that bouncing mechanism.

83
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.370
If you think that intersects with that big rectangle.

84
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.420
So.

85
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.150
Always, I need to mention you've doing this and prescriptive, small, so.

86
00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.990
Very correct.

87
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.610
What will happen?

88
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:03.770
Matt?

89
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.840
Said, I'm going to create in that malfunction, if you.

90
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.140
You look at my community, so you just basically disappear.

91
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.090
Uh, no need to worry about dysfunctionally just basically disappearing that brick.

92
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.910
School will be increasing for you.

93
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.260
As this is my method to remove, including flame and purple bricks.

94
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.880
If you zoom minus minus, which is basically degrees, this will be degrees in the colder.

95
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:39.960
OK.

96
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.010
Now I need to mention.

97
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.120
When Ball hit to they turn left of the.

98
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.700
And basically, just like intercepting or intercepting that part, but I haven't mentioned.

99
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:56.980
Michael?

100
00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.760
One.

101
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:10.730
It to right or left of it, you know, it disappeared because just like the thing of that big so it

102
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:18.270
can be bounced from that part also, or it can be hitting that part of huge government not letting you

103
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.390
know.

104
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.520
Oh, I will complete, and it's OK.

105
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.750
Now I need to create the logic for that also.

106
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:32.660
If.

107
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:35.760
One.

108
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.770
Position.

109
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.870
The extradition was in the direction.

110
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.630
Less 19.

111
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:56.030
Is less than or equal to one rectangular, she's basically bald, rectangular x coordinate.

112
00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.000
What?

113
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:05.010
You can create the conditions for auto install all pole position.

114
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.210
Again, which is basically my right part of.

115
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.990
You know, but less one.

116
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.680
Now you remember why I am not giving again or 1990 levels.

117
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.940
If I'm concerned as more part of left now, I should mention less part of rate of that.

118
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:27.580
So.

119
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.710
But again, rectangular, very correct.

120
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:34.570
And.

121
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:36.900
Wait a minute.

122
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.010
What is this degree or?

123
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.270
We do need.

124
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.910
It should not be moral position, it should be brief, correct?

125
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.750
Let me do one thing here.

126
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.490
I'm going to change this variable because I'm confusing wrong in Indonesia.

127
00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:01.370
You know, Molly and Bill, so I'm mentioning as an issue, it should be very clear.

128
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.520
And should will be correct now, it's considerable.

129
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.500
You just like this X.

130
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:20.450
And explosion, basically, that's not complete logic, plus it should be.

131
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.200
But, Greg?

132
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.470
Not.

133
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:27.460
We're the touchstone.

134
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:28.810
So let me mention.

135
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.490
So that's a different matter.

136
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.830
If that happens.

137
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.250
More deduction should be changed because just like you did.

138
00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:48.280
Well, it's different from the beginning, so I'm going to change that bold direction, not opposed

139
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:48.510
to it.

140
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.180
When top to bottom.

141
00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.430
Top or bottom, not top to bottom.

142
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.870
Top to bottom, on top or bottom of that part brick.

143
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.870
I need to mention its condition here.

144
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.310
I mean, all of data contributing.

145
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.000
We can assume that it would be negative.

146
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.940
That's basically opposite of that.

147
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.800
So in the ASO Mansingh condition of our.

148
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.940
So I need to break.

149
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:28.510
You're just basically breaking the epoch, which is I'm not going to continuously calling this again

150
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.020
and again.

151
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.790
So these things are enough, I guess.

152
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.910
OK, enough.

153
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.710
Oh, no, I need to mention one thing here.

154
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:41.650
Which is we are no.

155
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.420
Out off, you're going to kill this one collision, No.

156
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.520
One small collision is done.

157
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.010
I need to specify.

158
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.360
This says bold, because for further creating and everything.

159
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.370
I am updating.

160
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:09.600
My bold directions, the Gimbel direction, I'm going to update.

161
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.540
So now what I'm going to create is very simple, just mountain conditions.

162
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:25.780
If you know this part, it's very helpful or otherwise you can drop this part on.

163
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:30.650
So it's not very important, but for seamless gameplay, I'm going to clear this.

164
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:41.000
Otherwise, you have to again and again closing and opening the games or or such purpose and creating

165
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.300
this.

166
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.420
Now, it's very similar.

167
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:54.880
Now, if I'm mentioning right, and I should mention here, why, because I already created this.

168
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:03.520
So he's just basically moving or bouncing condition here, if it's less than zero.

169
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:04.570
It's the opposite.

170
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:10.090
If again, this should be why and this is why.

171
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.460
So these four top and bottom.

172
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.400
Now let me mention for lower and upper part.

173
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:20.650
So for my concern, there should not be any.

174
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:27.650
Conditions for or which is basically left and right should be that it's condition because we know that

175
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:28.490
it's going to.

176
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.150
You mean the game when we're apart.

177
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:39.470
So I'm sure these things are done and depend on call, which is basically.

178
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.650
Calling these things again.

179
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.540
So now we are done with our gameplay mechanism.

180
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:53.630
So now what teams are remaining, which is basically map generator functions, which is I'm going to

181
00:13:53.630 --> 00:14:00.790
create it, which is basically very similar to these things, but I'm going to use some color strokes

182
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.390
graphics to mechanisms which will be helpful to create a map generator.

183
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.420
So in the later part, I'm going to create one map generator function.

184
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.470
So in that part, you will understand what is the map generator?

185
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.120
And I'm going to call that in me.

186
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:16.370
Hope you understand.

187
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:17.450
Thank you.
