00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:10.190
In previous cases, our tutorial, we have seen that how we created them basically gameplay.

2
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.190
So a lot of our gameplay holds is basically it's going to hold all the game components.

3
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.600
So what is the game components are basically I'm considering as a breaking ball game.

4
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.820
So let me show you basically what our components, so our components are not really complex things.

5
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.960
Here it is.

6
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.110
These are just some of the things here.

7
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.730
So let me show you.

8
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.780
So there will be some bricks as I'm showing you.

9
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.460
Like, these are the bricks or what you can do is, Oh.

10
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.880
So let us consider these are some bricks in our game like these, these are in will be in order always.

11
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.040
And let us consider this is the window of the game now.

12
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.210
There will be one platform.

13
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.920
In our game, which is going to move, so we're just going to move by user, we do basically live to

14
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.300
right on you, not OK, we're done.

15
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.930
It's going to move from left to right.

16
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.070
So let me give one color to it seems like these are the.

17
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.910
And these are all things that will be green in color as I'm chewing and.

18
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.310
Not all these things, these will be the on.

19
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.180
So these are the some breaks consider as these are in the order or neutering, it's not an order at

20
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.360
all.

21
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.290
But consider these are in order only and these will be the bricks.

22
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.020
So now what will happen when you re starting are going to play?

23
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.520
There is there will be one.

24
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.250
Mall, you can say this is the ball which is going to move like from here and it will push this part,

25
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.100
then the mall will be touched here.

26
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.880
What happens that brick will be disappeared?

27
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.850
That beak will disappear, so this is the brick, and it will disappear when it's going to move like

28
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.120
that and or.

29
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.530
Like this, it will be disappearing.

30
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.390
But remember, Ball will be remains.

31
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.270
It will be in the same position that one will be bouncier and it will act like that.

32
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.720
So what are our mountain conditions?

33
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.360
These are our balancing constraints, mounting, going to see these and this platform also.

34
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.430
But below this platform, there is no balancing constraints.

35
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.760
So let us score something here, which is basically our quoting park.

36
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.380
Now, this is my map generator, as I told you, oh, I'm going to create my generator later, but this

37
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.170
is the gameplay which I've already configured in the previous two drill hole.

38
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.610
You can set up, I told you this four.

39
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.990
This is for parallel.

40
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.790
This is for ball now.

41
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.370
After the ball and everything, I need to give one thing, which is when you are going to win the game.

42
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.810
Did we mention when you win game, when you are going to win a game, what you are going to do?

43
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.700
Winningham is basically the total number of bricks in that window.

44
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.830
It's zero, so in our condition is I'm going to mention total bricks or you can do any other variable

45
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.070
here.

46
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.590
I'm going to build bricks.

47
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.080
Which is going to be zero.

48
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.180
You get less than or equal to zero.

49
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.870
No.

50
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.440
Let me tell you why it should be less than or equal to zero.

51
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.830
Sometimes that look, I'm going to reiterate, it's going to be a minus.

52
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.730
And what is the exact minus thing is less than zero, so we're going to win that game.

53
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.680
Our user is going to win that game player is going to win that game if the number of breaks in the fall,

54
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.190
Lupita, depending on your game play.

55
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.010
So if it's less than zero, it will not appear on our gameplay window.

56
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:27.560
But at the back for the calculation, there is maybe conditionally less than zero, so do not give proper

57
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.510
meaning conditions or for such things to avoid.

58
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.390
And I'm a little I'm giving less than zero.

59
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.400
No, lately I already created.

60
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.980
If you closely look at your play, this is your priority, which is false.

61
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.550
But at the starting it is false.

62
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.690
But now, after winning everything, it should be always false again.

63
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.230
So why false is a condition of playing after winning game?

64
00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.970
False condition should be appear.

65
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.530
It should not be true always after winning game that Windows should be free and your win or User1 title

66
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.320
should became theirs.

67
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.450
Or for that purpose, I'm giving this.

68
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:19.620
No, let me mention my addiction either to new direction or zero, because Bold Directory is should

69
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:26.550
be zero, just like the greedy part of greed part of our game, so it should be zero zero.

70
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.350
No.

71
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.690
Did not said I'm going to use your.

72
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.270
Which is a very popular method.

73
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.850
Cologne, not let me mention that you're only giving clarity.

74
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.870
Then I need to search phone for text theoretically should want.

75
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.510
Oh, it's not giving me OK.

76
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.890
On.

77
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.300
OK, I got a mental now in this.

78
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.110
I need to mention new font because I'm giving new font.

79
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.740
Again, I'm mentioning one family series, which is commonly used, and it's open source for family

80
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.210
then.

81
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.520
Font, not bold, I'm getting mentioned as bold.

82
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.360
And let me tell you why I'm mentioning board because it should be in bold form and the site should mean

83
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:25.070
30.

84
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.080
I guess that's enough or sitting right in.

85
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.400
No, you're not.

86
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:39.110
Oh, drawstring, now that drawstring is basically it's going to draw that part, which is basically

87
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.790
displaying that part in N.W.T..

88
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.700
So its graphics fruity.

89
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.940
There is no need to mention these all these things because I got a job.

90
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.220
I will take care of that prostitutes and everything.

91
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.660
So just mention this and let me introduce you one.

92
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:03.000
You went as a message that after winning the game and all 60 x coordinate and.

93
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.600
Three hundred, I think it's enough if you graphics designer, you will understand more than this.

94
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.500
Let me tell you, in short also, you can understand this so.

95
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.860
Let me do one thing here.

96
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.010
Let me play around these parts.

97
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.500
OK, so let me clear on this fact.

98
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.560
So when you are in the map generator, you win.

99
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.590
This is my window.

100
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:41.410
But in the actual part, what happens on there are great lines and each green lengths.

101
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.810
So this is a vertical grid lens you can assume.

102
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.510
Always remember, these are always straight lines.

103
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.960
Not as I'm drawing always.

104
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.950
These are the straight lines.

105
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:58.330
And there are some horizontal lines also like this in a grid.

106
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:03.310
So there are many horizontal lines and each are adding some meaningful names.

107
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.390
So this is the hour excluding it, and this will be a little like ordinary.

108
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.230
So I split over Matrix.

109
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.060
This is X, and this will be in the gameplay.

110
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.470
And what happens?

111
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.920
Actually, there are two minute things.

112
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:23.380
So when I mentioned this or two, 16, it means from top to bottom edge, the number of 260.

113
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.590
And from Michael to be there.

114
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.910
And number of three hundred, so it will appear something in the media, so that's something that constraint,

115
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:33.400
you can see it.

116
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:40.520
Sixty two, three and four x 14 to wise three and needed basically like top of something miles.

117
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.940
So you can assume like that.

118
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:48.360
Now I need to again mention the color.

119
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:56.630
For one simple thing, we do basically all our school, which I am going to because you want and your

120
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.060
school, so for that purpose, I'm using color.

121
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.730
And again, I'm putting as only.

122
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.680
So now you can argue that it's giving me the.

123
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:14.420
That five is book, which is basically, again, your and everything.

124
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.360
Oh no, you're not sick.

125
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.620
I need to mention again and font.

126
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.110
So what are you going to do it?

127
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:28.160
I'm copying this test because I'm going to say that font again, but.

128
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.530
It seems but less safe.

129
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:38.200
And what I'm going to say is basically get drawstring.

130
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:44.950
Again, I'm going to mention drawstring, oh, this is not at all what I'm telling you.

131
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:50.770
The graphics fleet's older method of doing in IWD, which is a Java swing.

132
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.180
No, it's not required.

133
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:53.830
Press.

134
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.080
Entered.

135
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.580
To.

136
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:11.310
Restart the game, restart the game, and now I need to mention the coordinates again.

137
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:20.140
No, I'm moving little bit downwards, as you can see, persistent going downward with three 50.

138
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.030
It's enough, I guess.

139
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:27.330
OK, so this is the winning condition of my game.

140
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.650
But what will happen if my know I lose a game?

141
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:39.570
So if you remember, oh, I created one thing here, which is the basically.

142
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.660
Well, OK, I.

143
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.080
This is this is over parallel, which is basically Blair.

144
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:54.890
So if you look out this hour, this is 550, so assume that our location is 550.

145
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.450
The location is 550, expertly so on the panel.

146
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.610
But below that parallel, it started from for you.

147
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.170
Fifty five, sixty five sixty, then 570.

148
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.620
So what is the losing condition?

149
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:17.570
One condition is one goes downward, then that pedal, which is basically if you consider this as my

150
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.430
polling idea.

151
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.510
And this is my final.

152
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:24.080
If.

153
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:31.640
This is my ball and ball goes to downward this, so this is for you to stop consider as this is for

154
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:31.730
you.

155
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.760
16, if goes to downwards, it's 570.

156
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:35.960
So if one.

157
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:43.100
Like moving from this, this this and time will do that again, bouncing and moving downwards, then

158
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.230
this pattern, that's a losing condition.

159
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:51.380
So for that purpose, what I'm going to do, I'm not mentioning, I mentioned the winning coalition

160
00:11:51.380 --> 00:12:00.560
winning conditional use only one, but no one need to mention when you lose the game, you basically

161
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:01.940
condition.

162
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.290
Again, more position.

163
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:11.780
What position, why now, why I'm not mentioning Expedition X is only horizontal position.

164
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.870
And there is no limit for horizontal horizontally in there two constraints.

165
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.910
One can move from that to England, but in a way it's not like that.

166
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.210
It should be a kind of formal position while.

167
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.660
Is greater than 520.

168
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.370
If ball position is greater than five, 70, you're going to lose the weight.

169
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.060
So each is basically in false condition.

170
00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:38.240
You cannot play for the it's going to downward, so play false.

171
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:46.080
Again, each direction you need to mention is zero, because it shouldn't be zero, then why that action

172
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.050
shouldn't be again zero, which is basically normalizing the world position.

173
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.330
And I already mentioned so many engineers why?

174
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.390
By direction.

175
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.770
Then.

176
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:06.930
No, I need to mention game one word or something, so for that purpose, I need to again mention circular

177
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:07.410
methods.

178
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.440
So again, I'm telling you color is one of the sitting, and let me tell you what is the here?

179
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:21.690
So if you seen I created your paint, which is graphics method in our AWP and again and again, you

180
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.000
mentioned it as a graphics method.

181
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:32.670
So I'm calling that graphics methods, which default N.W.T. teams with color dot red.

182
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:41.790
Oh, I need to mention foreign family also, so all these allow me to copy this text again because I

183
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:42.900
already coded that part.

184
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.150
And Tony and.

185
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:53.670
I need to mention this rostering again, which is basically printing that string in that console, but

186
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.320
this time not one.

187
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.990
Which is basically game over.

188
00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.010
And let me mention as like this.

189
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.090
And like this and for this xenophobia.

190
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:11.930
So this is for the game on what?

191
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:21.680
But while your gaming would you need to mention a sponsor, so now I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going

192
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.910
to mention score.

193
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.420
Game over.

194
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.510
In this only school, I think I'm going to mention Scoop.

195
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.430
And again, less.

196
00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.630
So I guess I made mistakes not.

197
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.260
It basically or iPhone.

198
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:49.170
So when these things are done, you shouldn't be mentioned, I was caught and this which is basically

199
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.410
going to bring the school final score of the game on the team.

200
00:14:54.100 --> 00:15:01.090
Again, you know, St. Cloud, which is basically commenting presented to us, they started looking.

201
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.250
So this is the same thing I'm going to call.

202
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:17.850
No, no, I need to dispose of these things, which is basically when gaming is not started.

203
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:25.710
It we capture that part our system will catch in that part of the game will catch some parts here.

204
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.960
So I don't want to work like that.

205
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.940
I need to dispose it.

206
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:37.570
Like, it should not be mentioned again and again, game over game one thing you won't because it seems

207
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.860
like a storage of memory.

208
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:45.700
So while working on the real platform games, you can see your statistics so they are not disclosing,

209
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:53.170
they are storing at all kind of events or storage, or they're creating other files, fix files to storage

210
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:53.770
your data.

211
00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:02.070
But considering as a disk game what we need to mention when you mention that I'm going to store anything.

212
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.530
So for that purpose, I need to dispose it.

213
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:11.710
Otherwise it will give me errors for this course, or it will again and again would be meet the you

214
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:12.320
when you went.

215
00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:21.220
Even how this is, total bricks are going to be zero, but it stores that in case you mean it will not

216
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:21.580
disappear.

217
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.790
So I need to mention as I dispose your own soul.

218
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.240
So this is done by for this white paint.

219
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:35.080
In a later part, I'm going to show you what is pristine, thinks I'm going to create key events, then

220
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.070
release the games.

221
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:42.940
Also, I need to mention of it some more things I'm going to create here, which is right and left things

222
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.810
and some ball position things because these are some complex things.

223
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.550
So these are just a drawing part.

224
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.100
We are done now.

225
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.950
We need to do the basic game logic, but it's going to work.

226
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.780
After that, we will create a map generator.

227
00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.190
It's very simple random generator how we are going to place that generator map.

228
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.200
And one last thing is basically we are going to call it in the mean all these meters are calling in

229
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.880
the mean, so it will help to understand object oriented coding and programming.

230
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.380
Also, hope you understand.

231
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.280
Thank you.
