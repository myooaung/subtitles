1
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.850
If you closely look at the record we already created, well, I mentioned this.

2
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:16.040
So let me do one thing and important when you follow the model known as Java Security, you can meet.

3
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:27.930
Optimized in boats, so as using eggs, there is no need to import that libraries again and again,

4
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.790
so let me mention here.

5
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:41.390
Importing Lebanese and importing the Lebanese, so I created a one glass to create a symmetric key firmly

6
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:49.750
plus symmetry in this glass what I'm mentioning oh, I mentioned my I find string as east, which is

7
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.960
steady and welcoming as a algorithm, then function to create one key.

8
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.230
I mentioned functional written, maybe.

9
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:09.500
Also, it's commonly known as mental function in Java to exhibition.

10
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.930
Then it throws the exhibition.

11
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:20.720
If there is an exception to good and it's the random thing you will generation Wolski 256 with six random.

12
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.090
Which is basically an enemy that is going to done with the key now before this, what I call an implementation

13
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.600
driver.

14
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.840
But our goal is basically nothing no mean all that work for the nation.

15
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.340
So let me be at ESPN, but we straightforwardly.

16
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:54.140
He is to mean Mr. Declaracion, again, it's true, those exception.

17
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.990
If there is an exception for the exception point.

18
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.020
Now what I'm going to mention, I'm going to ask, it's semantic, so it's very easy.

19
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.470
Security.

20
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.260
Makes could produce security, which seems pretty good.

21
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.900
We reached symmetric and symmetric.

22
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:38.000
I want to mention it semantically is equal to what is it similar to create a U.S.?

23
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.100
Yes.

24
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.580
So it will create a whiskey for me.

25
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.690
No one is going to mention is really simple system, not a rental.

26
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.250
Oh yeah.

27
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.420
So it's a bit output for.

28
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.590
So this is my concern.

29
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.460
And let me tell you one thing grenades and dysfunction.

30
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.200
So my function properly, yes.

31
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.150
So it will be symmetric key for me.

32
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.770
Oh, then.

33
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.120
System not here.

34
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.460
In Smith Creek.

35
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.680
Let's.

36
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.340
Sumit.

37
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:56.600
OK, so I will change gears a little bit later, but now listen, I create a class which is using a

38
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.680
ski algorithm for these purposes, which is going to change this everything.

39
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.690
So now let me run this using you can go to this also our control chief on so that I'm going with disturbing

40
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.620
going to today.

41
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.500
It's currently building in the building.

42
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.210
Thank you.

43
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.560
It's to being.

44
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.740
It will take time to read everything.

45
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.690
So it's raining dogs new encryption.

46
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.380
And when this is done, you can do this job.

47
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.500
So this thing is no, but.

48
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.620
Wait a minute.

49
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.760
This is incorrect.

50
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.680
No, it's printing them directly.

51
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.650
It's not encoded, so I need to encode it when you to encode in what is just basically creating in the

52
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.280
ciphertext.

53
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.710
So this is not at all Eydie Gorme.

54
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.680
You just keep specifying, I need to mention here.

55
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.350
More important thing to include.

56
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.690
So the narrative converter.

57
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.930
So let me in all this.

58
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.720
What I need big data I've converted.

59
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.320
Do 30.

60
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.410
He converted.

61
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.460
So wait a minute.

62
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:44.940
There is a you can to this Google if parking data ain't going to work.

63
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.310
Get a converted dog.

64
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.140
And you mentioned some green.

65
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.210
Picks exactly what I needed to inform by binary.

66
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.400
So I will.

67
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.350
Look at this, but you don't ignore the Minority Report.

68
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.950
Oh, wait a minute, I need to use or import.

69
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.920
He's also pain, so there may be no error.

70
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.950
So if you're.

71
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.420
Oh.

72
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.900
Taking it, I will with all this, it's so easy.

73
00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.380
It would.

74
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.720
So it's a similar scene, muscle union who.

75
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.850
Object with this javelin.

76
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.870
So if you're facing this it, it will be this bar.

77
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.250
It will impose.

78
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.400
It will download Java that file for you.

79
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.610
It will end domestically, and it's that part.

80
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:32.620
So wait for something to know, look, this way we record this, I will tell you, because that's a

81
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.630
simple thing I created, but I need to mention symmetric yields, so.

82
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.410
It's very easy to enjoy.

83
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.300
Which is only one dimension.

84
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.580
And.

85
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.910
That is so.

86
00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.020
So.

87
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.570
It is adding their dependencies, but.

88
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.700
Sometimes there may be error in this or.

89
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.590
Better to go get my independence.

90
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:27.550
It will.

91
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.200
Directly add the dependencies.

92
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:43.800
We need Joe Biden, just basically so you meet.

93
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.310
Directly download such dependencies on the internet, which are available.

94
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:02.870
So.

95
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:13.050
What I'm lonely, you need one job simile by independency to create that team, so.

96
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.740
I'm OK, I'm having that dependency.

97
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.620
So what I'm going to do, I'm just going to mention John Fahey here.

98
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.880
So let me.

99
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.440
I had two injured who can directly directly add Judd here also.

100
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.310
Heroes, all else would fail.

101
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.280
Project structure.

102
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.530
Let me go to these projects, Doctor, if you can see these were two lavatories.

103
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.090
Nothing is I like this, things are dead already.

104
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.930
I need to mention Java.

105
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:03.660
So it will directly to this, so let me go to where I stole that part.

106
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.580
What's your like?

107
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.650
It will apply this again.

108
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:19.070
Click.

109
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:34.370
So you can check these dependencies every day, which is basically my job if I use Masuda, so I didn't

110
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:40.190
I did my job clean and now it's going to be Hakes binary and get in.

111
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.350
So let us run this again.

112
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.410
It's currently being.

113
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:57.400
So wait for something to build this, so might be required to create or generate this heat before developing

114
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.390
actual, and we're going to be able to do the right equipment, we required this.

115
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:09.290
Cuba's D-Generation is very important for us without getting arrested, and you cannot do anything.

116
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.270
So now this is Mike.

117
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:18.360
So let me do one thing if you can see this is Mikey.

118
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.720
You can copy this guy.

119
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.650
OK.

120
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.770
Now why I used random thing here.

121
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.790
And let me just keep quiet.

122
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:28.030
Remember?

123
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.960
As you can see, it is 256 Beats is blowing in this disco 56.

124
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.960
Let me run this again.

125
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:46.540
What I want to show you, I want to show you why I use secure random algorithm.

126
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:53.500
Not randomly changing the key keys should not be always saying I should not always use this sim because

127
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.780
anyone can try this again later by.

128
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.290
So now you can check by me.

129
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:12.740
This is different, so we have one call which hopes to create semantic is always so.

130
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.790
This is my encryption key, which is I'm going to use 0:40 data.

131
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.600
Using that data only it will decrypt that block.

132
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.520
Hope you understand in the next part what I'm going to do.

133
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.100
Let me copy Salzman, let me show you.

134
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:31.850
He's also.

135
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.020
Is not the first part of the country.

136
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.780
So this is.

137
00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:01.500
Poppy business, Amanda.

138
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:10.160
Different so we can integrate such ease using easily advanced encryption to get on with.

139
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.040
Also, I use security to create good random changing disguise.

140
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.010
So if we want to check, you can check this.

141
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:26.630
It is purely all of these six bits I'm telling about bits, he says.

142
00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.360
For me, it's easily someone so sprinting.

143
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:33.140
And remember, I need one extremely simple binary.

144
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.830
Yet so you need to download this.

145
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.930
No, I need this also.

146
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.320
So.

147
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:49.490
Well, it is that thing, and at the library in this order, so you understand or in the next part.

148
00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:57.460
I'm going to create a journal within them who is going to work and how it's going to increase dramatically.

149
00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.050
Hope you understand.

150
00:14:59.290 --> 00:14:59.770
Thank you.
