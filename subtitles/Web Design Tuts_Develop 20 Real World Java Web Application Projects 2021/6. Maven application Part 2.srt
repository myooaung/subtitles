1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:07,230
So I already ordered some part, and now I'm going to show you how we can perform this.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,750
So these are already done in previous regional.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,070
I forgot to mention.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:22,170
You need to install the music app, which is a Windows pick application, which is available on the

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:22,470
internet.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,010
You need to install that, but otherwise it will not run.

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:35,710
Then what I'm going to tell you, I created this, it wouldn't, you know, if.

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,720
Which device I want to because I want to give that information.

9
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,620
Then I need to create one snapshot paling.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,520
So what is this and I'm starting to?

11
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:58,670
It's created one FYI, I will not be get to perform an ad for you, so it will add to my listening board

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,300
and everything in this fight file.

13
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:10,760
But so then I'm going to capture that part later in further and further to the rules.

14
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,370
I'm going to tell you how to capture that part.

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:23,840
So this is just handling and capturing the linebackers like I need to handle that package, so for that

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,320
purpose.

17
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,210
Oh, I'm going to handle these packets.

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:36,130
So let me check whether this outdoor pick up or when I sticks.

19
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:45,400
So as you can see in some package that these are not in these, but yeah, some packets are added.

20
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:55,100
So you can create different, different things, but I think the files and everything but.

21
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,390
No, you have to check whether it is listening to these people or not, so my ideas is not currently

22
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,040
listening to the people.

23
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:14,500
But if you can somehow implement this, you can create these are set to free from lilies and DCB bigots

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,360
on board for this.

25
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:23,790
If you create this HDTV, you will get people.

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,810
So I will run this and I tell you how it's going to work, but.

27
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:44,450
Is currently loading, and we find out all the networking devices available on my site, on my system.

28
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:51,540
So it will take some time to know everything, so it's loaded and.

29
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:59,550
This is going to provide the things for me, so as you can see, these are the minor devices.

30
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,320
So I will tell you what is the exception for me is certainly.

31
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,550
Syntax error.

32
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,720
What is this index in it?

33
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,060
And you can download this source.

34
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,150
Said Phil, that this OK.

35
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,230
Why?

36
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,390
I haven't mentioned the issue.

37
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,080
I should mention that D.C. people always time.

38
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:41,320
So hope you understand this fire, so not always do you have to listen to the people.

39
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:47,240
So I created this part and I could probably really got back into material.

40
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:54,650
Then I created the Max package to bring that box and package to this new package dropped and everything,

41
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,460
but my little package capturing and everything.

42
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,430
So my device is not currently connected to the network to some issues and networking issues are not

43
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,660
connected to the network.

44
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:13,360
So you may not find their are packets captured, but you have to check everything.

45
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,590
So hope you understand this, but oh, this is it for this project.

46
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:25,970
If you want to implement this part on your site, you can create when you are using string and you can

47
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,800
implement this part.

48
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,860
Hope you are listening?

49
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:28,850
Thank you.
