WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.600
In previous tutorials, I told you we created all the programs and we are facing some exceptions, so

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.380
I told you in that video we can handle that exceptions with some part.

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.760
So we use the multi-threading and as I told you, we hope we can use multi-threading yet to execute

4
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.610
the main process in small small processes, or we can set up processes.

5
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.780
And which are these processes, like I told you, there are different processes in connecting a client,

6
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.800
connecting the message, handling the message, I'm accepting some private messages also here.

7
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.470
So that part then stability 10 times that we're loading.

8
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.830
We can handle all these things to order multithreading.

9
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.900
And what is the multithreading handling done multiple tours at?

10
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.660
And so what is the beautiful thing here is I can connect many clients at the same time stamp or we can

11
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.970
say the same thing, stambaugh for that purpose.

12
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.000
So I you multithreading.

13
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.640
By extending the third class, I am to create an able interface for that.

14
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.120
So trade class includes good and evil interface also, so I went through that.

15
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.960
All these things extending the trade classes.

16
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.160
So let us see what is implementation.

17
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.940
We can see the deep implementation of this.

18
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.200
So the side implementation I'm taking application begins with the server computers running on the server

19
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.710
or the posted photos on your port.

20
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.390
It was your 1500.

21
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.020
You can choose photos in any report for clients to talk with one another.

22
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.080
They will have to run a client called for their systems.

23
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.600
So assume that you are a few things.

24
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.670
What are you going to do?

25
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.640
You can run only the client pool and you can deploy your server on some server.

26
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.650
Or you can say there are many servers available on the internet like Google Cloud servers.

27
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.740
Are there A.W. Servers Europe Web Server also supports this.

28
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.100
So what are you going to do instead of running server on your machine?

29
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.740
You can deploy on the internet that part, which can do what it will be doing.

30
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.470
It will be the thing that's the world class or labor or we security 24 by Isilon.

31
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.100
So you just need to run look like you just entered into in the interface, and I'm considering your

32
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.370
own new command line interface.

33
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.740
In next part, I will tell you how you can create some UI for that simple UI for that purpose.

34
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.360
So what you can do?

35
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.860
You can just run your client.

36
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.280
So for the client was the only new client.

37
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.810
No need to run server.

38
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.300
So server and plan.

39
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.630
What are the different codes?

40
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.370
What is the thing between is it's connecting to the TCP connection to that.

41
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.020
So that's it.

42
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.800
So the work consists of two classes of a class and client and a lot less so I'm I mentioned the name

43
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.110
as different in that all good.

44
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.310
But what is the main thing is client handling and leaving the blank server class consists servers of

45
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.690
which which for plan to join whenever a new client joins its created the trade for that purpose, then

46
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.860
you can use the run method to allocate that server part broadcasting part, each and every client handler

47
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.220
plus.

48
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.930
So when trade begins its education execution, it starts by waiting for clients to send message as soon

49
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.340
as blank disconnected.

50
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:33.530
Our server and client is Valley or Glen, the server, which for the blankness, it's a cleansing message

51
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.450
when clients shared the message.

52
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.350
The message is controlled by silver and move forward and the trade center in the same message function

53
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.170
recently.

54
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.260
First, trade is what we are doing.

55
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.260
Accepting the message once the messages are not ready to move, but to send a message part when job

56
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.560
is to forward the message from the client to another to be meaningless.

57
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.300
But I'm sick.

58
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.990
Say it's Typekit victor.

59
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.100
We can say all we can say, Oh, that's not good, but so what will we do?

60
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.840
Fulda That trade will be converted into object and will be holding up well.

61
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.500
Why we use.

62
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.660
We're at least we can pass that object in the ArrayList and to know that trade ECP connection or we

63
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.950
can TCP TCP back, it will take that part and move forward.

64
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.980
Will that object move forward to that message?

65
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.060
So instead of using bye bye bye, good, what we can do, we can move that object inside frame and object

66
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.950
and choose that message message again.

67
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.180
It's converted into bytecode, but we don't need to convert into bytecode.

68
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.710
We just need to put that object in front of it will go to another.

69
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.180
Let us see what is planted in implementation I'm considering here, do you?

70
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.730
Because I don't want to explain it again.

71
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.390
So enjoy us and learn to use on Java Swing.

72
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.110
So as soon as a new client opens that Java is an application, it's connected to the front end to back

73
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.130
and back and needs to just basically all the similar part like plant.

74
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.700
Whenever it's open, send measured functions will execute and another function in the background to

75
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.070
which server to send a message like even the server is saying successfully the message, then it will

76
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.000
be handled then.

77
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.380
So message functions are there.

78
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.120
Each message is sort of what is prefixed by name by sender to increase message readability and everything.

79
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.660
So it is a client or implementation only.

80
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.260
Supplied.

81
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.460
What is the client doing?

82
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:31.090
Client is only muted first client when the client is added to that server.

83
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.320
Now the client today is accepting message from user so that reusability.

84
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.130
One message is that part is done.

85
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.260
It will push to the server port.

86
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.750
Informally, once this is done, the server will handle the pushing the message.

87
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.810
Similarly, Blank is also waiting an undertaking for another client message of what we can learn to

88
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.020
message so it will waiting for that purpose.

89
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:03.010
Another thing once that messages are pushed to that part, or we can see the front end part and it will

90
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.650
show that it's so waiting and showing the message.

91
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.350
So this is the basic idea of this.

92
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:15.340
In this also, I mentioned some useful parts, like within method activity usernames.

93
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.730
So our direct username, which is basically private method, if you would edit in the name of that person

94
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.380
or client, what are you going to do?

95
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.100
You can publish it on that part, or we can see a private message.

96
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.300
You can do.

97
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:37.370
Then injured, OK, now the main thing is in Europe here, why I'm using injured judokas, if you know

98
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.730
this is only what we can say, my client machine.

99
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.490
But I want to join my friend also.

100
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.940
So these are my will be this look almost any generating.

101
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.510
But I want to create some thing which can be global or we can see port forwarding systems.

102
00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:02.240
So for that purpose, I need one board for auditing my local post or printing development machine can

103
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.640
maybe be connected to securing network behind a firewall to work around access restriction and grant

104
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:09.340
runs.

105
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.590
Small claim process on your machine, which creates private connection panel and your cloud service.

106
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.400
What is doing it in Europe is a cloud service, basically what it is doing.

107
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.720
If I had a new server on my local news, it will copy that part each and every time.

108
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.410
Copying means the continuous copy to the cloud.

109
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:33.710
It will create another link with the port and it will not proceed in that purpose.

110
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.710
So if you have that part, what are you going to do?

111
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:44.190
You can share your IP address or you can say, link your server address with or to your friend to connect

112
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.550
friend on any network.

113
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.310
I'm not saying your local network or consider there are two things when it John and Andrew Sam John

114
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.780
is shipping news in New York and are considering same musical sitting in San Francisco.

115
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.200
Oh, John wants to send a message throughout this process.

116
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.000
Oh, are we going to throw this client through what he can do?

117
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.880
He can create some server party generating.

118
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.780
He can mention in the server part.

119
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:22.430
This is my link throughout the new doc and you can and this is my port address to the SAM what you can

120
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.560
do.

121
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.500
You can create a permanent link on Angel.

122
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:31.640
This is my port and this is my link forever for this Mike Line application function to what he can do.

123
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.440
He can create one client code like this.

124
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:43.940
You can put the local shows there that localized change to that or that IP address within Europe, as

125
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.780
you can see here.

126
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.300
In Park.

127
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.960
Let me zoom this little bit.

128
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.100
This, despite what he can do, he can change these local laws, which sort of I dissolve in Europe

129
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.810
and put no with that vote, no.

130
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:14.940
And in a server implementation part onshore, he has to change everything here or like I told you or

131
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.110
in this part.

132
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.680
These local laws and borders to change, basically.

133
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:26.430
So as I mentioned, the airport, no and each and everything are different like this and policy has

134
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.400
to change basically.

135
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.960
So once this is done, what you can do, you can send that message to the same.

136
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.330
We do sitting, we will sitting in San Francisco.

137
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.410
So this is the function of in Europe, local, those developments that are what is Matthew Angelopoulos

138
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.810
of a domain which remote users can access?

139
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.820
No need to expose your pole sitter pervading, make another network genius.

140
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.900
So it is very simple.

141
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.830
So I will show you how can we can do this so.

142
00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:02.610
Let me go this once you downloaded the new doc from the doc website next for Windows, and I will go

143
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.000
with that.

144
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:03.960
Indeed.

145
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.030
Not easy.

146
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:13.080
Now there are many services available on the Hill and PCB, but we are going with PCB PCB.

147
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:19.770
And what I don't want to do, my board of the local post, as I told you, is 1500.

148
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.760
Let me show you in a server part I mentioned.

149
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.010
No need to change that server part.

150
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.350
I'm going to I'm I'm telling you, no need to change this server part.

151
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.600
I mentioned my board address addresses 1500 in the main method.

152
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.730
This is 1500.

153
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:45.570
So what I can do, I can mention this one thousand five hundred now, and you will take time to run

154
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.590
its web interface.

155
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.020
So this is my web interface, basically.

156
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.460
So you don't doesn't support your dynamic and each and everything you are.

157
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.690
And so what you can do is.

158
00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.680
This place controls.

159
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.840
So it will take time to each and everything.

160
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:15.620
So all in all, we can do these things and you can put your queries and everything here within judo

161
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:22.040
and in Europe, create digits or know what you're going through a tunnel status and each and everything

162
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:26.360
so it will you, you the non-status, and you can put the link here.

163
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.820
So this is all about how we can do this part.

164
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:38.230
But always remember, while creating the injured rock, the boat should not be occupied, all you can

165
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.460
say, it's not running.

166
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.420
You have to change it first and you have to change that part.

167
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.810
So this is all about how we can do this.

168
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:55.170
So now I will do what I can do is I'm going with some.

169
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.240
Let me go with some things.

170
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.580
Which is I'm mentioning here.

171
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.450
We did basically.

172
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.450
Let me show, and you don't.

173
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.810
In all.

174
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:30.760
I will share this to you on like Indie-Rock DCP 1500.

175
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.470
I will fear this.

176
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:35.610
OK, OK, OK.

177
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.290
So this is all about how are you going to do it on this team?

178
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.950
So this is my new application.

179
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:03.420
Let me clear this and let me do this and go back even further than.

180
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.530
So sometimes it is unavailable, but you have to keep trying.

181
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.470
It gives you the proper power.

182
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.610
Of that.

183
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:17.070
And you don't.

184
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.130
E acce.

185
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.280
ECB intelligence.

186
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.580
So it's showing me that all these examples are not working because.

187
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.720
Of all these things.

188
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.500
So this is all you can do with.

189
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.640
OK, so no, my local authority keeps running.

190
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.640
As you can see, my local Lutheran, each and everything is running here.

191
00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.210
So this is my import and this is my you.

192
00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.850
So what I can do, I can copy this part first.

193
00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.080
And added to the tax system with plan with this local host.

194
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.720
And it gives me the world also.

195
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.840
So this is my fault, basically.

196
00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.630
So what I can do.

197
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:30.390
So where is the boat I told you this is my pool tradition before this is all things other.

198
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.830
Oh my, oh.

199
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.560
Before this all is sort of registered in this report.

200
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.330
So let me add in the board.

201
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.470
This number.

202
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:48.800
So don't close that injury park, let me run this over for us, basically for testing purposes, not

203
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:54.980
considering here, but what you can do, you can put that server part in some online sort of what would

204
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.190
you change everything.

205
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.520
Now let me run the client until you.

206
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:09.470
You can say the connection is successful to this in Europe, and if I put who is in command each and

207
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.170
everything, it will give me all the things.

208
00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:12.990
Now what is it?

209
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.290
Sort what is running on my own machine?

210
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.960
But blank can be running on any other machine.

211
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.420
Let me add one more client here, as I told you.

212
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.570
This is Client two and I'm mentioning, you name is Sam.

213
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.150
Sam is also connected to this.

214
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.270
So let me add a more another line.

215
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.260
Whose name is?

216
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.940
James, so there are three more.

217
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:41.560
Let me just please, as I told you, John, Sam James are connected here.

218
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:46.750
So from the James, what I want to do, I want to send Mr. John Legend, John.

219
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.190
So Admiral John messages Hello.

220
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.840
So let's see John King, John Campbell, Brown.

221
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.400
You got the message.

222
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.550
He received the message, but not this.

223
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:07.490
As you can see, this is not running if I am quoting from same message.

224
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.660
Hello.

225
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:14.140
Every one, what you can see, it is broadcasted.

226
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.220
You can see it is broadcasted.

227
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:23.100
And from the server, you can see all the messages, you're also Sam, then each and everything, but

228
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.010
in a private thing, you can not see each and everything.

229
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.350
So this is all about how we can put forward in.

230
00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.590
And I ran this part on the inaugural part also.

231
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:37.710
So in further videos, I'm going to tell you how we can create a Jew, and I will tell you everything

232
00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:38.480
there.

233
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.730
So let us see how we can do.

234
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:47.730
And also just close the injured, OK, you can see sort of what is close connection because I already

235
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:51.750
done with that part and now you can see client is also getting disconnected.

236
00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.990
These also disconnected because I close that in Europe.

237
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.840
So the service is Tottenham.

238
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.990
So this is all about how we can proceed with this.

239
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.850
So that we don't what I'm going to tell you, Oh, I'm going to tell you clear channel.

240
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:10.440
Do you have JavaScript and how we can connect that to any generality in that thing?

241
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.850
And with the simplest, I'm not adding that we've mentoring some private methods also.

242
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.860
So let's see in that part.
