1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:11,260
We already created some GSP files as adamant updates to the end of litigation and everything, but we

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:20,280
need to create some more space for everything to make student content, some display displays as adequate

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,910
and we try to question GSP.

4
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,370
So let us see how we can create that.

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:24,910
But.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,250
So this part of this article shouldn't just be here.

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,840
OK, so let's see student list first, which contain.

8
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:43,640
And student speed, I will call police for naming purposes only if New Jersey.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,550
And I'm mentioning the GSP failure.

10
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,080
It I'm.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,800
Defaulting, I already told you about.

12
00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:03,620
There are some default things, so let me remove this part and let me remove this part of.

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,800
In one line.

14
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,620
So it contents first at a student this.

15
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,870
So let me create at a student, just be here.

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,480
So this is very important.

17
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:26,290
This is you're going to see ads student because it contains all things related, adding the student.

18
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,360
Using GSP.

19
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,900
OK, so what would convince you to see?

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,830
So I'm using the Java as my language.

21
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,150
Let me turn this and.

22
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,510
Two groups.

23
00:01:51,470 --> 00:02:00,560
OK, so this continues, and I understood in detail with by Luis Fonsi, formation is basically all

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,110
U.S. college student concert.

25
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:09,280
So as you can see in the OAS controller, I created a studio instrumental.

26
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:17,440
So it is different in order to determine support, but you can see this is the front end of that concert.

27
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,290
If that message to like 220 is inserted or something that is not inserted, I'm printing this message

28
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:32,910
here to this gate parameter and using so I already told you, I already mentioned the messages.

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,320
Your message to any student at any message to any student is not it.

30
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,360
So I'm printing this.

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,180
Oh, good trade not added, one added for this is the frontier, for the similar thing, I'm going to

32
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,060
create an instruction later.

33
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,260
Or instruction, just be.

34
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,610
Again, similar thing.

35
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,770
You just been so as you can see, we can't we are using just be more than this.

36
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:14,520
Java, but it's Java only because we are writing Java files in three days.

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,840
But you can see it's demand, so we are using a steel mill embedded with Java to add instruction.

38
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,900
Again, the start of an instruction.

39
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,590
And this.

40
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,750
Shows.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,410
With instruction in third.

42
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,990
GSP.

43
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,320
And this adding just instruction with text.

44
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,880
And an instruction in.

45
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:03,000
Which is open to the instruction list only if submitted purely for that purpose, instruction instruction

46
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:09,350
and in order to do that or again, I need to create an instruction disposal.

47
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,840
So these all things are similar.

48
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,260
Let me go with this at Christian Christian speak.

49
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,820
Deciding the question.

50
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,480
Well, we are done with adding part, adding Jewish people, so some things are determining which contents

51
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:06,310
basically exempt GSP, the desert Jewish people already playing in the desert and some day days before

52
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,490
that.

53
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,440
So let me create one exam just before examination fronted.

54
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,970
You speak.

55
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,780
It's him.

56
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:18,600
Much.

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,290
OK.

58
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:40,850
It is the.

59
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,030
We are done with our project now.

60
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:49,460
So let us deploy this for the different purposes and deployed end tried already, so let me redeploy

61
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:49,910
it again.

62
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,300
What I'm going to do is I'm going to play here, Clinton will host.

63
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:04,010
We close this part, so before this, you should always check all the libraries are like ordinarily

64
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,170
do see 14 for the database connection.

65
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:12,610
Sometimes I also made a mistake because I never added some displays, so it will throw the nil point

66
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,420
reception area.

67
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,110
So now over will be successful.

68
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:17,990
No running over.

69
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,300
So as.

70
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,080
You can see.

71
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:31,820
Well, Glasby server is now deployed with this on things in milliseconds, so it doesn't go to the Chrome

72
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,780
browser.

73
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,190
And you can see this part is done already.

74
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,750
No.

75
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,890
First, let's go to the logging part.

76
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:48,090
And if I am using Root or something here, it will bring me the error basically invalid username and

77
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:48,580
password.

78
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:56,130
So for this, I know the password is admin, so there's no other admin panel.

79
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,420
Let me add one student aid or object.

80
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,300
You can go to the back panel and then check on it.

81
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,640
Let me add a student here first.

82
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:13,700
Let me add my name as John Ujiri's Jr. one zero one Asked what it is and mentioning simple.

83
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,990
One two three four.

84
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,470
The student leader let me go to the home.

85
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,770
You can either object an instruction or you can see there is no instruction manual.

86
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,150
Let me add one instruction.

87
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,140
Always be ethical.

88
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,600
All right.

89
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,810
Then I want to add one more.

90
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,420
Answer.

91
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,710
On Christians.

92
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,330
That is the moment, if I were to add a student again, you can see this is done.

93
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,020
You can go to a black student or you can delete that student also.

94
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,950
And remember, this is starting from zero.

95
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:08,300
So you can implement it already where you are pushing that on the code or you can see you can always

96
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,580
be taken, answer all questions you can.

97
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,180
And little student.

98
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,780
Let me add a question here, first question is.

99
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,900
Java is.

100
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,340
Dot dot, dot dot.

101
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,940
A higher level language.

102
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,040
I can add some simple question.

103
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,030
Just be means.

104
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:56,850
Look mirrored Java, so pages just two options, basically Java server pages, but one option.

105
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,440
Jake Query.

106
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,910
Jake Assuages.

107
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,930
The ocean is.

108
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,000
None correct option.

109
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,620
We know if it was done.

110
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,900
Why the issue in question is not, are you OK?

111
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,050
So as you can see, we have to mention something here.

112
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,050
Always.

113
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,050
OK.

114
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,690
So let me add this book.

115
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,760
If you go to this and the nation is successful, you've done.

116
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,750
You can see.

117
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,630
There are too many values inside a school excursion, so I'm getting a skewed exception.

118
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,500
Let's check that.

119
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:52,940
First.

120
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,530
What is the explanation that I'm getting here is?

121
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,910
Christians, the.

122
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,140
Do you?

123
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,550
Scripture exemption at 31 and.

124
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,370
OK.

125
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:23,740
Let me.

126
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,670
Remove this because.

127
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,030
And am going to stick.

128
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,260
Deploying the again.

129
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,060
None.

130
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,870
So now we are done with this part.

131
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,010
So.

132
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,820
Hmm.

133
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,520
Let me check first.

134
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,150
Right.

135
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,870
She's doing what she thought doing that would be.

136
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,410
OK.

137
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,200
So it is showing me you are providing some more values less than this because.

138
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,040
So and what we have in question, people is only.

139
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,480
Six questions, OK.

140
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,120
So.

141
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,510
We are adding some more extra things.

142
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,190
Rations and food options with the correct option, because.

143
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,640
We.

144
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,540
So let me do this for you and what is 48?

145
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,150
Let me run this again.

146
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,670
So you may find some errors here on some.

147
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,640
Now you can see Christian in Israel.

148
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,580
If you go to the homepage and you can add an application can see on television and we go back to the

149
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,900
canon.

150
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:14,670
And you can create a model seamlessly on a four day one zero one one two three four a password for the

151
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,050
student.

152
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,950
I'm going to go page again.

153
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,120
And then it will be easy.

154
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,390
So once you exit and going to student page, you know?

155
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,250
He's basically student in admitted.

156
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,460
Nobody was already in jail, one zero one password is one two three four.

157
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,030
Let me know in this, so if your student instruction, Jesse.

158
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,160
He's in London.

159
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,600
OK, we are remaining with student instruction, guys.

160
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,680
Let me create this is as fast as possible.

161
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:02,790
Student instruction, yes, we are remaining with one dispatcher told Do Student gives me instruction

162
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:08,280
to use speak because it should show the force through student instruction to use.

163
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,620
Looking Chick.

164
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,220
It's done.

165
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,560
And broke those.

166
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,120
OK, I will click finish.

167
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,700
I told you, like there are some errors when deploying this.

168
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,810
Remember, you have to check each and every team before deploying.

169
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,060
So as I told you, I'm remaining with this.

170
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,670
Let's just clear this.

171
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,710
So this is very simple GSP.

172
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,790
And just check again, one, two, three, four million.

173
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,150
Oh, it is not really.

174
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,050
OK.

175
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,880
As I just screamed, let me be deployed again, our server.

176
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:21,220
So sometimes it takes time to deploy it, all things will go fast in this.

177
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,390
So let me go to the student blogging page.

178
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,200
Given one.

179
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,540
One, two, three, four villages and logging.

180
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,480
Student instructions.

181
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,280
OK, the thing is that I made some errors.

182
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,190
Let me remove this first.

183
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,240
Yes.

184
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:54,580
What?

185
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:02,570
I made some errors is a file name is this let me copy this because I won't include this findings service.

186
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,730
Then.

187
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,030
Let me do this.

188
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,550
Just.

189
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,140
Mitch?

190
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,580
The you this despite.

191
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,770
So as I told you, you have to always remember weird, all finds you mention.

192
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,430
And let me really apply myself in.

193
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,860
I mean, look this.

194
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:35,580
We learn.

195
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,390
Now you can see welcome, John, always vertical our instructions.

196
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,430
If I could start based here.

197
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:52,910
You can or you can see your options on and before, you know, if I put Java solid business.

198
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,600
Some.

199
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,510
Questions is wrong answers.

200
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,120
John, you the result is pending.

201
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,750
So this is all about how we created our Aegis and Student-Run.

202
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,330
So this is very simple.

203
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,010
If I go to again.

204
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,440
And if I'm going to one, two, three four.

205
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:22,030
Start inside, I'm going to break and starting this security again, if I put these security is going

206
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,100
to be this and wrong answer.

207
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,610
This correct answer is zero and spending the holidays.

208
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,380
So this is a very simple thing.

209
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,310
You can add a more and more questions here, but I certainly.
