00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,140
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:10,140
So as far as I can see that that we have successfully created the flame and inside of it, we have called

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,780
two function known images and initiated the.

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:26,080
So after these do function, now we have to create a new function called Public Void Locator Plus.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,180
So we have to locate the apple and we have to set some positions for that apple.

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,380
So that are the coordinates of the Apple are dedicated for this project.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:48,190
So initializing this function and inside this function, we are going to initialize an integer variable

8
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,190
which is going to be in.

9
00:00:52,310 --> 00:01:00,140
A random mathematical expression and images called using math to talk to random.

10
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:10,280
So we have called the random function outside which we have to give this straight and call random positions.

11
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,960
So we have to set a random position for the app.

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,520
It is not fixed in every start.

13
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:24,890
Like, if we start again again and then go and then start the position of the Apple changes every time.

14
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,780
So this is created for the Axworthy new and similar name.

15
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,050
They have to create this for the Y coordinate.

16
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,950
So Apple X is R and their large size.

17
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:47,060
So the dart size are multiplied by their dot size.

18
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:56,780
So we have this in our suggestion and we have to create a similar thing for the Y coordinate also.

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,810
So Apple has a specific X coordinate on a specific Y coordinate.

20
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:12,640
So we have successfully created the position of the Apple method to help this locate Apple variable.

21
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:21,350
So we haven't done and we have to not to declare this again, it is already declared.

22
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,090
So I guess that it is gone.

23
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,450
So let me give a quick idea about what this metadata random is doing.

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:39,050
So common thing is down to explain the random function calls are numbered between zero and one, any

25
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,920
random number between zero and one.

26
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,140
It could be like 0.1 0.2, 0.5 0.6.

27
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,700
So the number is going to be between zero and one.

28
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,380
So suppose the number that is called randomly zero point six.

29
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,470
So we have to set it like 0.6 into the DOT says.

30
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,240
Let us take it to 20.

31
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:10,490
So next, guarding it is going to be zero point six and don't do anything and which will end it as.

32
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:22,790
Well, and then that 12 minute past here in this and again in 220 is going to be 09:48 is going to be

33
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,250
120, so 120 is inside the frame of the game.

34
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,560
We have three hundred in the X8 and 300 you, I will say.

35
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,720
So they have to set this random function in this manner that this needs.

36
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,350
If goes outside the three hundred one e that in white or X, the game is over.

37
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,880
So we have successfully created the locate upper.

38
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,460
Now let us call this looking at the ball inside the is in the game.

39
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,530
So calling this look apple.

40
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,280
The void function is to recall her.

41
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,230
We have called it now ventilating the it up function.

42
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:18,360
Now we have to check that will check that the Apple is eaten by the snake or not.

43
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:25,530
And if the snake is though apple, we have to increase the size and if not, then we have to do nothing.

44
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:36,960
So similarly, creating a void function for checking that Apple public void checkup would.

45
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,910
Similarly, using camel case for the function name.

46
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,400
And yes.

47
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,650
So we have created a check up on function inside which we are going to call a conditional operator if.

48
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:06,150
If not coordinated of exit zero and nine, which is equal to Apple Apotex Coordinate, then.

49
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,140
Bollocks.

50
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,590
And similarly for the Vivan.

51
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,980
So if the Y coordinate is.

52
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,950
Same may have to go up in this.

53
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:32,520
The whole but inside the bracket and attaching it with her and operator.

54
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,070
Replacing the ActionScript why?

55
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:46,570
So if the X and Y coordinate are same as the Snake's X and Y continue, then we have to increase the

56
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,040
size of the snake.

57
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:54,460
And if that coordinates becomes same, we have to increase that, not by one.

58
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,110
This new note?

59
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,730
Let me comment this out.

60
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,070
Like this, they note.

61
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:13,890
After this, I am going to dance is going to be not plus one notch size isn't fazed by one, like initially

62
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,000
the Darksiders three and I'll spare the snakes, eat the apple.

63
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:26,160
The dark side increases by one after which we have to call again to locate Apple, like if they're not

64
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,200
saints, is increased by one.

65
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:36,100
We have again gone the apple, so the Apple appears again after checking that police eaten my destiny.

66
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,350
So we have successfully created the Apple section like we have created a look at that point and check

67
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,260
whether the apple is eaten by the snake or not.

68
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,720
Now we have to set a timer.

69
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:57,970
Like if the snake is starting to move, so if the snake started moving, so if the snake hits the wall,

70
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,440
then the game is over.

71
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,460
So there is a fixed in time like the snake is not moving for the rest of our lives.

72
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,140
There is a time of like four seconds, five seconds or something like that.

73
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:17,920
So we have to set a timer until when if they do not perform any keyboard actions, then the game will

74
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,830
be automatically more like the snake will hand down.

75
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,750
And the game will over over.

76
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,750
So the time is like this the timer we have call new timer and insiders.

77
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,740
We have fast operator like 140 milliseconds of time you can set any time you wish.

78
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,770
I'm calling this operator and then calling this timer when the game starts.

79
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:51,720
We have to declare that timer inside the bone glass and for implementing that timer, we have to implement

80
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,400
the action.

81
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:59,100
Listen to this more glass and this action listener is under that NWT event.

82
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,150
So we have covered that timer thing.

83
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:10,370
Now the next thing, we are going to cover Oak Ridge, so that bone is showing some IRA that Diebold

84
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,350
must implement that in an abstract and mental action listener.

85
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:23,280
So we have to inherit this matter so far, which we have to call override function, like if you on

86
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,610
the basis of our abstract method cannot be called without the override function.

87
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,060
So often this.

88
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,610
If Endgame, we have to check up.

89
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,740
So we will get it in game function first.

90
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,050
Like, I am randomly handing this.

91
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,600
We will see this.

92
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,120
So I hope not, and yes.

93
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:56,770
So the border that is removed, we have added an abstract class for this matter, and now we will move

94
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,310
forward.

95
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:07,510
So after covering all the apple and the timer writing, now we will switch to drawing the graphics inside

96
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,200
the frame.

97
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:17,850
So creating a function called public wide draw graphics G.

98
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:36,430
So importing this as on human graphics and if condition says Endgame, like if Endgame is true, if

99
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:42,700
we do not write anything, just a variable incentive, then that says that if.

100
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,240
Now in is showing it.

101
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:57,760
So let me first import this, even the Boolean variable private Boolean Indian, so endgame had an alternative

102
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,290
if the game is on.

103
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,620
So if the game is on is true, then we are going to run the graphics if in-game.

104
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:14,320
This denotes that if individual points are this, if I am going to add some conditions that we, if

105
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:22,660
the endgame is true, we have to draw that image and insert the argument section.

106
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,570
We are going to set it as a full.

107
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,540
So.

108
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:40,460
And in the X-ray, we are going to read it as a black stand up alone Apple X Apple II.

109
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,250
And in the observer side, we are going to earn this, that this Cuba.

110
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,360
Yes.

111
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,010
So if Endgame is true, then this is going to be the case.

112
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:02,350
And if this is going to be the case, then we have to wait up for low for the North.

113
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:13,260
So the graphic will be like the follow up says that if the snake French their are, then increase the

114
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:23,450
size of the snake legs, move the snake forward and make it to reach the North Shore, make it to their

115
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,110
dog and eat it.

116
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:33,840
So that in zero g dry range hen we have to go ahead and attaching with the hand, we have the wrong

117
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,230
dog.

118
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:46,620
So if the hen then is a dog, if there is little we have learn the hen, I know it is going to be simply

119
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,100
the dog.

120
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,820
So this is how the graphics are going to be and I give the snake finds the dog the size will increase

121
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,720
or otherwise the head will remain the same.

122
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,530
We have to do this by using that toolkit function, by getting the default toolkit.

123
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:13,080
And this toolkit is the Damasio inevitably so thanking you for giving such amazing toolkit.

124
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:19,950
So this is going to be the graphics of the game if the game is true, like in-game is true.

125
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,630
If this is true in all, we can say that if one.

126
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,450
So if one, then this is going to be happen.

127
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,500
And if zero like it false, then the game is going to be over.

128
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,700
So we have to create a function for game over.

129
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:44,310
Also now, in order to create the game over function, we have to recall that what are the conditions

130
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,830
that makes the game to be opened?

131
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:53,010
So the game could be over if the snake hits the obstacles and obstacles?

132
00:12:53,010 --> 00:13:00,090
Are that force out of the wall, like on the flame and the snake fixes itself.

133
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,970
So there are these possibilities which which will make the game to be overrun.

134
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,980
So inside this game over function, we are going to learn that things and then see what happens.

135
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:22,800
So let me show you that's what this game over function is responsible for, like vision, though it

136
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,270
is being responsible for.

137
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,240
So that game over is responsible for this thing like this window will open.

138
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,140
If that's the function which we are making now will be gone.

139
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:42,180
So that is a game over 410 in the middle of the frame and everything is black outside.

140
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,620
So let's try to write inside this.

141
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:55,620
Like firstly, we have to write a string message which is going to display a frame like a game over

142
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,100
text.

143
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,530
Game over.

144
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,660
So the frame is going to this play game over.

145
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,420
Everything is slow.

146
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,030
So, yes, the game over.

147
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:17,060
No, so that we have created the mission, which is going to be this play in the game over a window.

148
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,850
Now let us move forward.
