00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,370
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:10,500
So in this series of learning, making projects in Java today, we are going to make a new project in

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,730
code Java.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,870
So on your screens, you are seeing a layout of this application.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,130
Basically, this is the interface of the application.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,570
We are going to me.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,830
So this application is headed as must make of the three name.

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,170
So I hope by listening to the title, you must have.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,290
Yes.

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:44,170
Must have built a references about what we are going to make today.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,490
So this is basically a game made in Java code in this game.

12
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:57,730
We have to treat this nie and make it grow longer and longer.

13
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:03,100
The game continues until you're free to bust me without hitting.

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,240
And now I'm second.

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,530
So let me give a quick introduction about the application.

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,630
We are going to make today.

17
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,500
So in this, we have a player support.

18
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,810
The user is the player.

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,010
I'm going to play this game in his or her next stop.

20
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:29,620
So the player is going to control our dart us grid or any object like in this, we have Apple.

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,720
Yes, this is that Apple from which we are going to create destiny.

22
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:44,650
So this object is inside this border plain and we have to treat this 3.8 snare with this.

23
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:55,230
Now then the snake will move forward, and if this object reaches an apple, it will leave a trail behind,

24
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:01,650
like if the snake will eat this apple, more dawn will be added to the body of snake.

25
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,060
And later, this object will shift to any other place in the flame.

26
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,870
So we are going to obey this main window.

27
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:22,710
And once that snake hits any obstacle like the wall is an obstacle, that snake itself is an obstacle

28
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,030
here.

29
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:32,460
So when the snake hits this, this, this or this side window or it sells, then the pop up will appear

30
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,840
saying that the game is over in another common scheme.

31
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,150
A snake has a specific length.

32
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:47,550
So there is a moving tail, a fixed number of units of a drum head like suppose there are three units.

33
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:56,490
And the last part is that they saw after hitting this apple, this naked little our tail behind its

34
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:02,670
head, and it will continue until the game is continued and not over.

35
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,770
The player loses.

36
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,260
And the game is over.

37
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,580
So this pop up will appear, then the obstacle is greater.

38
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,410
And the game is finished.

39
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,830
So I hope you understood this game.

40
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,560
If you are a 90s kid, you must have played this game in your keypad phones.

41
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,630
And by making this game, will it make you nostalgic about playing this game in your head in your childhood?

42
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,770
So let's get a quick idea about what are the specifications of this project?

43
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,480
We are going to make today.

44
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:48,000
So talking about the specifications of the project, as I already told you, there will be a player

45
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,980
which will control their door with the help of is our keyboard.

46
00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:01,790
So your keyboard has four navigation buttons up arrow down, arrow left and right now.

47
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:10,400
So the player will control the snake with the help of these four buttons only so that dot square object,

48
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:17,730
then suppose that we have an app on her is inside the border plain and we have to make the snake with

49
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:23,310
the help of our keyboard so that appeler objects inside the frame.

50
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,330
So as the snake moves forward, it leaves a trail behind resembling a moving snake.

51
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:38,310
Basically, there are images with the snake this consist of, but it will look like there is a moving

52
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,340
snake and you think the apple and blowing?

53
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:49,500
But no, we are just adding images after the bin and again and again until the game is not over.

54
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,800
The player loses when the snake advancing to the screen border obstacle on itself.

55
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,560
So if the snake hits the screen border and if like, suppose?

56
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:08,870
That's Nick Hicks, this border screen border audit says then the game will over.

57
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,730
So everybody is of hope willing to make this project on their own.

58
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:27,550
So before starting to make how this project is, let's get a quick idea about what are the concepts

59
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,960
we are going to learn by making this application.

60
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,430
So what will you learn heading off this?

61
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:43,750
So before making any project, you must wonder what we are going to learn by making this project?

62
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:51,700
What are the concepts that I will gain in my mind after making the project, which I am going to start?

63
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,800
So you are not wrong?

64
00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:00,910
We must think that what actually is this project actually going to help me to?

65
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,090
Not to my knowledge in Java or any other language in which a project is going to be made.

66
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:15,630
So let us start the concept, which we are going to learn in the project.

67
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,180
So the first point is object oriented programming in Java.

68
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,190
So what is object oriented programming in Java?

69
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:35,210
So basically, Oops in Java organizes a program around the various objects and many different interfaces.

70
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:43,070
And these concepts aim to implement some Real-World entities in the program.

71
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:54,670
Ahead of having object oriented programming in real entities, there are also many features of ops in

72
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,180
Java.

73
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:03,970
We are going to use in this project like inheritance hiding polymorphism and next cetera in the programming

74
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,460
section, which you will see later.

75
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:14,220
Apart from object oriented programming, what are the other factors we are going to learn by making

76
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,880
this project?

77
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:23,990
So after the completion of this project, you will be able to make an amazing application using just

78
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:30,570
gorge availabilities, not any complex libraries, but just simply for Java libraries.

79
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:41,260
The snake Ofelia freed the snake game is built using cadaver AWP and strong libraries and packages,

80
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,660
so the app is built above NWT and answering only.

81
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:56,540
Let us take a quick look at what it would be answering are inevitably answering the news to develop

82
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:04,690
Windows based applications in Java and WD is an abstract Windows toolkit that provides radius component

83
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:11,620
classes like Enable, Button Text, et cetera, social window components on the screen.

84
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:20,300
All the classes on the part of Java Dot WP package, which we will see in the programs section later.

85
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:29,020
On the other hand, swing is the part of Java foundational classes that is based on the top of AWP and

86
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,730
written entirely in Java.

87
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:37,800
Let's suppose that it is interference of any other language, then we have to learn that proposal.

88
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,740
But no, that's not the.

89
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:47,470
The project is just making Java and the library, which we are going to use, are also made in Java

90
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:47,920
only.

91
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:56,910
So while talking about the pulse of learning how to make this project, there is a main feature which

92
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,520
I'm going to tell you about now.

93
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,560
So we are going to make this game from scratch like we have to write the code, make that project from

94
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:17,220
the beginning in our compilers and write each function component classes methods one by one with explaining

95
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,170
what this party is doing and what that part is doing and everything.

96
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,670
We are not going to leave a single point while making this project.

97
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,050
And this is the main part of learning this project.

98
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,150
So building such an interesting game of your own from scratch?

99
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,190
Yes, you are hurting me, right?

100
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,790
This interesting game we are going to make from scratch.

101
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,560
Also, the classes and objects are the main part of object oriented programming in Java.

102
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,090
When that is all that is nothing without classes an object.

103
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:02,520
So yes, apart from all the things that classes and objects are also being used while making this project.

104
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:09,600
So I hope you all are excited to start making this project with your own.

105
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:20,180
So come on, let's switch into the coding section and start their coding class and learn how to make

106
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,170
function components, classes, libraries and package with our own.

107
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,140
See you in the next week.
