WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:09.470
So in the previous part, what we learned is about creating constructeur and creating new methods.

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.200
We created general department.

3
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.570
Now.

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.570
Let us see what we are going to move for for this.

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.740
I'm going to explain.

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.140
How will we can create random password here to generate?

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.510
Random password.

8
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.790
Mr.

9
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.040
I'm going to put your name as like there.

10
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.870
Then again, private.

11
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.370
Or I'm considering your string only.

12
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.640
General.

13
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.600
Password.

14
00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:02.780
No, what I'm going to do, I'm going to put here some badminton integer length because I want to specify

15
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.760
the length of that password.

16
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.900
Lent.

17
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.190
Then I will create one exciting material with this brand.

18
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.480
So if you know there is one in Java you build, there is a class called random, which I already in

19
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.470
it, it will be helpful to, um, create some random thing in Central Java.

20
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.320
You can print any random number using this, or you can generate any random string.

21
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.280
So first, I'm going to put your string.

22
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.300
Capital collectors can be.

23
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.650
Capital, correct, because we want to create some sort of capital characters here.

24
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.900
So it was their capital, it the ABC like that.

25
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.750
So actually, we are done with that.

26
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.410
Let us know.

27
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.500
We will put similarly small letters.

28
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:20.770
So I'm placing your control just controlled would copy that part and small characters.

29
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.640
And I'm going to get Altman back.

30
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.960
So we are done with moderators.

31
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.350
No, I want to put numbers because there are no such name passwords or numbers.

32
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.630
Is equal to.

33
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.920
Zero, two, nine.

34
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.780
Now, some symbols.

35
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.210
So what I'm doing, I'm creating some six, as you can see of the strings like these are strings only

36
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.110
for symbolic capital letters, characters, small characters, it's on the symbols and considering all

37
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.680
the symbols.

38
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.710
Like extermination, added hashtag, then the other symbol for a saint and symbol.

39
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.850
And again, Christian, my question mark is on Sylvia and Mark.

40
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.330
Then.

41
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:44.870
Value values, basically just what is the um, what we can say is index of over this.

42
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.670
So what would we be considering here is all capital characters, plus all small characters.

43
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.180
I mean, it's more characters.

44
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.140
Smolder, birds.

45
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.110
Plus numbers, plus symbols.

46
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.140
So we are done with what is this index of over?

47
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.710
It will include capital small groups and what somewhat these are done for the system default passwords.

48
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.780
These four system default password.

49
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.010
No, let's move it further how we can then add some random.

50
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.020
Well, first create string for password.

51
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.080
Would you return to the nun because your statement is a nun and it will appear in some password here

52
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:47.020
then or for use for loop integer I instant variable again to no big, less length lent, I use the length.

53
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.060
I looked plus simple for no.

54
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.720
Use this password is equal to password.

55
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.080
What it will do, it will put values correctness at.

56
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.230
Index.

57
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.760
Then are you remember what is the reason for that random matter?

58
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.610
It will choose any random thing from that on the 6th and it will put incentives.

59
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.450
So random dot next.

60
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.370
Next thing because for this, I, it will choose next and then.

61
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.340
Or in this next scene, values Dot.

62
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.300
Lent, because it will stop at that length, but also.

63
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.840
And some Blues return.

64
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.690
Password.

65
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:55.080
So what will we do the significance of this is this will take this from.

66
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:05.200
These this all six known password, we are saying with password, plus what is an act that includes

67
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.800
character act, correct, which character it does warm random Nixon.

68
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.380
It will choose random from this.

69
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.730
Also, there ain't no addition of that password values document will that it will put that password.

70
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:27.030
So no, I'm not giving the fixed length for this, but for that purpose, you will choose the symbol

71
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.550
linked here.

72
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.480
As I mentioned you, we will see in the next part.

73
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.680
So this is for the random password generating random password.

74
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.850
Now I want to create those spaces.

75
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.980
We just change password mental change password method.

76
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.230
Now in change password method, I want to take it to public now.

77
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.870
Why will you tell that it should be public?

78
00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.690
You are all creating their private part and this is only public life.

79
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.500
So change passwords for user, not for the system user will change their password again.

80
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.320
I'm going to use some private things here, but it should be public for the user.

81
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.710
A significant source said Password.

82
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:23.460
Again, this is when you to the white student Typekit because it will return nothing.

83
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.600
It will just print.

84
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.070
No, no, I want to create some loop here.

85
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:37.610
The thing is before, like Sail said, where, you know, do we want to choose or change your password

86
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.630
and press y?

87
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.640
And in some little like that, I want to create your condition boolean flag.

88
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.890
Is equal to falls.

89
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.620
Similarly, we created for that State Department, similarly for this also.

90
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.120
Then, Lulu, you're the value system.

91
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.820
Lord $0.9.

92
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.300
Do you want to?

93
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.020
Change your password.

94
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.530
That part, why slash and why slash and.

95
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:22.250
Slash and.

96
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.130
So we will ask for use it now.

97
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.760
Let's see if we can get.

98
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:37.630
Joycelyn, I'm creating character, you remember these these are looking for that department, it isn't

99
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.460
the lamb greeting for the character that Joyce is equal to is not.

100
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:50.370
Next, for the character, it's for that scandal after scandal is not next.

101
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.120
What it will look, if you would be yes or something like that, then it will return some error to avoid

102
00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:58.630
editor.

103
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.490
What I can do.

104
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.770
This is the first character, so what I can do is it's not an extreme, not character.

105
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.640
At Zero, you wrote in this, you wrote in this in.

106
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.780
We all know that edit transformed zoodles character starts out start from zero character.

107
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.450
That zero.

108
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.920
Then if.

109
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.110
Choice choice is equal to is equal.

110
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.760
Why?

111
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.570
Or I can see if choice.

112
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.520
Is equal pay is equal to smaller what?

113
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.940
Organization, I just put on the condition you.

114
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.020
Smallwood.

115
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.340
What it will be do is it's one flag is true.

116
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.920
It will stop that, but will do well.

117
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.440
So I'm just putting flags equal to two here.

118
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:04.200
inter-Korean law, so it shouldn't be asked for current password, also, if it will not match it will

119
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:10.050
do the a new password and all things not so in the current password.

120
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:31.490
So this is one of the what we can say is most biggest part of our project, said Password.

121
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.310
Then string.

122
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.460
I'm going to create some temporary variable.

123
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.600
To assign that and bring.

124
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.050
That part would be next.

125
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:48.100
What do they use it?

126
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.310
Again, if if it's equal to that password.

127
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.430
They not so.

128
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.320
Yes, not equals.

129
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.860
This not password.

130
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.360
And it will be us.

131
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.770
It will ask about new bus system.

132
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.650
Not overnight, but in Berlin.

133
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.420
And new.

134
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.250
Password.

135
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.850
And once this is entered.

136
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.080
What it can do is this not.

137
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.220
Password, it will just append to this.

138
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.520
It's not next.

139
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.380
It will upend that, but.

140
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:44.170
And it will bring in CNN's Don Riddell in.

141
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.020
Password.

142
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.440
Changed.

143
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:51.900
The 50.

144
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.000
We change the password successfully, password change.

145
00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:05.960
Now, if password is wrong, if your password is wrong, this is wrong.

146
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.170
So an audit will be put.

147
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:15.130
Incorrect, but it's not I'm not pretending.

148
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:16.970
Incorrect.

149
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.570
Fast forward.

150
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:33.580
Now, if what if the choice is not this or that purpose, I'm going to create another elseif.

151
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:40.250
You know that LC is another in the elusive letter that I will create.

152
00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:41.960
You're also.

153
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.620
I didn't know that.

154
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:56.070
OK, OK, what else?

155
00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.870
It will should start from your wounds.

156
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.040
ElseIf.

157
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.680
Choice.

158
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.010
Is ecological to.

159
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.130
And order.

160
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.750
Chinese.

161
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.340
Is equal pay is equal to and small in.

162
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.480
Will just flag is equal to.

163
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:30.030
Through.

164
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.580
Removed from that new park.

165
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:39.110
And it will be seen not outdoors, but in Berlin.

166
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.210
Password.

167
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.270
Can.

168
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:49.960
Option.

169
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.680
Cancelled.

170
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:57.550
Let's it.

171
00:13:59.120 --> 00:13:59.660
No.

172
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.950
I will create some defaulting here like else.

173
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:12.500
And our esteemed thought, oh, no doubt retelling.

174
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.610
Like inter-religious or something.

175
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:28.530
And after this, I will and violence with similar flag.

176
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:37.360
And that now we are done with our third person, whether this is the biggest part, as you know, in

177
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:37.660
this.

178
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.220
So what I do this.

179
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.740
I created here.

180
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.620
Password matter.

181
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:51.370
Public void said password Boolean flag is equal to faults with the do my loop.

182
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.700
I first would do that.

183
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.340
We want to change your password, yes or no.

184
00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.160
Then I will enter from the user.

185
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.230
I will ask for you this layout and if user presses why?

186
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.910
It will change their password.

187
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:16.400
But before that, it will ask what a current password, if their current password matches with that

188
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.650
old passport like you are putting it, will be the new password.

189
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.750
If not, it will do the incorrect.

190
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:30.260
And if you are pressing anybody in, then it will that option we began soon or else if you're putting

191
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.530
some different like why other than wild and or something?

192
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:39.210
It will ask for an entomologist and then I'm executing that existing data.

193
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:46.250
So similarly for that, I'm going to create some suitable mailbox capacity then for alternate email,

194
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.520
then displaying the information of the user, then store the file and every method.

195
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.780
So that's it.
