WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.670
Over Project East Java event management system.

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.920
So for the event management, like registration and an event then payment, we are going to build one

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.240
Java application.

4
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.700
For even the management.

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.740
So here we are going to use GBC, which is basically Java database connection, Java servlet server

6
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.370
deployment.

7
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.040
To create a Web application out of this platform, what event management system?

8
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.420
So let us see how we can proceed with our project.

9
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.800
So.

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.740
What is the event management system?

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.760
So we want to deploy Baobab using Java for event registration.

12
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:59.010
So for this scenario, I'm considering university level events, the events which are in university.

13
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:08.860
To deploy the Web app for event management with the help of Java Servlet, so states of our development

14
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.130
site.

15
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.380
First, these projects are done, which is we are going to basically set up our project in it.

16
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.100
Then.

17
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.380
Understanding different tools, which we are going to use a little bit understanding, then basics of

18
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.180
databases.

19
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.350
We can handle the database according to that.

20
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.120
First step is making connections with Java servlet and connection.

21
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.450
And after the deployment and debugging of our project.

22
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.700
So we are going to build event management system.

23
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.260
And we are going to develop their best using Java for event registration at new level elements with

24
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.280
the help of Java, so.

25
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.840
So this is our basic aim or main aim for Java.

26
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.290
So it.

27
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.410
So what is the application requiring, so are we going to waive application requirements?

28
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.780
A program to display Web content like we want to display some Web content to the Java program.

29
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.710
So you should have the basic knowledge about Java, who do Java languages like methods, classes, three

30
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.270
different methods so we can use ultimate order and everything and some basic concepts of estriol.

31
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.270
So a school is basic language used in database for create involves inserting data.

32
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.450
So we are going to use a school in Java program to perform all database actions.

33
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.180
You should know a little bit about a streamlined services for the front end because we are going to

34
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.890
develop a web app with the help of this only let the front end, but we are going to develop flew back

35
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.830
in with the Java, like adding the data to the database and feeding that data from the database.

36
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:03.390
Then the take log in, and we not even get so I'm considering here two scenarios what we can say to

37
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.490
use case for this application.

38
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.780
One is administrator.

39
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.190
So for the administrator, the actions are like an event or to handle that event, then change their

40
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.000
leaders everything.

41
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.330
But for the guest, they should see the log in and sign up with that.

42
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.720
They should find that particular event and then register for that event using payment.

43
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.990
I'm not going to bring our full amendment or late payment gateways or something.

44
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.990
I'm just urging the small demonstration for that.

45
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.680
For admin, you should do administrative actions like adamant full admin control over there, and they

46
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:48.020
should see all the relevant details registered register all things for the gifts they should will find

47
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.300
the instruction and payment.

48
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:57.970
So this is the basic application requirements before that you shouldn't requires that we all do is required.

49
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.250
So we basically need Java Development Kit here.

50
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.810
I'm going to use Java Development one point eight JDK one wondered why I'm using Java 1.8 because of

51
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.040
the server, which we are going to use or deploy is localhost and basically to demonstrate everything.

52
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.740
But it is glass server I'm going to use.

53
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.930
So let's use server supports one pointed universal one point eight basically, for that only then I'd

54
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.490
NetBeans.

55
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.440
I'm going to use your Apache named Vince.

56
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:36.860
Additionally, with JDK, you should you require hemingses, Java Library or you can find on the Internet

57
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.890
Java Library.

58
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:45.200
It is popular library for a skill and a skill statement in Java, then Java e interpreter version it.

59
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.090
We are going to deploy here.

60
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.300
Oracle Database Automation Database.

61
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.130
I'm going to use Oracle Database.

62
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.060
Then blast this server or complex, remember in Bomb-grade server, you can change the world.

63
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.940
Of that issue is pretty bizarre.

64
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.630
But in the last feature where you cannot change the board.

65
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.060
So do you remember it shouldn't be a board for Blacks officer, but he's always getting in for those

66
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.530
scenarios.

67
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.120
I'm going to resolve all the issues with Glass, with Silver Lake.

68
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.620
There are some board misconfiguration also that, so you have to consider that.

69
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:25.170
But before that, Tom could supports only job evil agency when you know, so it is very old school or

70
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.240
enterprise edition, and it does not support gerekiyor so far.

71
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:35.950
The minimal condition you should use plastic silver Oracle database Java even to generate native inside

72
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:42.550
and Judy, given these are the requirements, so we will further proceed with how we can set up our.

73
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.200
Project opportunity means.

74
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.920
So now we are in opportunity, once you install a budget, it will point eight and is currently a long

75
00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.620
term stability warrant here, so you can see everything you are.

76
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.280
So first of all, this is this should be blank.

77
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.740
There will not be any project here to go to file create new project.

78
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.060
You can see new project option.

79
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.650
You create new project.

80
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.750
So it will ask for different scenarios like you are.

81
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.420
Also, I will increase this option.

82
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:28.330
You can see here or different options in Brazil and so on, I mean, the basic libraries inside Java,

83
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:34.300
you can perform with Java and so you can see into about too many applications.

84
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.210
But for the simple scenario, we are going to use and read and click Java Web.

85
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.700
You can see web application, web application.

86
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.420
We take existing resources and extremely liquid applications.

87
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.490
Click Next.

88
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.520
Then you name to your application, I'm going to put you in.

89
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.070
Or registration?

90
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.290
Then you can use dedicated folder string libraries and everything.

91
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.360
No need to do that because it will athletically create some dedicated folder.

92
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:13.010
Well, as you said, the project, location and folder, you can change it, but I'm going to say before.

93
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.770
Then click next.

94
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:26.110
Then it will take time to create a project so you can see your options within an enterprise application.

95
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.160
So you should be done.

96
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.920
You should choose Abu Glasby server or Apache Tomcat, but I recommend Glasby server only.

97
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:39.370
If you don't have a blast server, go to this option and then you can find your server.

98
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:45.530
Like everything I'm going to blast reached by wrestled with this Glasby server Typekit and download

99
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.180
it from here.

100
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.740
I already installed and downloaded Lashley's server, then click Java eight where it is.

101
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.980
After that, it is the latest Java EE Jakarta EE Virgin started.

102
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:04.270
So Java EE, I'm going to use here and this is the context because it should be same like as your project

103
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.790
and next.

104
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:11.770
So don't leak anything yet and we don't need any frameworks.

105
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.770
Java server for our students or everything.

106
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.880
Click on Finish.

107
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.570
So it will take time to create the default logic here.

108
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:28.000
We are going to use some default templates here, basically like in Java Servlet, so it will take time

109
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.540
to perform some actions and everything.

110
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.700
Once it is done, you can see in this section.

111
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.390
Or when in a statement, if I lose, I in this story.

112
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.330
I'm going to cut this part because this is only coming.

113
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:53.870
So as you can see, this is investment and in this scene you get this scenario you can see.

114
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:55.440
Everything.

115
00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:02.990
Event registration, you can see this is our project, which is a project introduced, you can once

116
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.400
you click this plus icon.

117
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:10.070
You can see all the webpages, source packages, libraries, configuration files here.

118
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:16.820
So we are dealing with web pages, sources and libraries don't need to change in this file.

119
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.290
Don't touch this file.

120
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.300
So this is all about our project set up from the folder.

121
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:26.570
I'm going to tell you how we can proceed with our project.

122
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:34.790
This is set up only, so remember in webpages folder, you should add web pages, estimated frontend

123
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.030
pages and in the suspect edition, you should add packages.

124
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:46.340
Before that, I will add some libraries by default libraries here, so we need to install Java Library

125
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.900
as I will you for the school support.

126
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:56.690
So just like clicking the libraries and select folder, so I will click this folder.

127
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.700
Inside this, you can all see where you store that.

128
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.890
I will use this Java as a tool and I will share the open.

129
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:15.000
So our libraries added no thought where this project was a school based on so so if you don't want to

130
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:21.900
do it from here, you can go to this and go do project properties and you can add or change everything

131
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.110
here.

132
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.160
As I told you.

133
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:32.150
Also for this, I'm going to be some dry wit, and for that, I will tell you how we can add that library

134
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.570
also.

135
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.180
So this is all about our setup.

136
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:42.980
So let us deal with what is this works or how it's also indexed on these families don't prime where

137
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:50.980
you don't change the name of indexed or digital audio file, or we can say, loading plain off our logic.

138
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.040
So as you can see in the webpages, there are different things.

139
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.000
But if you go this, many people dot MF.

140
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.100
This is not what we can say.

141
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.050
This is the virgin for the loading.

142
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:10.280
If you change this to some another name, you have to change the properties to according to that.

143
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.800
So let us see how we can build this.

144
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.540
So I will just deploy.

145
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.410
With this hour and inside this, I will free Hollywood.

146
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.470
So a deployment is very simple.

147
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.220
What are you going to do?

148
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.580
Go to this event, raise that.

149
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:33.060
Brigid Glanville So what will just build what it will be do?

150
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:40.770
It will show the only the building part, but in the cleaning part, it will remove the particular non

151
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:46.530
usable libraries and unusable dependencies, and it will clean living.

152
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.500
So as you can see, our building is successful in building.

153
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.160
So now you can run this from there and project.

154
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.930
From for the project, it will take time.

155
00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.450
So I will show you how we can go with our.

156
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:12.150
Running time to wait for some time, it will take around two to three minutes.

157
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.070
Once it is successfully done, you can see building success with this, Mr Julian, and in the glass.

158
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.670
You can see rental registration is successfully deployed.

159
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:30.480
So remember if you are or what we can say, the pulled often.

160
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.500
Database is also you local.

161
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:40.710
You should change that board using some commands, I will tell you further how you can change the commands

162
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.260
there also.

163
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:48.350
So this is a duty I'm going to use Blackfish, but otherwise you can change the last fish work in either

164
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:53.860
set up, but it takes some complicated steps or you have to change the configuration.

165
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.050
So I didn't tell that part.

166
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.740
Instead of this, you can run single command in goal to change that.

167
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.710
So once it is successfully be.

168
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:11.910
You can see in the courtroom, either this administration is are we going to reject this susceptibility

169
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.180
flood?

170
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.710
So this is for the setup only.

171
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.000
I told you about I bring the Helloworld here and this is an opportunity.

172
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.920
So this is about endangered instruments.

173
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.960
So as you can see, our index not extremely, then we'll be successful.

174
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:32.040
The beautiful thing about this is once you deploy, no need to deploy it again and again, you just

175
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.160
print anything like I am printing.

176
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:44.800
This is my project or even registration.

177
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.380
And just likely controls to save this once I say this and I click Reload.

178
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.080
You can see this is all going to be.

179
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.310
So this is what we can say currently running.

180
00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.140
So once you have some.

181
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:12.170
So let us see how we can see this, so as you can see, this is done in over like this one site, click

182
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.780
control and perform this reload here.

183
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.640
Reload again, DeLorean.

184
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.530
So as you can see, this is added.

185
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.570
So this is how it works.

186
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.160
So once you deployed, no need to stop it or something like that, I'm going to stop it here because

187
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:31.920
it takes Oh, and it was that board, so it will slow down the system.

188
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.640
But once for the small whole operation, you can perform this.

189
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:41.700
And if you have some ambiguity or error in this, it will follow this error in blustery server and event

190
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.350
rage also.

191
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:52.200
So this is very important in this you get if a Chrome browser or something is not opening by default,

192
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.310
then there is some issue with ID auto your code.

193
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.760
So no need to worry about that.

194
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.000
Sometimes it will happen.

195
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:05.940
So you can use this link also this given an output.

196
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.250
You can see this output link here.

197
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.500
You can use this link to deploy that.

198
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:19.790
So that it about our first amending or we can say, successful deployment of our of our project in the

199
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.060
further I will tell you how this java.

200
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.660
So ladies working, what did you see then?

201
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:27.350
Everything.

202
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.770
There are so many talks in Dallas that I will tell you.

203
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:36.050
So we just saw that how we can set up our project and how we can deploy this.
