00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.690
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:09.430
So I hope that you all have went through that introduction part pretty well and now must be wondering

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.550
that how actually that application is going to work.

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:23.050
So in this part, we have had to look how actually things are going to work and what are the functionalities

5
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.050
to be attached to by making this application?

6
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.090
What are the features that should be kept in mind before the creation of the programming section that

7
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.110
be we have to put up so in the programming section, according to the other things which are already

8
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:49.720
in our mind, like we have to make a call for the order, for the size, for the practice and for the

9
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.210
speed, for the avid speed and for the elapsed time and remaining time as well.

10
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:04.210
And last but not the least, the status bar is going to show the actual status of the download file

11
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.440
taking place.

12
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:14.710
Also, we are having buttons as boards and as you can see on clear, and these buttons also contain

13
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.840
some functionalities within them.

14
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.640
So we have to also like put the pinks according to these buttons, like how on selecting a specific

15
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.200
column was read Zoom, cancel and clear is going to work.

16
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.800
So this is like opening window off the application.

17
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:40.030
Once you click on the icon of the application, this window will open Title Bar containing our download

18
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.610
manager, logo head and also in the taskbar upload download arrow.

19
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.820
What is the icon of this application we are going to make today?

20
00:01:51.160 --> 00:02:01.390
And secondly, our final text is showing in the title bar as well, so our files are going to be downloaded

21
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.570
with the help of this download manager.

22
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:13.000
So, yes, a file download manager, we can also say this this is the third row like we can see that

23
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.220
the second row after the title role.

24
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:25.480
So this is containing input text when we can enter any text from our keyboard and add download button

25
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.280
is like placed placed side device to the input tax free where the link is to be pasted.

26
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.640
Now after this, we are having a downloads column like we can see that this is the download table.

27
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:51.700
The table model is displayed once they will start like downloading anything, we can see that yes,

28
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.460
it is actually looking like a table with some rows and several columns.

29
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:07.570
So let's try to like grab a link from the web and try downloading it from our download manager.

30
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.630
So suppose like, OK, so opening any random read if.

31
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:25.130
And copying the link of that Rebif and then switching back to our download manager and pasting the link

32
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.530
in that input text field.

33
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.840
OK, so yes, here we are.

34
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.720
We have pasted a link with the tape.

35
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.980
You are going to roll off.

36
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.250
This link is for, I think, a Java tutorial.

37
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.070
So, yes, now we will hit this add download and see what happens.

38
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:56.250
OK, so that download has started, it is working perfectly fine had the other column is showing that

39
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:04.260
you already have pasted had and it is like vanished from and now displaying that this are column of

40
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.400
the table.

41
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:16.380
The size of the file is five and the remaining time is like zero or as nothing is like to be waited

42
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.740
for.

43
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.650
The total time to top for this download is twenty four seconds.

44
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.490
OK, so that status is complete.

45
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.010
Let's try pasting the link again in order to study things.

46
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:40.470
OK, so initially we have 48 seconds in the remaining text and now, OK, so these are adding.

47
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.120
Status is showing.

48
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.320
Download now.

49
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.630
Let this writer selected this column and force in order to like study things.

50
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.670
It is downloading so fast.

51
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:58.410
OK, so one thing you have to keep in mind that you will have to like switch on the network, connection

52
00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.880
off your system.

53
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:08.040
Like check if you have correctly connected your system to internet in order to like, check this download

54
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.200
mind as it is working so.

55
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.050
Sometimes we do not connect to the internet and then try to download something.

56
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.170
Then things are not going to be fine.

57
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:29.790
OK, so in the progress, this bar is showing 53 percent completed and the download is fast right now.

58
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:38.380
We have our remaining time of 18 seconds and less time, 14 seconds, and the average speed is different

59
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.970
in both the columns.

60
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.950
So I have already told you that they network bandwidth to me.

61
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.510
That vary according to like a different time.

62
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.370
We have different speeds off the internet.

63
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.890
OK, so for the same size, we are having different data speeds.

64
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.780
OK, so this is the speed at the current instant.

65
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.480
And this is the average speed.

66
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.660
Now let's try to resume this download.

67
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.940
So we have resumed this.

68
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.370
Now it is again showing downloads.

69
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.200
Now let's try to again cancel this, OK?

70
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.170
So we have cancelled this download and the status now is showing cancel.

71
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:33.920
So we have a total of 21 second elapsed, and then we cancel this download now after canceling a new

72
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.430
download.

73
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:42.710
Suppose we want to clear this from the role which we are like, suppose I have selected this and I want

74
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.730
to clear this role from the table now, not table.

75
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:53.850
So after the selecting the color changes of that specific role, initially the color is right now.

76
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.150
The color is like a light blue color showing that this column is selected.

77
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.610
So on, think this clear?

78
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.030
OK, so that specific column is not.

79
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.880
That specific role is the second line which was in download.

80
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:19.640
So now that we have completed one download now, let us try to download something else.

81
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:28.740
Oh, OK, so we have downloaded this data yourself in 21 days an introduction.

82
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.160
Suppose we want to download this book.

83
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.720
So copying the link and again, trying to paste?

84
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:43.100
Initially, we have faced the same links in order to check how actually pausing anything works.

85
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.700
So again, we are trying to pester someone differently.

86
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.570
And again, this is containing DTP.

87
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.710
You are in control.

88
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.190
So now I'm hitting that download button.

89
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.980
The download has started again.

90
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:03.290
This is a five megabyte set, and you can see that download speed is very fast.

91
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.890
It is downloaded in just five seconds, so you can see the difference.

92
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:18.210
Like I said earlier, the average speed jumps to four times, so you can like, analyze everything over

93
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.030
on this download manager.

94
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.190
You can analyze the average speed of a specific download.

95
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:32.840
You can analyze the total time elapsed and thus, according to this size, it's is so simple.

96
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.560
Let us try to download a big file.

97
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.980
So let us see that we can find a big file or not.

98
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:48.410
So, OK, so this is a big look, I think.

99
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:56.120
Let us try to copy this link and try pasting the check, whether it works or not.

100
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.450
Soyuz who thing on this ad down?

101
00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:04.520
Again, this is up at City Bureau Control, but that is some error.

102
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.210
So OK.

103
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:13.820
So if a link has some bugs attached to it, then automatically the status bar will show error.

104
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:23.060
So we have like opened up on that feature of this download manager that if a link is like some broken

105
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:33.320
or 90, then the status of ensure that a message that OK, so we can download this file as there are

106
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.280
some errors.

107
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.970
So let us try downloading something else.

108
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.950
So Castle opening this PDA file.

109
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:44.570
And.

110
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:52.060
Let's check whether this locks are 9:00 hour again, it shows there.

111
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.850
OK, so this started downloading.

112
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:09.940
The south side is five point six megabytes, and again, we have a different download speed so far three

113
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.300
downloads, we have three different.

114
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.200
Like the average speed and speed cable.

115
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.280
So the time elapsed is also different, almost the same size file.

116
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:30.210
But the time difference is unlike not comparable ones we have.

117
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:37.810
So OK, so we have to be complete status downloads and error state test download.

118
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:38.260
Fine.

119
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.920
So let's try to again clear the.

120
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.390
Down and out of one side.

121
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:55.810
OK, so we have near the end of one side now you can see that we have a table like structure with potatoes

122
00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.870
and one two three four five six eight columns.

123
00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:04.630
So we have veto then eight columns and basically direct table structure.

124
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:13.720
So in order to like start the programming section of this project, we have to analyze that to avoid

125
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.150
that action required in order to.

126
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:25.470
Start making this project, OK, so what are the things to be kept in mind before creation of this application?

127
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:33.930
The first thing to be kept in mind is that we have to like, create the new project.

128
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.400
And I be.

129
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:49.490
After that, it may have to start creating the classes that are required inside the application.

130
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:55.610
So I think we will need to like let us start one by one.

131
00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:04.640
So that means creating the main class and we can name the main class anyway.

132
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:14.300
But this class is going to be responsible for testing and learning of the application.

133
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:22.570
So yes, no testing and learning of the application is going to be handled with the help of this mean

134
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.000
class.

135
00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.320
Now what part concern should be to like?

136
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.780
Yes, we had our progress.

137
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.780
So create a class.

138
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:46.130
For progress, we have already discussed that approach six to like five to six columns in the table.

139
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:54.690
I like linking it to each other, so everything is linked to the prognosis and things are going to be

140
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:59.360
valid according to the percentage displayed in the progress line below.

141
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.620
So we have to create a creative class for the promise of Indigo.

142
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:14.970
Then the next concern is to create a like good, stable middle class, so create a stable model.

143
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.540
So we are creating a table, basically.

144
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:25.230
So table model Class four table model, so class party room model.

145
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:33.240
And inside this class, the things that are going to be like, combine accordingly are how the model

146
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:40.890
is going to be looked, how many columns are going to be placed inside the table and how the links are

147
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.050
to be rendered one by one.

148
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:51.840
Once we like to hit on that download button, the role will be added with a new download, meaning whether

149
00:13:51.840 --> 00:14:01.110
it is in for progress or fast or like complete, or that it may be entered also so that you're always

150
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.270
going to be like occupied one by one.

151
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:11.520
Once you hit that download button with a link every time, again and again, things are going to be

152
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.000
added in.

153
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.370
OK, so our next concern should be like.

154
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.970
Yes, we have created them in class.

155
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.470
We have created the progress renderer and we are done with their download.

156
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.180
They will also like table model also.

157
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:36.930
Now we have to add one more class for the rest of the columns, like see what we have left the size

158
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.690
thing, the status thing and the time thing.

159
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:52.590
So the fourth class is going to cover all the things about that time status changing and like, what

160
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:53.940
is the next thing?

161
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.340
OK, so size.

162
00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:04.860
So we are going to make a class for handling the functions, methods, objects off balance data, center

163
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.310
size, class size columns.

164
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:18.960
