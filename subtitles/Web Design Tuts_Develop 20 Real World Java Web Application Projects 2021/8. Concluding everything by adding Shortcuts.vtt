WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.460
Now, so that we have created actions, performers for that name doesn't exist.

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.550
But let me explain what this is actually doing.

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.260
So suppose if your system has an internet cast, then this will try to print that text data.

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:27.360
And otherwise, this will catch your next section and show that it is an error that is not attached

5
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.170
to the system.

6
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.300
So try connecting a printer first and then try to put in your request text, which you have to for.

7
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.780
Similarly on clicking on the exit button, there is a simple function system dark exit, which takes

8
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.890
argument as null zero or false, whatever we call it.

9
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.200
So when we exit the system, Agnes with the null exception.

10
00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:03.750
Similarly, for coffee and garden salad and bass, we have inbuilt functions like for cars, we have

11
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.550
bacteria exterior shortcut for copy.

12
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.090
Similarly, we have to paste this part only like four copies.

13
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.370
We have text area, dark copy for best.

14
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.790
We have text data not based.

15
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.880
And.

16
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.170
For select all we have text area, not select.

17
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:43.400
Similarly, yes, we have done this everything now commenting about what is going to be performed on

18
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.870
clicking the above button.

19
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.760
So I'm digging that out.

20
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.270
But then I knew about Window will open victory.

21
00:01:50.270 --> 00:02:00.950
We have here in the amount of applause and the visibility of this window should be set to true, said

22
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.640
Visible.

23
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.280
Should be true.

24
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.330
Yes.

25
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.430
So here we are.

26
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.330
Now let's try and run this.

27
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.880
Not bad, Java ran Java, and they're waiting, yes, so let's dive something.

28
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.610
Hello, everyone.

29
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.530
We are here.

30
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.180
Cordero, so, yes.

31
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.670
Now let's try to click on the print button.

32
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.460
Perfect.

33
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.130
So I'm clinging, picking that plane to my window windowpanes, which asks that misprint that you want

34
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.430
to print it from and the format of this print.

35
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.960
Similarly, it has many other options, also number of copies.

36
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:05.470
So the proper printing window is set with the help of this option.

37
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.610
Try and catch and get action on it.

38
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.840
Glossy, ignored and similarly on taking the exit.

39
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:26.760
It will exit, so the window is closed now, running this again and try to test that card copy and Windows

40
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.760
buttons like Hello.

41
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.530
Now let me try to select this and go ahead.

42
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.690
Yes.

43
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.040
So it is good.

44
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.710
Now let us try to paste it.

45
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:51.510
Hello is besten now select on all of the text written had is selected with the help of this select copy

46
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:59.400
and then try to paste it again, again and multiple times you wish it to be printed.

47
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:11.070
So we have created action listeners for all Albertans here for the final edit and help now let us try

48
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:18.930
to add some keyboard shortcuts with these buttons so that we can perform their task with the help of

49
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.980
keyboard itself by typing so there will be no need to click on the button, leaving your keyboard and

50
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.030
coming through your mouse.

51
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.720
You can do everything with the help of your keyboard only.

52
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.140
So let's start adding the shortcuts.

53
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.430
Yes.

54
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:45.390
So by this, we are going to add keyboard shortcuts attached with every button in the menu bar.

55
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:56.220
So for the new file, we are going to set it as set accelerator set accelerator is used for the keyboard

56
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.880
shortcuts.

57
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.760
It has an argument as keystroke.

58
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:14.320
After which call get keystroke, get keystroke and the required characters, so key event.

59
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.270
He events.

60
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.450
And.

61
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.360
After giving, we have to.

62
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.620
QualitÃ©s dot, leaky, hey.

63
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:42.710
We get in as we want control and to be the shots go off this, so suppose we everything it does key

64
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.640
event, not speaking, not end, and the modifier will be as the event.

65
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.090
Key event control, noun mask.

66
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.260
Iran.

67
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.760
Noun mask.

68
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.570
Yes.

69
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.720
So we have successfully created a sharp cookie for the new file option.

70
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:21.380
Now let me copy this for all the parties like we have gone digital already does one two three four five

71
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:30.230
six seven eight nine 10 19, so pasting 10 more times and replacing for each button.

72
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:38.990
Again again, and I think let us try to change open file.

73
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.600
Save file.

74
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.360
Print, is it for the print button?

75
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:58.960
The short term will be different for exit button, the shot that is a different key from your keyboard

76
00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.950
got.

77
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.950
Copy.

78
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.140
Based and select.

79
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.670
So ignore their typos and select all.

80
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.790
Select on.

81
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.320
I think we have one more option about.

82
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.740
So about will also contain eyeshot got exaggerated.

83
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.650
Now think about some keys from your keyboard, like for opening the file.

84
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:41.280
It could be all for saving.

85
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.860
It could be as controllers for printing.

86
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.720
It could be paying for it.

87
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:59.280
It could be the blue void exit card should be X and copy should be controllers.

88
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.730
C based should be B.

89
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:15.600
For selecting on Reuse A and similarly for the about option, let us suppose we are using that jacket

90
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.490
on our cable Soyuz.

91
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.920
Now let us try to run this and see if we are OK.

92
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.380
OK, so if we are able to earn.

93
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.090
No shortcuts.

94
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.420
Yes, both.

95
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:39.180
So we are able to add shortcuts returning key, like for new, we haven't all as be exit W..

96
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.670
Similarly for the Edit Options Guide.

97
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.530
Copy Paste.

98
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:50.420
So let's try to check this like if I am inputting hello over and trying to cut this with the help of

99
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.190
my keyboard print typing like it does control X.

100
00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.140
So it should be selected and closed.

101
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.600
So, yes, I am able to cut it.

102
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:09.170
Now let me try to paste this with the help of my cable control be so perfect.

103
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.620
The short cuts are working perfectly fine.

104
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:20.810
OK, so in the window, often we can see that there is a not so good double than line.

105
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.510
So let's try to remove this with the help of some functions.

106
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.850
So search for this scroll area, which we have created.

107
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.780
And try to add something.

108
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.700
Mitch Gordon of our nation, the noble lining there.

109
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.170
So yes.

110
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.930
At this place, I am going to an uncontrolled brain.

111
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:54.390
Yes, above this line, I'm going to hate us for all pain not set by the.

112
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:04.380
Said border and the border would be like border factories, not empty border, as we do not want any

113
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.690
border between the title and the menubar so clear.

114
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.210
Empty border.

115
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.570
Selecting this.

116
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:24.760
Now, let us try to run this, and if we are able to learn this or not, then our.

117
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:34.160
And yes, the double border is vanished, so the application is almost ready.

118
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.380
One more modification.

119
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.070
I want to do this.

120
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.310
Suppose that gun control open.

121
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.030
Are.

122
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:54.630
I suppose like when the final user option opens in the same, an open button, this ready, all designed

123
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.090
model of the final user opens.

124
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:02.670
So you want to give it a go and look, I'm more than twice your children should open.

125
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.930
So yes.

126
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:09.440
So the final user, you shouldn't be involving the user.

127
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:15.240
So I'm going to add a UI manager, nor said, Look.

128
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:28.400
And she said, look and feel option inside, image US manager again and get this done, look and feel

129
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:33.920
last names get system look and feel class.

130
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:34.700
Yes.

131
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.370
So this will throw an exception when there's an.

132
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.250
So throwing exception.

133
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:44.120
Yes.

134
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:53.720
So let us go and take a look that the file user is dusting the old one on it is updating running the

135
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.130
job again.

136
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.680
And waiting for it to be executed.

137
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.720
Now let us try to time something.

138
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:12.250
There are no bags and clicking on, supposing so often this is the modern train station which opens

139
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:21.050
and we want it in this way, only the old one was not so good and involving for the user.

140
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:32.990
So closing this now, as far as I can see that me, I've covered almost everything in the northwest.

141
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:45.430
So giving this project a conclusion as we have created about class EP app named North Bend.

142
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.520
And after it, we have added actions to that.

143
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:56.060
But as we have theater, the menu bar inside the frame using the W.T. Library.

144
00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:05.000
So overall, this project teaches us all the concepts about a simple java, the UI application, and

145
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:12.350
I hope you all are going to make this project on your own and learn these concepts.

146
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:22.370
Do not only by viewing this lecture, but making that project by your own is the best way to learn and

147
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.790
practice their language learning process.

148
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:33.710
So I hope you all have enjoyed this series of project and thanking you.

149
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.860
All for joining this.

150
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.790
Good bye.
