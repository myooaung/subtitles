00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:08,400
Hey, guys, in this review, I am going to show you how to install and download Visual Studio code

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,890
on your Windows 10 operating system.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,660
So let's get started.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,530
So to start with it, just open your favorite web browser and search for visual studio code.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,940
And the first line, which will appear here will be from Gordon Visual Studio dot com.

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,440
So we are going to click on this link, and once this website is open straight away, you will be able

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,830
to see this new download button for Windows.

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,710
We are going to just click on this, no matter which is going to download this executable file and this

9
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,860
executable file is around 50 megabytes.

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,770
So I am going to read for the download the complete.

11
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:06,550
Once the download is complete, open the executable sign and this will appear like this.

12
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,190
So you have to accept the agreement, mention her.

13
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:21,540
Click on the next button and head you will receive various check boxes for the additional tasks required

14
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,320
in this setup.

15
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:33,050
The checkboxes, her mention as a creative backstop icon and open with court action and open with production

16
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,140
in context, menu is hysterical.

17
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,360
So keep this check.

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,840
And also, I would like to check what clicked this checkbox created Dexter Python.

19
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:51,920
As if we have our next door Python for Visual Studio code, it would be very convenient for you to open

20
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,020
the app very conveniently.

21
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,980
Then click on the next button.

22
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:05,180
Hey, do we have to click on the install button and wait for the installation to complete?

23
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:16,610
So after the successful installation of Visual Studio Code, the Visual Studio code application will

24
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,840
launch on your desktop and it will look like this.

25
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:29,900
Trust me, it is the best idea for any any of the program you'll wish to run.

26
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,730
Look at the beautiful layout of Visual Studio code.

27
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:42,710
We have a file button, edit button, selection, button, view, button, go button, run button,

28
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,860
terminal health and so on.

29
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,460
You can click on any of the options and start.

30
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:03,060
Performing your desirable task with this application succumbing to the fact we are here to create a

31
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:12,390
Java project and I am sure you may be wondering that how you can run Java programs in your favorite

32
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,860
visual studio code.

33
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:23,250
So now I am going to show you step by step process to configure the Visual Studio code for running Java

34
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,690
programs correctly.

35
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:33,270
And I am going to also show you how you can run your basic Java program in Visual Studio Code on Windows

36
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,020
10 machine.

37
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,680
So without any further delay, let's get started.

38
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:45,480
Firstly, we have to download the latest version of JDK and to download it.

39
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:52,160
We have to visit the official site of JDK download, which is Oracle.

40
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,590
Now open up your favorite web browser.

41
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:02,970
I am using Google Chrome here and then open the link up on the top of the page.

42
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:13,000
This link will redirect you to the official site Oracle to download latest JDK Virgin.

43
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:24,160
So now you can see we have her download links for the gift for Linux, Windows and Mac OS, but.

44
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,840
So we are going to download it for Windows.

45
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:39,030
Now, select the 64 bit installer, currently its size is 152 N.B..

46
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,700
Clicking on the download link.

47
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,380
Their download has started now, wait for the download to complete.

48
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:59,050
So once the download is complete, you can see the executable file in your downloads folder, so we

49
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:05,230
have to run this executable file to install JDK in our system.

50
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:14,940
So once show that you already have this software installed in your computer, would you like to reinstall?

51
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:21,590
So I am clicking No, what do you have to wait for the installation to be completed?

52
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,160
And once the installation is simply, I will take you to the command.

53
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:37,010
Prompt veterans show you how Judaica is installed and what is the version it will.

54
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,300
Reflect, I think, yes.

55
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:51,860
Java minus minus Virgin to get the version of Java and to check whether the JDK is completely installed

56
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,670
in your system or not, so click Enter.

57
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:05,070
And yet you can see Java seventeen point 2.1 two years JDK is completely installed in your system.

58
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,410
Congratulations.

59
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:15,230
Now there is one more task that we are supposed to do before running a job program in our favorite compiler

60
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,580
visual studio code.

61
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:28,700
So click on the search bar and type environment here so that I two options we have to select the first

62
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:28,940
one.

63
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,780
Remember?

64
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,580
Click on the first one only.

65
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,640
Yes.

66
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:39,950
So after clicking on this, we have that environment variable system properties.

67
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:48,230
We have to click environment variables and then click on this bad option after clicking on this bad

68
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,890
option.

69
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,200
We have to click Edit.

70
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,720
Remember, we have to click edit and then we have to.

71
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,310
Added the environment variable for Java.

72
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,140
Now I will show you.

73
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:25,010
Here do you can see we have this environment stable back forever, Judy, give us?

74
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,460
So you must be wondering where this spot came from.

75
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,800
Let me show this to you.

76
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,500
So go to your next settings and then.

77
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,040
File Explorer, yes, go to your C drive.

78
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,860
And then program files.

79
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,730
Yes.

80
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:06,410
So search for Java in your program files folder, a member search for Java.

81
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,130
Yes.

82
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,360
So here it is.

83
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,880
Yes.

84
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,770
So click on the Java 17 and copy the.

85
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,260
But.

86
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,320
Venue copied apart from her.

87
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:36,700
You have the best in your environment, variable edit, but I already have wasted so I will not do anything,

88
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:42,130
but you have to paste it and click on the button, remember?

89
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,260
Click on the OK button twice.

90
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,590
OK, so your environment variable is set for Java now?

91
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,340
That will close this step.

92
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:01,570
After successfully setting the environment variable for decades now, he had her in our visual studio

93
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,300
code to run on Java program.

94
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,090
So let's get started.

95
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,350
Hey, we have to create a file new file.

96
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,440
You may create a folder.

97
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,920
To run this, so I am.

98
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:31,000
So to run a Java program, we have to open any of the folder from our system.

99
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,540
So I am opening a new folder.

100
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,910
And selecting.

101
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,450
So the folder is open in visual studio code.

102
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,970
We have to create a new file.

103
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,200
So let me name right Halo Dark Java.

104
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:57,020
Oh, sorry, I'm sticking you to the next meeting in this.

105
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,930
Hello.

106
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,330
Not Java.

107
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,130
Yes.

108
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,140
So we have created a file with extension Java.

109
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:17,270
Remember, it is mustard and this dot java at the end of your filing?

110
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,530
No, never run a simple Java program to print Hello World.

111
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,670
So let's start writing our very first program in Java.

112
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,690
We have to create a class.

113
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,120
Name.

114
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,060
Hello.

115
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:50,650
Publics think would mean.

116
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,020
During.

117
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,110
Human.

118
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:14,080
So, yes, we created a class, and under the class we created a main function inside class Hello is

119
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,350
responsible for running our Hello World program.

120
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,400
Released inside this, we have to write this out.

121
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,940
There is a shot good also, but I don't like to write the.

122
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,460
Completely so that you feel it.

123
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,300
Comfort, ever.

124
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:47,880
Later, I will tell you about the shot, put in a separate video.

125
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:04,480
Soyuz system, door to door train, Talon is required for printing anything in Java has.

126
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,510
In the inverted coma contains a string hello world.

127
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,510
It is necessary to enclose the string inside the double inverted commas.

128
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,370
So yes, we have written the program successfully.

129
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,560
Now we are here to run this.

130
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:32,080
OK, so before running the image of semicolon after this wreck?

131
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:32,710
Yes.

132
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,210
Now the court is perfectly fine and we should run.

133
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,480
So clicking on this run button right here.

134
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:42,830
Yes.

135
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,620
Perfect, so we got the output.

136
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,260
Hello by Insider.

137
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,050
Permanent.

138
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:51,980
Yes.

139
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,830
So the court is run successfully.

140
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:04,140
And you successfully run their first Zara program so we can congratulate yourself first.

141
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:11,370
Let me tell you a most important feature of this visual studio code.

142
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,930
If I erase this semicolon, it automatically shows a red indentation error.

143
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:24,650
And you can click on this ball icon, which opens her.

144
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,740
Which shows that there is a syntax, an insert semicolon to complete block statement.

145
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:43,440
So yes, this is the most important feature of visual studio code that it helps us with our mistakes.

146
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,440
It helps us to clarify our errors.

147
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:54,180
So yes, you have to write your code and wait for Visual Studio code to tell you that if your code is

148
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,650
correct or there are some syntax, error or compilation or two.

149
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:06,990
So, yes, I like Visual Studio four for this specific feature, and there are many other features which

150
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,160
we will together get to know in this project cities.
