00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.550
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:11.010
So, Dylan, we have covered everything about the beverage class and coffee glass and added everything

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.270
to the label glass.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.870
We just have to add fast action to the event at best in the class.

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.860
So in order to make that things clear, firstly, we have to create the juice and the water glass.

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.850
Then only we can attach the actions to the label glass, which is not going to be responsible for testing

7
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.320
and turning off the application.

8
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.410
So our next concern should be creating a new Finance Merseyside folder that will be called as Juice

9
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.310
North Java.

10
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.440
So we have landed inside the juice file on this list containing a juice glass.

11
00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.690
So inside this juice glass, we are going to create more like object event.

12
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:13.740
String and float, like Usain has flavor, we have already discussed it in the U.S. So private string

13
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.980
float and the float is going to be a string theory basically, which is going to contain types of the

14
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.550
fraud, which could be the flavors of the use of force sore.

15
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.760
And this string recalls float is going to continue to be fraud in the beginning and that there are going

16
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.890
to be some falls upon.

17
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:55.560
And then an orange, OK, so it is right then that my double string, so I'm not ending up buying now.

18
00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.310
But for sure, we have a look.

19
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.940
It's so changing this to double coat.

20
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:16.450
So the elements of the show today is I put on edge and pineapple, and the indexes of these are going

21
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.390
to be zero, one and two, respectively.

22
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.030
So after the creation of this juice glass and extending it to the beverage glass as we are going to

23
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:36.730
use the methods inside the beverage glass, we have used the 10 segments hard for this only to make

24
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.940
use of that glass inside an underclass.

25
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.860
So that said, the method is used for that only go access private objects inside any other classes of

26
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.100
the folder.

27
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.790
So we have set it already.

28
00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.100
Now we have declared the string after which we have declared this news object and the arguments inside

29
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.260
the juice object is string size, integer amount and label.

30
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.830
So these three are the same arguments as we have done inside the coffee glass.

31
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:21.610
The difference inside the juice glass is only that we have options like we are using this combo box

32
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.620
like option pane.

33
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.610
We can see that.

34
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.930
So option pane is displayed when we run the thing.

35
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.190
We choose juice and then we add it to cart.

36
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.130
Then our option pane appears asking, twice selecting.

37
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.750
Absolutely.

38
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.770
So we have to select that food as a flavor of our use in order to complete the order.

39
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:54.220
So this try and catch, we are responsible for an exception handling like any kind of error.

40
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.050
If arises, then it will be cached inside the null pointed exception.

41
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:08.260
You have to select our flavor if you click no later, do not select any flavor items, cancel the dialog

42
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.890
box, then automatically the exception collective.

43
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.860
Choose any of the flavors and then you can add to cart.

44
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.890
So try inside this try.

45
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:28.690
We are adding option pane on the label list containing the string select of fruit, so select the fruit

46
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.600
and a question message is being up passed asking for fruit.

47
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:42.880
So the option pane will be containing this fruit that had this fruit string at it, containing three

48
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.950
floors apple, orange and pineapple.

49
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.800
And by default, the total will be displayed as the index zeroes.

50
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.480
And then we have output.

51
00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:01.000
So the update will be displayed by default and you can choose it and you and you will like any of the

52
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.290
three scoops you can choose.

53
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.040
Now, in the similar way, we have done it for the coffee glass.

54
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:14.830
We have lost sight of double price and we have our dedicated prize for all the three sizes.

55
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.170
But in the juice, we have fruits also like that we had milk.

56
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.210
So in this, we are having our flavors.

57
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.450
So by default, the flavoring Zapper.

58
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:37.420
So this five and seven and nine is the price for that produced by small apple juice is costing five.

59
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:44.650
Similarly, the medium one goes seven and if not using the small and medium, definitely it will make

60
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.810
using the large glass.

61
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.790
So the price is going to be nine.

62
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:57.910
And suppose if you are choosing orange and pineapple, then the price is going to be multiplied with

63
00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.350
one point two five in those like dedicated glasses.

64
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.320
So you are choosing a small orange juice glass.

65
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.010
Then the price is going to be multiplied with one point over it.

66
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.460
And for the pineapple, the size of the price is going to be multiplied with one point five.

67
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.000
Similarly, the set price is used to set up daily the price.

68
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:28.750
Once you change your mind like adding two more glasses of coffee, then this set price method is used

69
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.770
to update this price.

70
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.570
OK, so this is done till now.

71
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.430
Now, in the similar way of adding strings like text.

72
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:49.830
In the form of string, we have prizes of double and an amount as an integer, so we have to convert

73
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.770
all of the text into a form of string.

74
00:06:53.070 --> 00:07:02.200
So we are using this to string function, calling the SuperDart string to convert float just to display

75
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.770
her like, suppose the f choose our produce.

76
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.260
So it will be displayed that five glasses of apple juice is added.

77
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:18.180
So yes, this is responsible for converting everything in the form of this thing now so that we have

78
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.930
created use glass, coffee, glass, beverage glass.

79
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:30.240
Now our next concern should be creating a new file inside this folder and name that the Java.

80
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:39.780
So this glass is going to be responsible for adding all the functionalities of the the option in the

81
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.470
menu bar.

82
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:50.390
So this will be like initialized US public, sorry, private boolean sugar.

83
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:58.920
And then in that sugar is going to be the add on for the B option in the menu.

84
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:10.680
Now inside this, we are going to make a constructor call it as E and the arguments are going to be

85
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:20.280
string side and somone and label B and in the similar way we have done it for that juice and the coffee

86
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:20.760
glass.

87
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:29.390
So the constructor is created successfully now inside this in the similar way, we'll be adding a Superman

88
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:39.300
turn and the Superman turn will be containing size and amount for the bee.

89
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:52.140
And if statement will ask for that, we want to like attach sugar to our C are not so g options been

90
00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:02.160
dark or dialog box will appear asking for like whether we want to add and the patent component is going

91
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:12.420
to be the LV end and the message is going to be like, would you like to add the sugar or something

92
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:12.920
like this?

93
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:17.260
So would you like sugar as it goes well?

94
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.610
Would you like sugar in your thinking?

95
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.740
Would you like sugar?

96
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.940
A question mark should be attached.

97
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.240
And after this, sugar?

98
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.520
Well.

99
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:45.580
OK, so option been really bad after this, asking for like a bad yes option.

100
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.890
Option pain again, not yes.

101
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.980
No option.

102
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.330
We are going to selected from the suggestions.

103
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.610
So yes, no option.

104
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.320
We are going to add.

105
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.650
And this is going to be said as.

106
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.590
Not in the fall.

107
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:18.330
And if this if statement is true, then the Sugar Bowl in object of an so through in the beginning,

108
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:24.400
as if this is not true, then we will like change sugar.

109
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.450
It'll force later initially.

110
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:33.060
So what is false by default now?

111
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:39.720
So that, OK, so there are no alcohol is required for this also.

112
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:41.830
Now after this.

113
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:50.970
Now, in this similar way, we are concerned adding prizes to their tea with sugar and without sugar.

114
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:59.670
So calling double price here, if size equals small fries for this day, is going to be three point

115
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.120
zero.

116
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:06.990
As if this if the size is medium, then the price for that thing is going to be fought.

117
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:14.550
As if we have not chosen small and medium, then that is only one size left, which is larger.

118
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.620
So definitely for the lies, the price is going to be fine.

119
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.300
Now what if sugar is added?

120
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:27.480
So if this boleyn's yogurt is going to change, if this says do true and false?

121
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:34.950
So if true, like if sugar is present, sugar is added, then the price is going to be multiplied with

122
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.180
one point two five.

123
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:45.930
And suppose we have to like go to the small size D, then today is going to be multiplied with one point

124
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.460
two five and the price is going to be three point seventy five.

125
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:58.500
So that total label report will show that you have added a small cup of tea and the price is two point

126
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.270
seventy five with sugar.

127
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:06.930
So we have updated the price to according to the sizes we have used.

128
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:15.030
Similarly, we have done it for the coffee and the juice, plus we are converting string and I like

129
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.310
other data types in the form of string.

130
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:27.450
So suppose if sugar returns to string, then be rich sugar so supposedly added sugar, then we have

131
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:35.400
to display that five glasses of five small glasses of B is added with sugar.

132
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.290
So this is going to convert things in the form of string.

133
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:47.340
We have already like mentioned it in the previous glasses now so that we have covered everything about

134
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.400
that the juice coffee beverage glasses.

135
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:57.690
Now, in the next part, we will be covering about the worth of what this glass is going to be responsible

136
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.210
for, what is going to be the brightness for all the size.

137
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:08.460
What is going to be that I don't think attached to what the glass and later on they will say, I like

138
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.680
the action attached to it, every event inside the label glass.

139
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:21.000
So yes, this is exactly we are going to do in the next, but we will be creating the water glass and

140
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.090
then concluding everything inside the label glass and we will be attaching actions to everything and

141
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:32.100
then running the project and see what actually happens as the output.

142
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.640
OK, so see you in the next part.
