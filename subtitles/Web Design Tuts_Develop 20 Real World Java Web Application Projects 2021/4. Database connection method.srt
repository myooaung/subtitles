1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:08,260
In previous material, I told you, we need to create one database and we need to create some methods

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,480
to improve that data in the database.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,840
So on screen, you can see this is our database team.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,480
So I'm using user, another user with this is my password.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,550
Anything, you can change this.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,260
OK, it's on your device.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,300
Let me close this.

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,520
So these are day school goodies, and we are going to create three tables here, which is basically

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,350
the first e-book.

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,290
Second is e-library and for four library limited.

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,170
I'm putting the constraint here.

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,200
Always e-book.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,920
We gave it the name primary call number.

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:47,200
And what is basically call number for that purpose, which is basically it should be a primary key.

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,470
I am enabling that call number should be unique.

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,810
So name can be common.

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:58,630
Publishers can be a common quantity, can become an issue of numbers until we can meet common but column,

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,900
but it should meet unique similarly ID of Ã‰laborer and should be unique.

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,250
I'm mentioning that email can be same because it's universally thing.

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:14,170
Want part of that and you should book which is call number, which should be not unless you don't really

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,000
not know the student name also.

22
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,380
I'm mentioning that and the dancer doesn't mention all the things.

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,880
So these are all about how you can create that villain database.

24
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,150
So let's see how we are going to create this.

25
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:35,020
So I already told you you need to create a new library in form and why it's going to be needed because

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,600
in the long run, I haven't mention all the things here.

27
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,510
So it brings me error also.

28
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,970
And like library in four months or missing there, so I created our library and for monsoon.

29
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:57,740
And Library in form, as you can see here in this part and in the images, there are images and all

30
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,550
the things that are mentioned.

31
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,850
So let us inside the view library.

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,320
We need to create a library and be.

33
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:11,330
But before that, there do we need to mention some or part also.

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,460
Did part, I'm going to tell you.

35
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,840
Because we need to mention their database, so I'm creating BP, which is basically a database DB with

36
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,700
our Java, including the finish.

37
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,390
So I'm creating your when?

38
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,060
What you can see.

39
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,430
No, simple.

40
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,730
I'm reading.

41
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,290
I'm just creating a package.

42
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,570
And let me mention, the package is over the simple.

43
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:47,570
As simple as that, I created him, so this is my soul, and this is all the things I mentioned.

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,890
So let me also.

45
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,840
Stream.

46
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,610
User is equal to.

47
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,020
Deb, as I told you.

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,230
And another user is doing.

49
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,800
Password is equal to.

50
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,250
And one good thing, so this is my username and password.

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,910
If you don't, how you be your default password.

52
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,780
But in my case, I'm using another user name.

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,140
And one, two, three.

54
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,900
As I mentioned in the notepad also, I'm creating this, I already created this part and I created a

55
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,330
good collection of and and Anthony Kiedis.

56
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,970
So I will put your database.

57
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,440
Connection method.

58
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,520
So now we're done with this in the.

59
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,090
We created this now India, we need to create law library.

60
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,800
India is basically a library and all we can say library in part adding and creating.

61
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,310
So let me create one, so let with the same name in India.

62
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,820
So I'm adding the information and I'm building this part, but I'm not deleting the package because

63
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,070
I need to mention it again and again.

64
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,390
I don't want to do that.

65
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,430
Well, as you can close this part, I mean, well, it's no longer required.

66
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,580
So let us create labor in the but.

67
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,000
So.

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,000
As you can imagine, you can delete this for the first.

69
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,630
And.

70
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:43,180
So now we're done with this book in the library, and we we need to mention that part also like importing

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,380
the this part.

72
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:54,030
So let me form this first, and we haven't mentioned this library and been first, so we need to mention

73
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,960
that part also.

74
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,850
So, no, I'm done with this.

75
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,160
So let me explain this, what is this?

76
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,030
So it contains all mentions here.

77
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:11,360
I mean, building libraries for first time, I'm adding some class, so it will be for sale in the library

78
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,650
and be without taking the name from this and insert into the library.

79
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,460
As you know, the name, email, password, movie, everything.

80
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,700
Then find a mate of 11 in Sydney and all the things mobile where I so.

81
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,630
Nothing but and mentioning your status and everything.

82
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,090
Oh, then this is again used for putting in a really stupid.

83
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,030
All the things you buy it.

84
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,740
You can view by ideals.

85
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,170
You can delete, then you can authenticate, authenticate or no authentication because.

86
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,710
I'm creating here and it is basically select email and password.

87
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:57,690
So for the email, we need to mention this, but before that in, we need to create liability and been

88
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,520
also.

89
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:04,170
So let me go with this and it's only been I'm going to create new solid.

90
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,850
Librarian been.

91
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,150
And then with this.

92
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,410
So.

93
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,870
Let me delete this part, because it's no longer required, I told you.

94
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,840
And let me.

95
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,130
I already created this part, Liberian bin, so let me use that part.

96
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:43,180
So let me tell you what it is, basically it is taking this, it is putting in another part laboratory

97
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:50,140
and been similarly in the laboratory and been basically constructed all those things and it is creating

98
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,340
when we're building them on some data illicitly get name, shift name.

99
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,620
If you know what is doing this, it is thus fitting the data and it's putting into this.

100
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:07,690
So as you can see, being slavery and then everything is done, but what is remaining is basically you.

101
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,150
So while this view is showing the area, as you can see.

102
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,770
Instead, this view is this, and now you can see these results.

103
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,590
So you need to see everything.

104
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,830
And we are done with all dimensions here.

105
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:36,630
Basically, you, LeBron and everything, but before we need to deploy some another solid fossil.

106
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:42,370
So let me explain what this deal is doing here is basically what are the purpose proposing this?

107
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:49,940
But what is inside this building is basically just taking that data and it's putting in another variable.

108
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,440
So why this is required?

109
00:07:52,660 --> 00:08:00,280
If you are going to do this, you will understand it takes too much time to process some parts as this

110
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,820
is, I'm doing in some part it takes.

111
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,140
As for the library and method only, I created that much part.

112
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,580
So it is.

113
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,850
It should be like some different things your own.

114
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,130
So.

115
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,810
So if you are, well, managing your school bag, considering you are managing your school or college,

116
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:25,420
make you put in our database that will automatically you to your timetable, you choose your timetable

117
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,620
or you took your timetable.

118
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,010
You seem to be ready to do this.

119
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,240
Then you are putting the first known book on your book or anything.

120
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:38,290
Similarly, what I am doing here, I'm creating three packages you it for the controlling part, bill

121
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:43,870
is basically for logging and all the methods it considering, but it also contains one b b, which is

122
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:50,830
basically the connection and b meaning basically what is the been creating being is for creating all

123
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,520
the constructors.

124
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,320
These are the constructors basically.

125
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,060
And from the Superdome, I I'm mentioning the super.

126
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:02,860
And if you know the super keyword and this keywords, so I'm mentioning this a to do this early and

127
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,990
because it's private, so it gives me some security purpose inside the database.

128
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,830
Otherwise, anyone can check that part and anyone can use that right.

129
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,800
So and all these methods get it.

130
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,130
What it is?

131
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,350
Get ideas for Glenn, which stands for so sole purpose.

132
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:26,060
Great name again for the plan for positioning image for the server purpose, getting all the things

133
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,590
that are similar.

134
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,400
So why I'm creating two different methods here again and again.

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,160
Similarly, I'm going to create four admin part of.

136
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,820
Creating these methods also is very helpful.

137
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,650
Again, this is public.

138
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,180
If it's a public, but all the variables are private, so no one can change this public and all the

139
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,870
things here.

140
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:55,540
So excuse me, 100 percent abstraction you can see here and I'm opening up again and again using this

141
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,790
keyword keyword.

142
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:04,250
So this very simple thing I can do if you I don't know if you don't want to create such methods, if

143
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,840
you don't want to create but ideal condition that you can create this and it's very easy if you don't

144
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,610
want to create, you are not to mention instead of you, LeBron, you said, and this is very tremendous

145
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,540
because you, LeBron, you can create only to view LeBron thing only.

146
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,690
So as you can see, this will be nice and everything you can create.

147
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:21,770
So.

148
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:31,590
The very simple reason being, Bill is basically this is so it will create one metal as a toll booth

149
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,250
and everything.

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,950
So as you can see these 11 being and we knew it would lead.

151
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,070
So this is a very simple thing I can do with this.

152
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,430
If they change to the beans, as we can see, this will be the edit.

153
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,120
So for the library and been very helpful for me.

154
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,680
And if you know this part, it is the once for loop or follow each loop you can see.

155
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,320
As for Lebanon Bean and if you notice Liberian Bean.

156
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:09,480
And so it's all the things here, but like LeBron Deal, as you can see, at least if you want to invoke

157
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,410
or use that as inside of Java, you have to go with two methods for normal for loop or normal way loop.

158
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:23,400
But you can use for each loop in any library, at least any advance on secondary data to make any strings.

159
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,850
Least at least said all things hashing.

160
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,240
Hash it, you then use for each loop.

161
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:38,010
So for each library in this Part B, is that what we can instantly liable for this list, this list,

162
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,520
what it will do, it will get into and print everything inserted.

163
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:49,440
I will remember and I'm mentioning here that bulletin here, and I need to engineer a library in form

164
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,740
on so a little library in form.

165
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,590
So we need to mention what is a librarian from here also, and it should be in select.

166
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,450
So I need to mention again here.

167
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,490
So let's not.

168
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:11,670
Because it's so late only and delayed labor unions again, so late, but let me when duty will copy

169
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,100
this because naming is very important.

170
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,620
Otherwise, it will give some error again and again.

171
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,920
So if you want to delete it, will this part?

172
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,650
So always you have to mention this.

173
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,250
And you can say I mentioned all the things here.

174
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,670
And now we are done with this.

175
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,400
If you want to add here.

176
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,170
You can and this part.

177
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,230
So now we are done with it in.

178
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:51,890
Let me tell you one more in like bill part, which is basically booby.

179
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:59,630
So I'm going to create it later, but I'm going to use this part because it is very helpful to me.

180
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,940
First thing, it's very helpful for me.

181
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,200
Second thing.

182
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,630
I'm mentioning all the beings here, so.

183
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,910
Currently, it is no longer required for us because we haven't created such matters for that purpose.

184
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:14,720
But.

185
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,260
Filling in in advance is very helpful.

186
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,930
While deploying all the parts.

187
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,150
So let me help you.

188
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,390
Well, I already created this good.

189
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,080
I'm just explaining you said this little movie.

190
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:42,320
Similarly, I'm going to create one issue moving, or you can say, issue moving part or the issue in

191
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,670
that.

192
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,300
With some this method in a school.

193
00:13:50,150 --> 00:14:00,200
So I'm just mentioning this because I don't want to focus on it later part because it's just being part

194
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,820
or you can see me through the part.

195
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,460
So now we are done with this, so I would have been parties done, as I told you, we give you directly

196
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:25,410
means your library an issue, and so now we are done with that connection, but also so in the next

197
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:32,630
weeks, I'm going to create some gaming and I'm going to add some or more will be part of that purpose

198
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,220
and so that we are now focusing on the solid part later.

199
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,390
So in the next two days, I'm going to tell you how we can create the solid part and everything.

200
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:48,090
So in this shooter I just created beginning, if you will, we are going to use it later, that purpose.

201
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,620
But I already created this.

202
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:57,630
So nothing but all the student IDs always create some tables idea before deploying all the produce because

203
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:03,760
we are going to use this also inside the library you need to add or technology TV celebrity.

204
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,230
Otherwise, it will show me the error again, as I told you.

205
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:16,630
So let me add that Oracle Library also here, which is basically what I call database GBC Dialer.

206
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,190
So as you can see, these added incentives.

207
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:30,450
So now our duty vehicles are connected and everything is done, so Pennington dibs on everything, you

208
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:30,830
know.

209
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,290
So in the next two days, I'm going to create some looks inside the admin part and you back, we are

210
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,760
done with the part and we need to create some Alonso.

211
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,580
So let us see how we can create that instrument in the next parts.
