00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:10.000
So after the successful completion of all the Java classes here, I hope you'll have a lot of knowledge

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.130
about object oriented programming.

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.230
Now looking at some more features of this program.

4
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.960
So before starting.

5
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.800
Let me add this, that we have a correction here.

6
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:33.460
Previously, I have Typekit asked to tell my niece friend whatever we have to subtract it with total

7
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.300
money owed.

8
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:43.240
So total money, I suppose if school and two thousand so the money spent will be two thousand minus

9
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.490
the salaries of it is seven hundred.

10
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.580
So the salary will be subtracted from the money earned by the school.

11
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.660
So.

12
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.970
Let me comment this out and explain it again.

13
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:08.240
So 2000 is the money aren't initially stored in this area, but later on, the variable stored the variables

14
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.540
in store value of 2000 minus 700 samples.

15
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.870
So the value will be equal to thirteen hundred, so that total money spent will return to being hungry

16
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.280
and the money on relief.

17
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.810
But the money will be left handed in total.

18
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:39.300
So yes, this was a correction that spent is the wrong arm in the quarter to be subtracted from now

19
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.230
removing this.

20
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.550
Let us move forward towards our main goal.

21
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.150
Where we left soirÃ©es.

22
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.870
We have created the school ABC and.

23
00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.960
Six out the on the money by the school, so I went to my nap.

24
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.300
Duffy says 60000 the fund in the school was sixty thousand.

25
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.020
We have run it and will run it again.

26
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.150
Yes.

27
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.210
So that school has on sixty thousand.

28
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.150
No.

29
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.490
Yes.

30
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.610
So let me add some more.

31
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.760
Funds like suppose that the.

32
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.480
Bases.

33
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.850
All 50000.

34
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.540
No running it again.

35
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.540
The fund shouldn't please, yes, perfect.

36
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:54.480
So now the funds in the school is one lakh 10000 paid by both of the students and totaling them.

37
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.750
Now let us.

38
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.340
Think about adding a new teacher to the.

39
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.160
Feature list of the school, so we have our list.

40
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.160
There is no restrictions in adding teacher.

41
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.710
We have unlimited size so we can add any number of features.

42
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.950
So let's send a new teacher to the school.

43
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:31.040
So we will add a new teacher in the similarly we have added it here, her so and then it does feature.

44
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.490
Let us name her, Mina.

45
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.330
Yes.

46
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.810
So Mina wants to join the school ABC, so she's new.

47
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.180
We have to set an I.D. for her.

48
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.700
So she's a member of that featured object.

49
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.150
So, yes, yes, it is demanding for iodine men.

50
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.650
The salary she should be given.

51
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.160
So we have already declared our as one two three.

52
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.890
So find a unique idea for me now so we can give her idea of the exciting.

53
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.530
Yes.

54
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.030
And put to her name.

55
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:27.340
And let us suppose let us suppose she is going to pay the salary of nine thousand.

56
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.410
Yes, perfect.

57
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.390
So Mina is added to the school and.

58
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.870
We have to add to it to the analysts like this?

59
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.510
Yes.

60
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.750
Goal.

61
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.910
Not as feature.

62
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.410
I mean.

63
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.530
Yes.

64
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.610
So we have named the school as ABC.

65
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.950
No school is ABC.

66
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.230
Yes, now it is perfect.

67
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.000
So, me neither.

68
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.770
Me, neither are they to the school.

69
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.550
No.

70
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.760
Suppose that the species collected from this event.

71
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.690
No.

72
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.700
What if we have to pay salaries to their teachers?

73
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.930
So giving this a good handing.

74
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.920
Like, suppose we were handing.

75
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.290
Yeah, schools.

76
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.910
Base salary.

77
00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.790
School is going to pay salary to their teacher in a separate blog.

78
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.110
Yes.

79
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.670
So.

80
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.710
Giving a hope.

81
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.570
Look, the heading should look nice, right?

82
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.560
So, yes.

83
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:26.680
Now, suppose that the teacher named someone is paid a salary so some men don't receive salary.

84
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.430
Yes, they receive survey escorted from the class last.

85
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.520
You receive salary.

86
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.990
Yes.

87
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.660
So how does the receive salary receive salary function?

88
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.880
He does the salary earn by a specified feature.

89
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:57.870
It was in the manner of salary is equal to salary plus salary.

90
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.190
Initially, the salary earned by any teacher is zero.

91
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.990
Had it is mentioned.

92
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:14.920
After the greatest tradition of the salary to the Samantha's account, she will be having a total salary

93
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.120
of nine thousand one check what was her.

94
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.450
Sorry, five thousand.

95
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.890
So Samantha will have a total salary of five thousand.

96
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:34.570
So, yes, calling the receive salary function from the teacher class, we have to write it in a way

97
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:41.500
like someone can not get someone to go up this salary.

98
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.310
So yes.

99
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.290
Someone to give salary is called here.

100
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:56.330
The method is invoked here, so if we try to bring out this shift, I'll.

101
00:07:59.480 --> 00:07:59.960
Yes.

102
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.650
So I it in this way that.

103
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.500
ABC School.

104
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.310
Spend.

105
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.950
For salary to.

106
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:31.250
Now for adding a variable in the print syntax, we have to use this plus icon.

107
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.240
So, yes.

108
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:45.820
Calling this a man to observe, not getting that name as a string is done by this good man function

109
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:46.930
and.

110
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:55.700
The variable is enclosed by a plus single at the beginning and the end after which.

111
00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:07.990
We have to print what the school is left of it, so we could write it in this way and now has so schools

112
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.120
left with how much money.

113
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:15.980
And again, the declining of any of the schools.

114
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.500
Not yet.

115
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.490
Yes.

116
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.430
The total money on spend for this salary.

117
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:29.990
Yes.

118
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.580
So again, the school name is ABC.

119
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:37.630
Right.

120
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.240
So let us try running this.

121
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.810
I think there is an error.

122
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.330
Let me try to fix this and.

123
00:09:53.050 --> 00:10:03.160
So, yes, after fixing it, the total money on and again, very to check what are the funds that the

124
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.570
school is left with.

125
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.160
And running.

126
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.590
Yes.

127
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:17.350
So the school has on one lectern tell them this is the title for the base salary school has been for

128
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.500
a salary to Samantha and now has spent $1.

129
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:30.850
And five thousand, like initially the school received the fees from Japan brother and then paid fee

130
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.890
a salary to Samantha.

131
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:43.660
So 60000 plus 50000 and subtracting five thousand from the salary by the front left, the school is

132
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.920
more like five thousand.

133
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.080
And it is perfectly fine.

134
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:48.690
Yes.

135
00:10:49.530 --> 00:11:00.750
So now let's suppose that school pays salary to one more teacher like the tide one last they've.

136
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.220
Copied this part and pasted again.

137
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.260
Yes.

138
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.380
So the third one is.

139
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.560
What is the name?

140
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:17.700
Yes.

141
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.010
So it is possible.

142
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.850
So that second payment is made to him and

143
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.040
placing everywhere.

144
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:38.330
So, yes, school has been this way to the second teacher.

145
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:44.300
And again, we want to check what are the funds left at the school?

146
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.680
So running it again.

147
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.300
Yes, perfect.

148
00:11:52.110 --> 00:12:02.160
So school has on a one leg 10000, then the base salary shows payment to Samantha and then school is

149
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.130
left with this money after paying it.

150
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.670
Also then now school is left with this money.

151
00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:14.040
So I hope you understood the concept behind this program.

152
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:25.710
We are calling the functions, invoking the method and printing it out in our output terminal.

153
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:31.660
So it is a beautiful way to learn the basic Java concept.

154
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.620
No.

155
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:41.430
In the next five, we are going to learn how to add some more specifications to this code.
