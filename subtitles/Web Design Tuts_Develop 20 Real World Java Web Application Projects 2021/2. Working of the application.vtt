00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.660
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:08.920
So I hope that you all have been through the introduction part of the application in Java.

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:17.800
Let me are going to make today and often that introduction, you must have a rough idea about what actually

4
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.920
we are going to make in this project.

5
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.530
And what are the concepts we are going to learn while making this project?

6
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:35.020
And what are the specifications of this project overall that we going to be looking up to while making

7
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.800
this project?

8
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.600
What should we kept in mind before starting to make this project?

9
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:48.040
So in this part, going to be looking up the what is now working off this application, how actually

10
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.510
this application works?

11
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.820
What are the functionalities attached in this app?

12
00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:02.230
And also like what will be the final output for running everything and we will see that.

13
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:12.310
So this is the window which is going to open when you will run the application in your compiler or from

14
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.080
the icons, which we will make on the completion of the project.

15
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:27.910
So yes, we can see that there is a frame basically inside the frame that is like the title menubar

16
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.460
titan is that component of the frame framework, which we are using.

17
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.170
I have known about it.

18
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.480
It was spring and it will be.

19
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.190
We will be using these two frameworks while making this application.

20
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:51.500
So this is the Typekit containing a Java coffee mug icon and all the other titan of this window.

21
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.910
OK.

22
00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:02.720
So inside this application that are some options and first options for size that is a drop down based

23
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.170
asking for small, medium, large.

24
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.450
So on selecting any one of them, it will be displayed here large.

25
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.870
And then we are being asked for select which type of beverage you want to order.

26
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.480
So they will be choosing one of these to check how actually it works.

27
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:32.260
So suppose I'm going to select coffee, so we are ordering large coffee and how many glasses of suppose

28
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.830
I want to order six glasses of coffee?

29
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.910
And you can see that initially the order button is like a light.

30
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.420
It is not clearly visible.

31
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.470
It is like a paring light light.

32
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.930
The border that is no highlighted.

33
00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:01.030
These button, once we will click and then automatically, this order back then will be in like, come

34
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.400
in a different color.

35
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.650
Similarly, like this had been so currently in this or that button is non-functional.

36
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.120
Once they will add something to the cart, then only this order button will become functional and changes

37
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.220
color automatically instead of being this grey like looking.

38
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.920
So I am clicking on this ad button, so this dialog box appears asking me for an add on.

39
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.210
So suppose if I want to add milk to my coffee.

40
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.560
There are people who prefer coffee without milk, like good, diet conscious people, so they will be

41
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.510
clicking no.

42
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.800
Then the data will be made in that.

43
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.450
So but suppose I want to administer it to check how it works.

44
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.430
So would you like milk?

45
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.920
Yes, I would like to admit.

46
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.730
So six large glasses of coffee with milk.

47
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.670
And so we have successfully added six not of coffee with milk.

48
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:15.780
Now you can see that this order button highlighted up, and now we can click on order so that yes.

49
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:24.760
So again, a message or dialog box cafe and six lines of our favourite milk will cost me fifty eight

50
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.530
point five lite currency units, whatever it could be.

51
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:38.950
And once I will click OK, so this dialog box, then again, a dialog box will appear showing me that

52
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:47.230
how much I should pay for this application, like what is the total amount to be paid by me once I will

53
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.520
check out the card?

54
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.280
So this is the like or what our process of ordering something.

55
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.380
So I am clicking OK, so everything is now like.

56
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.010
Previous.

57
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:10.120
They're like that initial state application jumps back to the running state, initially law and order,

58
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.310
and now we maybe try adding more than one thing that I like.

59
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.010
And then we will try checking out to see what actually happens.

60
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.040
So it's up on the size and it means medium.

61
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.430
And I am ordering a juice, five glasses of juice and then I am clicking on this add button.

62
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:41.500
So this is a new thing which we haven't talked about, so I wanted to discuss in the working class for

63
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.600
a better understanding of this thing.

64
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:52.750
So one more dialog boxes attached to this application asking for flavors of juice like what?

65
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.120
What things do we want to order?

66
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.940
So suppose I want pineapple juice.

67
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:05.020
So we have selected this fruit in other dialog box as well.

68
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.190
So this Nela Works is containing our drop down menu.

69
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.440
It's denser dialog box.

70
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.050
It says it contains a drop down menu.

71
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.800
And again, the council button to confirm.

72
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.290
So I am clicking okay.

73
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.410
And then finally, the glasses of pineapple juice are offered.

74
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:34.690
So suppose now again, I want to order, or the size should be simple, small and suppose again, I

75
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.880
want to order five glasses of B, so I'm clicking on it is asking for would you like sugars?

76
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:49.570
So it depends on the user, whether he or she wants to add sugar to that they or not.

77
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:56.350
So suppose I want to add sugars on flakiness five small glasses of sugar daddies.

78
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.320
So are these two things that added to the cart?

79
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.590
Now I wish to like check out.

80
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.550
I did not want to order anything else on making order.

81
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:14.080
So let's see this dialog box up there displaying that what actually I have added to my card and what

82
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.530
is the post attached to these specific items?

83
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:25.450
So five million glasses of pineapple juice costs fifty two point five and five small glasses of the

84
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.740
mint sugar costs eighteen point seventy five.

85
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.400
OK, so it is perfect.

86
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:37.750
We have ordered two things and the message is showing the same so everything is working fine below on

87
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:46.870
clicking OK, so that total amount to be paid by me is seventy one point two five units of currency.

88
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.740
And this is like adding that amount.

89
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:59.800
So we have fifty one point two five and I am not remembering remembering that data, but they are adding

90
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.620
the cost of the fee and the.

91
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:13.420
So this is also a special functionalities attached in this application offer totaling the items cost

92
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.930
and then displaying this in a separate dialog box.

93
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.390
So I'm clicking OK, so off.

94
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:28.060
We are back to the previous window, which was opened when neutron d'application and we have ordered

95
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.260
two things so everything was working perfectly fine now.

96
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:41.320
So you have gained all the idea about the working off this application, and I hope that you must be

97
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:49.480
like excited in order to learn how to write the program of this application on your own, learning every

98
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:59.290
concept behind the program and then complete this application to learn more and more concepts in Java.

99
00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:07.630
So here we will be like good writing the prototype of the application, which we are going to make today.

100
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:16.060
So what actually are the requirements that will be kept in mind before creating the application?

101
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:29.770
So firstly, we have to create a new Java project in the new project, and these are ease of our choices,

102
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:34.330
like we will be using Visual Studio code for creating this project.

103
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.050
So firstly, we will be creating a new project.

104
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:45.760
Secondly, we will be creating classes inside the project, so creating.

105
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:56.410
Main Glass first saw the main glass will be responsible for testing and running, of d'application responsible

106
00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:02.700
for testing and running off the application.

107
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:11.500
So whenever they will be like making things like putting things together and then we will be checking

108
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.290
that to how things are working or not are in each step.

109
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.470
We will be running them in glass only.

110
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:23.470
Not any other glass so responsible for testing and turning off the app.

111
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:33.310
OK, so after the creation of the main glass, now we will be creating separate glasses for each of

112
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.530
the like you have.

113
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:44.770
You must have seen that every order yours, the asking for are different are doing so in order to make

114
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.530
things like the difference into.

115
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.040
What we can say that the menu items.

116
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.400
So we have to build a different menu.

117
00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:01.520
Items fit different add ons, so we should be creating different classes for each item.

118
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.430
OK, so then OK.

119
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:12.940
So as a whole, we will be creating a beverage class for like consisting all night menu.

120
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:20.830
And afterwards we will be creating separate classes for each of the items in the menu.

121
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:28.930
Suppose we had coffee, juice and water as we had.

122
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.160
I think it does be an hour.

123
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.880
Yes, so we have ordered.

124
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.930
So we have to order things from these four options only.

125
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:50.170
So we will be creating four different classes for the menu items in order to attach or like the add

126
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.200
ons which they were asking for separately.

127
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.420
Like, there was nothing combined.

128
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.240
They were asking for different items.

129
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.700
So coffee was asking for it.

130
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.770
Yes, it was milk.

131
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:10.720
Jules was asking for flavours like, We chose pineapple.

132
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.000
I think so flavours.

133
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.440
So we will be attaching everything separately in these glasses only.

134
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:25.330
He was asking for sugar and the water was asking for ice, of course.

135
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.940
So we will be like attaching everything in these glasses separately.

136
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.970
And after which we will be having a total of five glasses.

137
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.920
So I, in the fifth step will be having a total of five glasses.

138
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.570
This is amazing.

139
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:50.800
Total of five glasses will be made in order to complete this project.

140
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.340
It will be made OK to be made.

141
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:06.270
So they have like a gender gap idea about what to are going to me while like creating this project in

142
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.000
our compiler side or whatever we see.

143
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.140
And after the creation of these five classes.

144
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:21.040
Except for the main glass like we have for things, for the menu items and beverage glass, which will

145
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:29.260
be consisting all the items in the menu in a combined manner and OK, so if they are mean glass, it's

146
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.680
also mean they'll make it in six six glasses as a whole.

147
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.580
And this main glass will be consisting on their phone.

148
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.610
Yes.

149
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:43.540
So basically, it is a form and we are filling this form in order to complete our orders.

150
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:51.580
So you now get like gathering all the idea about this application in the next five, they will be looking

151
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:59.500
up to clear things off a new project in our compilers and then starting coding part of this project.

152
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:06.310
So see you in the next little definition of a new project in the compilers tanky.
