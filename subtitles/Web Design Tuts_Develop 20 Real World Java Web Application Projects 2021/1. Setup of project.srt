1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:11,140
Averting projected job losses in going to a one blog is a name is going to bloom and is the name given

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,560
by me.

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,850
You can choose another name, any other name.

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:24,860
It's not compulsory when choosing the name, but I prefer names, according to Bloom in this blog or

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,740
against the system.

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:33,100
What I'm going to do, I'm going to add some admins and I'm going to connect to people using Java.

7
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:42,480
Oh, also, I just want to add one on nutrition information, also giving the information page for the

8
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,640
solar so nearby police station.

9
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,940
I'm going to try some logic behind this.

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,200
So.

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,210
This project is based on Jelavic DSP jealously and the software deployment I am using here.

12
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,260
I will tell you what is adjacent each and everything.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,530
So our project is a block system and we are going to create one block system platform.

14
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,780
We can say we took our app basically.

15
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,550
So we are going to use it.

16
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,340
So our project is.

17
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,290
Basically, develop a block system platform, we are going to develop a Block 16 platform.

18
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,960
But the people around the globe using Java technology.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:35,050
So our aim is very basic, but what we are going to develop, it's very important here because we are

20
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,000
performing with this Java, so we need to take some on the pages.

21
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,580
We need to write and just be pages and JavaScript on Zoom in.

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,810
Further, considering that I am going to use some default images and some things to add and create one

23
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:58,870
beautiful UI for my website or against web application with Java or I am using your database also.

24
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:06,040
I will tell you later who I'm going to use the database and who I'm going to connected to the main database.

25
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,500
Just heaps of overdevelopment.

26
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,840
These projects where I'm going to set up my project and then understanding different tools because projects

27
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:22,200
are just not writing code, we need to mention all the libraries, each other, everything.

28
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,950
Then understanding different tools, what I'm going to use here or what is the different tools and will

29
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,490
be easier.

30
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,560
What is the significance of theses files to each and every team I am going to mention here?

31
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,070
Then some Java basics, you should know the basics.

32
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,500
I will teach you the Java six.

33
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,370
Also, what platform?

34
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,560
But sometimes due to time constraint and each and everything, I'm going to use some default URLs that

35
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,180
we, I will explain later, but use that then basic some database.

36
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,020
What is their database and what is the school statements I'm going to use here?

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,510
I'm going to use the relational database, no special database link and I am not going to use it.

38
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,650
I'm going to use your only traditional database with the relational school grounds.

39
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:11,410
Some just be basics, then Java Solid and the BBC connection and deployment of the sobero deployed on

40
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,350
the server so that see the work, the steps of development.

41
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:22,300
So just recall those types of development projects that understand different tools used go basics,

42
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,510
basics of database DSP basics, Java solution connection and deployment on the service.

43
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,490
So let us see the what is the teams?

44
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,480
I'm going to use it.

45
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,700
What are the requirements each and team?

46
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,550
So application requirements?

47
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,540
Oh, let me tell you, what is the application requirements?

48
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,550
Not always.

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,010
Our requirements are specified.

50
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,800
We cover goal or anything.

51
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,190
We need to mention the application requirements.

52
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,780
Also you.

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:57,250
So our program to display basically, I'm not going to tell you, though, that the thing is for that

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,480
purpose, I'm going to create a connection and I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do.

55
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,630
Yet I'm going to write just one Java audience.

56
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,200
What is it?

57
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,060
It's a pure java.

58
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:14,620
Other than this, I'm going to embedded Burgess b o leader in a human face to writer documents.

59
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,120
So basic knowledge, also basic concepts of the skills.

60
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,790
You should know the basic knowledge of Java.

61
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:28,600
If you have some prior knowledge of A, those sites will be very beneficial by developing this project

62
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,220
because I'm not going to explain the agenda yet.

63
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,640
I'm just giving the overview of this then some Java basic concepts.

64
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,750
Also, you hear a few million views just renting.

65
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,080
I'm not going to tell each and every part of it.

66
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:50,440
I will try to explain that, but I will tell you you can use your bootstrap also for debate.

67
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,520
But I'm not going to use here, but I'm just telling you you can use Bootstrap and Jackson's website

68
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,180
for log in at Amenas to learn what you can see me as a part of you.

69
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,820
You can use student, but I'm mentioning as admin only you can change it to the people also who log

70
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,210
in here.

71
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,990
So let me tell you, you can use it as a people also.

72
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:14,970
I'm going to.

73
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,300
This is for students on.

74
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:23,590
So that is calling people for admin, do administrative actions and for the common people.

75
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:29,030
These are the user or you can say you get the software application who is required.

76
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:37,600
Judy given pointed why I'm telling Judy given point eight is the glass servers, and even in our kids,

77
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,250
it's upwards of 1.8.

78
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:45,990
You can even detect 16's also due to what it is, and it means I'm going to use you and Oracle databases.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,690
My relational database entries, as we said, where you can directly import to your site, you need

80
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,330
to check for that and you can check for it.

81
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,670
So actually, our application requirements?

82
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,760
Let's see our functional requirements.

83
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,430
What is the functional application I'm going to use here?

84
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,040
Functional requirements first is admin.

85
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,800
There are a few admin roles here I'm going to post was this can create and post topics to be discussed

86
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,350
and report, respectively in London.

87
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,200
So basically, it can cause the topic or report of the report.

88
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,600
Like some, it's it'll Zoom entries or explicit content.

89
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:35,230
You can delete that report or we can see, post and view all the topics we discussed can search reports,

90
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:40,620
and you can take unlimited any input data reports also.

91
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,490
So that part also you can handle.

92
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:51,940
Helping in any report to further give it to the media, except you can do or can you not previously

93
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,660
posted comments or strong comments on each reporter topic?

94
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,580
So what can we handle?

95
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,640
Well, what is it that they resisted?

96
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,730
ABC and next would exercise their knees and look at the idea, and that's very unsafe so people can

97
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:13,570
put that on and people excited is very unsafe and they can pose the picture also so admin can do that

98
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,830
and can conform to that police station nearby.

99
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,950
So I am considering this scenario, you can choose any and then so this block system is the way it can

100
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,940
be reporting materials for the reporting matter and for the smart city.

101
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,270
But also you can.

102
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:38,110
So common people can do all the reports of getting logging such and go to the police station like I

103
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,340
need to report the police station.

104
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:45,760
It's not very useful in a case like emergency, but you then report to this platform on.

105
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,400
So can you previously post your comments and post on comments you generally between you and you?

106
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,650
So that's it about the functional requirements.

107
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,360
So in the next part, I'm going to tell you the what the solid basics.

108
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:06,310
But before that, what I'm doing here is I'm going to explain all of it.

109
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:13,540
So this is mainly because once you are installed, then it means I'm using Virgin and it means you can

110
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,720
check for stable working, then you can look like this.

111
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,690
Well, there is one new window for you.

112
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,130
What is needed here to find a new project?

113
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,290
So.

114
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,680
Once you hit new project.

115
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:38,280
You can see this is my new project and you can see job of it.

116
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,360
We'll do it next.

117
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,810
You can choose the location.

118
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:45,840
Coming.

119
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,570
Blue.

120
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,310
So I'm putting like this going to look, you can use the Digital Library for sorting libraries.

121
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,680
So I'm mentioning this heat.

122
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,070
The next you can choose server.

123
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,990
I took the glasses server this next.

124
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,850
Don't lose anything here because we are not going to use your antique finish.

125
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,860
You can use jealous little faces.

126
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,830
You try everything you can.

127
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:21,000
That's not really matters here, but you mean what I mentioned here, so it will take time to check

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,450
everything.

129
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,880
It will create the next door page for you.

130
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,570
Keep it as it is, we are going with only GSP pages.

131
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,380
We are not including be just as our friend.

132
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:37,330
In part, we are going with JCP pages because I don't want to write your Java world, which connects

133
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,610
to the extreme.

134
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,240
And so I will.

135
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:45,780
And but it might just be all we can say Java code in this game, so it will be very helpful in developing

136
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,170
the code.

137
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,060
So on the left side, you can see this, and this is my good looking.

138
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:59,120
So this is the default war which created only 2.8 content supplied and everything you're going to see.

139
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,050
On this, you can dig the projects here.

140
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,490
Well, once you claim this, it will load off, I won't see the ladies lavatories.

141
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,020
So this package is filled with packages for you on figuration points.

142
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,750
If you want to add JDK, you need to install the Java X-ray load.

143
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,740
So let me add that Java folder inside my listings.

144
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:29,760
Let me add to Java X, which basically contains Java, because while they were living this, I understood

145
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,140
that my JDK doesn't contain this or does not contain these Java XDR.

146
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,840
So if you want, you can download it from the way it's freely available and just you don't, then it

147
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,880
will load that file so it will take time to load that.

148
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,520
Once it is loaded, you can see here that's left.

149
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,510
Also, you need some database connectors.

150
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:56,820
Follow whatever you need or GBC what I call GTV to connect or 09:46 according to your TV.

151
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:01,080
See on television and for my school, you need a MySpace connector.

152
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,910
So that's it for the setup.

153
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,940
If you want to check whether it's your running load, what you are going to do well, click here.

154
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:15,660
On This Morning, look likely you can see many options here, keep it clean and be.

155
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:25,090
So if your window is not opening your window, you get out so you can see the window you.

156
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,190
So you can use this as output.

157
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:44,250
So intriguing, because these are my quoting, and I can check out some here to look at this.

158
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,210
OK, so this is my outputting and you can see me successful if you want to try what you are going to

159
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,390
do.

160
00:11:51,020 --> 00:12:01,430
Click here and then so it will move to the daily and you to see Glasby server visiting the references.

161
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,520
Globe is running really successful when this is when this is done, you can check.

162
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,760
This is my Golden Globe localist 2002.

163
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,390
If you're code is modular.

164
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:24,290
A defiant domestic family in a last resort and changing it to random because whatever happens or regulatory

165
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:33,100
service is also guilty, so you will move to the part that you do basically not very useful content.

166
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,460
I can see block ADHD and also block sort simultaneously.

167
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,110
More can be done and me, me, be probably not when you are doing this.

168
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,090
So changes do not do as I change you.

169
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,570
So this is my idea and the least successful.

170
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,790
So let's think about how we can deploy this.

171
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,420
Everything.

172
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,030
So basically just a solid liquid.

173
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,940
So what I'm going to do, you need to.

174
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,680
You don't need this index statistic, but you don't just do this.

175
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,380
What are you going to look like here if they just click new?

176
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,710
And let me.

177
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,770
Open this all the pages in New Jersey.

178
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,470
So when this is done, New Jersey change it to the next day because this is not enough.

179
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,770
I'll always remember indexes basically for the loading there.

180
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,020
And click here.

181
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,900
And once this is done, you can check here.

182
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:43,110
India's largest is done and it will write content for you directly letting you know using it quite hard.

183
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,610
Well, what I'm going to do is.

184
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,910
Index page.

185
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,450
So let me.

186
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,030
So as soon as Elizabeth is doing the running, you can check here and let me tell you this.

187
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:10,610
So what you're going to do is click here, delete and delete spot, so it will do so if you know what,

188
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,560
do this or let me copy this because I'm going.

189
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,410
We'll hear.

190
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,170
And let me run this again.

191
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,840
So you then stick India's or disputed GST bases and island, which is condensed Hollywood.

192
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:35,230
So that's a total we can no longer do is we don't change the index or GSP because it's a industry.

193
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,470
And what we can see configuration is already retained.

194
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,160
So this is it who I'm going to perform this.

195
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:52,030
So in the next part, what I'm going to mention here or what I'm telling you, we are going to perform

196
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,770
these actions.

197
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:58,470
I will explain the solar part and I'm proceeding with the functional requirements.

198
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,140
I will check for each and every financial requirement step by step.

199
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:11,890
And I will tell you that within this session, we are going to perform few administrative actions and

200
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:18,220
three common people actions, as I mentioned earlier with the functional requirements before proceeding

201
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:18,880
with the project.

202
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,910
You should have some bad knowledge about Java, and it's good.

203
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,330
So I will tell you what is the basis of.

204
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:30,100
So let's do the basics of GCP in the later part of district.

205
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,400
We'll.
