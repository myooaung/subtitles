1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:11,080
So in previous videos or explanations, I told you how we are proceeding with this, so I imported this

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,770
in my.

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,220
And know what I'm going to do.

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,660
I'm going to mention some code here.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,640
So let me go to the project's structure.

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,000
You can change the views.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,640
Your package is also here.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,550
You can check or you can see a project structure also.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,500
So instead of C mean in Java, you can say this is my package basically.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,020
So I don't want to go any further part.

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,530
So what I can do, I can just switch to the package view and inside the package you I can see the packages

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:37,930
also.

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:44,170
So this is all the things and application properties, which is basically the application things here.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,610
So as you can see, this application properties files, you can check your.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,550
So let me close this, and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to invoke some things here in the district.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,680
What I'm going to mention is basically.

17
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:17,630
So before going in for their part, I need to mention one thing here, or as I told you, I'm going

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:24,470
to use your one csv file, which is basically from raw data files, and I'm using your one raw data

19
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:24,740
file.

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,280
It is deploying in every day.

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,600
It is updating it enabled.

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:29,900
It is.

23
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,940
I'm going to fetch data from that.

24
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:38,620
You can use any other team, but my recommendation is just check for their headers, check for each

25
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,740
CSP file or not.

26
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,960
So these are some important things.

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:49,520
So in this part, what I'm going to do, I'm going to mention one thing here.

28
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,450
So let me click this.

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,330
So, OK, so let me play this clip, Nunieh.

30
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,490
I'm grading Java class here.

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,160
Yeah, well, you can use this software you can buy, you name.

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,250
Well, you can go to class.

33
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,350
Well, let me go with click new.

34
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,310
York nice.

35
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,570
This daughter.

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,690
OK, so what they're going to do again will be accepted on.

37
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,960
In this application.

38
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,610
Can you?

39
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,220
Don't.

40
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,140
Now, what I'm going to mention is, is this really good on our data service?

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,430
So what it will do, it will create a service package with some this, which is basically our class

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,790
and it is going to fetch their data for us.

43
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,870
So clearly tender.

44
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,640
So.

45
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:14,760
What is happening, basically, it's created a service, so if they go to packaging, you can see some

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,880
of these issues created here.

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,330
These are my another package and let me.

48
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,050
Go with that same.

49
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,470
It means respond.

50
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:38,660
So this is my package of it, I can with this, and this is basically a person who I import in this

51
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:38,950
pilot.

52
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:39,980
So.

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,850
I need to mention that you are a little first.

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,360
So what I'm going to do is I'm giving up.

55
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,890
Your private.

56
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,310
That big.

57
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,680
You are a little basically, I would say, which is basically strong on reaching.

58
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,510
And the name is I'm going to specify, is my restaurant.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,150
So you can use anything, but I already ordered some part here.

60
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,310
What is it that you are in?

61
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,980
And let me with this.

62
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,640
Let me mention on the date of failure, or we can say, you are here.

63
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,880
You can use any other thing here.

64
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:27,970
But as I told you, you new, you need to maintain the law basically to see if people check for it.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,080
CSP before I not.

66
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:37,360
If it's not the CSP, you have to take the CSP if I'm using the raw data failure.

67
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,530
As I told you, I mentioned Engineer Little Project of fighting.

68
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,700
So why this data, religion not.

69
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:53,520
So now what I'm going to do is, oh, let me create one thing here.

70
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,040
Let me mention something here.

71
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:05,820
So this is basically the statistics, but I need to open this list in one location status because it's

72
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,660
location wise.

73
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,520
I need to create one list here.

74
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,200
So let me mention this list.

75
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,700
So I'm going to explain what is this?

76
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,780
Let me on this, basically.

77
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,400
And what I'm going to do is.

78
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,360
Let me start at these two locations starts, I'm going to explain you.

79
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,650
What is the useful thing here?

80
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,730
You mentioned it.

81
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,590
So this is the basic thing I mention.

82
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,810
Now, let me create one thing here to basically list public list.

83
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,330
Location start with all that, so it will get the all statistics from that.

84
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,040
So these are the locations then.

85
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,600
So I will explain later.

86
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,570
What I'm going to do this year.

87
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,870
So I'm just invoking the other and.

88
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,960
What I'm going to do is I need to create one method to fish that things.

89
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:08,560
So in this class, only after the closing, this let me mention one method to finish the data.

90
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,110
So let me create public.

91
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,800
Boy.

92
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,340
Which Kobe began begin to pitch does data.

93
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,830
This is my.

94
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,890
So.

95
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,270
OK.

96
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,670
As I told you, we need to mention this again, I need to mention the decision.

97
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm going to create location.

98
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,940
Don't worry about it.

99
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,750
I will create it later.

100
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,680
Little Park, let me create one HGTV client you HGTV.

101
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,920
Client.

102
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,320
So remember, this is a Javadi.

103
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,690
And what I want to mention is you're OK.

104
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,860
So dot net job is to decline for you.

105
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,070
And let me create one client which is basically name as it was this you are supposed to.

106
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,740
Lyon gives equal to.

107
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,290
New.

108
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,320
And she learned.

109
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,410
So this is all about how well I'm going to do this.

110
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,450
OK?

111
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,220
I forgot to mention our client is not in this physically and.

112
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,900
I will explain this again.

113
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,260
OK.

114
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,420
What a thing is to to create a strategic plan for the sickly HTP.

115
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,220
Client daughter new.

116
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,780
I should be glad.

117
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,720
That's it, I need to engineer a strategic plan to receive the client request.

118
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,540
So let me create one builder team.

119
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,050
What is the thing is we disagree.

120
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,260
Did you request?

121
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,990
Did request oh, let me mention this as a request only so variable.

122
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,760
You can use anything here.

123
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,960
Extremely request equal to request.

124
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,420
With some builder class, which is basically issue to be.

125
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,610
Request not newbuild.

126
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,230
Or we can say, the new building on new media.

127
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:41,290
Not so mentioned in the note, as I told you over the days, you are a not so you are, I think I need

128
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,330
to mention yet you are Ireland's.

129
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,270
You are.

130
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:54,280
So your eye is basically nothing but integrated, you can see your eye create, and I'm going to mention

131
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,270
this latest data.

132
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,730
What are you hearing?

133
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:06,100
Plus, I mean, I need to mention one thing here is Bill, I need to build this, so build.

134
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:17,390
So I mentioned this, so we already created this, so I need to mention one thing here is or this is

135
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,860
basically to give you oral, I think this is what I need to mention me to.

136
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,930
You are I have your eyes embedded.

137
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,260
So I need to create one in Britain here.

138
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,520
And I mentioned this.

139
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,590
So forget about these things.

140
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,040
I'm going to create the ArrayList for that purpose to store the location.

141
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,240
I already created this.

142
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,680
I'm going to run this project after all the things I invoke.

143
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,150
Let me just do one thing.

144
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,250
Whenever there is a.

145
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,890
This thing.

146
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,200
Let me.

147
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,370
Buddhist part.

148
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,940
What I'm going to do is.

149
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,520
System.

150
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,320
Don't start.

151
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,300
Request so this can be sorry.

152
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,200
Or we cannot bring the request here.

153
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,690
If you want to do you then put in the request also, but before that we need to create a string framework

154
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,090
here because it's not a string first.

155
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,980
We need to make a string here.

156
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:34,360
So what I'm going to do is to be responsible and also response.

157
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,810
Then inside this response, I'm going to mention one.

158
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,110
It's a string framework string.

159
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,690
Use this thing only not a small thing, because we are going to handle the.

160
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,500
And limiters also to be responsible young engineer.

161
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:57,730
Computer science is equal to what I'm going to do is gland.

162
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,820
This client or send.

163
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,580
Now, I want to mention the GDP response.

164
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,980
So first is basically request.

165
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:19,460
So this is basically we can say we are working with client request, and this model in the spring framework

166
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,410
only is should you be.

167
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,890
For this purpose, what is the thing is, if do re responsibility?

168
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,900
Its GDP response.

169
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,870
Not body handlers.

170
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,630
Then again, not all.

171
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,710
Bring.

172
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,880
OK, so.

173
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,360
What I need to mention is here is basically.

174
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:11,630
A GDP response, not body handler's offspring thing, knots, things like things.

175
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,960
Let me do this again.

176
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,170
So, OK.

177
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,250
So it is telling me to.

178
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,360
OK, so our example is not close.

179
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,690
Are you exceptional?

180
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:46,980
That's.

181
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,310
Year.

182
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,550
I exception.

183
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,530
And interrupted exception, I need to engineer.

184
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,240
Because we are going to face that is exceptional.

185
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,170
So we are going to do this.

186
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,050
So let me do one thing.

187
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,140
Let me invoke.

188
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,310
This.

189
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:46,840
Directly, OK, so what the missing thing is, I'm specified this so this can be general data.

190
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,530
Sometimes we mentioned this request with this.

191
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,980
And what I can do, I can put into this to.

192
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:58,870
OK.

193
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,470
So in looking over this application, what I can do.

194
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,150
I can run this application.

195
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:13,390
So let's check it's raining or not, if there is an error, we are going to develop this and we're going

196
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,380
to check that part.

197
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:22,870
So currently sticking big, it's raining and Eugen, everything it's doing running my way and is also

198
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,790
distracting the part of that.

199
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,910
So it will take time to run each and everything.

200
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,210
Once this is done.

201
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,420
You can say this is the.

202
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:46,350
Thing which is removed in future, but our spring will be doing very well.

203
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,060
And I can see change this.

204
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,760
This started Google application.

205
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,930
Gillian is running low.

206
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:04,450
So this hour, basically the application is running, it is building, subletting, everything is running

207
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,360
in the spring, is working very late spring.

208
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,310
So this is basically warning in check.

209
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:18,720
And as I told you, I'm just printing this part only, so it will print the info part on this.

210
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,320
And.

211
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,940
So our response thing is very simple.

212
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,750
So I will remove this in later part.

213
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:37,280
Let me create one thing or let me add one dependency injection here.

214
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,090
So other dependency injection is nothing but one, oh.

215
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,660
What we can say is comms failure.

216
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,350
So let me copy it from them.

217
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,320
Let me go to the.

218
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:01,280
Do not open here, you can check on your only, so let me go to the project in here.

219
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:10,000
Let me go to the bombed out and so I need to mention one dependency, so I will add it here, which

220
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:16,370
is basically in constant CSP and which is basically the for the common thing here.

221
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,930
So you can check your.

222
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,100
Injection, so let me look this part.

223
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:29,490
So it is resolving all our dependencies, and if the dependency on digital download that, so this is

224
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:36,210
the basic thing of what we can say are taking each and everything.

225
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,780
So the dependency injection here.

226
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,640
So as you can see, our dependency injected very well, which is basically a budget outcomes.

227
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,970
So what is the basic thing I'm using here is while bringing the data, I don't want to mention it as

228
00:16:54,010 --> 00:17:00,750
a comma separated, I need to mention it says, handling the request and development.

229
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,740
So I invoke that mark.

230
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,130
So later, I will explain how this is going to work.

231
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,720
So for things, I'm going to take this part also.

232
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:19,710
Let me add to three things more here, all because due to time constraint, I don't want to specify

233
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,650
how much more time in that you can use directly these things.

234
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:35,140
So let me mention that breakfast, and it's very useful by just basically feet, but nothing more to

235
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,130
this listening reader.

236
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,740
I'm going to use it later because.

237
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,620
And OK.

238
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,920
Let me import jail, what are your dog's bottom?

239
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,460
Style, then it's also.

240
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:59,030
Started to use one thing using Java, you can import all the libraries.

241
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,360
Let me mention here these importing.

242
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,100
So you can take I importing the libraries, well, these are the some system for libraries here.

243
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:18,470
And let me add one more thing is basically about a single with string reader, which is basically terrible.

244
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,310
It is nothing but checking this again and again.

245
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,730
So.

246
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,990
Again, what is the thing is basically OK or dental?

247
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,390
So all.

248
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,920
I'm going to pretend.

249
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,910
So it will create glass and each and everything you look at.

250
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,360
Let me do the Slater.

251
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,810
So it will import this, and this is we already done it, POM for.

252
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,230
And I mentioned England before in Europe, or you can check the documentation of commerce on the available

253
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,800
internet, but commerce isn't the thing, but it will take all those sites, though, as in this little

254
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,490
file or we can set you get off table, there are already hurdles.

255
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:08,490
In further part, I'm going to mention extremely busy on Zoom and we are going to depend that part and

256
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,000
we need to store some locations also in our system.

257
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,990
So I will tell you how we are going to do that.
