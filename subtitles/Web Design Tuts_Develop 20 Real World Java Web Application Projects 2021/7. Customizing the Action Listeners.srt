00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,570
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:10,070
So let us quickly summarize what we have learned by far, do this, not a dumb application.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,950
So from the beginning, we have created a notepad class.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:23,420
We have created menu items as finally health and enzyme PHI.

5
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,290
We have, I didn't know, open Steve damage options inside the edit menu bar option.

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:37,330
We have added cut copy paste selector and inside the help menu, but we have added the about section

7
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,280
of this noted down application.

8
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:46,030
Also, we have added a text area which is the soul of this text editor noted down.

9
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:53,620
So then we have also set a title for the main body of the frame, which we have today.

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:03,490
We have added the file open different option to the constructor so that it becomes working.

11
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:11,320
We have added similarly the added options to the structure, and then we have created a scroll bar for

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,210
the text data.

13
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:21,310
So we have created a text area and it is very necessary that it should be scrolling like we can't type

14
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:27,280
a single line in the code and wait for it to complete this project.

15
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,390
We have to make a proper functioning text editor.

16
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:38,860
This is the goal of making this application that we can write in finite number of lines in our text

17
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,170
file editor, save it, print or read whatever we want to do with it.

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,400
So I asked.

19
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:51,390
Now, everybody in the Northeast has a action attached to it.

20
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:57,530
Like, if we click in the new file, we have to open a new window in the northwest.

21
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,320
When we click on the open file action listener button, we have to open a file from our computer like

22
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,570
previously saved file, already present existing file in our computer.

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,780
And if we click on the save button, then we then the computer next.

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,410
Whenever we want to save scene, it should open similarly for an exit card and copy.

25
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,140
So now.

26
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,800
Yes.

27
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:36,220
So the Action Perform event is called here as a function, and it has a radius conditional operators

28
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,530
if inside event is.

29
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:48,450
So for the new option we have created, if conditional law, which says that by default, this app opens

30
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:57,300
up a new window is open by default, which is initially set to narrow the text inside the text area

31
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,380
is set to null.

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:07,560
Similarly, the at once we have to click only one button so that if we click on the new button, then

33
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,200
this option is going to be performed if clicking on.

34
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,270
So let me just add options to it like we have.

35
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:22,420
Save Martin inside the file menu bar, we have brilliant action.

36
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:31,600
We have an exit button, which helps us stoke escape through the application.

37
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:42,640
We have our edit option, such as cut copy paste, as if we are writing something.

38
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:51,310
The main news is of copying and pasting like suppose we have to paste some data from another resource.

39
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,550
Then we have to use this paste option.

40
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:02,230
So suppose if the application does not contain a paste option, is it be fruitful?

41
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,970
No, not at all.

42
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,820
A paste option is very important.

43
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:16,930
So adding it to the queue dialectal, suppose we have to write this text like suppose you are composing

44
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,790
an email or something like that?

45
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,290
So we have we want to write it in the notepad, in the offline one.

46
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:32,500
So we wrote the content and want to select all at once with a single button or with a mouse, with a

47
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,220
single click.

48
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:42,160
So this select all option contains that feature and about return, which gives us our intro about this.

49
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,010
Now let us check what is left.

50
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:55,300
We have an open new save button, exit card, copy paste selector, and I think we have covered all

51
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,750
of them.

52
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,720
Yes, new open save print tags.

53
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,810
We have a total of 10 things which need to be action lists.

54
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,710
And so one two three four five six seven eight nine 10.

55
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,810
So yes, we are done.

56
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,780
So let's remove this extra one.

57
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:14,980
Yes.

58
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,100
So customize this save button.

59
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,300
Like what action to be performed when it does seem?

60
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,210
Button we have already decided is that what is going to happen when you click the new button?

61
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,830
Now an action should be attached with the save button as well.

62
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,700
So if we write some text in the notepad, we want to save it.

63
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:52,930
So calling the default user component from that swing library of job the weekend, we are going to do

64
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,040
the same thing.

65
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:03,730
So do file user naming the method as file user and a new keyboard with a different user.

66
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,210
Yes.

67
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,710
So how do we add this function is invoked here?

68
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,060
Different user.

69
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:21,340
Now we have two steps select that in which format we want to save our text like we have previous extensions

70
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,370
attached to files.

71
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,940
You must have seen them in some of them.

72
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,570
We have that PDF in some of them.

73
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,250
We have got MP three, not MP for like four videos.

74
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:41,080
We have an extension of the time before, so it is already decided in the program that what action is

75
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,700
to be see what action, what extension is to be added to this side.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,990
So in the text, we declare that this text really is going to be saved as the dot the extension.

77
00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:01,350
So in initializing this as file name extension for it to.

78
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,790
We are going to add a filter that filters that to the extreme.

79
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,720
Tax extension.

80
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,280
Text filter.

81
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:25,310
And I knew you weren't saying that by extension further.

82
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:38,240
And in putting a string and saying this, my turn as only text files, only text files.

83
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,140
Yes.

84
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,100
And in bracket, I'm going to add the dark extension like this.

85
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,090
So I think this is done and.

86
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,030
60 as history also.

87
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,070
Now closing, the statement has.

88
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:13,520
Now, if we want to save anything, we have to open the file to the menu from our system.

89
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:20,990
So how to open that file, choose an option like let me show you what I want to see.

90
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,690
So I'm running the program.

91
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,880
We have our notepad window.

92
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,850
Let us try to type some random text and suppose we want those saved.

93
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,940
So on clicking on the save button.

94
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:42,860
There should be a file to get off of this backstop, our system should be open so that we can choose

95
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,980
that we want to save this file like in which folder?

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,720
What will be the.

97
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,520
Well, this will be saved.

98
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,090
So let's adamantine for that.

99
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,590
So this is going to be fine, chooser.

100
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,380
Dart said, accept all figures.

101
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,390
That acceptable file will try to use.

102
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,730
Yes, this is the matter.

103
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,680
And then say, we are going to end up Boolean argument as follows.

104
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,350
Sure.

105
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,190
This is said to be false as the only one that the ex defines.

106
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,310
So again, find chosen and choose bill.

107
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,820
Fine center.

108
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,530
And inside this, we can only allow this text further.

109
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:43,400
Like, we cannot make it as in Vietnam before on anything else, we just simply want a text from the

110
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,310
inside the.

111
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:52,760
So yes, no, that action is initialized us into action.

112
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,690
And while chooser.

113
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,170
Tuned show save low.

114
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,600
And it is no.

115
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:17,280
So now let us try to run this on running this not and our Java clicking on the run Java and waiting

116
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,830
for the program to execute.

117
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,790
Yes.

118
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,250
So let's try to type something.

119
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,300
Hello, wine.

120
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,790
I am a Java developer.

121
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:30,900
Yes.

122
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,850
The text is ready.

123
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,980
Now, suppose you want the same.

124
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,900
So initially there are no action performed by clicking the button.

125
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,820
But now you can see that the action is attached to the button.

126
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,730
So I'm clicking on saved words and actions should perform.

127
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:53,190
So yes, button on opening this and clicking the same button.

128
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:58,650
This is open file choose option from your system and you can save it.

129
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,290
Hello, the see there is a text filter, which of it only takes twice.

130
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:15,000
We added only text filters, so it showing that somehow load on the X2 and sequencing so they should

131
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,570
be saved in your system.

132
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,940
Let us check for it.

133
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,590
See?

134
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,890
Inside documents searching for it.

135
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,220
Shouldn't be a lot of Java.

136
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,870
So there are no fires.

137
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:44,320
There are some more modifications needed to be made in this actual listener, so action and content.

138
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:55,270
If else conditional, which says, OK, so I've been this lion get exception handlers.

139
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,390
Now we can see our fine, I'm going to see the results.

140
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,460
So I'm running this.

141
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,010
And aren't some random attacks like hello, everyone.

142
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,150
And try to save it by clicking on the same model.

143
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,450
Suppose I want to save it in the next door.

144
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,610
And name it as hello.

145
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,740
Only a text file folders as we have attended.

146
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,320
Now, let us see that it is saved in the next dump or not.

147
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,420
So when we open again, the next stop.

148
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,740
Yes.

149
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,010
So, yes, hello.

150
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,700
Not be successfully saved.

151
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,770
So the save option is completely functional.

152
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:53,130
Now for in a similar way like this, try to make this print option also functional.

153
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,680
So for the print case, that is a simple logic, which opens up any window.

154
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,220
Data not linked to call this and.

155
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,440
And not try and catch exception.

156
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,730
Makes think things from the not been ready.

157
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:25,330
So inside the catch, we have to call it for being the exception.

158
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,120
So bring that exception.

159
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,290
The that exception, it's so.

160
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,720
X.

161
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:49,590
So they're trying to get blocks out of corn now inside this longer.

162
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:00,010
Is to get get longer and then say we have been protests.
