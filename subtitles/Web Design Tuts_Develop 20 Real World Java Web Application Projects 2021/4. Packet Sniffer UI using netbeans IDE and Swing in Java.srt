1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:11,300
If you already seen the previous record year, you should understand that that's pretty I waiting.

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,110
I know you did.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,360
Just checking my arse.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,670
Target Target is not doing much any well.

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:28,310
I guess I'm not considering any special visit, but the sources will be able to victim or we can take

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,680
that that far.

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,320
All we can say about it is lay on network or not, that part we are checking.

8
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,120
So it's not actually really useful thing at all.

9
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:47,840
I'm telling you, but we can create a more advanced scene using for loop, or you can check your board

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,150
numbers also inflate more jingle plays and we can.

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,560
Wireshark are also available for Portuguese water board training.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,290
We are taking the open pools and closed ports, which is closed but basically connected.

13
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,910
But if we find there is one or one boat as we don't do that disconnected apart, so we know that that

14
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,540
pool is not connected at all.

15
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:15,950
So such things like net for the source IP, that water is open.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,810
No, what we can do using that, or we can connect to that source.

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:29,000
So for further information gathering into cybersecurity complexity, border checking the ports and everything,

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,660
according to the networking and everything.

19
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,570
So they fired in consideration in bargaining between.

20
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,330
But we are not bothered about that.

21
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,300
So that's really the part we create that's not exactly packaged only for the.

22
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:53,220
Look for I guess it should all use that package link is to keep order that should use some be kept files

23
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,650
directly read in that files.

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,160
So for that purpose, we need some tangible knowledge.

25
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,650
So know what I'm considering.

26
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,620
I'm doing my job.

27
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,950
Are you waiting here?

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,090
Not very.

29
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,420
Difficulty, I'm getting very simple.

30
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:17,860
Which is going to boil down to two weeks is it's not going to work for 64 existing you because of some

31
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,610
liabilities.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,850
But on any system independent.

33
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,120
But if you are using Linux, see more Windows are to do with system.

34
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,350
It will be very useful.

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,880
Plus, you can maintain the libraries and you can perform it.

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,120
Let let let us see how we can perform this.

37
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,910
So in the later part, I'm going to use one marine program room to create one long project also, which

38
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,240
is very helpful by developing this application.

39
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:50,260
So we will check that part later, and I will tell you why I'm using my vignette for dependencies and

40
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,670
everything else.

41
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:59,380
So instead of using an automated, I'm going to be using here because we are not proposing any application

42
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,510
was not a mobile application.

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,770
So here we are considering only two scenarios and developmental modern development, but for the dependencies

44
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,930
and to use merit in the next project.

45
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:18,340
So in the first part, only I thought this tutorial is based on two people objects.

46
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,960
So first project is done.

47
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:25,150
We created the orb checking in and everything that's not approved project next decade.

48
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,720
And now we are on the second part how we can create the UI and everything.

49
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:37,150
So let me move it to Java classes, and that's why I'm telling you such a basic thing here, because

50
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,180
we know we have been using Mavin.

51
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,870
I'm not going to discuss this.

52
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,070
But second thing for the Mavin classes and methods are very important.

53
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,800
So let us see how we're going to it.

54
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:53,900
So Java class and visitors, so everything is in Java is associated with classes without Java.

55
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,390
You cannot create a single core off line, also not even the Hello program.

56
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:06,730
So for that purpose, class animator's, so Java is secure language because we can create classes and

57
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:13,330
methods directly on object PowerShell, object oriented, not object oriented classes, but my language.

58
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,180
But we can recreate classes and methods.

59
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,030
So what is class in real life?

60
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,130
You can then sort of Cartesian object and God has some attributes.

61
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:33,790
So what is the God of God is a class who did object and then 01. when Garbrandt for an object, it has

62
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,560
been inactive, such as coloring.

63
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:45,280
But it has also made us also like fundamentals that are different things very then that I then open

64
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,240
noodle when everything mentioned also Naxal methods.

65
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,860
So what we can do, we can create a god.

66
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:57,430
Plus we can put some attributes, you can create methods and we can even it using wonder.

67
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,360
So that's a really fundamental thing related to the classes.

68
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:10,900
Plus, it's like an object concept why we need a great object to invoke classes and invoke methods or

69
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:17,350
use that the dark, slick integers or anything we have to use while performing any coding language.

70
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,550
So for that purpose, we needed these classes.

71
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:28,240
Also, some user defined attributes, possible user inputs, anything objects to use glasses.

72
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,950
We need to acquire an object.

73
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:30,940
We don't object.

74
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,710
We cannot invoke or use particular class.

75
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:41,530
Then let's see what is the class syntax is basically these symbols class name.

76
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:47,680
In this line, you have to mention some more explicitly flat, which is public, private or anything.

77
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,440
Yeah.

78
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,570
Hope you understand this.

79
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,480
So I just read this.

80
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,000
So it's symbolically deleted the Java class.

81
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,610
So let me show you how I'm going to put on you.

82
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,410
So I already couldn't use one.

83
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:04,960
OK.

84
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,450
So.

85
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:15,110
So we are going to use your one liability name as Jiffy Cap, the emerging big cat.

86
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:23,780
Another thing we are going to use Java for cleaning and everything, and Java is one most common thing

87
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,140
here.

88
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,500
So let us see what is the jib cap?

89
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,970
First, it's working for you need is in the different packages.

90
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,500
So what do you do?

91
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,380
I created this employment packet receiver, which is basically duplicate one.

92
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,200
You then is asking for it in Republic.

93
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,520
Remember, it should be public.

94
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:51,470
But if you created your private, then it acts as a private network, so it will check for PCB packets

95
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,180
in private network only.

96
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,130
So remember considerably as fdcp it be.

97
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,460
And I see, I assume, before the incoming message meaning.

98
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,360
But so if you want to read more, I'm going to be one layer.

99
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,210
Cuisinart is deceptively simple.

100
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,710
You get two different different in Syria.

101
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,410
We show you how we can perform here.

102
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,100
So let me put public static.

103
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,890
It's due to be.

104
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,400
Thank you for support.

105
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,040
So we're doing it for.

106
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,330
Union to create glass.

107
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,490
All you need to mention that parcel, you need to create this class.

108
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,120
So I'm not at all mentioning this.

109
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,180
So let me move this.

110
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:49,070
So I am not considering HDTV because it's very common and you will get full GDP only because once you

111
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,620
connect connected to reality, it should give you back.

112
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,330
It's going to be a spec.

113
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,180
It's contiguous, so I'm not going to get that part.

114
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,670
Then Willie said, I created one lists I released for this.

115
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:11,260
Then I created one metal this--you package with constructor lists, rescue package, public void and

116
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,240
oh, the instance of Quebec.

117
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,960
The very important part you have mentioned this part in this is for a link.

118
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,560
I'm visiting Quebec it.

119
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,870
I had no money for no BC Phillip BBQ sauce.

120
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,120
I DCB and I did that as a ticket.

121
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:45,640
So do we add in the object as a rule or rule in that at least this at least released, and then it will

122
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,340
add this sniffer, which will end this?

123
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:55,570
Now let me put all the things you sniffer, which is basically our sniffing thing.

124
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:01,660
I will tell you what this number means reaching a little packet for a second term for anything.

125
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,600
It's a brilliant message message of that part.

126
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:15,820
If this is to also be discreet, just like this IP DCP again, this resource description, like what

127
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:22,030
is the source for an English radio station for indicators is just acknowledgement while if here that

128
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,150
they have some problem in networking.

129
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,090
But let me tell you that considered off one hitter so well, Hayden has some fuel filter.

130
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,640
It has also acknowledgment field.

131
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,780
So for that purpose is is seeking this case again.

132
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,200
And what do we do the let alone acknowledgement no data.

133
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,480
Now the data is very crucial.

134
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,710
I am considering printing the attack directly.

135
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:56,410
So being on this, you can perform like I'm sending a package link username, my username ABC, so I

136
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,800
see will divide into the Tea Party plus parties sending a signal by maybe second and third party Senate

137
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,130
seat.

138
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,560
So that has having dinner at eight.

139
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:13,300
I could have ended up in vacantly lunacy, so that might be known as key goals or another team model

140
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,580
that might do nothing more go down as he is going to do by binary.

141
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,280
So that's could be subpoenaed or not.

142
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:28,420
I'm going to determine who the actual date of the lindqvist sequence or the sequence of that offset

143
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:34,030
then hinted about is that all leading parts more after this.

144
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,440
And if I were able to create which is?

145
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,010
Extremely well.

146
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:48,750
We just want to add his sniffer, Gillian, with that model and model Aldgate Pro with me for no plus

147
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:56,070
plus, which is basically if they're listening for we go for that link when no is given here like one,

148
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:02,250
then it will print or to do it will be in there or it will increase and increment.

149
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,020
Operator.

150
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,090
I used to.

151
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,640
He flip phone the YouTube.

152
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,130
Then again, same thing, I'm doing it.

153
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,690
I assume you like it, iPhone, I'm doing that same steep steps you.

154
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,660
So that's done here.

155
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,380
Back it receiver part.

156
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:20,490
So.

157
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,630
Well, now let me show you the.

158
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:32,000
These are the Java box, not least pants when you consider these, these are the Java bar, that's all

159
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,510
the back end and with some, you need these, but I mean you.

160
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:47,790
This part comes just swinging utilities, rail, so why I required this part, I will tell you.

161
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,890
So that's all the get.

162
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,400
So I created did all of the banking industry, which in.

163
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,780
But someone needs to run it again and again and again.

164
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,960
For that purpose, I created this trade class.

165
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,050
So these in the trade wars and everything in the get value added value finished methods, entrapment

166
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,190
over time, get get and all the things we put enable a to be smoking.

167
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,250
So now this is this new flip.

168
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:21,720
So this is the form matter with all you can see here, but it has captured important stock buttons to

169
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,090
button freedom of everything with GP.

170
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,440
The competitor is basically for the capturing and everything in the GOP cap folded.

171
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,480
You may found on with this.

172
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,120
So my recommendation is you can design here that you are directly.

173
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,930
Once you lose this in the haze you, you will find the hazy view.

174
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,130
But capturing the look for capture, not the least of interfaces.

175
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,240
I will tell you what is the least of interfaces.

176
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,650
So I created this for the Linux.

177
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,830
But what is not for probably close Windows having only one enabling interface.

178
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,570
But while you're looking at Linux, you may find it at villain.

179
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:12,330
No idiot internet model, windows waving windows are also having some intricacies, but that's the system

180
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,020
to entries.

181
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,900
So for that purpose, I created this capture button.

182
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:23,340
As you can see this capture window, the Saltonstall Golden SEAL, it bothers me list of interfaces.

183
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,140
This filter button on the filter options have been truthful here.

184
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,570
I'm going to open that list again and again.

185
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,700
This is by getting caught up in this Higgs field so it can be the source of it.

186
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,670
So you can create design that quite directly.

187
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,830
But we need to add some GP capt also.

188
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,570
So what is the difficult contaminating it is just basically this gap too far in this part?

189
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,710
I heard it.

190
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,500
This is the interface window, so I need the window here.

191
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,730
So this is the inside in this part.

192
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,660
But for this, I need this window.

193
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,390
So I'm not.

194
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,710
Oh, excuse me.

195
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,050
So now we are done with this.

196
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,280
So let me see it clean and we.

197
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,230
I mean, we were on the notion.

198
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,190
And what do you hope they do?

199
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,020
So.

200
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,040
This withdrawal is just clinging on to reading anything seems clear of this.

201
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,660
For glasses and think again, this is very basic, if the after this, what I'm going to offer them,

202
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:53,570
I'm going to create one marinating, which is very useful, very powerful.

203
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,870
I mean it then.

204
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,930
Then he ran.

205
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,180
So it's not only.

206
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,790
Well, you can check this, in my opinion.

207
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,060
I mentioned it is unlikely to be a long day.

208
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:10,830
Anything.

209
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,210
So this is my capture part and everything.

210
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,250
So let me tell you why this is not running because it's 32 bit system.

211
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:25,850
I'm not performing on this so we can give you a list of interfaces.

212
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,950
You may find this.

213
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:35,010
GOP candidate for independent voters, Biden is not alone in this party.

214
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:42,240
It's an honor to miss him, and you may find that it's a building with glass.

215
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,390
Lauder is building with much 64 bit architecture.

216
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,330
What if John, in order to give government an not?

217
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,780
If you are interested in 2012 and running on the windows, you need to install any given point.

218
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,070
We do not want appointed for that purpose.

219
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,520
You needed this work for the whoever.

220
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,810
You can consider this as an ideal.

221
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:11,720
You so hope you understand this in the next video or next to read it.

222
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,900
I am going to be this on my window and we are going to use it.

223
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,670
That's what I will do.

224
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,620
So if you're using 32 with any architecture, these are very helpful.

225
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:33,270
People will issue all the brackets and rather than using Wireshark, if you're using virtual machines.

226
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,470
Very good idea.

227
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:42,780
Why with Green Machine is not existing system in the networking, so you may will create one more details

228
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,550
on other link existences system.

229
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,620
Then what generation, if you understand, take.
