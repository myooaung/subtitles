1
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.850
So all of you already know that we created a three minute 30-year password change password method of

2
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.260
generating random password method until I cleared it here, using that password method of using random

3
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.400
also yet then asking for department and printing them and know what I'm going to do is I'm just going

4
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.200
to say that mailbox capacity, not even in this first.

5
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.090
Also, I told by default, I wondered, but if you don't want to extend that mailbox capacity, I'm

6
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.340
asking for the same mailbox capacity, your method.

7
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.110
So after this park, I will create some.

8
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.830
Set mailbox capacity, method, mailbox capacity.

9
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.280
Method.

10
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.830
Then again, it is public.

11
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.310
As I told you, why should it really be public, because you still want to access that part where you

12
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.450
sit?

13
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.780
M. Get.

14
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.130
That's it.

15
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.570
Then no need to put any argument here, because I don't want to care if you want, you can minimize

16
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.220
this part of school system or not.

17
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.440
But in long.

18
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.600
Current capacity will bring current capacity first.

19
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.390
Current capacity.

20
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.750
Is equal to.

21
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.350
Plus this board.

22
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.310
Mill capacity.

23
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.210
And I'm considering this question here and not.

24
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.880
I know this is very loose, but I want to clearly simplify this in.

25
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.630
Then system, but there is no need to ask for what is your first capacity or something?

26
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.220
I just want to create a standard so internal capacity.

27
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.780
And there.

28
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.160
New mailbox capacity.

29
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.910
Capacity.

30
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.780
Then.

31
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.410
This dark male capacity, that part only.

32
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.760
Is equal to is not an extremely.

33
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.240
Next in digital only.

34
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.090
No need to put anything here next week and in Lake System Dot.

35
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.100
I would not.

36
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.190
In Berlin.

37
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.580
Mailbox capacity.

38
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.920
Is successfully changed.

39
00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.360
And so this is honorable in setting the mailbox, obviously, it is very easy printing first current

40
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.350
capacity, then enter the new mailbox of the city and just from the user just assigned to that new mailbox

41
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.890
capacity.

42
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.140
Similarly for that.

43
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.580
Alternatively, public.

44
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.500
What is that alternate?

45
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.020
Eamon?

46
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.990
So I will put your first.

47
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.920
Served.

48
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.210
Are.

49
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.620
Meet, you remember, commenced because it's very helpful while reading the quota system, not.

50
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.740
I would not put in.

51
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.190
And there.

52
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.570
New ultra net mail or e-mail.

53
00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:03.350
Then this dirt alternative that we created already created that part, it's not.

54
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.820
Next.

55
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.600
Then system in this very simple matter, you won't have to worry about this.

56
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.030
Alternate.

57
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.670
Men or women?

58
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.040
Is sick.

59
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.190
That's it.

60
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.360
Now, these are all about the creating or generating something.

61
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.720
But I want to create another method to display something because we are just generating, but there

62
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.410
is nothing.

63
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.170
I'm going to display here to how I can display the user information or something that part.

64
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.020
So to display user information, I will create.

65
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.010
Another matter.

66
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.410
Information meantime for that, but it should be public only public.

67
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.380
Avoid getting food and bring it in for.

68
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.720
Simple, just printing nothing.

69
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.900
Well, that system dot dot printed in this printing statement, but print statements it only.

70
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.510
This dark.

71
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.930
If name know the space between these.

72
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.610
This not in.

73
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.930
Similarly, that system.

74
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.080
Not a rental in.

75
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.670
Part.

76
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.580
Meant.

77
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.390
Plus, it will pull back burner and distort.

78
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.930
DVD.

79
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.560
Department.

80
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.810
This is then for e-mail you can put.

81
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.370
Email.

82
00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.730
Then this.

83
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.810
Not it.

84
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.900
On that user information, this.

85
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.960
Then if you want to put a password, you can put that password, but here's why it in ideal condition

86
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.170
you should not print any password or you should not display any password.

87
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.630
But for the significant convenience and I want to check it will be running or not.

88
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.250
I'm going to put you on.

89
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.950
So this product testing purpose for our application, this is not password.

90
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.320
Then again, system, not a lot, but in telling.

91
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.810
Meal box capacity.

92
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:55.200
This not mailbox, the mail capacity, the mail capacity.

93
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:03.980
And I will put your ambulance like I already mentioned, I'm putting in this ambulance in.

94
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.160
Then again, system, not a lot.

95
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.080
Alternatively.

96
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.370
Internet.

97
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.790
Male.

98
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:29.200
This.

99
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:30.860
Not.

100
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.410
Older women and their.

101
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.590
Who we are done with these matters.

102
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.910
So let's in walking into that public glass.

103
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:50.910
But before that, remember we are remaining with some other matters also still facing this.

104
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.640
But before that, I will explain that constructeur.

105
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.900
But yeah, so we already created one constructor here.

106
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.450
And before that, the grading standard of what I did is signal box capacity.

107
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:11.790
Then to change password method, alternate implementer and display user information that we plan, then

108
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.440
we want to call that methods.

109
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.390
So calling that method is very simple.

110
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.330
I can see.

111
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.060
So now I will go to this constructor party, you know?

112
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.210
And putting hair is falling.

113
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.370
Methods.

114
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.120
So now, Colin, inter-disciplinary, this not.

115
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:42.900
Department us and that department, this department is equal to this not set department.

116
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.880
What I created the department.

117
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.360
Now for the random password.

118
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.460
I will put your department.

119
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.090
First random password.

120
00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:07.130
This form password is equal to this not generated password with which I created no work, required duties

121
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.630
and wouldn't let it.

122
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:17.490
What I told you, I'm not mentioning lender because I want to put in scientists who are avoiding that

123
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:17.850
part.

124
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.770
I just put Clint here.

125
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.380
So Lent will be always it.

126
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.800
It's not really ideal condition to always lend aid.

127
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:33.810
But for the simple condition I use here, or you can do what you want, or you can choose from six to

128
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.070
15 or something like that.

129
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.450
Now.

130
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.840
I want to combine this.

131
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.140
Like generating mail, you know, that method this not.

132
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.070
What is their retirement?

133
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.210
Email?

134
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.460
This is for.

135
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.810
Email generation.

136
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.910
No, now we are done with this part, but.

137
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:11.820
This is just there is no you cannot run this like this only because you're going to there is no main

138
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.000
method to be created here.

139
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.000
We are remaining with them.

140
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.010
So this is all about part in next part.

141
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.230
What I'm going to show you how we can create momentum.

142
00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:28.410
We are going to invoke that method, including that how we can use this.

143
00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:38.430
All right, let's I'm going to show you how you can create and store that in the specific final 30 X

144
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.830
define.
