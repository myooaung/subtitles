WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.570
So in previous part, I told you how you created student depression in certain methods.

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.390
So we are done with ourselves.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.260
So the main project is focusing on webpages because using GSP or we are using.

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.580
So creating so looks is very important part because for the deep connection and we have already created.

5
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.150
So for the database connection, I will show you know what things you have to use your order, which

6
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.830
is you are you are going to use.

7
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.610
So you are seeing some queries here.

8
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.830
So this is my some database credentials for a mid-table union to create admin part of this, which contains

9
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.150
user ID and password.

10
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.650
You're Judy, no need to specify more length or I'm using that to mean that be a default part here.

11
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.680
You can use some on other matters because editing part is only in the database system configuration.

12
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.110
You cannot say I don't want to become an admin to create admin metadata or anything.

13
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.880
You can use student metadata, but no need to create some admin DSP, but you can say administer DSP.

14
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.580
So I'm inserting this and I'm switching as a default passwords.

15
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.050
Then student table for creating a student part, which contained all the little things as a name, password

16
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.520
and user ID, then instruction table, which contains instruction which is 30 percent, went on to specify

17
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.470
more in question they will, which contains question option eight, option option C, Option B and the

18
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.920
answered.

19
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.640
So we need to create some primary why we need to create primary care, because this should be unique

20
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.550
and not knowing which parties should be unique and normal.

21
00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.010
You cannot specify instruction should not be unique always or you can answer that question is always

22
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.350
a unique for the examination, but it's unique, but it should not be unique as a word to it.

23
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.770
So really, what is a unique 10 year old username and they will use a.

24
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.380
So I'm creating unique ideas.

25
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.970
What I'm doing, I'm doing as a primary and my son in that part as a primary key witness, really,

26
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.820
and this you can directly use these queries and you've been executed in your database.

27
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.660
My school or Oracle, you get these goodies.

28
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.510
So this is all about how we can set up our database.

29
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.960
Once this is done, you are done with our database part.

30
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.350
So we are not focused with only just be part.

31
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.270
So let us again move over to overages part here only.

32
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.990
So these teams are the No.

33
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.080
As I told you where you go to create just report in the webpages as we created admin.

34
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.790
Log in here.

35
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.140
Let me close all these things.

36
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.980
OK.

37
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.530
Edwin, log in Park.

38
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.860
No, we're not focused with only just be part.

39
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.480
So we are done with this.

40
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.740
So after this, we need to create an admin panel, which is urban penalties punitive.

41
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.720
So let us create an admin panel here.

42
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.930
All four.

43
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.050
Create a webpage, New Jersey.

44
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:42.390
Admin panel, or I think you can see this is direwolves new dialog box will open and you have to specify

45
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.390
the file name and special thing is the admin panel here.

46
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.430
Once this is done, delete this part, because I'm doing this part also.

47
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.740
And am.

48
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.920
Going with this only as a comment.

49
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.030
So let us be away already created this admin panel.

50
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.780
So let me use that part only.

51
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.850
OK, so now we're done with this admin panel.

52
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:29.190
Remember what, I'm using this so this page language java in these are some default things you have

53
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.550
to use.

54
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.180
Again, these are some scripts I'm using bootstrap and everything.

55
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.180
So.

56
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.270
This is username.

57
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.270
And it's done it will not steal anything because no need to specify anything.

58
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.540
If it's not done, it should specify that these log in as admin to continue.

59
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.870
As I told you in Ermine Log Industry.

60
00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:03.320
OK, despite this log in as I mean, so do that, pardon me again, I'm specifying this and welcome.

61
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.830
What is the?

62
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:13.400
This is printing the username, which is specifying from that part, and it's mercury only they're still

63
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.910
controlling.

64
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.520
Or you can see moving part in human.

65
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.130
Then what is the troops home to the endless instruction list?

66
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:30.930
Christian list also it will create some novel editing, but as I told you, we are already created controller

67
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.510
for the novel enemy combatant.

68
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.040
So we need to create that potential and question list contents.

69
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.340
Well, let's add an updated to Christian and everything.

70
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.320
So we are done with this.

71
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.180
So let me tell you what is this part?

72
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:55.290
So admin panel will contain some methods and which new order, which provides some buttons to forward

73
00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.870
some analogies, be part only if it's not providing some part like this.

74
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.230
This user name is not default, although we can say admin, not it's not me.

75
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.950
It will bring that admin little organized admin.

76
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.740
If you'd say, I mean, it will in this loop and it will go directly to this part and bring in this

77
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.730
will combine everything.

78
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.710
And same, this is done.

79
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.870
It should create some dispute.

80
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:34.620
I'm going to create student lists GSP instruction list GSP, which contains a button and an update then.

81
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.040
These are some default classes inside bootstrap only.

82
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:46.060
So this is all about this thing, so now we can see how we can predict student athletes.

83
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.120
So let me copy this part because I'm going to create a student list.

84
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.630
And I'm going to create new.

85
00:06:52.750 --> 00:07:00.400
Sorry, not this great new and just be letting creative energies be filed here and we could finish.

86
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.100
I will delete this part and record this then.

87
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.300
Also don't require this.

88
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.130
I recall only this comment on.

89
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.350
Those are.

90
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.660
It will specify what is this document for?

91
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.570
This is a document for student list.

92
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.890
So let me show you how we can create student used here.

93
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.160
So student list is very simple.

94
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.200
It's a little bit tricky, but it's very simple.

95
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.450
So I'm embodying this, what is this page important where I'm using this?

96
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.430
So I want to import some libraries here.

97
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.320
What are you against the system for things?

98
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:52.650
So in the GSP, you have to use this index imported for the importing is equal to to specify what we

99
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.600
are importing or you model dots that we are importing everything inside.

100
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.890
Oh, yes, I'm importing students.

101
00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.770
And I'm importing ArrayList here.

102
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.370
You can specify North Star also, but I'm basically a realist.

103
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:05.580
You?

104
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:15.980
Now it is in insert title, I will change this, and we do basically student no user I.D. and everything

105
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.490
you can.

106
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.120
Mention it like this, and what I'm doing is you're so tightly around instead of this.

107
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:31.600
I will print student list, that's who this will bring the student list here.

108
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.550
What is the issue number you can grade, which is basically a sequence number you can say is number.

109
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.050
You can also put into this number.

110
00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:39.900
User I.D..

111
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.320
Namely, that shouldn't.

112
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:49.830
I sort of the children, so as this is only true for the admin purpose, it should get the password

113
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.830
of that student also, so it will show the password.

114
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.060
If you don't want to show the password, you can move that part also.

115
00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.780
So I'm reading in the table or tabular manner, so I am using and.

116
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:10.860
You should know some default things inside this and list of all update and delete button and go into

117
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.100
it.

118
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.430
So I'm faking it as a student due at a least.

119
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.250
So always remember if you are reading Java.

120
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:27.960
Then inside this year to this romance and this person marks enclosed with this, you are going to use

121
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:36.060
this and all these things, then it all started for the first column I plus plus because I'm reading

122
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.450
that for loop again and again, one to three as usual.

123
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.730
Then not good user name because I'm using e studenti for that.

124
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:51.120
And remember, this is the advance for loop and set out for each loop, you can see at least.

125
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:58.000
You don't use a name, you don't get name, ID or password for the updates to then dispute now what

126
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.380
is this?

127
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:07.300
I'm going to create a new student just so it will show up to you, which is basically links you can

128
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.080
create a button on.

129
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.240
Somebody inside the table button is again taking much too much time to see.

130
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.110
This is that part.

131
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:20.440
So instead of this, I'm using audio your file, which you basically directly links to a big student

132
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.730
or delete student.

133
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.470
But again, you don't get name ID, get user username.

134
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:33.100
So remember, I hesitates to add a student's delete students of the student for that purpose.

135
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:42.620
Then this button to add student, because I need to add some students here so it will go to the admin,

136
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:48.340
in fact, if I click here back to panel, it will give the element.

137
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:53.300
And so I'm going to create admin student part on some longer student list.

138
00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:00.380
Let us see how we can create instructions because we need to specify the instruction, please don't

139
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:00.680
forget.

140
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.250
Let me create and under the GSP.

141
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.270
Which contains instruction list in which.

142
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.630
I'm deleting this because no more required part.

143
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.720
Again, this I'm sort of one only and I'm building.

144
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:23.250
OK.

145
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.890
So let us see how we can get instruction this year.

146
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.170
OK.

147
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.680
That's it.

148
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:34.820
Oh.

149
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.440
Let us see what instructions to you.

150
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:46.030
I'm importing diesel in import instruction, diesel importing DB file importing additives.

151
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.930
So let me take this as a.

152
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.630
In proportion.

153
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.500
It's.

154
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:00.620
It.

155
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.840
Again, you can specify it's no no.

156
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:14.880
Then digital, all things are related to that estimate, which content is no construction operation

157
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.750
is basically some adding or updating part or deleting.

158
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.030
Again, I'm using a.

159
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.800
If update instruction just.

160
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.680
I'm going to give it another GSP file for printing.

161
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.200
It will update you.

162
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.610
I'm I want to delete.

163
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.080
I can delete that part.

164
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:40.110
So remember, I'm what I'm going to use yet again at instruction part or the ad instruction if I want

165
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:48.570
to click back, but it will go to the back written by I'm using this part because for this is for the

166
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.650
this because it will show some I want to specify some gap.

167
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.010
So I'm specifying this as a year.

168
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.070
So this is all about ad instruction part.

169
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.710
So, Edmund panel contains all these things.

170
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.690
So question list is also remaining.

171
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.350
Let us create one question list, but honestly it.

172
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.280
You can create Grishin list here.

173
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:15.610
Just be.

174
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.420
So let me do this part again.

175
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.520
OK.

176
00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.500
And Mandy Moore despite.

177
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.170
So let me use that question list again.

178
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:44.820
Rationalist.

179
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:55.910
OK, no question list, again, similar thing I'm importing, although it's more related to this than

180
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:57.350
devises for the database.

181
00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.840
I mean, again, it has a.

182
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:07.360
Rationalist as a title, then this is and this again, is no.

183
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.920
So it will show me the opposition, then question absolutely options.

184
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.550
Correct answer.

185
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.380
Update And if you want to update that part or delete that part, I'm using this.

186
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:23.460
So this is similar as a student list, as we created using for Loop.

187
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.750
But remember?

188
00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:32.090
Whenever you are using the logic related to the Java, you need to invoke that syntax, which is basically

189
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:41.990
this state and for the clothing design, what is sensible and then angular brackets here or triangular

190
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:48.800
brackets, you then object questioning the direction GSP if you want to elevation, you can articulation.

191
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.640
Yet if you want to go to the backbench, you can look back on them.

192
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.240
So this is all about how you can be at some list here.

193
00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.890
So this is different in part of the student list, instruction list and Christian list.

194
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:08.840
So in further videos, how we are going to create some exciting GSP files related to the update operation

195
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:14.330
delete questions similar for object instruction, delete instruction, similar for object student and

196
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.170
delete student.

197
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.700
But also we need to create some added student or DSP and different things.

198
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.650
So in further tutorials, I will tell you how we can create that one.
