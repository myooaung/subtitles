1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,520
In previous sessions and tutorials, I told you how we can set up our project.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,270
And we created one in this British committee for the learning page, so it contains two links.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,520
What I have been logging, which is basically for teachers and student log in for the students.

4
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,120
So let us see how we can show the student log in page.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,190
So this is our student login page.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,090
Remember, this is just so we can include some Java.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,190
Well.

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,470
Classes or weekends is, in fact, once a year.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,210
So how are we going to do that?

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,790
So this is all about new cases and I'm using Mujtaba A.j.'s for all these things.

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,820
And this is timely because I don't want to create another file for statuses, so I could be embedded

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,510
here only.

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,090
So all.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:57,440
But remember, what is this if our great parameter is null, like if we are not putting something on

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,700
username or password, it should enter enter username and password for us.

16
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,140
That's all the message.

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,280
Things it and to get better barometer from that part.

18
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,610
Similarly, again, this is for its value validation.

19
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,520
If successful, it will join the message Know Green Park.

20
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:24,250
So this is a very important part for my actions, which is using politics as action.

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,950
So what is this supposed to be?

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,890
Is not controller.

23
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,780
As I told you, we are going to create when.

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,470
So package you inside this package, which contains an address, a package controller, which contains

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,510
valid instruments, controller is basically controlling all the parts.

26
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:43,770
So I'm dividing my for my convenience, although Java course jar of liquids.

27
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,210
So do you use the rifle, which takes username and password, which takes password?

28
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:57,640
If I click it, it will go to the first page and if I click submit, it should go to the left part and

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,390
a valid ID.

30
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,540
So similarly for the admin page, as I told you here, I'm going to use method validating.

31
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,100
So let's see how we can create valid student mark.

32
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,560
So I did it for the validation.

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:19,270
You just need to create one package and say yes and control it, and you get it when you also need it.

34
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,080
So I'm importing all libraries here, then I'm importing.

35
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,800
All packages.

36
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,900
So you're I'm going to use database packages or this database package, so it will contain all the database

37
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,790
fetching part and model contents, all the logging and logging logic and everything.

38
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,260
So what is it?

39
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,800
Student, it's actually over writing.

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,730
I'm using overwriting material to validate student will use this validated student as a supplemental

41
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,750
and then using the due course method.

42
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:02,190
I'm going to say that you name and last name, and for this, I'm going to create students or video,

43
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,330
which is basically taking that part.

44
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,860
I'm using Boolean part here.

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,110
So this is just for the what we can see controlling part of this.

46
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,410
If our organization is correct, it should go to the student instruction just for that, I'm willing

47
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:25,210
to get on student instruction in the GSP file because if you know, like you on some online portal and

48
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,370
you just click that on the log, it should go the instruction page or something like that.

49
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,750
It shouldn't be needed.

50
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,030
If not, go to that part.

51
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,760
Let's message with message link invalid user.

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,100
As I told you, this message should be printed.

53
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,230
So these are all our lives.

54
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,700
Let me say this.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,530
OK, so.

56
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:53,430
I'm overriding method, remember that you can override this winter with the serial opportunity, and

57
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,350
these are all things are seem and default, as I told you.

58
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:04,110
No need to change these things, but you can change your own things, your and your own logic.

59
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,700
I'm using this logic.

60
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,630
So these are all about values.

61
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,790
Same as well.

62
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:19,420
Oh, I mean, I'm mentioning it all the libraries because you can use that, but I want to specify each

63
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,120
and every library.

64
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,520
So I use this.

65
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:31,110
Then, which extends to a city of its own, a similar method takes you name from Adam in Logan GSP.

66
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,080
You name and pass these you name and pass it will take it, will check for that.

67
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:44,330
I mean, it shouldn't go to the admin panel if username is correct and if it's not, or should we go

68
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,370
to that same page?

69
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,340
So remember, in so late, you have to use the word amateur.

70
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,980
You're going to use this one's not synthetic.

71
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:59,240
If not, you are going to use the same direct to that particular person, only to include that for word

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,910
and include method to use that part.

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,550
You can use only one method saying that you.

74
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:11,390
So again, this is as a TV station is handled as in GSP or Java, I can tell you.

75
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,890
So in new post, you have to use HDTV decision, no need to use the SJW, Silverlight and all these

76
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,130
things.

77
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,220
I'm I'm using this YouTube solely to fill data, but for the forwarding part, you need to use this.

78
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,600
Which attribute also.

79
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,270
Your attributes should be saying because I'm going to print a tribute there, Nick, welcome student

80
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,800
or welcome back.

81
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,510
So this is all about this.

82
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,100
So let's see how we can create one database featuring part in everything.

83
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,260
So before that, I was pitching, but I need to mention the connection.

84
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,210
Or we can say we need to create connection.

85
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,930
I am using yet another dedicated Java file for the connection.

86
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:00,900
But why why I'm using this, so each and every connection lake for eggs mean then students, then questions,

87
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,020
then instructions, all these extraordinary times.

88
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:11,520
So for all these purposes, for storing the questions and everything again and again, I'm going to

89
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,600
create a connection.

90
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:20,520
So if I use the methods and I implement some object oriented logic here, I can easily create this method.

91
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,660
So let us see first create or is the DB of idea why I'm using this package?

92
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,050
Because.

93
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,110
I'm going to use it as a sub packages mental unit, so it is going to be for loading the database for

94
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,290
you.

95
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,750
So this is another provider.

96
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,090
I'm switching provider, this provider.

97
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,640
So this is good.

98
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,830
You can always use this, actually.

99
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,050
No need to specify everything.

100
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:47,860
Just put this.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,820
It will ask for everything, and I'm including the Lebanese, this very same building then regarded

102
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,350
as a class stealthy connection, basically, because, you know, for that purpose, you need to create

103
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,120
a connection with Oracle connection basically.

104
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,810
Then connection, it should be you.

105
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:08,830
You are.

106
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:17,440
I told you it should be null or even directly put connection here or do that or you can put connection

107
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,110
and is equal to this, but I'm creating this part again.

108
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,090
Right?

109
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,660
Always in the law school connections and with in, say, the trial.

110
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,850
Or you can use Pruzan for your time using that as an exception, part exception catching.

111
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,610
But this is for Oracle database.

112
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:40,300
Then this is system my user name or Oracle database password for pasturing.

113
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:46,210
Then this is all for all good connection for user POS.

114
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,640
If this is correct, it will show that connection is successful in this.

115
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,120
It's not.

116
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,760
It will provide some error or exception in saying this.

117
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,450
But what we can say our command prompt.

118
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,930
So I'm creating one dedicated.

119
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,780
I have created already this part for connection.

120
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:11,500
So this other other provider is over our dedicated connection Java file for builder connection.

121
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,910
So let us see how we can create admins Java.

122
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,040
So inside the army in Java, what I am doing is.

123
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:26,630
I am fishing all from that database, or we can say we are providing it into the database and then returning

124
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:26,720
it.

125
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,110
So this is very simple by which I already great.

126
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,730
It's very, very easy.

127
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,190
Which is basically pretty common.

128
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,680
So this very basic thing and username and password, and I'm putting the good username, string username,

129
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,910
password, set password.

130
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,310
As a matter of time, what do you think?

131
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:54,110
So I'm just using that variable and I'm listening to another variable.

132
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,850
So this is very easy.

133
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,600
Student's law.

134
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,020
Java is also sin, which is using this database where it's very easy.

135
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,260
I'm just doing the same stuff as admin.

136
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:16,780
I'm putting in this and I'm returning that part and I'm storing dedicated team in the name and all these

137
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:16,960
things.

138
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,370
So this will be easy.

139
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,530
Same for the Christian part.

140
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,390
I'm working for the commission.

141
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,350
Good question is what a good question that question is to state the question.

142
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,040
Good question for the user or begins to shake.

143
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,510
But the question is what the elements are.

144
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,300
Not just get a means for apportioning the incentive for that purpose.

145
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,890
Get me for.

146
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:46,160
No student said before another student gave to Sea City guilty, I'm currently visiting the four options

147
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,170
done so don't say Dunzo exit student.

148
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,480
Sorry for sending that answer or get answer for or remember.

149
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,840
Then instructions north of us, so.

150
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,600
These agency said instruction gives instruction.

151
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:07,060
So the bill contains all the files which just creating the connection part.

152
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,590
So this is all about this.

153
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:18,180
No, let us see how we can create one thing here, which is basically Adam, remember one student deal,

154
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:23,040
so I told you about that how we can create in Java for you.

155
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,310
And remember why I am using this Adam in here.

156
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:34,740
So if you see the new elements where it is used, I'm using this new items and I'm sick username and

157
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,030
I'm setting the password.

158
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,260
So when I say so, I will put your.

159
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,060
Creating.

160
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,830
Object.

161
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,630
So this is setting the password.

162
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:55,460
So I am using this like I'm switching from one message to the another variable and I'm using this,

163
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,400
so it is very common method in Java.

164
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:06,200
If I am using the same variable, it will change its value again and again, like if I would admin usernames

165
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,580
and passwords admin.

166
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:12,560
And I want to change that part, but I want to store that eliminate admin.

167
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,530
I want to add it or appended in the admins.

168
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:24,470
So it will help if I am not using this part like I'm switching from one variable or from or I am fetching

169
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:30,470
data from user side and I'm storing it to the same variable line and using same rehabil again and again.

170
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,510
Then there can be an anomaly.

171
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,030
Or we can say there can be some Social Security issue.

172
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:41,540
Also, like you can easily find the answer of our questions or anything.

173
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,940
So would you do the another file?

174
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,810
It will create some dedicated file for that purpose.

175
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,900
So I'm setting this username and password method.

176
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,370
And I'm using that very retirement, so I'm using this part.

177
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:02,390
Or and it will send to the admin panel, we will create an admin panel for that purpose in further videos,

178
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:08,810
I'm going to tell how we can develop largest profiles only because we are mostly done with our Java

179
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:19,160
files required are a thing or two to three only remaining for that purposes and controller will be required

180
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,210
to create some log out.

181
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:26,580
Log in all our load for our admin level for student, then question insert method student instrumental

182
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,990
also and some instruction in insert methods also.

183
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,530
So that's it.

184
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,400
But mostly we're done with our Java files, so we are now only focused with our GCP files only.

185
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,110
So this is all about how we can create.

186
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,040
So let us see how we can create student delimiter.

187
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,460
Here I am going to use Metro to edit it, which is basically Boolean, which tells us status as false.

188
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,590
So what it will be do.

189
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:00,650
It will take for the school connection, then the provider as a delivering student back.

190
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,180
So it will help me to take everything.

191
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:10,040
And I am passing of in line object, you can see for that are in Line O team.

192
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,400
So who do you basically constructor not on these?

193
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:19,310
So I'm going to use this again, as I told you, is that user name from the student method and get password

194
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,180
from their children.

195
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,490
To see how we can.

196
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,500
I told you, you are OK.

197
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,080
This is your username and password method.

198
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,000
So I'm using this.

199
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:36,740
So from the wider don't get Oracle connection, which is basically our provider, dogged our file only.

200
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,740
So this will use this again, your direct connection.

201
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:52,380
Then, oh, no, need to to create another thing like, oh, as I am using this D-Block fluid, which

202
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:59,460
is basically specific file I'm using here and not mentioning only DB here, so I can use this provided

203
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,510
nordtveit connection here, which is basically fully defined name.

204
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,850
Or we can see then I'm using the string to phase that part.

205
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,230
I will again.

206
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,750
But in Clear Lake, it's good.

207
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,430
Yeah, it's good for the user alien password suing for the 13th.

208
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,770
I'm going to create tables in the database.

209
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,010
I will tell you which queries you have to use.

210
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,120
And these are all for solving.

211
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,550
The name Ulva is duloxetine, which is basically we are setting them here.

212
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,810
And I think oystering is equal in the name, basically.

213
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,970
So it will render true, if not influence that you look at the statement.

214
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:45,540
Similarly, for the entire student, I'm not creating another thing because I don't want to create another

215
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,310
file to instruct students on everything.

216
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:55,000
So I just created then get all records from the Israelis because from the student level, I want to

217
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,350
check for all student list.

218
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:03,100
I can use a religion, similar thing you can use and remember all those things.

219
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:09,430
You're dead and again, printing that because, you know, there may be some two names also inside that

220
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,750
park.

221
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,840
So I'm using this.

222
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,110
And delete records, I'm adding the delete record methodology and get to the name metadata to your then

223
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,800
do update new record because I want to update new record also.

224
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,190
So these are all the records you can minimize your own.

225
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,170
So this will be the lindy part.

226
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,630
You can check for this.

227
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:36,860
It's very easy, but it takes too much time because I created in only one single method, which is basically

228
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,710
studio.

229
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,540
So this is all about go in for further parts I'm going to get you can create how are you going?

230
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,690
Create the admin part, then insert part and everything.
