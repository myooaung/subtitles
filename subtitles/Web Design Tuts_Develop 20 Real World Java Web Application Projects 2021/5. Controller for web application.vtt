WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.430
In previous cases, I told you we already created this part.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.760
So we created one data service client to request and bring the response for this purpose.

3
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.230
So.

4
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.650
If you know these all the things are currently not mentioned here.

5
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.960
Let me do one thing.

6
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.910
Let me.

7
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.370
Coming down this part because I'm not using this currently.

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.140
And.

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.210
Adrian, Do1Thing, let me bring location sticks because I'm using that location sticks you.

10
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.590
As you know.

11
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.660
Is there any error?

12
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.310
No, not currently nutritional.

13
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.500
So little what I'm going to do is since June.

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.790
Not old, not wrinkled in.

15
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.080
Location states.

16
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.980
Our location straight.

17
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.890
So that's it.

18
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.350
And what I'm going to do.

19
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.430
Let me.

20
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.230
Then court records application.

21
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.980
You can run from here on somewhere.

22
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.430
I'm going in here.

23
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.760
And this is over, I mean, could do it in.

24
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.290
So currently, it's running out of metal.

25
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.120
It me chicken can build.

26
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.350
Yeah, it's running and it will be in the open for us.

27
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.720
OK.

28
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.450
You can see the Java compiler using everything.

29
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.760
And let me check.

30
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.030
What is going to bring to you?

31
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.290
This started.

32
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.190
So as you can see, these are location statistics.

33
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.660
It is giving basically.

34
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.540
We replication each and every team.

35
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.010
These are all things after some time and will run it again, and it will start to switch.

36
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.270
You know, what I'm going to do is I'm going to comment on this because.

37
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.660
I'm not going to print and or cancel.

38
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.390
I just want to create one another thing here.

39
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.340
Well, we didn't say the models, they already created locations that application.

40
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.890
So let me create one.

41
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.290
Private training for students, because.

42
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.410
I'm using as a state then.

43
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.470
I would string country let me on to lead us to.

44
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.110
Use this again.

45
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:11.420
Country for the country, what was then went on under integer for 210 cases and under four leaders total

46
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.880
cases.

47
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.720
I'm just using this.

48
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.870
So we are done with this now.

49
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.550
Let me check.

50
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.200
Some instructor, so you can say these are the methods here, you can use your I want to get around

51
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.410
certain methods, which is basically good and each generally do.

52
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.500
I will use everything you.

53
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:48.510
OK, so at least for me, it's already created, as you can see, good student and third segment of

54
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.330
the country can all the methods I've mentioned here.

55
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.920
So what I'm going to.

56
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.000
I'm going to.

57
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.280
I just come into this party first.

58
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.070
But now I can use this part.

59
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:15.120
Well, as you can see, we are using these methods and we are using these methods to get country, said

60
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.340
country, all the methods we are mentioned here.

61
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.510
So let us take what we are missing here.

62
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.080
The basic method is missing.

63
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.120
We are missing the string material.

64
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.440
So let me create one booster to bring it to you or your insert to get to string the third.

65
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.940
So, OK.

66
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.630
As you can see, these are the all things I already created.

67
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.600
And no, I'm doing this.

68
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.980
It is already painting me this on the radar.

69
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.430
Then this are in the mornings.

70
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.190
Let me go to the package.

71
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.730
Well.

72
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.590
This is inside the more location stats.

73
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.620
It continues materialism and frontier and all the things, I don't know.

74
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.170
Loading.

75
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.480
So this is all about the location starts and everything.

76
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.410
But no, the thing we are missing here is.

77
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.860
We need to create one controller why we needed the controller to control our air as a web application

78
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.400
or.

79
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.830
Let me keep this.

80
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.990
As it is.

81
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.540
And let me create one object.

82
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.310
Inside the.

83
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.050
What it injuries and what is done with this service is done, OK?

84
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.220
Create one.

85
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.590
Another class, basically, I'm going to create here.

86
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.350
Which is basically controlled.

87
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:53.110
So let me open one controller and why we need a controller, as I already told you, the initial thing

88
00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:03.700
of controllers is going to maintain our controlling part of whom I'm going to create the only home failure.

89
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.120
I'm not wishing you ill.

90
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.350
What are we going to say?

91
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.040
All the things.

92
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.770
I just needed to know home controller because we are going to create one home controller on.

93
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.860
I will look at us.

94
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.450
So I created this.

95
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.470
Let me tell you, what is this team's first location statistics?

96
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:33.690
Well, let me minimization and let me just load this, OK, so this is the audience and mentioned mortgage

97
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.830
as a package location, state country.

98
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.540
They're distributed in this case is different from previous debates.

99
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.720
Difference between the previous day and next day.

100
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.970
Good statements are to get that mental state for this great country.

101
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.720
So we'll start to bring that state get control for getting that.

102
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.320
So we are not currently losing this.

103
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.210
We're going to use it in Hong Kong to let people that remember we are using this.

104
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.090
Get latest latest news, all the things we have to mention here.

105
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.330
So let us see why the home controller is needed.

106
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.620
As this is, I'm deploying.

107
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.800
I know what we can say on live web.

108
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.040
We need to create a web application, but we are mentioning only in this part, so we need to.

109
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:26.180
Cleared one home controller app to control each and everything, so let me create one.

110
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.610
Thing here, which is basically and it.

111
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.110
Controlling part, so let me download first and.

112
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.540
Let me add one thing here.

113
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.010
Spring framework.

114
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.560
Six.

115
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.760
Invested in this thing.

116
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.240
And the red.

117
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.940
Controller.

118
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:56.870
So it will exhume the all controlling part.

119
00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.700
As you can see, disease controlled.

120
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:07.310
And as we learn the studio stereotype eugenics, everything, so this can be controlled to a baby.

121
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.950
So what is the thing I'm going to use it for?

122
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.070
I'm going to try at least and everything to deploy it.

123
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:15.330
Not.

124
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:22.820
But before proceeding with will, we need to mention what is going to it is going to use.

125
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:24.420
So.

126
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.710
Auto wire, I'm using auto.

127
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:35.450
Let me tell you, or I'm going to mention through on this call now it does data services so it can copy

128
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.080
this first.

129
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:43.590
Well, tonight as data services, because it is mentioned as a service, I can use this as a service.

130
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.790
Which is basically diplomatic for me.

131
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.310
So let me I'll take that.

132
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.220
So it will attract me to this.

133
00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.720
And as I mentioned, we can use this as a service, and it will be lauded throughout this part.

134
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:07.860
So this is it how we are going to do, but we have mentioned some things here like packages each and.

135
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.440
So before this, let me create one.

136
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.750
What we can see model or we can see.

137
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:18.540
Public.

138
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.330
Extreme.

139
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.790
A string.

140
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.920
Blistering form.

141
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.450
Moral authority.

142
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.590
I mentioned module, but I know not than.

143
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:48.380
Let me also introduce it, will accept this model, UN, which is basically spring framework.

144
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.360
Let me add your morning.

145
00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.630
So this is going to create one model here.

146
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.290
On that part.

147
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.640
So if you know, I already created this list.

148
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.230
With what is the name of all that?

149
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.610
Let me check first, which is basically location steps.

150
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:16.940
OK.

151
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.350
This only I needed.

152
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.490
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to create a controller here.

153
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.680
I'm currently creating a controller.

154
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:27.720
Before this.

155
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:34.640
I need to mention all stats, each and every expect, because as I mentioned earlier, this is all started

156
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.380
only on states.

157
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.730
And what is the name basic needs on stacks only on Stax is capital.

158
00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:47.880
I'm.

159
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.240
OK.

160
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.660
All states.

161
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.230
On that, we don't know how it is due to services.

162
00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.810
Don't get on specs.

163
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.280
That's what I'm into.

164
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.290
So let me when you pretended so it will.

165
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.540
I accept that everything.

166
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.420
So this is all I created.

167
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:21.200
No, I need to create a map, and you and everything went before the map I need to create one is.

168
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.690
And did it get moving?

169
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.400
So when I needed a good mapping because this is not mapped already, I need to map it.

170
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.370
And before the all the things on a map.

171
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.150
OK.

172
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.760
The new strategic plan would.

173
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:48.000
Between doing so, it will do it is this new for getting the mapping each and everything here?

174
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:56.700
So this is about how I'm going to do this, but before this, you have to mention eugenics, everything

175
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:56.970
here.

176
00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:02.010
So as you can see, you can it here open and you can check.

177
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:10.110
So my local plant and my boat is activity, so I can run this and this is the EPA indoor or get climate

178
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.620
onshore.

179
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.530
Let me close this for because I haven't mentioned yet.

180
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:21.570
So likewise, you can check your strategic plan meter so you can choose any year.

181
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.380
Let me do one thing.

182
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.760
Let me delete this part.

183
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.900
OK, so this is all about how we're going to create a strategic client.

184
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:36.650
So I'm going to control this part all over the web application and the further things I'm going to show

185
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.020
you how I'm going to place that.

186
00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.030
So I'm just getting the all stacks.

187
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.370
But what we do is I'm going to explain you.

188
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.650
I'm going to create one actual file to display all the imaging team live in.

189
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:54.650
Basically, during that year, I'm not mentioning it and it's putting authentication part on, etcetera.

190
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.290
This is just a spring boot application.

191
00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:04.310
Anyone can use this to check the COVID data on a daily basis, and I am telling you this is their daily

192
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.890
basis because of this.

193
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.800
So it will be updated every month over.

194
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:18.430
Or we can say first over of that, which is basically one a.m. in the morning when this issue is updated.

195
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:28.690
Well, why I'm mentioning this is very this what we consider not very useful to part of our thinking

196
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:35.890
because when you go to this link, you can check it's updated every 26 minutes or 30 30 minutes.

197
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:43.740
So identically I have to use this at once again, sort of one minute thing I would consider for the

198
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.350
listing application, I can put in checks of one aim of every day.

199
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.230
So if you want to create more efficient, you can change this part.

200
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.360
And this is a very useful thing.

201
00:13:54.780 --> 00:14:01.410
It is not achieving under the present obstruction, as I told you, because I'm not mentioning any obstruction

202
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:06.800
class or anything, but I'm using packages and packages concept to develop this all.

203
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.670
And it's synchronous.

204
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:14.040
As I told you, by developing spring application, you can move it or not.

205
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.840
But I'm going with asynchronous method.

206
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.490
As I told you, I created this FAQ.

207
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:24.460
So this is very synchronous motor and for the part I'm going to get home controller part and in template

208
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.990
part also, or I'm going to mention the templates, which is basically home template.

209
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:36.310
You can check the application properties each anybody can hear, and currently this is done.

210
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.260
Anomalous Data Services, Sydney, your service is basically going to face the data.

211
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:43.150
OK.

212
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.230
OK.

213
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:51.070
Well, tonight, as we said, was you going to face the data models for what we can see modelling the

214
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.300
data we can see we can.

215
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.880
We are going to create your methodology to display that.

216
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.780
So I haven't created these methods directly.

217
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:08.360
What I did is this I insert in your team and you can generate what you would get to set to your director.

218
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.170
Remote methods equals our hash for boosting the terms.

219
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.390
So this is all about how we are going to do.

220
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.620
You can use your copyright methods to turn everything you so overestimate them.

221
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.280
So no need to worry about this part of what created this.

222
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.560
This little system default on integrity.

223
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.520
I will take it off creating all the things and do the system given no need to worry about.

224
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.720
It's going to create it will detect your thing and it will print your data.

225
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.000
So hope you understand this part.

226
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.640
In the next part, I'm going to mention the home controller and each and.
