1
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:07.120
Now, let us start adding some more specifications to this code.

2
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.980
So.

3
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.320
Let us try to find.

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.720
What happens after Marla receives first salary?

5
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.560
Marla receives salary.

6
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:34.000
Yes, so that function is called and invoking the matter get salary.

7
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.600
Yes.

8
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.920
So let's try to run this.

9
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.900
And see what are what we are going to receive.

10
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.020
OK, so it is showing in the ditch, your name is mean, it's not my life, my lies, the student,

11
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.200
one of the students.

12
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.700
Yes.

13
00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.800
Rena is their teacher.

14
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.590
So now I'm going to run this again.

15
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.600
So, yes, there is no change as we haven't found anything, so let us try to say so.

16
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.970
Again, after paying into one.

17
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.020
Sorry.

18
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.240
It's me 19th.

19
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.680
Confusing with the names, so yes.

20
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.000
Let us do the same for fools to Nina.

21
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.800
We need something to say.

22
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.940
So they're placing this hideous.

23
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.780
So now again, if you try to run this school.

24
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.350
The money will be updated.

25
00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.390
So, yes, school has spent a salary off me not as nine thousand and left with ninety thousand.

26
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.720
Now, let us do a different thing.

27
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.140
Let us try to.

28
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.630
She out.

29
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.680
A student fees low.

30
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.300
Yes.

31
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:33.210
So here we are trying to sizzle, rather whatever other advisors, Ubuntu, so let us see what it is.

32
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.840
So you can see that there is a garbage value after students.

33
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.540
I suppose if we try to pretend what is it has fees.

34
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.820
So we can write it, the fees paid by.

35
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.310
Closing in.

36
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.970
And then.

37
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.320
Basis.

38
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.100
Yes.

39
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.140
So if they try to run this.

40
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.010
So actually, let us do this as.

41
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.070
Not only.

42
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.100
And try to explore something more.

43
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.040
It is giving garbage value this far.

44
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.000
So let's get back to the stolen birds and.

45
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.940
Try to create what a two state function so we can write it as or write.

46
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.680
Public string.

47
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.230
And they're toasting Mr.

48
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.030
I will show you what this does, my time does.

49
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.830
Once after it is executed.

50
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.200
You will relate to it with the garbage that you are receiving after calling the student.

51
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.980
So what is it that made this function?

52
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.460
Student's name, student.

53
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.240
Name.

54
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:51.230
Some homes student's name isn't on the record is denying their student name and.

55
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.880
A colon.

56
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.880
The name variable.

57
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:04.580
Yes.

58
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.630
And certainly she's been certain she's been.

59
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.040
Bailout.

60
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.760
Not the free spread over on, but potentially spread below.

61
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.850
In your piece, so suppose I.

62
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.180
Yes.

63
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.120
And the phrase brain function.

64
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.580
Yes.

65
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.660
So calling and closing it.

66
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.670
So, yes.

67
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:11.500
We had her with this toasting function overnight toasting functions, and let's call this again in May

68
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:12.170
not know.

69
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.460
So this are not brain dead end.

70
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.310
Let us try to run it again.

71
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.780
So, yes.

72
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:32.900
Buffer student's name, Nana Tortoises, break their lives thousand soyez.

73
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:39.570
Initially, it was a turning of garbage value, but with the use of all string function.

74
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.080
Yes.

75
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.420
So this use of this toasting function, the Garmin Venu is vanished.

76
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.830
So yes, this is the use of this boosting function.

77
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.360
We learn to.

78
00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:03.100
More function modified to allow says you can drive spin on that student also.

79
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.490
Yes.

80
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.020
Let's call it for one of the student.

81
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.800
Yes.

82
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.030
Jonah.

83
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:26.140
So now what does it mean, it seemed as the totality spread, right?

84
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.860
Yes.

85
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.260
So Joe, the pastor, dances with it and always know as they allow.

86
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:41.710
Only those students have been nurses that Damona and rather so it is a buffet are taught you about total

87
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.010
fees.

88
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.620
Paid is zero that has total fees.

89
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.370
Paid is 50000 below.

90
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:55.450
OK, so we have learned so many things by far in this project.

91
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:07.890
One more thing I am I would like to add is that this was the basic concept we were learning to this

92
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:08.370
project.

93
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:18.400
One more thing that we can do with this is make our next door window interface into the port will open

94
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.020
in a separate window like.

95
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.280
Not in that diamond.

96
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.550
There will be a separate window.

97
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.760
So if you want to explore more, you can do that.

98
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.890
It is a very simple task.

99
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:40.820
The main focus of this project was to teach you the basic concept of Java and classes and methods in

100
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.270
Java.

101
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:49.430
So let us quickly summarize what we have learned through this project by far.

102
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:58.750
OK, so before summarizing, we would also like to add the overnight case.

103
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.970
Former teacher says when?

104
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:05.550
So, yes.

105
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.900
I think the over right.

106
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.550
Let me copy it from the student front.

107
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.770
Yes.

108
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.560
So, yes, this is over, I think, function.

109
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.000
Yes, he did it for the students.

110
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.770
Now we are sitting in for that, teachers also.

111
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.870
And in the teachers, we have sanity.

112
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.220
Sanity said Saturday.

113
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.740
So it is like name on vacation.

114
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.590
The name of the speech you're.

115
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.230
Dalton, sadly, aren't so far.

116
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.200
Both Saturday armed and.

117
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:15.800
And then, Sally, on so I guess.

118
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.000
Now, let's try to test this.

119
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:24.380
This.

120
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.040
Name on the bleachers.

121
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:31.580
Yes.

122
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.580
So, Marla.

123
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.610
Marlow, let us straighten this.

124
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.040
In past summers, let me drag this issue.

125
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.840
So that it is in that business, oh yes, Mr. Bass.

126
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.440
We are following the principle of learning by doing.

127
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.420
I am learning.

128
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:12.140
Meanwhile, teaching you to make this project, so if there miss something, we should learn this by

129
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.760
solving that ends.

130
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:23.030
Solving the box is the best way to learn any language or make any project sense after fixing this error.

131
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.980
We really go back and try to run this again.

132
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:39.640
So I guess my last daughter's salary until now is as we haven't made anything to my alarm.

133
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:47.780
If they try to run it for another line, like suppose it's.

134
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:50.990
Yes.

135
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.840
So if you try to run it for larceny.

136
00:11:59.330 --> 00:11:59.650
Yes.

137
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.070
Loss of their daughter Saturday afternoon is six thousand.

138
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.660
This is done with the help of the override string function.

139
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:16.220
This helps us to return the SATs armadillo below and rest on the teams.

140
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.660
So yes.

141
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.260
Now summarizing this project, what we have learned so far.

142
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:29.270
We learn to create a school management system.

143
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:37.650
Like, we manage the strategy, Senator, to get each of us, the fees submitted by the students.

144
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:45.030
We created four classes Main Glass, School Class, Student Class and each year class.

145
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.340
For the school class.

146
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.150
Recalculated the total money spent.

147
00:12:53.230 --> 00:13:04.360
That total money by creating a separate momentum in the student class, we have created, the object

148
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.400
says, adding invalid fees Fred Sisco does.

149
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.760
And similarly for the teachers.

150
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:20.710
So overall, we have learned the basic off Java and it's Oops concept had opened a nurse object oriented

151
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.430
from them.

152
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:30.940
So after completing this project successfully, I hope you're on when that's when you get a good laugh

153
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.630
at this Java basic oops concept.

154
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:41.620
That's on ending this and wishing you a good day.

155
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.550
Thank you.
