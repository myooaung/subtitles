WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:10.700
Now, such that we have created everything about the Apple Entertainment, now we are going to see what

2
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.010
is going to be inside the game over, very.

3
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.530
So we have created a strange message for the game over one thing and the whole style of the game over

4
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:28.550
text is going to be like this sensitive ball and the font size is going to be 40 now.

5
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.040
The font matrix is going to be a special font like this.

6
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.320
This is a ball and style first showing game over text.

7
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.910
Now that text color is going to be white and we have both said the font for the game over text.

8
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:55.610
We have to draw a string which shows that the window is going to be the full size of the page length.

9
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.500
The text is going to be displayed in the middle of the page, and this is done with the help of this

10
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.770
thing.

11
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.840
Three hundred minus matrix string with like the very tough and the heart involved.

12
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.460
So half of the way and half of the hype, this is going to be in the middle of the page.

13
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.330
So we have successfully created the game over window.

14
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.890
Now let us switch to check the conditions for the collision, like the collision side to it, as we

15
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.870
already discussed the body of the snake itself and the walls of this game.

16
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
So let me first create our function.

17
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.100
Public void collision form checking the collision point.

18
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:53.780
So yes, we have created it now, brackets and inside this, we have to use a for loop for checking

19
00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.810
that whether the coordinates of the ball and the snake are seen or the snakes dot one dot another,

20
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.550
dot has the same coordinates.

21
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:13.760
Then this thing going to happen, then the human or one and a pop up will appear that the game is over,

22
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.130
like the pop up since you are done.

23
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.610
Now you can continue, which is very disheartening, I think.

24
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:32.790
Like, we never want our games to be all we want to play multiple times without getting the snake die.

25
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.960
So inside, if I am going to check if that is greater than for.

26
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:50.340
An ex of the snake and the obstacle is same.

27
00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:01.590
So double is equal to and then x z, the z is for the snake and the always for the snake.

28
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.780
And that is for the object.

29
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.290
So if Z is greater than four and and operator.

30
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:25.980
And X Zero is equal to is equal to double x z, and similarly for the Y coordinate and Operator Y zero

31
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.070
is equal double equals.

32
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.350
Y Z.

33
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.050
Yes.

34
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.590
So this is like something no bracket closed.

35
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:54.960
And what this event and so the endgame, like I have already said, the endgame is do not denoting the

36
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.040
game is on.

37
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.680
So if I am setting the game is going to false.

38
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.770
Obviously, the game is going to be over now.

39
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:12.930
So this is the first possibility of checking the collision, like if the snake hits itself, then the

40
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.520
game is going to be over.

41
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.070
The second possibility is that the snake hit one of the four walls.

42
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.410
And again, the game will be over.

43
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.390
So if lives are like, if the y coordinate of snake becomes greater than all equal to three hundred

44
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.300
like this is three hundred and this is zero zero, this is zero three hundred.

45
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.160
This is three hundred comma zero and this is field.

46
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.570
So the coordinates are like this.

47
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.620
So if the Y coordinate becomes greater than three hundred.

48
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:58.080
Similarly, if the X coordinate becomes greater than three hundred and if the icon becomes less than

49
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:10.770
zero, like there are four walls one in the origin side and one in the 300 side, and also the X coordinate

50
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.540
becomes less than.

51
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.560
Zero.

52
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.090
Yes.

53
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:24.120
So all the four walls are set to this, and these are the conditions which set in game for us, like

54
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.530
the game is on two falls and the game will be over if not in game.

55
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.140
Then the timer is stop.

56
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.290
So if the game is over, then the timer will stop automatically like the snake will stop moving and

57
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.780
the game or a window will pop up.

58
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:48.840
So yes, there are five cases girl total six kids discovered inside this jet collision like four snake

59
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.800
hitting itself.

60
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.870
Any of the four walls.

61
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:59.070
And if these five cases upwards, then the Indian Council and the family will stop automatically.

62
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.520
So we have covered this part.

63
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:09.870
Also now move to the next part now coming to the prototype like the main family of design.

64
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:18.480
What we have got our bill now, so we have covered seven things like we have created the project design

65
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.000
and nothing place the images inside these images one way or another.

66
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.070
We have located that one.

67
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.770
We have also created a function for collisions, checking the collisions.

68
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.440
So these two are also completed.

69
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.570
So now what's left?

70
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.510
So implementation of the keyboard?

71
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:48.960
So now we will jump this directly now in order to clear the keyboard functionalities, which will make

72
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.070
the snake move.

73
00:06:50.370 --> 00:07:05.040
We have to create the class for that be an adapter is the name of the class, and we will extend this

74
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:13.110
to a component of the next string, which is called gear adapter.

75
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.790
And.

76
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:32.140
So, yes, we have extended extends key adapter inside this, we will create a public void, key public

77
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.200
void gave breast.

78
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:49.400
Which will recognize that the key blessed breast like and creating events as document, which says.

79
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.350
And the event is e suppose.

80
00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:07.090
And inside this event, we are going to create the integer key which like calls the method, get the

81
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:07.530
key.

82
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.960
Code, so the code of the key matches being pressed.

83
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:23.720
Now, so that we have created this function now, we will check using if that.

84
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.360
The valuable key.

85
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:35.140
Is a key event and the key event says.

86
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.600
Like the Chiriches is, is the lefty.

87
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:47.660
So the writer does make you laugh, underscore live.

88
00:08:49.130 --> 00:09:01.520
And this check, if the key pressed, is the left side key and not visible to the right direction?

89
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.060
Right direction.

90
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:12.610
Off the plane after completing this.

91
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.320
So we have our extra bracket.

92
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:26.310
And so this is going to check that if we have pressed that we get less and not the right direction.

93
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:31.020
So it was said that left direction to through.

94
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.920
So let us first go to these variables as the global variables above have.

95
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:48.830
So below this, I am going to create a private Boolean for less direction, said to us false.

96
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:59.060
Similarly, for the right direction, again setting is the false and further up and down as well.

97
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.360
So we are done with three.

98
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.010
One more tool and that is down direction.

99
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.460
Initially, everything is set to false.

100
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.860
So we have created all of the global variables.

101
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.940
Also, we have one more bullion ready to roll.

102
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.680
We have to face data to the code will look nice.

103
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.480
So if endgame is true.

104
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:32.770
So all the Boolean variables at one place now moving towards the keyboard functionality.

105
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:41.620
Now, after checking that information for the left breast, we have to set the left direction as to.

106
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:48.430
And this makes low left mode and the other two as false.

107
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:57.460
Now up and down as force, we have already checked it for the right, be above head, not right direction,

108
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.120
which automatically denotes that our direction is false.

109
00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.770
We do not have to bother writing a test.

110
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.200
We have already set a little false.

111
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:18.280
Now, if he went for, lefties said, now we have to copy and paste it four more times for all the full

112
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.490
keyboard keys, which we are going to use.

113
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:34.990
So pasting it four more times for the right left hand up and down, right hand writing left.

114
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:43.660
Similarly, like we have right noted for the left key, it is caps lock right?

115
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.300
And for Upper.

116
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.450
Moving towards the up key.

117
00:11:53.810 --> 00:12:00.560
And we have to set not further down detection.

118
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.570
We will change this in some time after completing this part.

119
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:12.780
So, yes, we are done with all the years and her writing up.

120
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.400
So this is for right.

121
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:23.610
So we have to say the right direction, as do we really need this?

122
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.290
OK, so here we have up, and here we have down.

123
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:37.070
That image, we have the best in this place.

124
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:47.060
So having said that, our direction as to now head the direction and direction so official and down

125
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:47.710
is false.

126
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:52.970
So we have to set that up, though true.

127
00:12:54.020 --> 00:13:00.210
And we have two pairs left in the right direction is false.

128
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.340
So just changing it this way.

129
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.710
I'm pasting the whole thing has.

130
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:14.240
Just we have to change this week now.

131
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.500
Yes, don't.

132
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:25.380
So we are done with all the keyboard functionality, like we have functions for all the four keys.

133
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:33.060
If we are going to press any of the four, there is action which will be listen after the press.

134
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:44.520
So by far, we have covered every section of the main game section aspect of thus naked self.

135
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:53.400
So now we are going to cover it how the new function will work, like how the snake will move in the

136
00:13:53.400 --> 00:14:01.020
next bag and we will see that how the images are hiding behind the tail of the snake after everything

137
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.430
that happens and that is the application of this process.

138
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:13.620
So yes, like all the functions are covered now in the next part, we are going to create a more function.

139
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.420
See you in the next part.
