1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,970
Now, so that we have created on our menu items, classes except for water.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:15,160
So in this part, we are going to create a separate class for the water item in the menu and the name

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,630
is going to be turned out Java.

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:23,800
So on thing and then even land up to this file containing a public class water.

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:36,700
Similarly, as previous classes, we are going to declare a Boolean class call ice so private boolean

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,230
ice.

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,850
And after this, we are going to an.

8
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,540
So I could be better.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,410
It sounds like a war.

10
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,380
After this, we are going to create a constructor called Water.

11
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,710
Public class.

12
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:09,100
The water and this water object is going to contain an immense string size as the previous classes.

13
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,990
That is no more different ends and a label being OK.

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:23,780
So this object is created and inside this object in the similar way, we will be adding a supersymmetric

15
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:30,250
containing this size and the amount to be displayed in the label.

16
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:41,830
After this, they will be yes, attaching if statement and this if statement is containing us option

17
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,280
paint.

18
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,580
A dialog box will appear and the label will be the.

19
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,160
Like main argument and the message is going to be would be all.

20
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,160
Likewise.

21
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,830
So this will ask this question to the customer.

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,750
Would you like guys?

23
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:20,660
And a question mark after this I also have in Caprica and this is going to ask you.

24
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,010
Yes, no.

25
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,760
So again, option been asking for a yes or no option.

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,740
So yes, no option.

27
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:36,260
And it is going to return null in the beginning.

28
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,720
Said Thank you for this.

29
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,530
If statement is going to set, I don't know it.

30
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:53,270
Also suppose if this if statement is true, then that statement should segue to the I store false.

31
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,070
So as I is going to be false.

32
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,710
OK, so we are done with adding that I start now.

33
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:15,530
Our next concern should regarding the price be so double price and if size is small, so in the price.

34
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:22,640
But we have set up price like if the size equals small, then the price for what there is going to be

35
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,720
one point zero.

36
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,270
If the size equals medium, then price is going to be two point zero.

37
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:36,410
And as if we haven't chose small and medium, then definitely the size is going to be a lot and the

38
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,050
price for the large water is 3.0.

39
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,470
Now what if ice is added to water?

40
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:52,700
So the cost associated with ice is the cost of the they're like the respective sizes will be multiplied

41
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,120
with one point two five and what will it be updated with the help of this price method?

42
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,390
So suppose if the ice is Ivan, then the price is going to be one one five for a small glass of water

43
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:11,150
and supply for like ice is not adding, then the price is going to remain same as one.

44
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,110
So we have completed this water less now.

45
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,650
One more thing to be added inside.

46
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,100
This is going to be the override method, which we have a need for that.

47
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,760
Pretty interesting.

48
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:33,260
So I am going to copy you from the D class and we'll paste it here in order to save some time.

49
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,500
So water with ties.

50
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,760
Is going to be this plane.

51
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,610
And similarly, here, water simply is going to be displayed.

52
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:56,330
If I not sugared in water glass and we are done with this also.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,680
So all the classes I've successfully ran are tasked with every menu item in the radio, but this water,

54
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:13,960
the juice and coffee, all are done a beverage glasses used to set the size, amount and price of all

55
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,030
the items respectively.

56
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:24,330
Now, heading back to our neighbors, our classmates use them in class and we will be adding events

57
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,820
inside this in order to make things functional.

58
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:38,490
So now attaching actions to all the buttons like make all the things functional inside, though our

59
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,550
ordering form.

60
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:47,170
We are adding a string side here, which is going to like SAG the size of the selected item.

61
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:55,330
We have three options in this size small, medium and large, and you get source equal.

62
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:06,220
So if they click button and if we have selected use R.P. or coffee or water, so things are going to

63
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,420
be added inside the car.

64
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:20,760
And if this statement is getting a drink and if there is a like any kind of exception, then this block

65
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,760
is going to be get executed.

66
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:31,420
Then during the execution of this if statement, if a button is clicked on any of these item is not

67
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,060
selected, then we have to try.

68
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,510
I like this calling the beverage glass.

69
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:43,180
If juice is selected, then accessing the amount of side of use.

70
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:49,870
Similarly, for if water is selected, then we have to assess the size and amount of that.

71
00:06:50,290 --> 00:07:00,100
Similarly, for the coffee tea now, the next day, glass is going to set the external and our beverage

72
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,240
to the garden.

73
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,900
This labor report is going to add this flavor.

74
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,430
This thing is added.

75
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,600
We have already covered it in the above section.

76
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:22,030
I can show soirÃ©es we have covered it had only inside this labeled report, and this labor report is

77
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:26,590
going to display that this specific beverages that are so different.

78
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,390
Similarly, for the bar in group, we have setting the bar to do so.

79
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,520
Initially, the order button was disabled.

80
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:45,220
Do you can see that this thing was responsible for disabling the but then in the beginning, and once

81
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:53,890
any of the action is on and neon the tank is added to the cart, then the bartender will be enabled

82
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,160
and the certain antibodies will be, said Total.

83
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:05,410
Now, after this, if there is a try block, then that should be to block in order to start next section.

84
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:12,010
Now, think about that what exceptions could be by placing any order?

85
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:19,930
So are there exceptions going to mean that the amount we have entered is not an integer?

86
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:29,620
Then this gas block will be responsible for getting that data and showing the exception that the enter

87
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:37,240
an integer, as I suppose that in the like this place type, how many glasses you want that you haven't

88
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,970
done on any non integer thing.

89
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:46,300
So an exceptional number and the text will be displayed doesn't get any bigger than them.

90
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:54,750
Similarly, what could be the that exception that would arise that could be chosen beverage dependent

91
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,540
on the Moon?

92
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:04,150
So suppose that the old bar like place tried to place order without setting the beverage type and size

93
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:10,000
so that we last fall chose a beverage dependent on the Moon.

94
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:19,180
So you have to choose apostate and on five lesser not to try to click this add button before selecting

95
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,080
these two.

96
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:28,180
This is set so small by default, so you just have to choose from this and this.

97
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,060
Until then, we can't click this add button.

98
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:39,220
So this sketch exception block is responsible for that only so we have covert actions attached to all

99
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,000
of them now.

100
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:47,050
Let us try to check what is left now so that we have common actions like that of this size.

101
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:52,000
These radio button and this input text will now.

102
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,100
Our next concern should be that the what actions should be a list.

103
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,080
Then when the an order by then killed so.

104
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:09,160
On that, but then got that try and catch exception block was mentioned above.

105
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,960
Now suppose it's vaguely down there, but then then what should we now put?

106
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,210
So on saying this?

107
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:24,460
Things can be made clear that if you don't get souls like that event that is before them is equal to

108
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:30,250
that bit then or that this means that suppose it's Britain or order like, but then that is being clicked,

109
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,620
then our report should be like this played out.

110
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,720
Initially, that important is fact or none and zero.

111
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:49,540
But if things are getting ordered, then this far not being responsible for combining all the items

112
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,680
added in the court.

113
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,090
Suppose that we have added beverages one two three four.

114
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:03,700
Suppose they have ordered four things in a row so that the pings are to be combined at the end and displayed

115
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,870
as a whole sum.

116
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,660
So this is, you know, like sum, the total amount will be paid.

117
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,530
I suppose this is initialized as we know.

118
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:20,560
And then this is going to be extended till the total number of items till we are there and the report

119
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,060
is going to be displayed the total number of items in the form of the string.

120
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,190
We can see that 10, supposing have are no more than one piece.

121
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:36,190
And then the dialog box will show that five million glasses of water, three million glasses of three

122
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:36,970
are ordered.

123
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,060
So yes, that is going to be responsible for that.

124
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:47,020
Also, the beer is going to win a total prize of all the beverages we have ordered as a whole.

125
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,820
So this is going to add the like total.

126
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:58,600
So I am going to lend it out and the total amount to be paid.

127
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:05,510
This statement is responsible for adding the total amount to be paid by the customer.

128
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,150
This total prize is initialized as the double date that died.

129
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,790
Similarly, we have declared the prize.

130
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,770
So the prize is double.

131
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,790
The total prize is also the validity of that image.

132
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:25,020
The report is going to display that total prize of beverage is So what is this report?

133
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,720
This is that you should pay twelve point five, so you should debate or dialogue.

134
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:41,380
Box will appear showing the report that this this is that report you should pay and the amount of event

135
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,760
in dollars or any of the currency you would like to add to your application.

136
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,680
It's up on you.

137
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:56,770
So initially, the labelled report said text is null and the written order is being disabled in the

138
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,350
beginning after the completion.

139
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,640
So after this report is generated, then everything is going to be set as default as it was in the beginning.

140
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:13,450
So after this dialog box of padding, everything will be know as in the beginning.

141
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:22,750
So I hope after the completion of this programming section, you all have gained a lot of conceptual

142
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,530
idea about what is being applied inside this project.

143
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:35,230
Everything we have used, we have extensively used the Swingin NWT Library in order to embed our life

144
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,790
the items to our frame.

145
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:44,230
So now let's try it on in-app negation and check that whether all the functionalities that we have,

146
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,870
our test is working fine or not.

147
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,860
So this is the application window open.

148
00:13:51,760 --> 00:14:01,030
So suppose we are trying to order something medium or a glass of tea, four glasses of B we are ordering

149
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,770
adding to the cart.

150
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,900
Would you like to add sugars?

151
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,390
So clicking yes.

152
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:15,490
So for me, the glasses off B with sugar added energy port is generated now after this on clicking on

153
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:15,910
our day.

154
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,640
But then our dialog box, there's this plain form reading glasses off.

155
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,050
David Sugar is costing $20 and on heating.

156
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,630
OK?

157
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,840
Our dialog box again appears showing that what is the total amount to be paid by the customer?

158
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,800
So you should pay $20 and on who they aren't, OK?

159
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,160
Again, they will be landing back to our like previous window, which was initially open.

160
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:50,230
So again, let us try to our order two things that are also adding four add ice.

161
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:56,080
Then again, a glass of coffee, a large glass of coffee, adding it to God.

162
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,660
And yes, we want to attach milk to the coffee.

163
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,150
One large glass of coffee with milk is our.

164
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:10,930
Now on who they are for glasses, for large classes offered to retirees costing $15 and one large glass

165
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,150
of coffee with milk nine point seventy five dollars is added to the card on anything OK.

166
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:22,420
A total of twenty four point seventy five dollars is generated as the total bill for the customer on

167
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,150
heating up.

168
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:29,490
Get back to our homepage so they'll know everything is working correctly.

169
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,250
Find the application is running pretty well.

170
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:41,410
I hope you all have been through the program section like the very concentrate give me and gained every

171
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,170
concept we have used inside this application.

172
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,510
Now I tried running this.

173
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:53,230
Try making calls on your own and try running the application on your own so that you will learn everything

174
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,790
more accurately.

175
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:01,960
So yes, we have completed this project and everything is working perfectly fine.

176
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,100
And then I want to thank you all for joining this session.

177
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,440
