1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:07,460
In previous things, I created the gameplay and we are done with the gameplay metal.

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:14,840
Now I'm going to create one another thing which is basically my gender too, so I'm going to create

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,840
another class right click on inside of the source folder.

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,670
Go to New.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:26,480
You can check your loading menu, go to Java class and mention as name Map Generator.

6
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,890
My generator, so it will give me when new public class, my junior.

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,080
So I'm using it only.

8
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,830
And I mean, when you don't, you don't you can minimize this.

9
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,690
And now in general, the first thing I need to create to demand.

10
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,890
So for two, the very similar thing I'm going to grill here as we are coordinating two, very.

11
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,540
As map and creating as it to the Eddie.

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,710
Posting first public in Britain, I need to mention big word.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,800
Then public.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,600
And.

15
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,120
Brick, right?

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,540
So if you closely this or this is a similar thing.

17
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,080
I'm quoting here.

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,520
Brick.

19
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,540
So these things will be resolved when I clear the map and everything.

20
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:57,780
Now I need to create one constructor of yours so you can use your old insert to go with your constructor.

21
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,560
But let me create it as it is my generator default package.

22
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:14,360
Well, you can check in row or row purpose and column for column this, which is going to put in that

23
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,740
part only, which is.

24
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,080
Matt?

25
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,780
Is equal to new.

26
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,570
Increase in.

27
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:25,990
Room.

28
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,380
Gone.

29
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,510
So it will put in that, but.

30
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:40,590
But in again, that iReport just basically generating some values for map and putting in the map lint.

31
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,730
Matt Lind.

32
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,790
I + +.

33
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,950
And one more look.

34
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,510
For.

35
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,550
And G is equal to zero.

36
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:05,120
Gays and lesbians linked again, but not the complete zealot looking, which is basically the starting

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,780
position of now.

38
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,390
Lint.

39
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,120
Duplass Plus.

40
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,260
Matt?

41
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,190
I met Jim.

42
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,490
She should be one.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,800
So I need to mention this.

44
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:35,530
After this, oh, and to mention mentioned brick wall, so brick will be quite well written, create

45
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,000
with written brick liquid.

46
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,420
540 divided by a column.

47
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,970
Which really directly depends on this and 150 divided by.

48
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,530
So it will take directly.

49
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,830
So, I mean, not to mention everything again and again.

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:57,800
Now.

51
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,570
Public void.

52
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:10,090
Which is basically shooting this part or directly dividing the similar order as so it will be reinvigorated,

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,970
the world order number of caller breaks that my.

54
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,820
You me draw.

55
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,570
Graphics are 2D graphics, 2D.

56
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,240
Yes, so once I call this you to hear AWG things, it's called.

57
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,640
No, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create one or not want look for look.

58
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,160
With the entire.

59
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,390
Zero.

60
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,600
Other than implementing it is Madeleine to me.

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,760
At length.

62
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,740
I believe that Maryland.

63
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,710
So.

64
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,860
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this point because.

65
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,590
And very.

66
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,050
Well.

67
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,320
So, OK, so these things are done.

68
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,250
Let me mention this if we can get so.

69
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,460
If map is I come up, gee.

70
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,170
Might not my.

71
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,770
Everything is greater than zero, which is the ideal condition.

72
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,750
Oh, gee, not set clear.

73
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,620
I'm going to it see you.

74
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,780
It's you, and I don't.

75
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,790
Wait, wait.

76
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,040
OK.

77
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,080
It's just OK, color that light, which is relatively light colored, it's going to say to the bricks

78
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,280
white.

79
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,300
And you, Dodd.

80
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,390
Be that rectangle.

81
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,930
Ignore this era is giving me some kind of hit it off.

82
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:17,910
So we will resolve it later, but it needs to create that with brick built.

83
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,230
You, you wait.

84
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,770
Yes, liquidity is what Brickwood plus 80.

85
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:35,880
With I start, it should be mentioned with brick height, the height, let's 50.

86
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,100
With which liquids and bleach type?

87
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:50,680
As many, many things, so we go off field rectangle, Oregon suit creating whole the rectangle as my

88
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,640
main part.

89
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,100
Now these things are done.

90
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,880
No, this.

91
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,830
And to do so, I'm going to create that mental separate.

92
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,320
Big.

93
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:08,910
Game.

94
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,760
It is basically going to separate the bacon game, so it will create another rectangle from it.

95
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,200
So basically can still run without it also.

96
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,310
So in this world testing purposes, we can stick, but.

97
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,190
Very important, whether that strong, I need to mention stroke.

98
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,420
New.

99
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,730
Basic stroke.

100
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,850
Java EWTN three, I'm going to mention as three.

101
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,660
With which stroke is basically no state killer method.

102
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,230
Sue, and you are not.

103
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,110
Black Angus, I.

104
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,430
Black first is Rachel did not know when I need to mention broad rectangular yet.

105
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:07,750
The rectangular window similar to this.

106
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,750
I think they would do it similar again.

107
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,710
We take down everything, everything is single.

108
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,400
No.

109
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,350
I created this, but I need to sit, but it really also for public.

110
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,820
Why?

111
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,450
Sit.

112
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:31,560
He.

113
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,630
Well, you.

114
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:37,810
In.

115
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:48,530
Tell you which is basically I'm going to mention how much you need to mention the raw flesh and column.

116
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,840
And now in this column, I'm going to create a map.

117
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:56,760
Rule.

118
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,770
Column.

119
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,980
Music will be held, so it will create different things for me, and I guess.

120
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,440
We're doing it.

121
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,530
I close the class, and that's not a problem.

122
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,450
OK, now it's, you know, now if you would do these things.

123
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,760
You can check.

124
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,700
And starting me for the resolving any purpose, and now you can check that there will be no errors in

125
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,480
our gameplay because I created a map generator function.

126
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,250
So this will create a map and this will create the functions, know what things are remaining.

127
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:46,310
I call this, but I won't six minutes and not creating an M.A. So for that purpose, I'm going to create

128
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,320
one main battalion.

129
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,310
Before that.

130
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,140
OK, it's clear on and close.

131
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:01,060
So what I'm going to do is this is my gender definition, isn't game plays, function is done.

132
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,300
Now I need to mention your mean function to call this my gender and gameplay functions in a minute or

133
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,610
two, I'm giving as mean only.

134
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,810
In this mean.

135
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,550
Obviously, to run any mean, Michael, you need.

136
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:25,650
All public static void may be going to ESPN to be extremely public, one minute should be print.

137
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,450
Jeffrey?

138
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,870
Geoffrey, I'm calling as an object your new Geoffrey.

139
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,440
My commitment or job, if it's something you can do you.

140
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,330
Gameplay.

141
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:47,060
So it's my default class gameplay with gameplay, I'm going to create your gameplay.

142
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,810
Well, what I'm going to do is we're game, OK?

143
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,350
Campbell, guess I'm going to use your game play with new obviously gameplay default package.

144
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,970
No, I need to mention boundaries of my object object.

145
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,360
With six bombs.

146
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,570
With two rectangular, which is basically my rectangular inverting by high dimension.

147
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,160
This will be the.

148
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,960
Well, tonight, X-ray Typekit.

149
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:27,090
Now I need to mention object title for this title.

150
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,680
So title name engineers.

151
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,100
Break.

152
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:39,770
Out.

153
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:43,980
Ball.

154
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,320
Game, which is my title game.

155
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:56,170
Are now said to be sizeable, which is basically disguising the part and don't want to do that when

156
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,070
mentioning is false.

157
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,610
If you are going to retire, it will default.

158
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,530
It will be create deformities in mapping functions, which is basically creating this.

159
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,550
So I'm mentioning, as this says, it should be avoided and certainly visible, which is basically creating

160
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,990
a visible and it should be true.

161
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,670
Well, Renee, it should be, too.

162
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,570
Now I need to mention your running function.

163
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,540
So for this object, not state.

164
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,550
Default.

165
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,980
Close operation, which is basically closing operation.

166
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,740
Jeffrey?

167
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,270
Jeff Green with.

168
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:46,060
Except on clothes is basically going to exist, so if I close, it should be closed object.

169
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,640
Which I am going to add basically gameplay.

170
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:55,980
And again.

171
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,000
It visible.

172
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,510
And it should be, too.

173
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,360
No, I created this mean, so game, please, I'm going to create your map generator is going to generate

174
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,240
a map and main method is going to load it.

175
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,560
So let us run this.

176
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,280
So you can check here it's running for me.

177
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,660
So it's giving me the running condition.

178
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,370
So it will take time to build and do everything but hope our code is correct, otherwise we will debug

179
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:47,520
it in a short way and we will check what sort of errors are, what are the errors in this?

180
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,500
But I guess it is perfectly fine.

181
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,330
Surpassing everything.

182
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:02,160
The beautiful thing of Java X-Wing is you should not be mentioning you or Java fix things, which is

183
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,940
basically WBBM options or anything it will load directly in your console only, which is very similar

184
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,240
to the No.

185
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,070
You can check here.

186
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,830
It's maddening and you can check your mind.

187
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,930
Coley started on this in my ballgame, so as you can see, I mentioned resizable.

188
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,030
So as we're going to check here.

189
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:33,050
My these teams are remaining, but my ball is not moving, so let us debug it.

190
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:40,490
I guess we mean error in our fault, so we will take it, but you can check your mind these things are

191
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:46,370
working and this is not going to do this part and this is demeaning to this part, so you can check

192
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:46,630
here.

193
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,200
It's not moving like upward trend downward, not just moving from here to there.

194
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,990
If I close this, it's going to me finish good with this.

195
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,390
So now it's looking.

196
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:56,660
But.

197
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,730
We made some errors in poor look.

198
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,350
So first we will debug it.

199
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,620
OK.

200
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:11,870
I found one error in this, which is very common error.

201
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,550
I started this fall appear to be my for.

202
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,340
And before I know.

203
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:26,210
But before that, I'm closing it in earlier, which is basically and moving it upwards.

204
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:32,000
With this for some practicalities for newbies going out of this.

205
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,830
So it's not going to move at all.

206
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,970
It's obviously.

207
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:44,120
So do one thing here is just move this below this map to this end, and now let us run it again.

208
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,010
Negotiating, whether it's working or not.

209
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:56,460
So we look at this, and if I press this now, you can take my ball is moving and it's going to bounce

210
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,970
and these results, so you can you and mine?

211
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,250
These things are also happening.

212
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:09,090
While recording this, you can tell there is some lag due to some system configuration or otherwise.

213
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,350
It's moving very fine.

214
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,350
And you can check here it's giving me this.

215
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,860
And you can check if it goes down, it is going to know if I press into again.

216
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,680
It will create meet another man, another new.

217
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,630
On which most to the right part, you entered on this late.

218
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,140
This is going live because I mentioned this.

219
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,180
So if it suits this position at this part, so it will go to right now moving to the right.

220
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,930
Now you can check in this.

221
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,320
So it's looking very fine.

222
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,580
Work all is working very successfully.

223
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,780
So now it's moving in that we only.

224
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,900
And our goal is working to know which very critical condition to in that game, and as you can see,

225
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,100
my sport is pretty violent.

226
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,950
You can press intrusion into this uniform.

227
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,410
I hope you understand that suit for the breakout ball game.

228
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:30,200
So know what you can do in this is as a creating from scratch.

229
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,790
That explanation light pollution.

230
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,870
What you can do.

231
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,380
You can create some illustrations here and you can add it directly.

232
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,890
As I'm creating here a single player game, you can create your multiplayer games on so you can create

233
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,400
animation.

234
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,830
You can add a sound also in this game.

235
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,040
Hope you understand.

236
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:48,820
Thank you.

237
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,830
So this is a very basic game and created to learn how the AWB things works here and what is the basic

238
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,450
mechanism of AWB?

239
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,010
Hope you understand.

240
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,850
Thank you.
