00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,970
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:13,100
So we have successfully created a file, but then as with options attached with it as new open sea energy.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,440
So we are done with this file.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,950
Now we're going to jump to this edit button.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,380
So creating functions for this and this button as new menu item.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,190
Similarly.

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,210
I read on it for the file section.

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:42,430
So, Jim, menu item will be like for edit me and do a cut of copy paste.

9
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,770
And I think we can select on.

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,660
So yes, the you can't.

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,920
No new menu item will be closed.

12
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,940
Yes, I think it does a menu item could.

13
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,580
We can certain this.

14
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,480
Method to the Edmonton.

15
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:28,760
And we can use this fact again, space between you and Jim menu item, so similarly for coffee.

16
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,200
Base and select all decks.

17
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,560
So coffee.

18
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,190
Based.

19
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,360
Select all.

20
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,830
And replacing it heralds.

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,250
I'll be.

22
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,540
Based and select all.

23
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,440
As we say.

24
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:14,380
So, yes, now successfully importing these menu items for Java Swing Library.

25
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,400
Now we have to add constructors to it.

26
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,710
So adding this did not and.

27
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,810
For the one so and in to cut.

28
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,890
And.

29
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,300
Similarly for BP, stem cell still.

30
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,960
He's.

31
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,750
It's four times.

32
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,700
And then this place.

33
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,400
Non-human cells, copy paste.

34
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,740
And door.

35
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:14,150
So select we are so we have glitter actions for the edit button now we will try to run this Soyuz running

36
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:20,420
this not burn gloves, run Java and waiting for the program to run.

37
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,550
Checking for that.

38
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,380
So, yes, we have successfully added cut copy paste and select all options for the Note 10.

39
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,850
So when we are inputting text, we can coordinate copy paste and select all the text.

40
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,830
Now the filing also has options and it also have options.

41
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,440
Now we are going to learn about the space in the health section.

42
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,250
So for that, we have to create a about class.

43
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,070
In our.

44
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,270
So.

45
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:10,130
We have successfully created the world class now, Java Swing Library.

46
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:17,630
Similarly, as the Note 10+ import Java X naught swing.

47
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,020
Import.

48
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,380
Hmm.

49
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:41,450
So that struck her the note that we are importing all the components from the liability now writing

50
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,070
the code for About Constructor section.

51
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,660
So creating a constructor called about.

52
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,120
Opening braces.

53
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,460
And we have said bounds for the flame side of the notepad window.

54
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:08,300
So similarly, we have to set bounds for the about section as well.

55
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:17,280
Let us first set the title for this about session suspect title.

56
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,590
As.

57
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:34,100
About noted down application, so in the handling of this about families along the way.

58
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,740
No, no.

59
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,180
No application.

60
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,160
So it's fine now.

61
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,480
We are going to set that tighter.

62
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,100
We have certified and now we are going to set about.

63
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,880
So it's showing some aerosols.

64
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:10,050
I think if we were to extend this class as Jeff Green, we are going to create a frame, then only we

65
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,000
title Atlantic bones.

66
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,990
So, yes, extend.

67
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:24,440
Friends now, their star vanished, so set bombs on.

68
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,680
What do you think the bone scan will do?

69
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,390
The rectangle feels so.

70
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,550
Something smaller than the notepad window for me.

71
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,110
Hundred hundred.

72
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,300
500 or something like 400.

73
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,280
Just fine.

74
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:59,440
So the bouncer said, now let's try to run this by creating a main function public static void main

75
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:10,410
main function is creating fostering string arguments and then try to run this.

76
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,780
They know all about us page.

77
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:25,200
We have to set the visibility to go first, then only we can run this new involved.

78
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,630
Martin mentioned is involved to the constructor that we created.

79
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,260
I'm setting the vision related to.

80
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:39,650
Through.

81
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,820
Remoteness not.

82
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,630
Yes.

83
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,220
So the about frame is created in a of ways.

84
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,750
Let us try to run this.

85
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,500
So perfect.

86
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,500
We have about Grindle about their known application with this size.

87
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:22,230
Now we will try to input something inside this and try to check this after writing the call.

88
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,770
So closing this and trying to.

89
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:34,740
You're writing how your source said the foreclosure operations said

90
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,840
so on closing on clicking the close button.

91
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,050
We know about the.

92
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,220
Setting this to frame this forum close.

93
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,140
Jeff?

94
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,360
This falls on close, so this when this falls.

95
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,840
On close.

96
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,290
So, yes.

97
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,610
We have to settle down as normal.

98
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:32,370
Now live similarly, and I can do the above thing, no, and then not by far.

99
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,210
So copying this part from her image, I can class and.

100
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:50,510
Treating this like, OK, so when we're done this, we really get a similar window.

101
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,040
As not but on the African is an issue.

102
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:04,130
So we have nanoparticle in the title bar and on minimizing in their task what?

103
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:12,700
So after ending the item, we are going to add some text inside the about talked.

104
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,410
So for the text part, inside the window, we have this dilemma.

105
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:30,450
And inside the jail and then we have an edge band which contains some stairs, as noted down the watered

106
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,170
down version.

107
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:31,830
All right.

108
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,960
Another noted down is a.

109
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,050
It is basically no idea what what this app is doing.

110
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,270
So we have used well.

111
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:53,540
So you are really using this button as deliver takes only input as a stammer dance and does not support

112
00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:00,760
backlash, and so we are using this as demonstrated from the beginning to the end.

113
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,710
You can see the.

114
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,740
So let's try to.

115
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:15,570
So I'm running this about when do we get the polls as this, the things that are done inside the testimony

116
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,540
that are displayed here in them about this window.

117
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,170
No.

118
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:34,090
In the Note 10 home page, we are supposed to edit, write and save text so that it's possible only

119
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:39,820
when we are going to take input inside the notepad window.

120
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:47,650
So let us figure it out to function so that we can write text inside the notepad window.
