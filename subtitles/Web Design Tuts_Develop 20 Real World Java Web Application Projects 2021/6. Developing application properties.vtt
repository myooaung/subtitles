WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:11.210
So we already look out this part, which is basically we created the one controller, part two handling

2
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.080
the controlling part.

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.910
Let me do anything.

4
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.830
It includes all these things.

5
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.460
We created one controller to perform the controlling actions, as you can see here.

6
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:31.110
Listen, for the controlling all the things we created one in the morning, which is handling the JPA

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.810
part in the repository.

8
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.020
This is the repository to store the files and everything it's going to create, as you can see here.

9
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.150
This is auto wired things now in the services.

10
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.970
I created one service with the list, which is going to throw in, at least with some get all inclusive

11
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.110
and all the things here.

12
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.310
And this is another method which is implementing this interface as a class system and which is calling

13
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.320
all those things and putting the data here.

14
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.670
And this is my main method, which is going to run and doing everything.

15
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.610
So as you know, this is the stuff I'm going to create, but I haven't mentioned how we can create the

16
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.450
database so that you don't.

17
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.760
Back in part, here, then on, let us see, I created one friend in Bartlesville.

18
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.460
So go to resources here.

19
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.290
As you can see, go to the resources stem and.

20
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.480
Here, Diesel assist in this.

21
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.670
Then go to the time, let's create one folder directory templates and create these three statements,

22
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.810
so I will explain what are these three accumulation plasticine days loaded steaming.

23
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.950
Remember, the loading should be and we will always not save the team live as my oh, assimilating here

24
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.130
with TED employee management system I'm mentioning.

25
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.710
Then this is the style shoot I'm mentioning, which is bootstraps patient with some SHA256 integrity.

26
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.710
You can check online that advice I'm mentioning.

27
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.540
The employee leaves employers list the industrial new in place on current page.

28
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.860
So these are the team leave each.

29
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.960
Are you of things I'm accessing here then?

30
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.320
List of employee's total pages.

31
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.510
Sam Curran page I'm mentioning if your pages exiting well, then this in the new employee.

32
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.100
It's very simple log in form, which saves employers my acting.

33
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.470
Then I'm enjoying this and update employee for the auditing part.

34
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm going to create your access.

35
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.820
Julie, as you can see here, this is for the updating part.

36
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.510
So these are the all the things related to how I created the affronting FAQ here.

37
00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.210
So you can use these directly and these things are very important to see an employee.

38
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.670
I'm accessing the methods with the object.

39
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.830
So remember the annotations nano symbols, then sometimes starts.

40
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.060
You need to find the hidden part text and controller, and I'm giving the button with some.

41
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.520
This class, which is already default in this stack, but with bootstrap inside and you can check in

42
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.370
with the back of home page by the slash.

43
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.490
So that's it I created.

44
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.170
So let us see how we can create one database here.

45
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.940
So for the database, what you need it, you need it on my school workbench, I'm using my skill.

46
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.760
So it's very important you shouldn't need by my school or otherwise.

47
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.480
You can choose your that you need a local server because I'm accessing the local database only.

48
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.030
So let us see how we can create here.

49
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.090
So let me create one database.

50
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.680
First you create.

51
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.210
Database, so it will give me the database I'm mentioning as employee.

52
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.240
OK, so employees, my database.

53
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:16.110
Use database, I need to mention it, or you can use directly here, also employed, so I'm accessing

54
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.890
that employee.

55
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.760
Yes.

56
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.900
I'm using that simply, so I'm not exercising again and again, I'm going to deploy it directly.

57
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.530
Oh, I'm not accessing it again and again, so I'm enjoying no create stable.

58
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.850
So.

59
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.060
Really able name as MP.

60
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.890
With this, if you know your skill, you should use this.

61
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.460
Oh, I'd mentioning with Inked.

62
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.180
Not.

63
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.670
None.

64
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.190
Primary mentioning as a primary key, as you can see, primary key.

65
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.410
It means an primary key.

66
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.940
I'm going to mention auto increment, so auto increment for the increment because default.

67
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.600
You know, I need to mention first name here.

68
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.540
And remember, I am putting first name as this.

69
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.240
So if you go to the IDP, Barton, just look out your malting.

70
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.100
Model the employed part here.

71
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:32.380
So this name and this name, the column name should be similar, so I need to create an indeed Slade.

72
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.820
But remember, this name and condominium should be same.

73
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.570
So for that purpose, I'm mentioning this column name and I'm mentioning as a character.

74
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.440
So let me mention Bearcat here.

75
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:53.710
And let me mention as Oregon's consisting, so I'm doing this not in alignment, including here.

76
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.280
Not right?

77
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.370
Then again, last name.

78
00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.290
We getting.

79
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.720
Let me mention for you what you.

80
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:11.270
So it's very useful, and I'm not giving the document concerned yet and email I again giving the not

81
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:20.810
many constraints, so emailing Radican and it's then not null.

82
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:31.260
So, no, this is if you need to create regarding a school sequel with the creation of a database and

83
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.360
everything on this is administration part and go to the scheme has to choose this file.

84
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.430
So select all this.

85
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.640
And he loved that script of everything.

86
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.900
So it's like an icon.

87
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.320
So in the outputting, you can check on all the outputs are currently creating and all of which are

88
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.690
created, but we can't not see the schemas here.

89
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.460
So just right click here and click Refresh on.

90
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.180
Once you refresh all you can check, you're over it.

91
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:03.110
It I mean, it's easier and it's showing me the only things I'd email LastName.

92
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:10.350
It shows me the foreign keys also indexes, so indexes is basically primary key and mentioning so everything

93
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.280
it's created.

94
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.540
So now you're you can close this because we don't required this manuscripts.

95
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.250
So the little about how I'm going to tell you how I'm going to work with this.

96
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.990
Let us move to.

97
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.170
So if you closely look, we created this, OK?

98
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:36.510
I assume that we already created the database and we are accessing, but we haven't mentioned what existing

99
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.140
I'm giving.

100
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.210
I'm not mentioning the properties here.

101
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.660
So for that purpose, we need one properties part.

102
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:49.980
So Properties is on the team, but you can say like, oh, accessing and giving that unique database

103
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.730
identities.

104
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:52.950
So.

105
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.980
Let me go to the application properties here.

106
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.900
These application properties.

107
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.480
And let me mention, so it's not like it's property, so it's very simple.

108
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:14.060
My sequel database, I'm going to mention first my second database as my ammunition properties in that

109
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.840
I'm mentioning first name.

110
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.640
So now.

111
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.730
Instead, this Deb.

112
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.680
Oh, it's very easy putting.

113
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:36.450
Not all the tussles and to mention, so we to source.

114
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.350
Not you are.

115
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:44.220
So these are the default things you need to mention datasource you are in.

116
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.140
Now what do you mean?

117
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.330
What do I glibc again?

118
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:54.590
The Java database connected only dot or I guess you have to use semicolon.

119
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.520
Yes, single my sequel.

120
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.910
And accessing the sequel due to his.

121
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.350
Then local host.

122
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:15.370
Because my mind is placed on local host, at least to check for years, link to 06 is the default world

123
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.470
number of my My three three zero six.

124
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.150
And your database name.

125
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.900
So my name is simply, as I told you, you need to mention their datasource to you are first.

126
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:29.070
Now you need to mention the driver last name.

127
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.810
So it's very easy.

128
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.040
Again.

129
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.610
Spring driver class name.

130
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.270
Wait a minute, I forgot to mention this, OK?

131
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.890
Winning not.

132
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.630
Driver, oh.

133
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.900
The tassels and driver gloves name basically all.

134
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:58.830
So my school, you need to mention Fiji order to remember this well, you need to always do the CGT,

135
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.120
not your defaulting, then spring again.

136
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.030
Not.

137
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.320
Again, this spring, datasource username you need to check.

138
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.160
So let me put your actual data.

139
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.150
Source?

140
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.150
Don't you?

141
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.230
Username.

142
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.010
Username, so for me, the username is rude.

143
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.930
And spring, not data, so it's not password, basically.

144
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:34.600
Oh.

145
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.470
Not all this is in my password for my database.

146
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:48.500
So we created this, but I haven't mentioned the spring property, so you need to mention the Jeep properties

147
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.040
also here.

148
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.040
So.

149
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:58.540
Hibernate be a robot, but it means you need to mention.

150
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.690
So first properties spring GPA, so.

151
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:08.800
JP.

152
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:18.370
So you need to mention the strategy, and every tangential properties don't have a lot of these.

153
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:21.280
Don't.

154
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.420
I wouldn't it you shouldn't mention, but.

155
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.110
It's magic, whether it's there or not.

156
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:30.960
OK.

157
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.060
Not to mention the spring hibernate.

158
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.940
I left my school, which is basically my school, by lifting, so.

159
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.960
Spitting, not proper.

160
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:45.780
These.

161
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:52.860
New properties, what you need to mention, the data was basically so.

162
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:57.630
Database, not properties they can do one to.

163
00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:59.760
Database.

164
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:11.470
If we do it on this platform and it's my it's my sequel, so you need to mention this hibernate.

165
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.030
Then I'm accessing some defaulting Sierra.

166
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.340
So let me tell you what is this team's?

167
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.650
So these things you need to mention in the application properties, this is for the DBA and accessing

168
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.700
the DB part here.

169
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:39.670
And this is Florida holding in GPA and putting into these things with scale, and it's going to create

170
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.010
a school, truly school and everything you're detail on.

171
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.880
So that said about how we can perform this.

172
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.670
So let us check how I'm going to deploy this.

173
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.060
So deployment is very easy.

174
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.790
Go to this.

175
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:58.750
It's actually already loaded in on the top here on Zoom, or you can run on this also, but you can

176
00:12:58.930 --> 00:12:59.900
click this stop.

177
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.590
So this is the first time building.

178
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.440
So for the first time building, it will take time to build everything.

179
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.480
You can check your blog also.

180
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.710
So let's check below and let's check how it's going to work.

181
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.980
So it's currently running the end task, and it's going to go for them, so it will take time to build.

182
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:27.760
The beautiful thing about this, it will not exist, though, not use libraries, it will not be taken

183
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.750
in the part of that.

184
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:37.360
So as you can see, it's passing the Java, it's creating the model and it's checking the compilation

185
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.920
part and bill is not successful.

186
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:44.050
No, the thing is in the run part, rent control part.

187
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:45.920
You can check.

188
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.810
Oh, it will default, flip in the spring here.

189
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:56.420
Now it will create some good things, and it will check here.

190
00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.360
So wait for something to create different things.

191
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.600
So now my program is finished.

192
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:07.220
I am going to tell you we need to mention some auto factory reset things here.

193
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.170
So.

194
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.010
Let me take one thing here.

195
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.220
OK, so Springwood application buggies and Uber.

196
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:20.960
Also, we need to display that part also and with the entity managing factor also.

197
00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.820
So we we are definitely not going to do that.

198
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.700
So let it go who I'm going to change that part here.

199
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.480
So maybe there is one error with bombed-out example.

200
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.680
That's why it's giving me the.

201
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.010
Sometime dependencies are not involved directly.

202
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:51.400
So let me move to the bomb similar.

203
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.260
So if you are no.

204
00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.770
No, this part or you can check your word.

205
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.030
Let me put here again.

206
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.570
So it will analyze the bar.

207
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.830
It's going into scoping text and everything.

208
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:34.390
Again, oh, you're going to cure it's currently lunacy, I'm giving you the time to perform these actions.

209
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.770
So as you can see, it's the.

210
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:59.160
Different different things for usually the PostgreSQL, so I don't need that dependency.

211
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:09.020
Then this is the springboard the team leave alone, all the things, and I'm sure some are doing OK.

212
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.340
No, no, this.

213
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.640
But on This Morning again.

214
00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.500
And let us have a look.

215
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.860
What is the different us or this spring?

216
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.500
You notice I'm getting so bored or decimal will minimize this song.

217
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.030
Stick with it.

218
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.710
It's going to minimize or not.

219
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.360
OK.

220
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.920
I found the error, basically.

221
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:55.880
So let me stop this bill part, so it's very common error.

222
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.480
You need to give the just distinct to.

223
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:06.350
Oh, you that look close part, so let me be able to come in.

224
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:13.580
So remember, this is the URL you can check on that school work binge on if it's giving the error.

225
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:27.690
Now it will be deployed beautifully, as I told you in the spring, but also it will deploy it directly.

226
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.180
And now the spring is no running spring application.

227
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.620
So wait for some time to move to the spring.

228
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:42.130
Spring would ignore these errors because my charts what 64 bit and it's difficult to really get out,

229
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.260
but I'm using an analogy Newcastle.

230
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:49.450
There is maybe sometimes so as you can see myself losing all started.

231
00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.700
It's giving the time configuration indexes.

232
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.480
It's creating all these things, that context part.

233
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.960
But we do know you can check here.

234
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.650
Let me show you.

235
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:14.980
Here also, it's getting all the details with the Web interfaces and all the things before it's loaded

236
00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.070
on local AT&amp;T directly.

237
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:24.850
Now it's currently running and you can take care of all this activity, which always the local or tomcat

238
00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.680
is already started on my web server.

239
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:31.630
So your thing is just to basically go to your browser.

240
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:32.740
I'm on Chrome.

241
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.260
Apia localhost 80.

242
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:38.910
And he didn't.

243
00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.670
So it for some time, it will lower the bar.

244
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:53.330
Now this in my employee management system, as I told you then in this, I need to mention first an

245
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.100
employee, I need to add the employee.

246
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.770
So let me mention name as John.

247
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.400
Employee last name is James Sawyer.

248
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.080
Let me mention as odd, so odd, John.

249
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.500
Or not?

250
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.920
John Andrade.

251
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:12.960
Gmail dot com.

252
00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.540
Let me hear the Silverton.

253
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.940
As you can see, I'm going to this park.

254
00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:23.320
So you will ask whether this is indeed on database or not.

255
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.070
So for that purpose, let me show you it's already added in the database.

256
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.860
So for that purpose, I'm going to access my my workbench.

257
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:36.000
So you can take care of this, but also I need to mention as John.

258
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.150
Not Otto, its name is John Yoo.

259
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.840
OK, so let me change this, John, you.

260
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:45.320
And update.

261
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:51.810
You're going to hear it's updating, you can check your delete part also, so first, let us see whether

262
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.110
our data on the database or is just catching from the catch about on part.

263
00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:01.670
So for that purpose, go to your MySchool workbench.

264
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:08.010
This is my dirty, defaulting connect to local instance, my ability to design my root server.

265
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.510
So it is opening me the loop so low is opening for me.

266
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:21.250
So be it for some time, so it will check whether my action is going to yes, my action is connected

267
00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:25.810
and you can check your this thing is already stored here already.

268
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:34.220
So I don't want this part because I already created the database and I don't want to know what I need.

269
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.610
Do I need to select star from?

270
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:47.180
MP and he's in the minority, so this is my table, so I need to mention and let me execute this.

271
00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:55.320
And, OK, so as in this, you can check here on these ideas already created for.

272
00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.450
You can check here.

273
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:57.590
These are my ID.

274
00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.410
You, you, you and you, John, and the regiment is already headed for me.

275
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:11.420
So let me go to the Cro-Magnon and let me delude this far, so as you can see, there is nothing here.

276
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.070
And let me go to this again.

277
00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.700
And let me execute this command line again.

278
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.730
You can check.

279
00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:26.330
There is nothing you saw my dirty fighting season, I'm working and I'm working with the database.

280
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.980
If you want to add it again, just go to your ad employees.

281
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.470
Now I'm going to mention James.

282
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:35.240
G.

283
00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.580
Then G.

284
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.330
James G.

285
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:47.270
And Andrade, G.M. dot com, I'm going to mention I'm doing the same, so as you can see, I did, and

286
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:53.000
if I go to the my school workbench again, if I enter it again, so you can.

287
00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:58.520
So let me tell you why putting the two year because it's on auto increments, so it will auto increment

288
00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.260
by default.

289
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:06.530
If you want to do that, it's not default in part, so you need to mention that later.

290
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.760
But due to auto increment you need, you are getting this.

291
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.860
So that said about this project.

292
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.480
So let me give you one overview about this.

293
00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.360
What I created is just to let me turn on this.

294
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:27.410
So I created the application properties you need to mention you are here with the class name.

295
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.790
This I wouldn't even use your username with the password.

296
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.340
No, the properties with these.

297
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:42.460
So, OK, these things with our nation by through these things, $1.6m also important thing here.

298
00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:43.670
So that's it.

299
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.530
You need to create.

300
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.230
So hope you understand.

301
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.970
And we created this project employs service.

302
00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.110
So what are you going to do?

303
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:55.120
You're going to deploy this employ service with another database using PostgreSQL on you, local.

304
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.230
What's available?

305
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.180
So this is the basic structure.

306
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:03.880
But while deploying on this, you should remember you need to change this application properties with

307
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.540
username, password, driver and you are also what you need to change.

308
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.640
You need to change.

309
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.400
Oh, pondered external dependencies.

310
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.150
You need to add that dependencies like PostgreSQL dependencies.

311
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.550
So that's available on their documentation, but also hope you understand.

312
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:22.720
Thank you.
