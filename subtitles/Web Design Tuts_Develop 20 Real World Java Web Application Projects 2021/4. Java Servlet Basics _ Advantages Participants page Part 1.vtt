WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:08.470
In previous sessions, I told you about all things like related to something that we created in the

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.870
Northeast, and then we created one HDMI file inside of Web Pages folder, a log in, which is basically

3
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.850
you log in to display admin logging methods.

4
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.060
So now I'm closing this because we are done with that admin logging and everything.

5
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.480
But as I told you, so this is basically Java Solarte.

6
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.640
But now we are going to deal with database Java Servlet and our estimate.

7
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.060
So before that, I'm going to use your Oracle database.

8
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.790
So always remember the Oracle database services IT beauty.

9
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.880
That port number is when you are installing will understand that.

10
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.360
So before installing Oracle, see there is one important step you have to change the.

11
00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.230
Support for blast free survival, if you go to the libraries, you can see there is goulash with server

12
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.500
and in the tools of the ID, which is native beans.

13
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.910
You can go to schools.

14
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.280
It is the sort of what option go to that acceptable option.

15
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.530
You can see I changed the board 82 to 2000 in your your.

16
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.160
You can see people do it.

17
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.880
We did basically default for local host.

18
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.200
But I'm going to use your two zero two zero zero and when I change this, how I can change this.

19
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.970
So where the installation is located on Mac or Windows system in the Reno system, you have to go to

20
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.190
the studio, which is mandated, then uses your computer name that you will find the glass fish.

21
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.600
Sort of what a folder by default location is that you can change the location.

22
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.860
We'll do that or by then go to that domain.

23
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.260
So my location is domain.

24
00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.040
Lashley's domains domain one config domain, not example, where you can find all the port numbers and

25
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.460
everything.

26
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:09.820
So open any that part in it or something notepad, notepad plus plus any code editor, then search for

27
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.320
your port number.

28
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.180
So I four two two zero zero to your ported activity.

29
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.940
So it it is not more located here, as you can see two zero or two zero zero.

30
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.930
So instead of ADT, you can change these to two zero zero.

31
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.360
Do not.

32
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.630
I look at it all on your system change.

33
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.170
Do not.

34
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.870
A one two zero zero two is free on my system so I can deploy these two two zero zero two server press

35
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.900
and save this part.

36
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.490
Now you can.

37
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:52.770
Proceed with your installation of Oracle database, so as you can see in the server of your localist

38
00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:00.330
port is now changed, so mine is already changed to two 00 do in your case, a duty change to another

39
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.760
way installing.

40
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.000
You can also change with another server name or something like that.

41
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.230
So this is by installing Oracle database, meaning all which you will find during this installation.

42
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.570
Once his installation done opened up ran the school command here, which is basically what I call it

43
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.600
school plus plus command.

44
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.220
So to connect to a school board, this executing, we are going to execute using this only we are not

45
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.550
going to use any new database or something to create.

46
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.640
I'm going to use this only so username means I'm going to say specified default system.

47
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.530
I remember when installing your password and remembering that password.

48
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.400
So as you can see, my system is connected now.

49
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.800
I can execute any school commands like creatively delete evil or anything.

50
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.830
So this is all about the Oracle database installation.

51
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.290
Before that, for delivery driver Oracle databases, you did or would you advise you, Oracle database,

52
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.700
Java database connection?

53
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.690
I'm going to use here for the invasion 10 to the latest or something.

54
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.020
So please use that also for database connection.

55
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.790
So that's all about everything set up with liberty for info that I'm going to tell you how we can set

56
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.400
up everything, but just remember these things.

57
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.940
So once we are done with our admin page now, let us move with this event log in page, so I'm going

58
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.500
to read part logging instrument I already created by the logging initiative when we do that, by this

59
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.030
one logging achievement page to say their time constraint.

60
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.280
So here we are going to give you two options create account.

61
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.620
If you are a new user, already a user, please log.

62
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:54.010
So we are going to create the signup demand for signup page on logging instrument logging.

63
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.480
So these are very simple and I'm going to create some.

64
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.550
I'm using the links, just I'm leaving the links.

65
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.570
It's all about different.

66
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.310
So let us create some peace.

67
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.430
Sign up first.

68
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.030
So what is the peace sign?

69
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.140
A sign up page?

70
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.830
So I'm going to remove this.

71
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.710
You can even do this just for me.

72
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.640
So we'll need all of the parties.

73
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.040
All we're in my case, you can change do to something on either, but I'm going to use only a single

74
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.720
link for these all things like style shoots and everything.

75
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.540
You then modify this to another, so please log in using valid name and username password, you can

76
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.730
add or something like that.

77
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.320
So I'm going to change this.

78
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.510
Please sign up not logging.

79
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.140
Please sign up.

80
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.980
As.

81
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.760
New user.

82
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.920
Nurtured.

83
00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:02.570
So participants knew all about blogging going to change it to the sign up page.

84
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.740
OK.

85
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.710
Username should be your registration number you can change or something like that.

86
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.840
Your information, I'm going to change this.

87
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:17.010
No need to mention this because I consider this as a university first university related.

88
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.000
But now I'm going to change this to all, all over the bar.

89
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.860
So I'm going, I'm going to use it.

90
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.250
As I told you in admin, log in, I'm going to use your form.

91
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.400
It'll form.

92
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.220
It is posting action is stored.

93
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.610
Remember, this is our Java.

94
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.580
So learning which we are going to use stored being stored in the password on storing their data.

95
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.970
So I'm going to switch over naming your first name.

96
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.650
I just want to put their name.

97
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.080
You can add them all up to name, location, everything.

98
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.930
But I am going to want it only for different name, username, password and confirm password because

99
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.090
I'm going to tell you some basic part of it.

100
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.970
Not very deep part of everything.

101
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:04.680
So name then it should be text and feeling, then username based username password this and confirm

102
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.320
password, then submit button, and I'm going to close all the text that should ever be signed up.

103
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.860
So how we can see our story?

104
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:21.570
So before I'm going to tell story in all the methods with a database connection, I'm going to tell

105
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.040
you about more about sums.

106
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.260
So Lake Park, how this overlooks actually work and why this a Willard.

107
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.800
I'm going to use you for their database connection and everything.

108
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:37.500
So let us see why our database and everything is very good.

109
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:46.440
Using this on it, so normally on though, what is the function from server and everything runs on is

110
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.550
the request and response.

111
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:56.010
So consider that one server which uses CGI CGI means common gateway interface before these technologies

112
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:56.970
are exist.

113
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.610
Like server related Java, then Python.

114
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.190
Also, CGI is most commonly used.

115
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.510
So CGI technology enables the web server to call external programs.

116
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.110
What we are creating these are the external programs.

117
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.100
These are stored in the server, but it's not on the network.

118
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.960
Our Java program is not on.

119
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.520
The network is on the system.

120
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.690
Basically, we are riding on the system in support of features that part.

121
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.500
And to use that part logic inside.

122
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:32.630
So before that, so let's CGI technology and industry observer to call excellent programs and pass as

123
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.250
an issue to be requesting information.

124
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.490
We are going to pass that issue to be its go, and we're just so late on general logic to ask you to

125
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:46.010
be part by example and process requests for you to request you to start the new process.

126
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.260
So here comes some logical or computer science, but we'll say this means fast.

127
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.160
Lindsey Dreadnoughtus.

128
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.220
So if you want to go to three shops.

129
00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:05.120
But every time what you are going to logic is, I'm going exemple, Photoshop, you want to go to shop

130
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.670
ABC, see what everything, what you are going to do on the starting point.

131
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.880
Go to e, then come to the starting point.

132
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.850
Then again, from the what to be.

133
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.970
Then again, come to the starting point to starting point.

134
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:26.700
Each process takes too much time, so it creates three processes, consider it like that if you want

135
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.320
to invoke three external programs, it creates three processes and new processes.

136
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:37.110
This clears server load ultimately serve, but he's a machine, so sort of addiction.

137
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:42.910
Boomers order for creating each new processes handle that process and everything, too.

138
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:48.190
We are assuming we are writing in the higher level language, but inside the machine it's again going

139
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.130
to using binary language, we can send machine level language.

140
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.300
So it is very difficult to handle programs, higher level programs.

141
00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:04.010
Now, the disadvantages of CGI here comes as you can see, these are the this is the image of CGI.

142
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.170
This is a request from a client.

143
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.780
This is our server issue DPD server.

144
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.790
This is CGI solution.

145
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.600
What is it?

146
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.040
Well, it consists the external programs, which CGI programs.

147
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.930
So this is one process.

148
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.750
It goes through this.

149
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.530
It runs this and it will fetch.

150
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.160
This is a advantage for the new process.

151
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.770
This again page for the new process, these are the endless loops and these are going to be the news

152
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.480
request and it's giving the response.

153
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.540
So as you can see for this sort of a longer term memory for this.

154
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.610
So what I mean, when you so process what is very high for this digital programming?

155
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.200
So if the number of claims increases, it takes more time to sending the response.

156
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.650
Ultimately, our the response and the question should be less.

157
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:57.140
Yeah, that's only as the ideal conditions for each request in startup process and web server is limited

158
00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.750
to start a process start process.

159
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.420
Just like we observe a great amount of times.

160
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.850
There is some restrictions on processes.

161
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:12.090
Also, you can bottle that much on what they consider a server, which can be on your toes or poses.

162
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:23.240
So if the clients come and ask for request, server can create more processes more than I'm considering

163
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.770
as an example, but it uses platform dependent language c C++.

164
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.250
Well, what is the difference between that?

165
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.990
Java is the platform independent.

166
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:40.580
You can use Java on any system as if you are using Linux Server, Mac Server, Windows Server, anything

167
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.120
you can use.

168
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:45.890
So I'm using the Windows machine is another tool.

169
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:53.630
What we can say with another person using Mac machine or Linux machine, it can easily use that Java,

170
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:57.090
but C C++ post-poll are platform dependent.

171
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.740
Ultimately.

172
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.400
So let us see what is Java, so it should Java.

173
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:10.510
So will it create web content in this very new technology we can say or retain technology we have.

174
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.520
It could be ex-dictator.

175
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:19.320
So this means basically these are the some will say, loading commands, or we can see process loading

176
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.200
handling commands.

177
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:27.770
So tips for handling multiple requests one three can handle 200 requests, so it can be a thousand requests,

178
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.290
arousal response, each trade.

179
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:36.220
So ultimately, we are increasing the number of processes so multiple requests can be come to the silver.

180
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:42.190
There are many benefits over the processes, such as they can share common immediate memory area.

181
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.830
They are later done processes each processes.

182
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:51.880
So traders can use common memorabilia like Trader one, three, two shares, common memory area in this

183
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.140
or what?

184
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.130
Eight until they like that.

185
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.730
So these trades, what can they do?

186
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:03.830
They can easily access same memory in any time or any amount of time.

187
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.240
There are some time stamps are given again.

188
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:13.510
The cost of communication between two trades like the one two also can communicate process one and process

189
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:13.660
two.

190
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.310
Communication is very difficult and there may be errors, things like that.

191
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.630
So for that error reduction, I'm going to be able to use some system methods or something like that.

192
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:28.240
But in trades, we can we can easily communicate that between two trades.

193
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:35.810
So Atlanta just off a little little of CGI, plus these moments always because it creates theater for

194
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:43.360
each request probability, because you did, our language increases probability language as you can.

195
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:51.140
There is a system default if CGI notes on your own machine, if there is error in some counterpart or

196
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:51.830
something like that.

197
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:59.290
If you are using common variable between two processes, c C++ will use the error of Java.

198
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:05.000
Language of unit is very low superposition, all again, low, robust JVM and just late.

199
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.710
So we don't need to worry about memory leakage, garbage collections, such parts.

200
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:10.850
So it is very robust.

201
00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:16.280
So JVM takes good of that solid part and everything, so it creates a lot of good machine for that.

202
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:23.780
There is no need to worry about all things garbage collection, so it never throws a lot of value on

203
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.530
a system or issue to be continued.

204
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.520
Or we can say we.

205
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.180
Again, need secure because you, too, you enjoy the language we can see, we can create public private,

206
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.930
we can use abstract, we can use the interface, anything inside relies on it.

207
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.970
So these are all about the Java servlet.

208
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.750
Now, you know, the I will tell you about the great post in the letter.

209
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:56.580
But remember, we are going to use two methods here to get an metal or as you can see in in that we

210
00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.890
created a source package.

211
00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.070
We're using them as we created as well.

212
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.260
We are going to use do postmortem.

213
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.700
You're going to use to get the methodology here, but we are posting something information.

214
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.600
So I'm going to use your new post.

215
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.000
I use their new ghostwriter.

216
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.870
So this is all about the Java servlet I told you.

217
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:23.970
So in the next for the session, I'm going to tell you about how we can consider this and using piece,

218
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.300
how we can put in the database.

219
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.040
All the participants name anybody.
