1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:13,570
So in previous two years old, we dated different soldiers and the member and his name climbed, which

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,130
is my soul, it was certainly.

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:25,670
These male clients client, instead of accessing to the well, not examine, which is basically controlling

4
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,960
fail.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,310
What I created, I did an audition for creating the mappings.

6
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,160
So this might be intimidating.

7
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:41,290
So if you don't know what is the mapping thing, it is just not executing and just adding this year.

8
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:41,800
So.

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,410
This will aggravate the back and in next location.

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,240
This is my next door to Espinal.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:57,480
It was not this or this, and it is the e-mail message I created in the password text, I'm going to

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,100
add my password later.

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,550
And in this, what we clearly already created is just.

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,080
However, what we can say.

15
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,230
You mean you build it and so on.

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:12,870
Now what?

17
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:21,360
And Lou, I'm going to add here my email and I'm going to add my passport of my e-mail in this letter.

18
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,880
So let me do one thing I did CC address the address and everything here.

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:39,590
So what is the remaining thing is I just started this email list to lend, but it's we need to create

20
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,310
one address to feel because I created CC, cc, everything.

21
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,680
So I need to create one for New Year.

22
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,590
So creating the for loop is very easy.

23
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,800
If you know this, what I am going to do is a very common thing.

24
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,100
I'm just going to travel through this list using I need ink.

25
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,440
I is equal to zero emission is with me.

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,120
Even I is less than you.

27
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,180
Me, it is.

28
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,160
You have that email is few ideas.

29
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,290
Dark blend.

30
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,780
Blend in.

31
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:27,350
What I need is I would accidentally and Warren to earlier this.

32
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,110
When this is done, addresses do feel the needed address to feel.

33
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,450
Rich Marlin, I commend.

34
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:47,340
Which water does I need to earn new, which is going to create one new object in you?

35
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,280
OK?

36
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,620
What's more, he's OK.

37
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:53,520
OK.

38
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,200
New and internet ideas, free internet address.

39
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,660
And we and you in.

40
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,920
You may.

41
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,200
Ideas which let.

42
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:20,840
So do you create middle on what you can see travels through that, and it will be assigned as a distributed

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,170
food again and again, so I don't require to travel one by one retailer to medically export things.

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,740
Similarly, I need to great address to fill.

45
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:43,350
So let me do one thing here who I had in I need to these this seeking and I created no similar thing

46
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:50,310
I need to perform, which is basically the listings or one thing you're going do.

47
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,080
Or I might even try edge because I need to handle the exceptions.

48
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:01,860
But if you want don't want to use tricks, you can use your tools here, so you can check out that part

49
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,120
also.

50
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:11,340
But I'm using projects you try to look for in an exception similar I'm going to perform for in I is

51
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,450
equal to zero.

52
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,780
I usually employed easement, basically.

53
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:28,840
Because it will travel through this again, and I need to check that email, it is now it's in the ladies.

54
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:41,020
Because is sissy field not a common field, then actress Sissy, I need to perform comedy in this scene.

55
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,520
And I feel it is a quality new internet.

56
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,130
Later this I need to engineer again, similar to my home internet address.

57
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,210
Oh, then this field again, which is basically.

58
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,710
Or email IDs, CC, so this isn't really.

59
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,460
You don't.

60
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,040
No, no, no, no.

61
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,030
Not because I need to travel to this song.

62
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,650
Let me mention.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,340
Who?

64
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,470
Guess this.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:45,730
CC argues this is going to chip in what is remaining tenure and going to air this week, so.

66
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,290
It will do one thing.

67
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:09,500
Let me directly copy, which already created a record because I don't want to focus more because it's

68
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:16,380
commenting thing again and again, I'm going to tell us after this what I needed is the most important

69
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:16,860
thing is.

70
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,230
If this field, which is addressed, land basically.

71
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,530
And disciplined.

72
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,770
Is greater than zero, which is basically perfect condition, I need to mention it.

73
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,930
Message dog sick distribution response.

74
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,670
So I'm going to ask the receiver in.

75
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,850
Dude, basically message my get free message.

76
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,030
No.

77
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,410
Babe, I need to find the tape.

78
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,400
Not.

79
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,780
CC, it will add Typekit CC.

80
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,110
Because I mean, there's another former Mexican.

81
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,180
So that's it, and you can enjoy.

82
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,500
Similar for me, he was.

83
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:21,810
OK.

84
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:31,360
Addressed to or written news for tourists, not musicians, or increase unemployment.

85
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,100
Now I have to create for me because I've created for CC first.

86
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,740
Now I need two engines for a DCC will lend greater than zero.

87
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,300
And who do you see your message toxic again?

88
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,040
Similar things I need to mention.

89
00:07:52,420 --> 00:08:00,470
Message messages and getting word that you may feel it or they don't seem to see.

90
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,660
And this is not addressed, this should be addressed.

91
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,090
Well.

92
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,260
Do you think?

93
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,060
And this suffering similarly for Mississippi.

94
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:27,100
So let me just move on to let me copy this part because I need to change some variables and not everything

95
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,340
you.

96
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,270
We.

97
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:33,940
She

98
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,060
is.

99
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,620
NBCC.

100
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:49,770
So.

101
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,250
Wait a minute, something is different.

102
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,200
And.

103
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,550
So whites asking me for.

104
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,170
Let me check it again.

105
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,580
It is the error of two, there should not be an error.

106
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,330
No, it's been because I haven't decided this.

107
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,340
So now we're done.

108
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:40,820
So I need to mention contentment with everything.

109
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,520
So these are my campaign team sets of delegates, object subject and content and.

110
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,350
Let me take that.

111
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,600
For using Switch case, whether it's based on a statement or plaintiffs, so if it's giving a message

112
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,100
as you know that it's cumulative, we can see what it will go with the it's different.

113
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,760
If not, it will take for that purpose.

114
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,420
So.

115
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:31,380
This is my last question, which is going to transport my main function and sing me, which is very,

116
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,950
very easy function.

117
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:42,510
Transport, Joe, I mean, not send a message message.

118
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,880
So it will directly handle my message, so that's it with me.

119
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,300
The 14 year old kid so.

120
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,400
Let me optimise my inputs.

121
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,390
So now you can check here.

122
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:08,600
We are done with this part and now what I'm going to do, I'm going to add my password and e-mail here.

123
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,770
So.

124
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:13,890
But in doing this.

125
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,250
So here I'm going to get my e-mail.

126
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,460
So let me do one thing with me and my password.

127
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,170
Then let me add my e-mails.

128
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,780
So these are my received e-mail.

129
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:42,870
I'm launching my IEEE team because of safety, because I don't want to expose my cell I.D. and everything

130
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:43,500
here.

131
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:57,250
And if you want to check out a Google free password field, I recommend you don't you just need password

132
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,050
or take this.

133
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:09,610
Just try to give fully-fledged location of your password, so there may be some things that are not

134
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,210
day.

135
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,140
Sometimes there may be error by locating such files.

136
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:26,560
So my suggestion is you fully place name who that the password field is popular, then you can go to

137
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,910
base that will.

138
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:40,540
So my feelings and everything is airing, and this is the thing that I'm going to resume my e-mail.

139
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,500
Another e-mail.

140
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,490
So.

141
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:56,720
Before proceeding with any project, let me tell you one thing here, you always remember all these

142
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,000
bombed out equipment and everything we already created like try to go along.

143
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,910
There are no one sitting in Gmail, which is basically very common, sitting alone or less secure apps.

144
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,270
So our App Security Security's very little allow it.

145
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:20,240
If you want to do this full fledged, you need to upload these files on Google Cloud, then you need

146
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,450
to find the SHA256 uniquely registered everything.

147
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,470
So that's configurable.

148
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,970
And instead of this, you can allow that temporary mail for that purpose.

149
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,710
Like allow the low, secure apps for your email.

150
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,630
So it is very helpful.

151
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,070
You don't want to.

152
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,290
I need to configuration you.

153
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,120
I'm going to need confirmation if you don't want to do lists.

154
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,950
It's not at all required on this, but let me check my configuration.

155
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,570
OK.

156
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,950
This is the configuration I clicked and it ran.

157
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:03,380
So it takes time to run some names because first thing, it's building my own data at first.

158
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,630
This is the first time it's going to open.

159
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:12,680
So this is the distancing part in the next tutorial and tell you how we can perform the receiver part.

160
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,270
So now you can check it's currently running and reading everything.

161
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,510
So it will take time to do this.

162
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,920
Once this is done, you can check it for the service.

163
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,480
Book was so great.

164
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,060
Currently, my service is not started because my project is building so.

165
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:40,490
Forcing cruise project to rebuild, basically, so it takes time because we have too many modules surveyed

166
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,090
for doing this, all the stops, so.

167
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,440
It will take time sometimes.

168
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:57,870
Don't try to interpret this process because, oh, these are not a very heavy application, but we are

169
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,250
there some normal things.

170
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,440
And so then after Dallas closed stores, there may be errors as bomb rotting smell.

171
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,660
I mean, now you can build a successful.

172
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,620
And you can choose the services not started it, but it will start.

173
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,080
So it started building output, but.

174
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:27,840
Willis completed the first thing, but now it's no need to run the service, also, it may it.

175
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,290
So wait for me in all three segments.

176
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,350
No, my you can check my phone, Curtis, no.

177
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:54,340
So that it will take time to deny everything and it will, you know, direct output of my team.

178
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,990
So wait for the New York.

179
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,440
It will take time to learn everything so currently trending.

180
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,420
And.

181
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,290
If it will take for three seconds, Mr.

182
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,450
Well, as you can see, it's not any.

183
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:40,220
So you said what is connected, but the fact is now deploying on my team.

184
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:49,520
So our artifact is vast and exploding, so it will take time to trace again stood on everything you

185
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:49,740
saw.

186
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,070
It's configuring everything.

187
00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:00,470
As Hourglass Server doesn't have such forward to do, so now you can check my email application is not

188
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,890
working.

189
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:09,750
I need to put this mail messages best and email bodies just miss.

190
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,180
Is based.

191
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,600
Mail from Java application.

192
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:33,180
So once they keep saying, oh, it should be better, posted an article by you all because the thing

193
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,550
is it's not allowed sometimes.

194
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:42,930
So in the four day thing, what I'm going to do, I'm going to review this and what is showing the error,

195
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,750
I will tell you, is not going to do so.

196
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,610
We will rectify this error in the letter.

197
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,900
Thank you for this.

198
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,430
And for the part, I'm going to explain everything and how I perform this.

199
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,200
I will hope you understand.

200
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:55,740
Thank you.
