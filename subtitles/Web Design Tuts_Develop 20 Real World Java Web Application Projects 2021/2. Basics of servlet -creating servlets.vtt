WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.690
So in previous part, I told you about so late, so now I'm going to create some extremist pages, then

2
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.340
some Java logic here.

3
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.200
So mainly it confused only a the pages.

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.690
And you can also create JSP here.

5
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.180
So what is just basically Java?

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.230
So Leadpages, which uses some Java language in today's statement?

7
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.710
So, you know, I'm using only original pages, but you can use JSPL Logic here on some.

8
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.140
GSP, which consist of human tags, GSP tags, some expressions also.

9
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.250
So GSP has more and more advantages on solid part, but for the understanding purposes, I'm going with

10
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.920
the GSP, so I'm continuing only to part O legal admin, which has role to add.

11
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.020
Liberian and Liberian is going to take all the student records and everything.

12
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.510
So you can also include some student also here.

13
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.060
But I do, considering student mentoring is very complicated.

14
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.610
You can go with two parts on AG, administer, do actions and leverage and to manage everything.

15
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.970
So this is all about how we can create GSP.

16
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.570
So GSP having advantages more then.

17
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.670
So it's like it's extension of solid.

18
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.100
It's easy to maintain as development.

19
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.590
No need to re compiling, compile and redeploy again energy in part.

20
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.910
So this is all about DSP JTBC is Java database connection.

21
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.510
So as we know, this is very crucial like we don't want to include in text file.

22
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.150
We just want a database here.

23
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.680
So database consist of different types of tables, database training, cetera.

24
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.930
So I'm using your only relational database, not be in a school or anything relational database, and

25
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.220
I'm going to use relational.

26
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.620
It's good queries only.

27
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.030
So GDC stands for the Java database connectivity, JTBC's and Java API to execute and query with the

28
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.510
database.

29
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.100
So each and every.

30
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.390
Well databases and all three already created.

31
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.790
The developers are dedicated GDC connectors for Java API as Oracle consists already busy with 14:10

32
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.540
for newer versions also available with that purpose.

33
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.120
Also, MySchool can include For My.

34
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.660
So these are two examples of relational database.

35
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.920
If you go further with MongoDB and different database, you will understand that there are really because

36
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.280
I was available on the internet.

37
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.390
So there are four types of database for Oracle database team driver.

38
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.120
Basically, we are going to use and all DVC MySchool is bridge over the native driver network protocol.

39
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.880
Drivers are used for different, different purposes.

40
00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.150
So we can use JDK Bay to exist tabular data stored in the relational database with the help of Julie

41
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.210
Bishop, yet so we can sue update, delete fish data from database so we can use that part also.

42
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.090
So let us see what is Julie?

43
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.380
So liberty is nothing more Java application.

44
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.100
Connector, which connects Julie Bishop and delivery driver and Julie Bishop, Travel connects the database,

45
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.810
so it will be very helpful to create a database connection.

46
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.600
So let us go to it.

47
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.500
Or as I told you, I already created this part, but no need to worry.

48
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.690
I will explain each and everything.

49
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.980
So I am using this steps used as far as you can see my mood subsidy, this is fine.

50
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.790
So nothing but I'm just riding boots that failure and you may not use this.

51
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.500
And this is all about digits, so it's nothing but consistent these of.

52
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.050
Let me close this part again.

53
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.470
OK.

54
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.720
So you can't just directly use and download it from the available I'm using.

55
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.770
Before things, you know, when I'm inserting some part onto your.

56
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.460
Forgettable, but I'm adding some images here.

57
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.660
With some things, as you can see for my high school connection and everything.

58
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.600
So close, so it is let me be on first place in this rotating and don't change this in regular testimony

59
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.410
because it's already written in configuration for utility.

60
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.320
As you can see, manifest and everything written in the stimulus basically the lowly part here.

61
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.540
So in this part, this welcome page, I'm reading the title deeds in my stylesheet, I'm creating navigation

62
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.570
bar, so you can change this also with different, different things.

63
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.620
But for this purpose, I'm putting, as in this notice, the first part and everything and this is home

64
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:10.140
for admin level, then I will change it again because I'm loading this only.

65
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.470
So I'm printing in the same part I can use this on.

66
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.770
Let me change traditionally in this only because I'm printing in the same, if you want to change in

67
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.040
another part, like if you want to create some another thing here, you can use that word also.

68
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.950
And let me mention Glass also.

69
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.540
You can create different pages for admin admin in Lebanon, but I'm creating one single page.

70
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.620
And collapsing this part is my e-library, let me.

71
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.880
Within this farm, then.

72
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.610
OK, so all of these things, so I am creating and winning again this year.

73
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:10.930
Don't worry, all things are related to tax with Glass Andrews admin logging into this post again.

74
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.510
And what I'm creating and creating.

75
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.850
From U.S. Army, long, remember, former action action should be with some.

76
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.080
Proper name, or we can say with some default or not.

77
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.410
Well, ABC or something, it should have some proper name because we are going to create some part also

78
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.680
there.

79
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:40.270
So my suggestion is you can create this item in logging inside another part.

80
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.620
Let me.

81
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.360
OK, so I'm going to use this logic.

82
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.420
So, ladies, I'm going to tell in writing this so late, but I'm going to create some packages and

83
00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:00.960
some packages for us, like you can see that there are some.

84
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.370
We are going to create some more solid so or java logic.

85
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.250
So it will be very hectic each and every part.

86
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.320
So for that purpose, I'm going to use this solely with email then.

87
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.300
He basically leveled an input and then another with the password.

88
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:26.580
Similarly, for this purpose, I'm going to put here so late dot librarian or log in because I'm going

89
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.230
to create insert that only.

90
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.560
And this is I'm submit part, so it's all about how we can create in the broadest human.

91
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.060
So this basic thing.

92
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:45.660
I'm going to create so after this, I'm going to write a logic for, so let me alone.

93
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.250
So let me along and let me create one solid year.

94
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.190
I'm not going to go with default package.

95
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.090
I'm going to create another package your Java package.

96
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.830
Name is so late.

97
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.950
And so these men knew before I cash in, said this, I'm going to create a.

98
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:18.380
Not just be after you right click the new items box is open, so I'm going to create an index, so let

99
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.040
me dialog box will be open.

100
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.140
Then click next on the dialog box after giving the name.

101
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.670
Add information to the deployment and descriptor.

102
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.200
Click it and click Finish.

103
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:36.100
So once this is done, you can see so then you start to log in, but you can change this and delete

104
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.980
this part also.

105
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.040
Let me add your admin.

106
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:41.760
No.

107
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.250
So let us ride this hour step by step.

108
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:59.220
So let me add some or import some libraries, which is basically import Java, I don't I will not start

109
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:09.910
I'm using here, then I'm going to use your solid Java accessibility basically for import, as I told

110
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:10.780
you, you need to.

111
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.480
Joy, so let.

112
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.450
Not starting.

113
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:27.450
So in so doing this stuff, I'm just importing, I need to be part of the year, so I will.

114
00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.410
Intuition, it should be not stored.

115
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.330
So, so I will put your as.

116
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.770
Importing.

117
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.750
Memories.

118
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.280
That's it.

119
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.110
So now we are done with this.

120
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.340
Let me write this part again, because we are going to override this on you.

121
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.550
So it will take time to shake everything.

122
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.340
So as you can see this.

123
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.340
Oh, you can close this spot.

124
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.100
Oh, my, it is not OK.

125
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.130
OK, it will remove that a little.

126
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.280
Well.

127
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:24.720
Not.

128
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:31.030
Well, it will win if you're doing this.

129
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.160
NEWSROOM this and let's not lose this part of.

130
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:40.580
So.

131
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:42.650
The public.

132
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:51.490
We are going to create class basically, so basically every public class is basically public class.

133
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.020
I had been logging.

134
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:01.490
We are going to create.

135
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.980
And women logging.

136
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.160
We take Syrian GDP, so.

137
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.320
Listen, copy this part because.

138
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:27.250
And again, an due to be late, not only so be so that you're going to mention it, should you be so.

139
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.580
Long are mentioning this.

140
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.450
Let me add one prospective warrior boost to mental.

141
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.030
So, OK.

142
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.250
Let me get this condition.

143
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.250
AP in.

144
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.110
Sometimes you use error because of.

145
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.130
Some part.

146
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.200
Let me add it again.

147
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.200
So we're not.

148
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.440
You can remove this part again because it's no longer required.

149
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.470
OK, so let me.

150
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.590
Now we are done with this.

151
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.950
So let us write the logic here, basically.

152
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:04.010
So in next part, I'm going to tell you how we can do a logical we before creating a logic.

153
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:09.500
Let me read some part here and I will tell you what is despite.

154
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.280
So this is nothing but the absolute part here.

155
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.880
Basically, we are just overriding this part, so we need to mention the.

156
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.050
Solar.

157
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.990
If you don't don't do anything, you're going to log lunch and also no need to watch and do so again

158
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.410
and again.

159
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:51.290
So we created response in this, and we need a great writer to print something on similar page which

160
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.870
is in fiction, and it wouldn't.

161
00:13:53.980 --> 00:14:00.940
And I'm going to create a simple page inside of this one, which is basically admin section where you

162
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.890
can say admin pendant you're on.

163
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.200
So.

164
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.220
I'm making a request from string.

165
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.650
Which is basically connected to the.

166
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.170
That part featuring request.

167
00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.710
I'm fitting the request.

168
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:30.920
So if you want to give on other things on, you can do what I'm going to do.

169
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:40.010
I mean, we asked for stitching that part from a steel mill and design creating logic of logging.

170
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:45.260
So if you don't want to put some default here, you can add it to the database.

171
00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:53.900
But for the security convenience I'm going to take from directing, so I will what I will do if you're.

172
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.980
I will string.

173
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.440
Even if it were to.

174
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:02.790
And mean.

175
00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:07.480
Not.

176
00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.930
Men and red.

177
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.040
And geographically, nothing during lockdown.

178
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.900
No need to check each and everything I can change his part of this from.

179
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.720
What I'm going to put it is spring even in doing so.

180
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.770
And one, two, three.

181
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.170
So this will be the password and username for logging and.

182
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.800
I will put your credentials on a.

183
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.650
So this will be the credential for retirement.

184
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:51.900
For now, you will understand I'm going to create even sparked your own need to take each and everything

185
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.520
as simple java.

186
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.350
So let me use that if it's part and you will understand this.

187
00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.150
So this is very easy.

188
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.980
Use full time, you can use your.

189
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.530
And for their part, I'm going to create some library and methods and issue book log in library.

190
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.460
And each part.

191
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.860
So for further development, I'm going to use Java seven.
