00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.630
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:12.240
So in the previous video, we have created a student constructor and passed the argument for new mandates.

3
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:13.420
Yes.

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.290
So.

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.430
We have passed that three variables, and these are trees.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.720
These are for free spirit entered the face of the school soirées.

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.130
If a student is admitted in the school, the fees paid by him or her is zero in the Magne and the total

8
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.700
fees is supposed to collect 10000 soirées.

9
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.300
So this is not compulsory to add this keyboard to free spirit and see students as they are not fast

10
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.570
as an argument in this constructor.

11
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:57.810
So, but for the uniformity in the code, I am attaching this, you know, free spirit and face to delivering

12
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.170
those.

13
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:07.410
So now we have to set the grade and you must be wondering next what Jesus said.

14
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.840
So we have certain guesstimating Java for updating our variable.

15
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.520
Suppose if a variable is changing continuously, then firstly, we have to certify to our value and

16
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.540
then the compiler will receive it after the execution.

17
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.660
With the help of getting one.

18
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.470
So yes, sir, I didn't get that in Java already.

19
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.140
Thought you?

20
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:44.930
For updating variables, so you must be wondering why we haven't gone sick and get for sex one ID and

21
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:53.910
name so, you know, name and idea of a person, our student, whenever he is admitted to a school,

22
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.860
never changes.

23
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:04.920
It remains constant for the rest of his life, like if a student is admitted to the school, what name

24
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.700
is registered in the school directory, it will remain the same.

25
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.530
So we do not have to worry about setting them name and the ID.

26
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.050
But what about the grade?

27
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.020
And upgraded the main theme for the rest of the life.

28
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.930
Think about it.

29
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.540
So that there's never any means seen it changes after every half yearly exam on the final exam.

30
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:41.090
Suppose if a student score a like 90 out of hundred in an exam, it doesn't remain same.

31
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.360
It is already very interesting that the dates in racing these changes.

32
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.420
And so we need to send the green offset every for every student.

33
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.910
Every student has different views.

34
00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:03.310
So for setting that rate for every student, you have to use this not for every student and.

35
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.400
For I.D., we have called this function public and get it.

36
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:17.070
It does not need to be said if just need to be guess, and this function returns the idea first.

37
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.780
Let me comment this out for your convenience returns.

38
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.060
The irony of the stolen.

39
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.570
And this part

40
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:48.820
sent the updates, the segment that is used for updates, so I'm using up the grade of my student years.

41
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.220
Similarly for the name.

42
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.840
We created this function.

43
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:06.730
Public string get name, and this returns the name of a specific student and returns the name of the

44
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.180
student.

45
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.410
So yes, we have.

46
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:24.830
Get full name and I.D. now we have to get the grade of the student public in good grade.

47
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.740
We are using Camel Case for a better understanding of the gold.

48
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.470
So you get a great.

49
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.020
This returns the lead,

50
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.080
so here we are.

51
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:57.450
We have sent anger for all the variables declared in the above student class.

52
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.460
Now we will jump to the teacher class and make a featured or Java file.

53
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.730
In our Sazi folder as well.

54
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.460
So naming this class as teacher or Java.

55
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.070
We have a class named teacher.

56
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.070
Now what a teacher can attain as a variable.

57
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.280
Think about it and then right at with your own experience.

58
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:46.530
Soirées a teacher can have an I.D. on me and a salary, so initializing the variables as private access

59
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.340
specify.

60
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:57.090
We have already discussed dicked about in the student section private string funding names are string.

61
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.560
We know that, but I read their salary.

62
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:13.520
So yes, if a teacher is here for teaching in this school, he or she must be expecting a salary.

63
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:24.180
But now, in a similar manner, in the student class, we will create a constructor named Teacher for

64
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.280
the Teacher Class as well.

65
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.980
Our constructor is the object.

66
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.850
We know it's the same name as the class and contains arguments.

67
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:48.580
Basically, it is a copy of the class we have made, and if we can pass out government of I.D. name

68
00:06:48.850 --> 00:07:01.720
and Stanley Soirées calling all of the things which we declared in the above class I.D. name

69
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.680
and salary, of course.

70
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.040
And salary is equal to salary.

71
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.000
Obviously, this is wrong.

72
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.410
Oh yes.

73
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.350
Huh.

74
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.620
So here we are.

75
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.940
We have created this new Teacher of the Year.

76
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.260
Let me comment this out for your convenience.

77
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:44.470
Cleared this path, cleared, sir, new teacher object, new teacher object.

78
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.370
Yes.

79
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:54.230
So here we have an I.D. for every feature name, for every teacher and a salary for every teacher,

80
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.860
whenever we call it, for a specific teacher.

81
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.270
It will consist of our ID, name and salary.

82
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:09.660
So in the student section, we have our fees and the fees total fine.

83
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:18.360
So the fees total part was suppose like one thousand and the fees paid was zero in the magni.

84
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:29.280
So similarly for teacher, in the beginning, the salary arm should be declared so private in salary.

85
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:29.820
Own

86
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.430
is declared in the class.

87
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:41.040
And in the constructor, this large salary earned.

88
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.210
Is Zito in the bag?

89
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:46.940
Yes.

90
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:47.810
So.

91
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:58.830
After this, after a successful creation of object and Class B ring, use the get and send method as

92
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.990
we previously used in the student on Java Phi.

93
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.740
So let me give you a quick reminder about sex and give.

94
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:16.470
So we have used as primate as our access pacifier for this feature class.

95
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:26.040
So for accessing this variable in the class, as we know that private private initialize ramble could

96
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.390
not be accessed by any other class in this function.

97
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:41.610
So for and even for using it for the same function, we use set and get methods so set and provide access

98
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.790
and update of the value for a private variable.

99
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:55.260
If we need to access like all this debt and if we want to update the value of a private access specified

100
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.950
variable, we use segment Soyuz.

101
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.000
Similarly, as for this 2.0 file, Newman said.

102
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.530
The.

103
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:13.420
Salary, yes, salary, so you must be wondering for the student.

104
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:22.060
We haven't said no I.D. And then so similarly for the teachers, we will not say that idea.

105
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:31.840
And then as when a teacher joins the school, the idea is provided and which is safe to that dataset

106
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.300
and we missing for the rest of the life and then name as well.

107
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:44.900
But the salary may increase in future if the school is impressed by a teacher's performance.

108
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:54.720
So yes, we will all get and set for salary and later on they will initialize our function for it,

109
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.530
any which way they've done it, any for that teacher.

110
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:10.990
So this public function contains the integer I do, and this function returns the idea of the teacher.

111
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.890
So let me comment this out for your convenience.

112
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:24.010
We've done the I.D. of our teacher.

113
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.280
So yes.

114
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.530
The ID is it.

115
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:39.400
Similarly, we have to return the new so copying the above code and.

116
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:52.350
The name is a string, of course, so everything it does name get names, a string and this is going

117
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.240
to have the name of their teachers.

118
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:55.700
Yes.

119
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.220
Is it does the.

120
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.140
The name of the feature.

121
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:10.560
Yes.

122
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.510
No, for the salary.

123
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:21.660
First, we have to set the salary and then updated in case if it is needed.

124
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:27.900
So yes, this is for the salary.

125
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:42.900
This the salary dipoles determines the salary of our teacher.

126
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:45.270
Yes.

127
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.460
So salaries are in danger.

128
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.240
Yes.

129
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.820
Has this particular design now for setting the salary?

130
00:12:55.590 --> 00:13:00.900
We have used public void search, salary in salary, Soyuz.

131
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:09.750
This is the snippet for setting something in German public words said salary and insight.

132
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:15.000
We have to declare the parameters what is needed to be said.

133
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.910
So this part what it does?

134
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.390
Let me comment this out of me.

135
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:34.380
The salary of RTG starting salary can be updating if whenever changes are mentioned, it is being asked

136
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:34.770
for.

137
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:43.340
Public void, search, salary in salary, this large salary is salary, so yes, we have successfully

138
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.690
settled and get all the variables which were declared here.

139
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.370
So the first part of this teacher class is completed.

140
00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.710
Congratulations.
