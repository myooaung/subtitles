WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:10.490
Our project is Java Breakout Ball Game, which is most commonly known as Bring Game on Super Bowl Big

2
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.670
Game, this is very old style retro game, not very high over Janelle's game.

3
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.370
But our main motto behind this project is to learn how we can create Java Swing, Java, AWP, US,

4
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:34.230
plus how we can incorporate some object oriented because game is mostly based on object oriented arts

5
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.940
or programming.

6
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.590
So our main more aim is to create some object oriented classes, object oriented programs here.

7
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.840
So this is our project.

8
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.060
So let us see what is our basic project aim to.

9
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.470
Creator Java program, which is very useful to create a ball game, which is basically American Ballgame,

10
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.820
I'm giving the name you can see is the big game also, but it can be game on.

11
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.560
So then steps of development is how we can set the ball project, then understanding different tools.

12
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.090
What is EWTN?

13
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.640
What are the team's parameters?

14
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.750
I'm going to use Java basic concepts.

15
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.530
I'm going to tell you.

16
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.880
Ninja OPB object oriented programming concepts, Java Swing and how we are going to deploy it as a final.

17
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.560
So if you know how we can create useful window any platform systems within the Java Lake in about about

18
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.720
$118 to provide a more of you, if you know that it's very basic to you and not very high over general

19
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.380
you guys.

20
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.830
But there are two categories in Java.

21
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.940
I mean, one is Java and fixed in the last week or Java.

22
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.610
Ethics is mostly built on scene builder, and it contains libraries and different things.

23
00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:03.730
But Java Swing comes with Jodi getting that JDK 16 after even with Jane of JDK Java Swing Swing.

24
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.880
The completely incorporate within the JDK.

25
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:15.310
So no need to deploy Arnone to fill page on other resources from or external libraries, so it's very

26
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.880
useful.

27
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.100
Second thing, which is final development six part final deployment, so I'm going to look like.

28
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.890
So that's the basic thing I'm going to deploy on my machine only.

29
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.130
But if you know this, you can use Java and you've been creating that things.

30
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.850
Also, you can create files of Java files also later to find out those things.

31
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.700
And basically, I'm going to create a game.

32
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.640
I'm not going to create the lake front page how the game is like.

33
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.310
Look, so you can change the UI later also for that purpose.

34
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:58.300
So let us understand basic our application requirements in Java libraries I'm going to use in then JDK

35
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.610
Java, seeing how I'm going to design JDK and I'm going to use your Intel JDA as my main.

36
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.020
It because I'm using it, it's good brain surgery, and it's very useful.

37
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.070
You can use any and that you can use it clips also, and it means also that fine.

38
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.560
Let's see.

39
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.450
These are not application requirements.

40
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.100
It's some game requirements.

41
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.120
So in our game, oh, there are three components.

42
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.900
One is paddle.

43
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.640
So while I'm in components, remember these as accidental object variable, or you can see that side

44
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.440
of the object in our program when this battle paddle is basically the thing which is moving around,

45
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.670
whether that window one ball, which is going to hit to the bricks and bricks, which are going to break

46
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.390
and we are getting the points, then we use we are going to create a game cycle, which is the timer,

47
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.930
basically.

48
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.390
Remember, we never work with angles in these things.

49
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.720
We are simply change their tactics and we call mortally afraid.

50
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.280
Remember that or if you know the structure of gaming technology, you never work with NGOs, mostly

51
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.820
why we are not working with NGOs, because NGOs are defined like if I am specifying 45 degrees, it

52
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.820
will again call it 45 degrees, so there may be some bugs.

53
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.020
So what we can do, we can work with top bottom left, Rachel.

54
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.780
We can mention the direction of that one later.

55
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.370
So I will tell you while deploying or developing how we are going to develop these things.

56
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.780
So let us see how I'm going to create these things.

57
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.620
So if you know the team, how this is going to work, basically.

58
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.680
So this is the welcome page of engaging idea, which is my idea, which is I'm going to create oh,

59
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.270
then hit enter a new project here.

60
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.730
So wait for something it will deploy you a new project.

61
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:24.820
For you, and once this is done, you can take years, go to the job only no need to change anything,

62
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.310
go to job only for me, it's doing the different things you can do for speeding and anything but go

63
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.810
to Java.

64
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.760
No need to select any library.

65
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.490
Just select your project SDK, which is for me, 16s.

66
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.940
If you haven't downloaded any SDK or JDK, basically you can download and Judy Gear work with that.

67
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.920
Then who's next?

68
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.120
Then next, then let me give you a name.

69
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.170
So for me, I'm going to recount Ballgame.

70
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.590
So wait for some time to these responding so.

71
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.840
Rick Newman, can we go to break out?

72
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:45.850
On game like this and no need to speak to anything if we want to change modular and continued, you

73
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.580
can change after that finish.

74
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.840
So it will take time to create a basic template for you.

75
00:06:53.320 --> 00:07:00.910
So wait for something you need to create big partitions and it will go with that part because it's the

76
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.620
higher version of it, so it will create all the default teams, which is required.

77
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.170
So wait for something.

78
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.560
So once this is done, you can check here.

79
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.960
It's currently deploying, so you can check it's currently running.

80
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.160
For me.

81
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.280
So now we are within IDP.

82
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:44.660
OK.

83
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:51.370
So in this ad, I will tell you how we are going to perform and how we are going to feature everything.

84
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:53.660
So.

85
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:16.920
So once this is done, go to this S.A.C. file or SLC folder, there is nothing is created basically

86
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.070
currently sort of sleazy, basically for the source.

87
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.870
So in the sole files.

88
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:28.410
We are going to deploy and we are going to create each classes each because illicitly.

89
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.210
So wait for some time, it's giving me the loading because it's scanning for me.

90
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:35.850
That's right.

91
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.260
Loading.

92
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.270
Once this is done, you can go with two approaches.

93
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.960
One is you can create.

94
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.860
What are you going to do?

95
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.830
You can create some, some package here.

96
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.630
Some fold, some folders.

97
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.250
You can see subdirectory.

98
00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:02.800
Also, you can see and you can create glasses within the letter to that.

99
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:09.610
So currently, we require only three main methods like we can deploy over three minutes.

100
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.250
We didn't get that in many methods.

101
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.670
We are going to create different, different classes.

102
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:20.410
But by deploying this, you can remember you can always create three different packages.

103
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:27.250
So I'm not going with some packages concepts I'm giving or direct what you can see Glossier.

104
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.890
So we had for some time and we knew because my system is very high.

105
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.980
So according to your system, it will take time.

106
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.150
So once this is done, you can check this is now done for me.

107
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.840
So this is scanning and everything is done.

108
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.960
No one thing you have to do is just click right click on, I see.

109
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.850
Then click new.

110
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.050
Or go to new.

111
00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.270
It will load for something.

112
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:40.690
And he hit Java Class, No first Java class we are going to work with.

113
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.450
It is basically gameplay.

114
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.220
Basically, we are going to create your gameplay.

115
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:49.480
So this is basic class we are going to create first.

116
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.840
Remember why I'm creating this class gameplay?

117
00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:02.410
The gameplay is going to work like mean architecture behind any program gameplay which is going to perform

118
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.580
all the game functions.

119
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.870
The braking part of Bleek and everything is going to work here only.

120
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.360
So now it's going to create a gameplay function for me.

121
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.840
So realistically, whether it's clear to look, no, it's created gameplay from here, let me zoom.

122
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.720
So now you can.

123
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.370
What are you going to do?

124
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.990
You can close this part on some.

125
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.590
And let us check the gameplay functions, what I'm going to work with.

126
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:13.050
So first gameplay is basically it's going to extend to Japan and Japan, at least basically for Javadi

127
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.200
Japan and.

128
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.900
Implements.

129
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:26.890
No, which is a Basic Law class of Japan, and so as you can see, it's giving me the error.

130
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.970
So thing you need to import.

131
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:38.530
Some fights later, so we will import that files later because it's defaulting.

132
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.220
Elise Listener.

133
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.760
It is not a Java A.W. 18.

134
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:56.470
Oh, and what I'm going to need is basically external action listener.

135
00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.220
So, action listener.

136
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.080
Which is I go to JWT.

137
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:09.310
And create one star and literary import, Java.

138
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:11.850
It's not swing.

139
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.530
Not.

140
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.330
Start.

141
00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.600
So currently, this thing is not running for me.

142
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.550
Now inside this, we need to create different, different methods, so I will tell you what methods,

143
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.110
what methods we are going to work.

144
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.580
But let us.

145
00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:39.900
I assume that we created a panel and everything, but to what is this Japan and means Japan list for

146
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.610
the creation of any window team in this so.

147
00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:53.090
If you know, know the basic thing in this, it's very easy.

148
00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:02.960
So let me close this and you this and we will create another thing here, Egypt, and the news is not

149
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.070
completely done here.

150
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:12.970
So I am going to delete two things Java N.W.T. on these things and later we will need.

151
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:20.110
These also include Java Not Util, which is basically for utilization of data utilities.

152
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.040
So for this included, let me create one private boolean.

153
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.020
Private Boolean play, which is always false at the start.

154
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.150
Falls at the start.

155
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:42.990
So let me mention as a false within the start, then one private India scored a score that is always

156
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.010
zero at the start.

157
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.870
So let me mention score at zero.

158
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.330
And let me tell you why I created these two functions and invites private.

159
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:58.100
So let us assume you're playing game, but at the start of your school, it is that singular honor.

160
00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:05.100
Or else user can change the code if it's public user changing their code and they can cheat in the game

161
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.490
also.

162
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:12.360
So for that purpose and creating this, then I'm considering here my bricks sort of static kill as.

163
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.430
Don't tell.

164
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:23.800
Did we mention mentioned forty eight only I'm considering your my brick, so forty eight, then private

165
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:25.990
time would.

166
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.750
But I wish time would I can create this job by using private time, would.

167
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:41.530
Which is basically willing to function with time, and once I'm quoting, there's no need to use that

168
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:41.970
also.

169
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:46.450
OK.

170
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.720
Oh, I don't know why, but.

171
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.560
OK.

172
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.380
Let me import these, OK.

173
00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:58.730
OK.

174
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.170
And now.

175
00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:09.420
There is maybe some delay also, so let me mention a delay of some eight seconds here

176
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.910
to provide a delay then.

177
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:19.410
But I weighed in earlier Exposicion, I'm going to mention.

178
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.830
Blair Exposicion is this three from three 10?

179
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:33.510
So if you know these things so like X and y axis, you should remember that treating or otherwise you

180
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.740
can copy this then.

181
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:45.220
Private and moral position and me to mention foul ball, Ford's X-axis pollution is one community always,

182
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:52.540
always means white and the starting point then private and born both.

183
00:16:53.550 --> 00:17:00.480
Y is equal to again 350m and that so coordinate things or pixel things you can remember.

184
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.480
And I need to mention expedite action.

185
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:16.880
Ball Détection, let me mention, XDR is minus one, addiction is minus one always and private single

186
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.900
malt or.

187
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.950
So who won right direction?

188
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:29.500
And it's minus two always so it will go upward, not downward, but.

189
00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:38.160
And I will create one map generator, so I will later create that massive generator class and everything

190
00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:38.970
but.

191
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.150
You're not return.

192
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.010
She's basically prior to the create chain of Mac.

193
00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:52.660
So I will create my generator class later, but remember, I'm going to create this.

194
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:59.130
Now let us create one public gameplay here, which is basically constructed.

195
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.090
I'm going to use your.

196
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.810
And so this constructor.

197
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.410
So let me mention to pass the value.

198
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:08.370
Construction.

199
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.980
But the boss values.

200
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.360
So I'm using here constructor to parcel values.

201
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:28.070
So basically, if you know, Constructor is basically used for this and as it's public, I'm going to

202
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:28.730
create this.

203
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.450
OK.

204
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:39.710
So if you know I'm using my generator again, I haven't created any generator class, but I am using

205
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:41.340
this as this.

206
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.710
So for better looks, my map by default and I will create that part.

207
00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.860
So that's it for this in the further part.

208
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.760
We will check how we are going to develop and deploy this, all these things.

209
00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:56.960
Hope you're understand.

210
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:03.950
In the little part, we will check who we are going to create a generator and main classes, game related

211
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:04.870
basic commands.

212
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.350
So I started to this.

213
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:12.670
If you want to check out who I'm going to create my generator, you should look out first for my generator

214
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.040
partner.
