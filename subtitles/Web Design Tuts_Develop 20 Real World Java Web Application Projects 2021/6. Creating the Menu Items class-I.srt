1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,080
OK, so in the previous five, three have created objects for size and mountainside, which is going

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:16,750
to be displayed here that there are five medium glasses of water with the added so as a whole, this

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,840
text is displayed in the form of a string.

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:27,510
But this five isn't the judge, and the prize may have said which will be displayed later.

5
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,650
Like this, which you should pay?

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,940
Twelve point five.

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,890
So this is double, but still this is also displayed as a string.

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:47,080
So we have to simply override this all the database and set the override and set all the data types

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,710
no strings.

10
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,360
So this is done with the help of public string.

11
00:00:53,020 --> 00:01:00,760
The string method is a feature of Java, which we use to convert all their text dislike, whether it's

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,360
been by a float or string anything.

13
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:11,050
Just simply all of the data types are converted to string and displayed as a whole.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:22,960
Basically, this does all the items as string format, so string format and inside this, the format

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,930
is going to be called an argument.

16
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:35,390
So what is the format we should use modulus to set the the database, let's suppose, for ten days for

17
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,570
an integer or as soon as is for double and glass.

18
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:50,620
So glass as I suppose, there are more than one glasses, so we are adding glasses to make things.

19
00:01:51,740 --> 00:02:02,000
OK, so class is the answer for the characters, the and these foreign teachers.

20
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,330
Glasses off.

21
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,330
And this format is completed now in the human section.

22
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:21,070
We will be using the objects with the help of this keyboard as a private global variable accessed with

23
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,270
the help of this only.

24
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:30,260
So arguments are going to be they start getting around and separating them.

25
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,750
Also, this not a second thing, is size.

26
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,220
So get sites as strange for me.

27
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:48,370
So now that we have converted all the string in the for all the text in the form of string above it,

28
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,390
be double or integer, we have converted everything.

29
00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:03,500
This is for the like amount which is in the integer format and the size which is in the form of string.

30
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,730
So percentages for this get amount and.

31
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:17,260
On this good science is covered in the format, but with the help of and test access, specify.

32
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,230
OK, so we have completed this beverage dark, the Java class.

33
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:33,190
Now our next concern is going to be to cater for more classes associated with all the menu items.

34
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:43,630
So the first item I am going to add inside this folder is going to be Coffee Dark Java, which will

35
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:53,770
be containing all the add ons and like the the text pairing and the dialog box associated with like

36
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:59,080
suppose if we click coffee in that button and then press add button.

37
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:08,520
So before adding that coffee to the darken, the dialog box was opening so that all the dialog box that

38
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,430
I don't think will be covered inside this coffee glass only.

39
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:23,440
OK, so suppose inside this coffee glass, we are learning more like an object and quality as me, so

40
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,990
that add on to the coffee was milk.

41
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:34,040
We have discussed it in the introduction, but only now inside the coffee glass.

42
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:40,930
We will be creating a constructor containing coffee object.

43
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:52,780
So yes, and the arguments inside this construct that is going to be the size, like how many glasses

44
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,820
of coffee we want to order?

45
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,220
What is the amount?

46
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:08,380
Like how much prize is attached, so integer amount and also only Bill.

47
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,390
The label.

48
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,580
Is responsible for.

49
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:24,530
The label, which was added with every menu item, so we have imported all that, as you mentioned,

50
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,790
said this constructor.

51
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:33,980
So this glass is an extension to the beverage glass, so extend beverage.

52
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,960
Now inside this.

53
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:50,260
OK, so we have to override first, then only the error will be gone, so overnight and public.

54
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,170
Public string, those string.

55
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,230
So this string is going to.

56
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,430
Convert all the other data types to a string format.

57
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,280
Oh, yes.

58
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:21,400
Now, after this, we will be adding now in the next bag inside the coffee constructor, we are using

59
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:33,670
this super keyboard for this size and amount of the like coffee to be order and setting up if conditions

60
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:45,010
inside this if statement, it is going to ask us for whether we want to add milk to our coffee or not.

61
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,060
So sure, confirmed dialog box will le.

62
00:06:50,080 --> 00:07:01,390
And inside this unlabelled will be seen and the messages it is going to make ask for is what you.

63
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,570
Like milk, like Thor and milk.

64
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,030
OK, so yes, this is going to be asked.

65
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:28,340
And after this also the male option, brain will appear asking for a yes or no to this day option been.

66
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,510
Dr.

67
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,210
Yes, no option.

68
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:37,130
It is going to last or so, yes, yes, no option is covered.

69
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,740
And after this, there should be an early statement also.

70
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:49,580
So if the user selects yes, then mate should be said to draw.

71
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:56,130
We have declared this as a global variable, hence our Boolean milk was declared above.

72
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,730
And if this happens, then we can make it certain true.

73
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,660
Otherwise, inside that is Melchizedek so false.

74
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,040
After this, we are going to discuss the prize.

75
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:17,210
Think that what is going to win a prize of them is so like the coffee with milk and coffee without the

76
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,510
minute.

77
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:27,350
So suppose if the user asked us small or medium or a large coffee, so the prizes should be different

78
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,340
in each case.

79
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,190
So setting the prizes in that manner?

80
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,020
So suppose the user selects for size equal small.

81
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:41,750
So if their size is small, the prize should be three point five units.

82
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:47,480
As if the sign this medium, then the prize is going to be five.

83
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,030
You can set it to five point zero.

84
00:08:50,180 --> 00:09:00,320
So as we have double detected for the prize, also if there is no medium and small, so of course it

85
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,460
is going to be lost.

86
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:09,980
So we have said as prize to six point five, you can also Typekit as is if size equals launch price,

87
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,980
but that is not going to go.

88
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:16,370
Simply, if it is not medium and smart, it is definitely large.

89
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:24,020
So these three are the prizes set for each of the sizes, and there is a unique prize for each size.

90
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,660
Now, if user wants to add minutes, so is milk.

91
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,650
So this is going to contain arguments as true and false.

92
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:41,070
So suppose this Boolean milk is true, then prize is going to be multiplied with one point five.

93
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:49,310
So suppose if we have ordered medium sized coffee and milk to it, then five is going to be multiplied

94
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,570
with one point five.

95
00:09:50,890 --> 00:10:00,290
So five and a one point five is going to be like, OK, so seven point five calculations are made and

96
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,360
according to that only and the prize is six.

97
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:12,140
So I suppose you have ordered a medium coffee with a single glass of medium coffee.

98
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,610
OK, so that's private sector's seven point five units.

99
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,220
Now we are done with this inside this override option.

100
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:30,230
We are using if milk is true, then we have to display the label they both enable.

101
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:37,910
According to that, this report labels suppose five million glasses of coffee with milk added is going

102
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:45,950
to be displayed in this report label and that is done with the help of this or what I would drink function.

103
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,530
And this is returning super toasting the super.

104
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:56,390
We have all the tests and this it is possible for that to me.

105
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:07,320
So this is converting the amount and the size of the coffee five door string format and then displaying

106
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:07,970
that.

107
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:16,820
So if Americans are going to display that specific text with less coffee with milk, and if that is

108
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:24,620
more, then it is simply going to be done at five medium glasses of coffee or whatever we selected in

109
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,390
that manner only.

110
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:34,490
So these things are done for the coffee glass and we have completed love coffee glass functionality.

111
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:43,100
Now our next concern is going to be that the more that and the juice less so we will be creating three

112
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,030
more classes in order to complete this application.

113
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:55,370
Are the Dark Java Water, Dark Java and you start Java and then will add similar dialogue.

114
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,500
Most functionalities are dedicated to that.

115
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,860
Also, add ons will be attached in that manner only, so we will see that in next part.

116
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:13,250
They'll then tried this on your own and write the code and find it in your ideas.
