1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:09,720
In previous videos on today, as I told you, I have created one studio method for connection to the

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,680
database in search to run this one.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,150
Then all records get all records.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,830
Using array is another method.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,720
Then I'm using the little automated also get pseudonym method also.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,500
So these are some common things I used.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,930
We did and record also.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,050
So this is to run be you.

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,030
Similarly, we created a deal, which is the release, actually, because I'm just preaching from the

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:44,450
database and putting because everything has a poor role to use all the to be you and ultimatums.

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,440
Similarly, we have to create matters for Christians and insurgents.

12
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,770
So why do we need to create these methods?

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,760
So if you pre-defined some versions, these are not very useful because you need to again and again

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,290
use a database queries.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,060
No database part.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,060
So if you want to use interface, you need to create one also.

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,710
So I created commission, be my turn.

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,980
Then this instruction in question, whether I'm using you so this what it will, we do, it will face

19
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:24,210
data or I'm not providing you're fetching data because I need to create another file also.

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,940
So in further part, I will told how you can create images before here and we are going to create JS

21
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:36,180
to file in webpages, but also so this will execute this and update that we took action.

22
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,360
So I will show you which queries you want to do because we need to just create tables here.

23
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,370
No need to create all things or interpret that.

24
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:53,520
We need to create our own or we want we need to execute only viable sixth in sector database, only

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,840
to create a database to question you for the get the records of the questions and then delete record

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,510
to question the question and update to update that question partner.

27
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:13,070
So you can update question table using it or like you can put the new question, or you can change that

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:20,130
position, you can change your option and there is one another for additional question because you need

29
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,920
to see that original version also.

30
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,780
So this is all around the question, Neal, which is a very simple matter and which is very helpful

31
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
or no.

32
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,030
One special deal, which is really symbolic.

33
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:41,000
The logic is simple as we are willing to do any deal, we need to get to run them similarly for the

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,470
good questions and everything.

35
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:49,570
And using this, if you know the solid part, you can easily create that part, I will explain.

36
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,720
Step by step, you two for the insert question, I'm using Boolean mentor.

37
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,370
So I I'm using Bulleit.

38
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:03,740
So once it is done, it will show that Boolean part only if true, then I can use that logic and I'm

39
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,250
switching the exception for the ArrayList.

40
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,270
I'm using a as designation and select from the question list.

41
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,740
It will print all the released.

42
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,270
So this is the backend part.

43
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:21,400
I will connect this back in to the printing tool, showing some beautiful loop manner inside our just

44
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,580
before or web page.

45
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:30,680
Again, I don't want to create some Mill and Java fighting for that.

46
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:37,850
I will embedded the Java code, inserted HDMI and so I am using GSP here, so it will be very helpful

47
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,040
while creating GSP, you will see how we are going with this pipe.

48
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:50,660
So once released is done, for the record, same simply deleted from question to question you.

49
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:59,230
So the next item will be from that good question, and what is your quote, good question, Christians.

50
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,900
Where is the Christian part?

51
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:07,150
So Christian is basically Oracle, which we created only order already good Christian and all the things

52
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:07,980
to do.

53
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,520
You are so Christian and it will delete that part and.

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,010
Let's see.

55
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,730
We are doing our part.

56
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,200
I'm handling the exception, and the exception is very important part.

57
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,470
We always handled that then with the original question, new question.

58
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:32,650
And with all the options and answers, you have to update that record and then the new record.

59
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,460
So this is all about how we can create a question mark.

60
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,230
Why don't you to the question be?

61
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:47,090
Similarly, what I'm going to do, I'm going to do, I'm going to create instruction deal to insert

62
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:52,970
instructions, and some are all getting all records, delete records and update records.

63
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:59,420
So as we are creating for us to learn deal, I'm going with same logic, same methods here.

64
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,150
So get connection insert connection, which contains internet connection with the instruction.

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,760
Then what is this instruction?

66
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,010
I ask you where I'm getting this instruction, and if we do this, we all use the instructions I told

67
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,750
you in for Barbato, in previous part, how we already created this.

68
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,130
You can use your daughter stardom and call for a school and all these things, but I'm feeling which

69
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,360
libraries I'm using only connection prepared statement and said I'm using here, not always for your

70
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,990
time using.

71
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,460
So this will insert all the values inside the database, then at least and get all the codes it will

72
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,070
of getting all the codes from this.

73
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,220
So remember, this is a very important distinction.

74
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:53,350
Then similarly for deleting instruction, tableware, instruction, and this also the reason seems simple.

75
00:05:53,350 --> 00:06:00,270
But all I'm doing, doing just database and all things are simple and similar to one type.

76
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,910
You have created student's deal, all things that are similar.

77
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:11,680
Well, this is all about how we can create all this, so all we know when we are done, we are done

78
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,580
with or is going to be part because we already know that an alternate model.

79
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:23,070
So not only are we finished here only, but we need to create some control in part with content, law,

80
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,820
old instruction, certain method also.

81
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:34,180
Also, we need to create one and other things in GSP because we just we are just doing this back and

82
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,640
we need to create different channels.

83
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,410
So we will see in this really only how we can go with that.

84
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:46,510
So let us see how we can create instruments that we use, control instruction in part.

85
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,600
So instruction insert.

86
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,730
Let me close this part.

87
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,770
So what will this method do?

88
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:06,390
Well, it will insert all that matter into all things and which is basically a very simple method for

89
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,250
the state and everything I'm using this to.

90
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:16,230
I need the need to use this method of instruction because if you are inserting the instruction, you

91
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,030
need to create some java for you.

92
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:25,200
We are already created with the instruction insert or instruction Dubuc, which is using simple audio

93
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:32,460
as you can see this part, but we need to push some message that database is updated or we can say the

94
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,190
instruction is inserted for that purpose.

95
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:41,340
I'm using this controller is basically you can see what level Java Silverlight, which displays only

96
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:50,940
messages to the user then DBS for or creating some methods, which is helpful to create some database,

97
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:59,430
then updating that evolve method, updating the apartment or inserting some database inside that.

98
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,320
So it will the second let itself glasses, or you can see second level important classes.

99
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:10,320
Remember, we use that model is very important because I am creating all the methods with the instructions

100
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,920
and everything.

101
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,800
So it will if instructions are inserted into that part, it will print message instruction added and

102
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,770
it will add instruction GSP, which I'm going to create an instruction GSP method, which is for it

103
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,520
to be in part only.

104
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:31,010
It will put in that instruction in the idea, if not instruction is not order that on that same page.

105
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:38,150
So this is very simple, and this is only for the one pushing, or we can say only for the showing that

106
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,440
message on the database.

107
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:46,670
Similarly, we need to create some amateurs in previous part, or we can see we can create the one only

108
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,330
one button.

109
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,930
And once users log out, it'll go to that first part.

110
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:57,770
But for some user-friendly website, it shows a message what it shows.

111
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:04,760
It shows your logo successfully, or if you enter, it should welcome your name.

112
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,910
Similarly, for that purpose, I'm going to create another methods.

113
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:18,810
So these are very simple methods, logout student and I'm inside your door package only.

114
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,130
I'm using this.

115
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,360
Let me change to the star part only because.

116
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:36,920
I'm facing specifying all the libraries, which I'm using, because you can use or you can use directly

117
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,910
methods like you can always write first code and then you can import libraries because it will take

118
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,060
care of the importing all the libraries so it will import step by step.

119
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:55,570
So you need to optimize this to not start because it takes like it contains all bytes libraries.

120
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,820
No need to specify specific libraries here.

121
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,220
So I'm overriding this to this only like these methods and these matters.

122
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,770
So as I told you.

123
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:16,250
So what it has to do that I knew was to post it for the posting was do it is just for showing some information.

124
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,480
So it is always useful to them to do what takes too much time.

125
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,590
Even GHB is taking too much time for loading for that purpose.

126
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,020
We need to optimize everything.

127
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,120
But if I'm using just if it does matter, it will take too much time.

128
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:38,090
And there I am, using very small, small things like low successfully, and I'm just going to show

129
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,490
this by opposition invalided.

130
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:48,440
But I'm just put this once I click the log button and to show this part on which we're logging on GSP

131
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,710
page.

132
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,260
So for that, do get method.

133
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,530
It will take less time and it is very effective.

134
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,740
So I'm sitting here only.

135
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,930
Printing my statement.

136
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,750
So this is for the printing message on then logo timing.

137
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:17,680
Again, this is a very simple method for the logo and log in, but it was similarly for students.

138
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
I have created only logo student.

139
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:26,770
Similarly, you have to create for the log, so you are again going to use these methods on de novo

140
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,790
students and everything.

141
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:37,240
So I am using this because for user-friendly website, you need to.

142
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,490
Involved this, or you can say you need to create this part.

143
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,110
Similarly, we need to create question in certain part of Europe.

144
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:51,400
So let us see how we can create one Christian insert part of Christian entertainment material.

145
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,370
So for that purpose, inside the controller, you need to create another method, which is basically.

146
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,930
Cushion insert metal.

147
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:06,950
It.

148
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,680
Your solid.

149
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,400
Questioning.

150
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,380
These are very important step daughter of a victim and create a new file.

151
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,760
And I'm deleting this all part.

152
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,020
So let us see how we can do that, but let me use.

153
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,690
Some matters here.

154
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,930
So what I'm doing, I'm importing these matters only.

155
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,320
Because these things remain same here.

156
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,070
All the what I can do is I can.

157
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,270
Take it from.

158
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,030
Logo student, because it is already optimized, but.

159
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,030
OK.

160
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:58,330
So I mean, pulling all the leverage first in what I'm doing, I'm importing.

161
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,560
Import duty is not the.

162
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,400
Not.

163
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,480
Christians.

164
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:17,790
Then what I'm doing is I'm importing more intensely here because that we export more than.

165
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,550
Not Christians, do you convince that part?

166
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,600
Then you need to create an.

167
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,430
At the rate we so late, Mr.

168
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,220
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just pitching this.

169
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,620
And.

170
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,310
I will explain you, OK.

171
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,690
We need to see how we can create this.

172
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:51,740
OK, so we completed this part only because this is a very simple method, I'm going to you.

173
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:57,430
So no need to put this again and again because you see the Virginia, which is basically defaulting

174
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,630
since I already created in this part, knitting.

175
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,190
OK, so question insert, what do you need to do?

176
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,630
It will take part from this to get method and.

177
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:21,500
Option one option given uncertain only, so this will setting dances and you, Christian ideals successfully,

178
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,270
it should print, Christian added.

179
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:29,090
But if not earlier in June, that question is not with the same dispute.

180
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,430
So we need to create order.

181
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,170
We need to focus on GSP only.

182
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:41,390
So now we are done with discretion insert or so we are remaining with some another method, which is

183
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,680
basically student insert.

184
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,740
So again, it is very similar thing.

185
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:52,460
So I will explain yet only once this is done, we need to proceed with GSP files only.

186
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,410
So let me create another solid.

187
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,250
You're.

188
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,290
I'm acting in the way protection, and I'm deleting this part and what I'm going to do is.

189
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,960
I'm going to switch.

190
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,650
Similar libraries in Europe, because these things are always similar.

191
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,650
Then.

192
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:19,190
Instead of using that question, import, I'm going to use student input, but.

193
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,270
So.

194
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,070
That's it.

195
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,650
So we are already done with the.

196
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,700
Similarly, you need to create some lending support your.

197
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,180
So these are all defaulting, all already created, so we need to focus on this.

198
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:47,200
Once this is done, you name password and username, or it will print to the answer to that database.

199
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,100
So we need to see how we can create GSP.

200
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,010
So now we are done with all our solid parts.

201
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,870
We control comptroller is done.

202
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,700
Also, I told you in the previous We are done with this and we are done with the model part.

203
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:09,730
So now in for the videos, I'm going to tell you how we can create GSP, but only because we are already

204
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,510
done with this.

205
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,390
So step by step, I will tell you how we can create.

206
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:20,890
So I will explain the code because writing a code is very huge because typing each and every segment,

207
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,510
so it's very huge part.

208
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,070
So I will explain the code.
