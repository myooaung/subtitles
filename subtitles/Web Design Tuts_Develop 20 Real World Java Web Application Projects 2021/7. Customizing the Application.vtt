WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.310
OK, so we have covered all the panel and but written things still now few are left.

2
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.410
So we're going to be covering in this part only.

3
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.870
We will be concluding basically the application by this video.

4
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.300
OK, so we have created all the bad news for playing that game.

5
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:32.450
We have scored probation panel, a separate dedicated thing for names of the player and the scores of

6
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.990
the player.

7
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.940
And in this, we are going to play the chances you can see everything is working perfectly fine and.

8
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.250
I suppose we want to make a plan, so we will try.

9
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.650
OK, so the dialog box appears saying that FedEx missed an RV after clicking OK, that's for should

10
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.540
be OK, so it is updated.

11
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.900
So the functioning of the game are by five working fine.

12
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.620
We have everything like actually snow sanitize with every button.

13
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.130
Seven.

14
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.610
These are basically but this thing is we can see that we are making out about 10.

15
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.760
Oh, so we have two more things left to do.

16
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.130
We have to set like reset the game again.

17
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.080
Only after that, the score should be updated for the next.

18
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.810
So currently that is OK.

19
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.750
So that scoreboard is updating again and again for next.

20
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.420
This should not be the way for it.

21
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.440
We have to first reset the game and then again, start playing, and then only those four should be

22
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.010
updated.

23
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.560
OK, so before we have covered most of the part like suppose it is like 90 percent of the programming

24
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.300
section is covered by FOX.

25
00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:03.460
Now, the little more things that are left to be like based in the function are like notes and process.

26
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.500
Plus, of course, the reset button and exit button, which will be responsible for escaping through

27
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.550
this application.

28
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.620
So we are going to cover this in this part only.

29
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.650
So yes.

30
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:29.500
So this is the 14th panel in that roll off all the 15 grid firing built to today grid layout, and this

31
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.690
panel is for that, he said.

32
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.010
But then let me show you, yes, this is the reset button and it is located at the 14th panel in the

33
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.860
consecutive rows of all the 15 panels.

34
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:52.000
So this is the life line model and then the old styling for the reset panel and like, continue into

35
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.540
this.

36
00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:03.160
I am going to add a zip button and that the button is going to be named as button reset and it is going

37
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.860
to be a new day button.

38
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.730
So calling it does.

39
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:17.350
Yes, it comes in the finishes and the string should be passed as what should be displayed on the button.

40
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:25.200
So you want to set the string as we set off what we want to set the button as we said.

41
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.230
So researchers say OK.

42
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.010
So they said it said that text was reset in the 14th panel.

43
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.820
We are successful in naming the button.

44
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.860
Now the next concern should be adding a action list next to the beeping reset.

45
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:54.180
So I think action listener and our new action is going to be a tagged inside action listeners.

46
00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.570
So calling in as that only so action listener and OK.

47
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.770
So it is not like this only.

48
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.930
Actually not end up.

49
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:19.560
Calling for action last night is a function of force inside this action last night.

50
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.980
We are going to initialize a public void action performed function.

51
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.130
So public void action performed.

52
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.380
Action performed is the name of the function.

53
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.540
We are like initializing and inside this function.

54
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.180
That argument is action event.

55
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:50.960
We are all we have already used this event in our program, so the suggestions are showing us that.

56
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.920
OK, so the function is created now inside the function.

57
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:07.690
We are going to set like what is actually going to happen when the reset button is all over the blocks?

58
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.910
Maybe up to zero.

59
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.940
Let's suppose this is the stage of the program.

60
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:21.640
So when we click Reset, the program is set on this stage only no more changes just now, saying the

61
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.490
chances of the players will get banished and the scores will remain same.

62
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.760
Only these nine things are going to set to null.

63
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.880
So for every bit, then we are going to set the external.

64
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.660
And this is just a simple thing.

65
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.380
Nothing is so complex about this.

66
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:54.190
I am going to copy this like, OK, so this was written one and it goes from Britain component, and

67
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.370
I am going to copy it further.

68
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:03.730
Suppose it more votes three, four, five, six, seven and eight.

69
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.170
Perfect.

70
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.100
So we have competed for.

71
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.990
Total of how many times one, two three four, five, six seven, okay.

72
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:27.570
It was only seven times, though more times now, replacing her three, four and up to nine.

73
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:37.820
We are sitting on the nine blocks to null after this so that our new game window should open and the

74
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:46.050
player should get a chance to play again and make her make their schools better, of course.

75
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:56.370
So, OK, we are setting everything to null after this and like the similar thing we have done above.

76
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.060
So I am going to call food from there only.

77
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:10.450
This is like we have said, no, we are just going to remove the private in order to not to read declared

78
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.520
anything again.

79
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.560
OK, so I am going to paste it here and remove all the private.

80
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:27.130
We do not need any private, so as we have already declared in more than enough, calling it as private

81
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:35.560
or public again, if this globally declared above, so no need to declare it cancel in order to remove

82
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.100
it now.

83
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.210
Former thing it.

84
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:47.730
And we are done with setting all the buttons like the action is that it is attached with the reset button

85
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:55.050
and after attaching events like actions to the buttons reset button.

86
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.790
And this is going to happen, then we click the reset button.

87
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.630
Now I added a bit of styling to the reset button.

88
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.900
I like the font, the name, it's the whole map.

89
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.440
The font size is going to be 22.

90
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.290
It is bold offers and up.

91
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.830
One panel 14 is to be added with this.

92
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:25.740
Then they said, Now let's try to run the program and check that the weather the reset button is yes,

93
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.480
it is actually here.

94
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.170
Now let's take a look that there is actually this.

95
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.380
If so, OK, so Blair Rex won the game.

96
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.750
Congratulations.

97
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.180
Now scores are updated and now on clicking Reset.

98
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:48.870
Everything is managed, so it is perfect now that is OK.

99
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:56.130
So it is automatically updating the scores of the day, so we will take a look into it.

100
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:03.450
Firstly, we will be adding gold like we had already set conditions for the 14 panels.

101
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.440
Now only the 15th panel is left.

102
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.210
Of course.

103
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.920
Then what the 15th panel is?

104
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:17.220
Yes, it is the exit button, so the window should be skipped as far as we can see.

105
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.440
Connected button.

106
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:28.920
So now we think the exit button and in order to get that button, we firstly have to create a J Panel

107
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:40.740
panel slash under scored 15 and this is going to give us a new burn notice, which will be solely containing

108
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.340
that exist button.

109
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:42.810
Yes.

110
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:48.750
So a new independent panel is the company of the swing library.

111
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.740
So yes.

112
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.650
OK, so this page should be capital.

113
00:09:53.430 --> 00:10:02.060
OK, so the final 15 is created, and now we are going to add tags, cartoons and events inside this

114
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:02.520
pen.

115
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:15.870
OK, so the 15th panel is completed with our done action event attached to the button and the string

116
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.960
inside that button is going to be Eggsy.

117
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:28.380
And this button is as far as I can see that it is not similar to the bit in the sense, but only the

118
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.850
actions involved inside this pen is different.

119
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.490
And what are the actions?

120
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.210
And also, let's take a look.

121
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:52.030
So when we click this exit button on the panel, the frame will exit and it if a statement is like it,

122
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.540
then inside it J8 option pane.

123
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.890
So confirm dialog frame.

124
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.630
And yes, I can show you confirm you want to exit.

125
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.620
So this confirmation dialog box will appear.

126
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.020
Asking for that?

127
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.190
Do you actually want to exert again?

128
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:20.580
There are two buttons attached with a yes button and a button, and that is what actually like placed

129
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.380
inside this action event.

130
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:29.670
We are going to ask the user for the confirmation, and there will be two buttons that bad.

131
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.320
Yes, no option.

132
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:40.080
We are using option pen component of this ringer library and we are going to ask the user for a yes

133
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.650
and no option, and we have to write a separate code for these.

134
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.380
Yes and no.

135
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.790
We have already put the things in our library.

136
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:57.410
We have to not do like buttons, separate agency style them on the show.

137
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:03.690
Just go all day option been daunting as an option and you will be of it this time.

138
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:10.560
OK, so after completing this, the system will exit lit up like null.

139
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:17.060
This zero is for null falls and leaving X application.

140
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.560
We will be escaping to the window with this action.

141
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.420
So this action is.

142
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:33.080
I still have no confirmation if we are pressing yes on the confirmation or no.

143
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.190
So we will exit the window.

144
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.690
And if the press know, then we will remain in that window only.

145
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.810
There is no separate line of code written for that.

146
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.800
We are only setting conditions for making this button.

147
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:52.490
So after this, we are going to down styling also to the exit button.

148
00:12:53.700 --> 00:13:00.180
So I am going to copy this thing as there is no specific change inside number 10.

149
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.640
OK, so we are going to press this call.

150
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:12.190
OK, so we have pasted this styling ping for the 15th panel, also replacing 14 her with 15 written

151
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:16.680
make of dedicated standing for the 15th panel.

152
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.170
Now let's try and run the program.

153
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.260
So running down for knots and crosses class.

154
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.620
OK, so we have reset button.

155
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:30.240
OK, so there is some added we have to change.

156
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.710
The thing within this is no, this is routine.

157
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.700
So we don't exist.

158
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:45.390
Should be replaced as what the places we have placed a reset button to the fifteenth finance by mistake.

159
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.820
OK, so now try and run it again and see that it is working fine or not.

160
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.360
OK, so it is perfect.

161
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.550
It is working perfectly fine.

162
00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:01.020
Till now, everything is correctly oriented inside the frame.

163
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.650
We have a panel of 15 buttons overall.

164
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:12.300
We have nine, but they good natured for the playing of the game like x zero x.

165
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.460
And if we're specific, there means that China will surpass pressing.

166
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:24.300
That score will be updated on taking eggs again, the reset and on making bags.

167
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.060
It worked and our confirmation dialog box office.

168
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:32.040
And if they click yes on this, then we will escape through this window.

169
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:39.600
We called System Dark Exit to zero and mechanic yes, and we exited the application successfully.

170
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.380
So by far, we have covered everything inside the application.

171
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:51.480
This is a completely functioning website like application we call it, and this application will be

172
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.700
able to teach you the concept of Java.

173
00:14:55.710 --> 00:15:02.040
And we have used extensively the swing and the WTA toolkits off Java.

174
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:10.920
So yes, this application will make you able in understanding the concept, the string and a number

175
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:11.550
of things.

176
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:18.430
Like me, I've used everything live one option open button, text free and namely everything.

177
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:23.790
Really, we have used up most of the components inside the swing.

178
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:29.940
I need W.T. toolkit, so everything is going to be made clear in your mind.

179
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:36.750
I've been making this application, so I will insist you all to make this application on your own from

180
00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:41.270
scratch in your compilers by installing the latest JDK.

181
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:50.280
And after this, I am sure that you all are going to build up a good grasp, java, its libraries,

182
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.850
the swing and the toolkit and everything around this.

183
00:15:54.180 --> 00:16:02.940
So ending this project on a good note and thanking you all for joining this project learning session

184
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.010
and try this on your own.

185
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:05.850
Thank you.

186
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.320
Have a good day.
