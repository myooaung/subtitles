00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:01,850
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,020
So in this series of learning how to make projects in Java today, we are going to learn about this

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,010
project, which is called Safety Management System.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:20,000
So in this project, which is actually made in code Java, we will be learning about that.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,750
How actually a management system works.

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,360
What are the like and what use?

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,800
And accordingly, what are the outputs attached to?

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,850
Those inputs correspond like those corresponding inputs and how actually everything works inside?

9
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,820
And will it be a management system?

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:48,500
So on your screens, you can see the opening window all for like this application, which we are going

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:56,410
to make today and in this application, initially, this page and open are like saying this title as

12
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,470
welcome to that project.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:06,020
Initially, there will be two options that we will have to type either one or two.

14
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,790
One will be for the logging in into the management system.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,000
If you are already existing user.

16
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:20,930
Otherwise, if you are a new user, then you have to type two in order to create a new account.

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:30,470
So suppose we are like, I knew you were, so we will be wishing to create a new account in this system.

18
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:40,940
So we will be choosing Choice two on heading to from your keyboard and then in the window asking for

19
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,500
our customised number.

20
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:50,150
So suppose that I have and then ask any random question number as one two three four.

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:58,430
Then after this customer number entering process, we will be asked to four entering a pin number,

22
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,080
which we want to register.

23
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:08,510
This is already like a security based of thing, so we have to keep our thing very private.

24
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:18,440
We have to enter our pin in ready to secure security minded manner like we do not have to enclose this

25
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:18,860
pin.

26
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:29,630
Any other user or any other, like our friends or relatives, only those people are able to know the

27
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,630
pin who are actually very close to you, who will be accessing your account.

28
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:45,860
So keep this in mind that this is already private, like logging in for so yes, once you enter your

29
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:54,770
customer number and your pin, then your account will be successfully like registered in this APM management

30
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,280
system.

31
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:03,110
So once this is registered, then the next process will be to redirect intolerable.

32
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:11,030
So we have already discussed that if you are a new user, then you have to create an account and after

33
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,780
which we have to log in if we are existing customer.

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:22,580
So once we created the account, we become automatically the existing customer, so we will be redirecting

35
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,610
to logging in the login process.

36
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:34,130
We will be asked for our customer number and our pin number, so we have to enter vote and we have to

37
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,890
remind this info in order to log in in future also.

38
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:49,520
So like, keep these things written somewhere or memorize these store credentials, your customer number

39
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,780
and your pin number.

40
00:03:51,290 --> 00:04:00,020
So if you enter any of the wrong credentials, then automatically you will enter this system.

41
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:06,800
Like do not enter the system, you will exit the system automatically and log in will be shared, of

42
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,280
course.

43
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:15,620
So once you enter the correct tendencias, then you have to like select the account you want to access.

44
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:22,460
So we have different types of accounts in this event management system.

45
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:32,420
We have checking account savings account, and the third option is to like, exit this frame window

46
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,650
or whatever we see.

47
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:44,720
So once we add that our choice of the types of accounts supposedly enter to OK, so we have entered

48
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:53,610
to our first savings account and we enter the afternoon bulk of the savings account in this savings

49
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,380
and account interface.

50
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,140
We are provided with five options asking for that.

51
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,510
What are we going to perform inside our account?

52
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,440
Then we want to be your view that balance.

53
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:16,650
Withdraw the funds, deposit the funds, transfer the funds or exert this saving our life savings accounts

54
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,090
and the interface.

55
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:25,170
So suppose we want to deposit funds as we have just created our account in this system.

56
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,870
So obviously there is no money.

57
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:38,130
So we have entered choice three for depositing funds as soon as we enter this option, three for depositing

58
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,810
funds automatically.

59
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:47,430
This shows that current savings account balance is zero, which is like we are a new user, so we do

60
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,700
not have any deposits already to this account.

61
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,830
So this will be asking that amount you want to deposit into your savings account.

62
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:03,200
So suppose you want to like deposit $10000, shares Soyuz.

63
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,820
After this entry process, the money will be deposited into your account.

64
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:17,220
Current savings account balance will reflect the value of $10000, which is an addition to this initial

65
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,480
are like a dollar.

66
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,410
OK, so after this, suppose we want to perform any other leg test?

67
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,510
So yes, the second choice will be to withdraw funds.

68
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:41,310
So suppose we have deposited funds to our account then a few days later or after, like for checking

69
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:48,540
initially, we want to check that even if the withdrawals working correctly or not, we want to withdraw

70
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,390
some money from our leg deposited money.

71
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:58,770
So current savings account balance is really reflected every time we enter any of the choices.

72
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:05,880
It will show that you have this money and then decide what money you want to deposit or transfer anything

73
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,990
you wish to.

74
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,920
So suppose we want to like, withdraw $2000 from our savings account.

75
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:22,350
So after the withdrawal from money, the current saving account balance will be reduced.

76
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,780
Obviously, we have withdrawn some money.

77
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:33,780
So the current saving account balance will reflect that value, which will be like that subtracted value

78
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:40,380
from the initial account balance and the withdrawal money like the money which will be withdrawn.

79
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,820
So after this, our current savings account balance will be eight thousand dollars, which is very natural.

80
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,290
We have returned to Thailand.

81
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,730
So what is left?

82
00:07:51,300 --> 00:08:00,840
This is left after this, I suppose in the next step, we want to like our option for this transfer

83
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,380
of funds.

84
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:13,410
So once we enter the default from our cue ball, the transfer funds option on the function will be activated.

85
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,190
So what is actually transferred funds?

86
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:24,420
So we have to firstly like select the type of account from which we want to transfer the funds.

87
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:31,410
Now, fund transfer of me to anyone, our friends, our relatives, any professional use or anything

88
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,560
so we can choose from which type of account we want to transfer the funds.

89
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,160
So we are already in the savings account interface.

90
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,970
So we just have to like switch to checking so there is no savings account option for all I had also.

91
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:56,490
So yes, suppose I want to like the transfer that funds from checking type of account.

92
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,640
So I have choose option one.

93
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,520
So current savings account balance will be shown.

94
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,830
You may be wondering that by issuing a savings account balance, I have chose this checking account

95
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:19,960
because we have no balance in our checking account balance, so it will automatically like it or it

96
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,500
if left enough savings account balance.

97
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,280
And from that only we can transfer the funds.

98
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,480
So mom, do you want to deposit into your savings account?

99
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:37,830
So how do we can transfer the funds between savings account and checking account?

100
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:45,660
So from the checking account, we are on to deposit our savings account.

101
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:55,080
So the current checking account balance will become $1 and the savings account balance will become seven

102
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,380
thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars automatically.

103
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,170
This value is substratum.

104
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,110
We have thousand in our savings account.

105
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,740
We want to transfer funds to our checking account as we have no money in our checking account.

106
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:17,870
So we are like transferring funds between our own accounts right now to check the functionalities of

107
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,560
the system.

108
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,380
OK, so we are done with the transfer from the pink.

109
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:29,030
Now the next process we are going to check is New Balance.

110
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:37,010
So automatically, you balances working with every step, but that is our dedicated function.

111
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,870
Are these four to be on balance?

112
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,600
Like, yes, we have to balance nothing else.

113
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:49,800
So on pressing one, our savings account balance will automatically and if left, as we are going to

114
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,860
be in our savings account interface now on this process is to exit.

115
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:01,670
So we have exited this savings account interface on anything five from our keyboard.

116
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:11,300
Now again, we are back in the interface, which was like initially present at the time of the now being

117
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:17,480
like we are running this program and this was the actual on logging in.

118
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,260
This was the actual interface.

119
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,920
We were like, See?

120
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,930
So yes, we are done with every checking or functionality.

121
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,300
And our next to it will be to activate this be a management system interface.

122
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,830
So on hitting three.

123
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,280
This message will appear there.

124
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:43,370
Thank you for using this area and you will be exiting the interface of the deer management system.

125
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,840
Now you may be wondering that or we are going to make this project.

126
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:57,260
So what will be the core like things they will be like keeping in mind before making this project?

127
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,520
So this is basically a dam management system.

128
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,440
We have already discussed it.

129
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,760
So we are going to manage everything about this, a dam management system, all the functionalities

130
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,940
we just encountered in the previous slide.

131
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:19,630
We will be making everything on our own starting from scratch.

132
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:26,390
Everything will be done a step by step and like, we are going to manage everything about this system

133
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,380
of what actually this system is providing facilities.

134
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,520
So this is for like access in different types of work.

135
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:42,380
And we have already seen accounts checking accounts, savings accounts and other functionality is to

136
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,250
withdraw money, check or balance depositing money.

137
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:54,530
And also, we can transfer funds within accounts with a feature of choosing the accounts, which we

138
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,560
have already seen in the previous slide.

139
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:04,010
So this is the basic specification of the project we are going to meet.

140
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,560
These are the functionalities which we will be writing the program about.

141
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:17,810
So yes, after all this specification, but now you may be wondering that what are the concepts we are

142
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,560
going to learn after this successful completion of this project?

143
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:27,500
So the first thing we are going to learn is object oriented programming in general.

144
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:36,050
So after the completion of this project, you will be having a good grasp at object oriented program

145
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,590
and back to new object oriented programming.

146
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,950
It is about our life back in the real world ended.

147
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:51,110
These objects are real world entities, and we are like a learning, object oriented program, so everything

148
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,540
will be around objects.

149
00:13:52,550 --> 00:14:00,830
My classes only now the second thing we are going to learn is to make a job application from scratch.

150
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,280
So everything will be done step by step.

151
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:13,670
We are going to like write a repeat of one by one explaining every part and not going to miss anything.

152
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,360
We are going to learn the test structures, such as hash maps, which gives out a strings and so on.

153
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,620
So therein lies plenty of knowledge about data structures.

154
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,730
We will begin in Java after the completion of this project.

155
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,810
The management system will be the output after this.

156
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,510
So completion of this project.

157
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,080
And of course, that is object oriented programming.

158
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,810
Then there will be definitely classes in object.

159
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:50,320
So basically, it is going to be what the concept, the best project that is no fancy like interface

160
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,200
we are going to make.

161
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:58,910
We are just going to learn the concepts, the basics and all the things about that APM management system

162
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,720
in Java.

163
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:07,880
And after the completion of this project, you will be mindful about all the concepts that need to be

164
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,740
object oriented programming, whether it be detached structures in Java and everything.

165
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:21,050
And I hope that after the completion, you will grasp our large knowledge about Java and become confident

166
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,110
in making projects in Java later on.

167
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,880
So in the next part, we will be looking up to the working of this project.

168
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,630
So see you in the next part.
