1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:05,440
Our project is multi-tiered system using Java.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:13,940
We are going to use your Java as a language of primary language for creating a chat system using some

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,070
multi-threading concepts.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,970
So I will tell you why we are going with multithreading in part and what is done will be trading in

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,620
the Java.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,240
But before that, I am going to tell some basic concepts of Java.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:34,090
So the Java project is based on Java, Java swing for developers and some Java multi-trillion concepts.

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,000
I will tell you why we are going with military training in each and every team.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,850
So for this job, I'm going to reject system, so we are going to create a simple check system of the

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,420
text and everything.

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,960
We are going to create so basically take system only and we are going to create a Java Multi Trading

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,650
Europe for the jet and client transport process.

13
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,380
Throughout the process, I'm using client word as a user and server as a service provider.

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:10,720
So remember that whenever I'm using client, it basically means that the user of the system and server

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,640
is basically for the service provider of that, or we can select the nation for that purpose.

16
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,230
So let us see what is the project aim or what is our project in this field?

17
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,100
So Project Team is basically our developer chat application interface fusion using Java with two multithreading

18
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,560
concepts we are going to use here, and we are going to develop a chat system with some application

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,280
in professionals, so we are going to create here.

20
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,940
So this is all about how we are going to create our chat system.

21
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,560
So let us see what is over basically to be required here.

22
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,950
So first of all, is over it.

23
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:58,840
But before that, let us consider some steps of development for our project management team.

24
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,610
So first thing you should always remember is.

25
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,220
We are going to create your Jack system for that purpose.

26
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:17,610
What we are considering here is we are going to set up our project first.

27
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,540
Second is our understanding different tools, what we are going to use your then Java basic concepts

28
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:24,990
here.

29
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,220
We are going to use some.

30
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:38,040
Oh, and also some knowledge of our Java swing, also, you should have some Java multi trading concepts

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,430
also.

32
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,950
And final step is our service Anderson.

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,700
What for?

34
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:48,060
So for that purpose, I'm using here some systems, so states that our project system understanding

35
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,390
different tools, Java Basic Concepts, Java multithreading, Java Swing Server and code for.

36
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,450
So these are the six steps of our project development.

37
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,290
So let us see what we are going to use yet or different tools.

38
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,570
So application requirements, Java, basic knowledge, multithreading concepts, I'm going to tell,

39
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,990
but you should know some basic concepts of multithreading, motion and JavaScript.

40
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,240
I'm not adding more deep part of Java Swing and each and every thing and explain here.

41
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,950
But you should know why we are, why we using Java swing here.

42
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:30,240
So tools required first JDK for a new development, you required JDK for any Java development.

43
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,990
Secondly, git, but inside I'm going to use here.

44
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:40,280
You can use Community Virgin also, or if you want, you can download it into login also, or the student

45
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,880
achievement button is free again.

46
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,750
So port forwarding and system I'm going to use here is in G Rock.

47
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,670
So these are the tools required.

48
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,960
So these are the basic tools JDK also in built with some JavaScript libraries.

49
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,300
So no need to record another libraries.

50
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,790
And if you want to change your password, you will require and also your.

51
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,510
So these are very simple for forwarding system.

52
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,190
We can see if you want to.

53
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,760
You can use another also Google Cloud also providing such systems.

54
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,870
You can use it.

55
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,390
So these are some basic application requirements.

56
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,740
So let's see first.

57
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,900
How are we going to set up our project?

58
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:29,180
So all you need to create on this project here, as we're already here, are so this is my new project

59
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,130
in search of Java in Belgium.

60
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:38,660
You can see here our project and each and everything here on in my chat system, Interjet, I have some

61
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,820
different everything.

62
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,580
So first, I will explain how we are going to create inside, build command, prompt itself, and I'm

63
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,050
going to do some added functions.

64
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,220
Later, I will create another program for you and each and every team.

65
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,280
So these are how we can set up everything.

66
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,860
You just need to create new Java project in idea of recreating the new project.

67
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,460
It will show some different options Java EE Java Web Spring.

68
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,730
So you should remember you have to use on Java.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,130
Java didn't specify your JDK.

70
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,560
It will automatically found that your system loaded JDK and each and everything.

71
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,840
So if you don't install it, you have option also to install JDK.

72
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,880
So download that JDK from it itself, or you can externally download from Google Chrome or any browser.

73
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,430
Then, after doing these steps, you want to create your project.

74
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:41,990
Mention the meaningful name for that purpose is in this with the check system and these folders are

75
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,830
created is that she's basically ever since folder where we are going to create here.

76
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,630
So we haven't mentioned it.

77
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:54,560
I told you, we haven't mentioned any libraries here, but as you can see, some libraries are already

78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:03,590
inside this all all libraries with some important external libraries, as I told you.

79
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,880
And these are anything.

80
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,700
So these are all we can do.

81
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,910
So before that, I will tell you some basic knowledge of Java.

82
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:20,170
So our Basic Soldier welcomes use of three basic structure, although we can say what is the Java structure

83
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,960
other than bioethanol c C++ Java is very much an independent language.

84
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:34,000
So why it isn't machine independent because of these three structures JVM and Angelica.

85
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,540
So JVM is basically Java virtual machine.

86
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:44,410
So if you know the virtual machine, Georgian machine is also similar like that, it does not physically

87
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:44,860
exist.

88
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,900
Second thing is providing the runtime environment with the Java bytecode, so.

89
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:59,030
What is the beautiful thing of Java is for the clan system, but or one system like consider T-Systems

90
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:07,910
TV or computers with having separate or we can see distinct operating systems like one is using Windows

91
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,940
when you do Linux and using Mac.

92
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,010
So these are three different or is this?

93
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:20,600
But Java is machine independent language, so all three are the clients or we can sit we are the users

94
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,070
of our chat system.

95
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,760
If they have some Java platform inside their system, they can run their client.

96
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,780
So it is a machine independent.

97
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,000
Like what is the informal chat applications available in the market?

98
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,530
Are the machine independent?

99
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,090
They can run on windows.

100
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,310
Some are running on Linux.

101
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,890
Also, some are running on Mac also.

102
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,920
Otherwise, some Android things also.

103
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,140
So these are the machine independent things.

104
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,100
Similarly, we are going to create that.

105
00:07:52,930 --> 00:08:01,030
It is also run programs in other languages, but compiling obviously JVM, remember that also for are

106
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:09,310
the main purposes of JVM Node or BI or Lotus or code verifies the code executed reports and provider

107
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,270
in environment.

108
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,230
So these are the basic concepts of JVM G-d's Java runtime environment, which is considering some state

109
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,810
schools, libraries java for you to accept extra.

110
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,560
So as I told you inside E!

111
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:29,900
So these external evidence, these are the parts of all our jihadi jawad and time environment because

112
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,680
these are not entirely new documents it will call while runtime environment.

113
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:43,880
So last July, Java development kit, it consists of containers are made of often plus JVM.

114
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,620
So these are what we consider in time, enrollment and doom.

115
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,020
As I told you earlier, it contains that.

116
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,490
Also, it consist of Java Jar wreckages, basically Java compiler.

117
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,740
So why do we need compiler?

118
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,590
We are writing them into Java, but we don't know the machine lake level language, which leads you

119
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,090
to an automated coder, etc..

120
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,320
So for that purpose compiler, which is converting all the Java program in machine learning to Java

121
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,640
on Java compiler is basically part of Duty Java Development Kit.

122
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,490
So just you download the JDK from Internet from Oracle website.

123
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,220
You are downloading Judy, Judy, you are not downloading Jrt your JVM.

124
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,820
You downloaded the JDK, which is basically all Java package.

125
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,640
We can see and you install that part.

126
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:38,170
So I'm using your 16 login of JDK for such purpose, but you can use integer here.

127
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,300
So no special judkins required for this program.

128
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,260
So this is a basic JVM Jihadi JDK Java basic structure.

129
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:52,340
So I am telling this again and again because if you say I'm using your Windows system for the project

130
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,320
development, if you want, you can use your another system also for this project development.

131
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,560
So Java is basically a machine independent.

132
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,570
So these are the basic structure of J.D. Degree and JVM.

133
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:12,610
So JVM is presenting as well because this is all consistent you.

134
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:19,720
So state libraries, Jodha files and some other on documentation on submitted consistent Jedi.

135
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:29,930
So it makes a Jedi, but developing a JDK Jedi JVM lets some Java files what we can see some other documentation

136
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,430
spa to which anybody can read me, for instance, on there in Java.

137
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,150
So these are Java compiler is very important here.

138
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,080
It's energetic and it makes a whole JDK.

139
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,160
So JVM plus Jerry mixed JDK.

140
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:52,550
Though Java is purely based on methods and classes, if you remember or if you know about sea, are

141
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,480
you going to see Python?

142
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,670
It is are not lake mutagen glasses.

143
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, I see.

144
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,260
Basically, there are classes, but it's not required that you should use that again.

145
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,780
But inside the Java, everything in Java is associated with classes, objects and methods with attributes

146
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,350
and cetera.

147
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,070
So starting off, Java is basically Mitre 10 classes.

148
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:22,910
So usefulness of this is you can easily create object oriented programming concepts in Java, and we

149
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,790
are going to use some object oriented programming concepts also.

150
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:33,110
So what is object oriented is basically this creative class creating that object and use that object.

151
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:41,660
So no need to required or create such a method for such classes or again and again, like you have to

152
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,850
check, you order an even number.

153
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,340
400 times.

154
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,630
So what are you going to do?

155
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:55,650
You can on Jake, such an ambush again and again 400 times or what are you going to do?

156
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:02,290
You're going to create a one meter to pass that number in that and just checking that number with the

157
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,010
same logic for even an hour.

158
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,180
And you can use such a method again and again.

159
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:16,090
So what is the usefulness of that is you can take that method also, and it's very use it usable less.

160
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,650
It's very less complex or complex if it has a very same complexity.

161
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,070
Also, it takes very little space in your system.

162
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,060
But very important thing is I is vital debugging and vital managing that it will be very useful.

163
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,400
So what is Java class and methods?

164
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:42,570
I'm explaining the classes this basically was in really consider this object and God has such attributes

165
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,980
or different attributes that dead weight, color, et cetera.

166
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,220
And there are some matters that I would break out of submitters.

167
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,120
So this object, you can create a class for that.

168
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:00,240
You can pass the attributes, liquid envelope and some methods like brown brake, etc. So basically,

169
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:07,740
classes are like Object Constructor, which is basically constructor of object, which is a blueprint,

170
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,680
or we can see a blueprint of our code on object.

171
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:18,140
An object in Java is basically to all classes or classes.

172
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,430
We don't object, you cannot use that class at all.

173
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:27,610
If you are using some different part, like there are some conditions for using classes and objects.

174
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,020
I will tell you in a letter, but object is called instant of class.

175
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,580
So we don't object.

176
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,520
We cannot call the class and or we cannot use that class.

177
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,950
Method is basically methods are declared within the classes.

178
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,010
It contains code of particular functions and classes who cannot specify the all the code, you have

179
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,380
to create methods for that purpose and you have to execute that part.

180
00:13:50,830 --> 00:14:00,430
So this is all about methods and methods contain some who lose access specified, then doleful object

181
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,720
or classes created for that purpose, then we can use that basically.

182
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:11,290
So what is the basic thing is the hierarchy, and if considered the method for calling the classes,

183
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,400
you need to create object.

184
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:19,600
And using that object, you can use that methods or syntax is very easy for that purpose.

185
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:28,240
Remember, if you knows how to print some statements in Java or you remember that you have to specify

186
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,310
public static void, main and intended.

187
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:36,760
So it is again a method standing with the main method either department or in a job.

188
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,940
I could run or build whole court or project.

189
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,430
Other than that, you cannot use any part.

190
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:51,160
So by running any class, any method, you should invoking the mean method always, which is basically

191
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,370
public static void main method in, say, Java.

192
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,310
So this is all about limited time classes.

193
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:08,840
So before going any further, let us create three Java classes here when these are over.

194
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,140
So what are the needs of the client and when is the message?

195
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,770
So for that purpose, what you are going to do is click here, right click inside to see on this odyssey.

196
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,750
So sometimes it will take time to load.

197
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:30,120
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create your files, Java files, click right click on instead

198
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,240
of see go to new and created Java class by mentioning these various server.

199
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,510
So it will definitely take everything, and it will create some difficulties here, as you can see public

200
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,820
plus of already created.

201
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,890
So similarly, what I'm going to do is I'm going to mention this as a client, which is another class.

202
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:06,240
And what I'm mentioning here is new name or as a chat message because.

203
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:09,820
I want to.

204
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,470
Creates a barometer to pass that message and exit door.

205
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,680
So these are three basic structures we are going to use here.

206
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,050
So these are three classes we are going to use here.

207
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,680
In the next part, I'm going to tell you how we can proceed with this part.
