00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.760
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.490
So in the previous part, we have looked up to all the objects which were declared in the class label

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:21.530
and as an extension to this class, we have extended this as deftly as we have to set a frame, layout,

4
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.630
size, location and everything will be attached to the frame.

5
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:35.150
And the frame is going to be like this with the help of this Java swing to frame import, which we have

6
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.410
already imported.

7
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:44.120
So this class has extended to name and which is going to implement action business.

8
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.500
So action listeners are going to be attached.

9
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.060
We call them by FinCEN are labels that are embedded in this application.

10
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.720
We can see that we have Marten's, we have radio buttons, we have a check box and everything.

11
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:07.400
So these are all going to be made functional then to help us to action this many black men station.

12
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.950
OK, so we have already made extension as Geoffrey Man implemented the action business.

13
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.790
So to implement this action list, and then we have to call this override for like this is a function.

14
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.940
Public word action performed is the name of function, which we have thought, declared or liked as

15
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.280
a necessity in order to implement this action last night to our main glass.

16
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.520
So this override is basically overriding one function over bar.

17
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.020
So this is our main function, and to attach actions to it, we have to write our program inside this

18
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.880
action, perform function and that government is going to be watching events perform with these action.

19
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.810
So that is the event, and every event is attached with a function or action.

20
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.250
We can say it entities.

21
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.740
So yes, we have made everything like clear till now.

22
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.380
We have said the size of the frame.

23
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.570
We have said location.

24
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.240
We have said the title OK, so we can set title according to our choices.

25
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.830
Like Do we have an order as our project title?

26
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.400
We can set it anyways.

27
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.780
So suppose I want to set it as food ordering.

28
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.920
System.

29
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.270
To make things like more appropriate.

30
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:47.440
OK, so I changed that title for our application now to initialize this application, we have to make

31
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.250
our dedicated function inside this enable us as well.

32
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.480
So let me first initialize this in need to make the error vanish.

33
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.840
So if there's going to be a public void function, of course, and inside this unique function, so

34
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:16.330
you can see that that has vanished now inside this in this function, I am going to initialize like

35
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.950
we have what we have on the desktop, so we have select size or light label on the top.

36
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:35.050
So firstly, we have no initialization label size and it is going to be a newly delivered jailable is

37
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.860
also a component of the Dallas main library.

38
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:50.340
So new jailable is going to be the new object and the like text inside.

39
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.760
It is going to be self size, select size of what do we want to order?

40
00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.470
And there are three options.

41
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.320
We have discussed it already.

42
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.910
So a juniper that was stuck on mobile, so we have our label to our control box.

43
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.900
Now we have to set the size for this again.

44
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.560
So all we have to like look similar, maybe have to label size, dot search.

45
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:30.850
So as we have done here, Bon Iver mainly, but so large set size and not set select location is going

46
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.280
to be attached heading similar to it.

47
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.350
So we have successfully set the size for this select size from box and a location.

48
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.080
I like that it is.

49
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.010
It has to be located on the window, which is going to be the application main window.

50
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.830
And similarly, we have added this Albiol size to our testing.

51
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.270
So in order to add everything to our frame, we have to do this.

52
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.800
Every method is going to be added to the frame with the help of this ad keyword.

53
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:17.800
So if this size thing and now the next step should be like adding inputs to the combo box.

54
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:28.900
So string inputs are going to be added for sizes so that sizes and three sizes option?

55
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.460
I think so.

56
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.560
These are small.

57
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:34.660
Medium.

58
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.050
And large as far as I can see that.

59
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:49.870
So we have to like name all the sizes of shoes inside this drink sizes thing.

60
00:05:50.350 --> 00:06:00.760
And now, after adding names to the sizes in the next step, we have to in a similar way, said size

61
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.630
and set location and then add this thing to the frame.

62
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.430
Also.

63
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:15.800
So these strings are going to be consistent inside the formal box, like you can see, this is a Jacomo

64
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:24.510
box component and inside this we are having strings small, medium and large as the sizes of the menu

65
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.110
items.

66
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.810
Now, size large select index is set to zero.

67
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.540
Like the argument, inside the select index is set to zero.

68
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:43.760
This means that by default, this size is going to be small, so there shouldn't be a default size to

69
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.130
die.

70
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:51.110
Those that should be open like the this is the opening window of the application and by default it is

71
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.040
showing small in select size combo box.

72
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.410
So this is responsible for that thing only.

73
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.980
So size, not select index or index is zero.

74
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:09.510
May have three zero one two indexes for small medium unless basically this is asking either we call

75
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:18.390
it that it is a collection of like events and strings and dangerous numbers, lungs and everything.

76
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:27.090
So we have string error and it is going to contain zero one until index is smaller than index zero.

77
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.330
So this is set to default as small.

78
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.560
Now this is the size of the combo box location on the combo box.

79
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:43.230
And as long as we have added this size to the frame, so I have already discussed that this side is

80
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:48.180
responsible for adding everything to the frame of the application.

81
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:55.800
Now we have successfully added this select size label in our frame as a next step.

82
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:04.290
We have to add this select which type of beverage you want to order and after which are like radio button

83
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.920
options.

84
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.160
Label is to be added to our free.

85
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:19.370
So our next concern should be adding a label which is going to be a label, of course, and this little

86
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:30.300
jailable is going to contain a string which is asking for select that type of like drink.

87
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:37.950
You want to order, so type of drink you'll want to order.

88
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:45.060
And this is going to be a label added to our theme and a colon.

89
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:55.140
So this is the label and are similar way we have to set aside for this label and location also.

90
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.700
So we have added items on the label.

91
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:08.760
A size is set for the label and a location is set for the level that where it should be located on the

92
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:09.540
window.

93
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.840
So head, this is located.

94
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:18.450
This is one hundred from top and from the left it is seventy five.

95
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.790
This is this size layout.

96
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:27.180
Also, we have added this to the frame with the help of and given.

97
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:36.290
Now our next concern should make everything on the radio buttons and we are going to import our in group

98
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.560
object, which we have like declared already globally.

99
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.840
So we have.

100
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:54.630
Successfully called our B10 group, had we have declared this weekend as a private global variable.

101
00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:02.280
Now our next step should be adding items to the radio buttons.

102
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:14.160
So like suppose we are adding the radio drink juice and calling it as are the juice, and we are going

103
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.050
to add a new.

104
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.600
Due to the over 10.

105
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:27.970
To that frame and the string, should they are the desert of Yemen, which is going to display the items

106
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:36.970
beside the menu button like the button and the name of the item should be displayed side by side.

107
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:43.240
So we have successfully created our first radio button.

108
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.050
Now set this size for it as well.

109
00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:59.890
So I did use exercise, not said size is going to set enough size and suppose we are sitting in 275.

110
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.480
Chroma 50.

111
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:11.160
So this is going to be the size of the new abundance in this image, let me have to set the location

112
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.640
and add this radio button to the city.

113
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:20.390
Now in this military, we have to add many more items to the menu.

114
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:31.080
So I am copying the same thing three more times in order to relate things one by one.

115
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.040
So the second item is supposed to.

116
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.800
The third one is for the.

117
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.260
And the fourth one is coffee.

118
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:48.380
So yes, just rename this every bit.

119
00:11:50.450 --> 00:12:00.110
And now they're renaming every like radio button and setting a unique location, a dedicated location

120
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.810
for every day.

121
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.900
But then the size of the radio button is going from the same location.

122
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.310
Should Jane like from top, it is going to be one one thing.

123
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.870
But from left, it is going to shift.

124
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:23.750
Some, like how many pixels are shifting in support, have hundreds, then 175, then then three twenty

125
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:24.130
five.

126
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:32.330
So initially we have this system 700, then 175, then 200 and then 325.

127
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:37.540
So this is the location of this button is from the frames left.

128
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.020
So.

129
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:50.000
OK, so now for as far as I can see that we have created the frame items bill has now our next concern

130
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.350
should be to add these Dilbert pens to the frame.

131
00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:04.070
And so our next concern is that only so let us try to add, OK, so we have added all the buttons to

132
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:12.090
the name with the help of these made in group object and we have declared this retail head.

133
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.120
OK, so we have declared this had also.

134
00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:17.840
Yes.

135
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:26.070
So this button group is the name of the function in which we are using from the library package three

136
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:31.550
and we didn't group is the name of the object, so we are adding everything to the frame with the help

137
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.890
of these reading group keyword.

138
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:42.890
Also, our next label asks for how many glasses of the specific item we want to order.

139
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.050
So in the similar way, we have created a new level here.

140
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:56.660
We are creating a label for glasses also and asking how many glasses you want to order inside the delivery

141
00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:05.000
bracket in a formal string setting that size for the label and location, for the label from the frame

142
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.780
like top and left the border.

143
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.980
And I think this will be a lot.

144
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:15.370
So Daphne, also our text box is added.

145
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.750
Our is going to take the input as how many glasses we want to order.

146
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:29.360
Like this box is responsible for that, and we have also set the size and location for that box also.

147
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:39.230
So they allow we have covered every page for select size and the type of item we want to order from

148
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.360
the menu as radio buttons and number of glasses.

149
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.490
They want to either ask me, we have color.

150
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.260
Fill this thing now.

151
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:54.680
In the next breath, we will be covering them back inside, like how to add buttons and how to make

152
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.670
them functional.

153
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:03.950
And there comes the importance of these action events like we have to attach some actions to those buttons

154
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:12.620
and then complete like the ordering process, which is the main concern by making this application.

155
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.630
So see you in the next five.
