WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.080
So in previous video, we learned how well we can determine and how we can rule in further, I'm going

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.180
to explain how we can store this information in two one five.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.730
So let us see.

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.660
I'm going to specify specified public word again.

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.630
Public void store for you.

6
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.460
Method stall pile method.

7
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.290
Is this just a method?

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.060
No, I won't do it.

9
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.710
I am going to use your favorite term for that.

10
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.900
I already use or import this library.

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.730
This is very important every four, five minutes or so.

12
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.210
Before failure to return, thought you should throw the user defined exception for that purpose, I'm

13
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.160
going to use your try track, which is very simple user defined exception method, so that we can say

14
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.810
it is not very user defined.

15
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.630
We can say this error handling method system, a lot of people in it or the error handling or let us

16
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.580
see and say, let's this track or we can do it by writer.

17
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.900
In is equal to new file writer.

18
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.270
European Europe specified this is the.

19
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.260
Basically, location of that pilot.

20
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.320
You can see that info if you are not giving that part.

21
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.730
You can just filing here, but it will create in the system default.

22
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.850
But in my case, I'm going to use your list of locations, which I already created.

23
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.150
So this time we're being the full part.

24
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.140
Always remember you should go to the full plate or.

25
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.650
In 4.60, while you're giving different fine for that purpose, if you're going to use the same file

26
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.900
inside your budget or you're going to create, you can just put that name on file name.

27
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.540
After that.

28
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.870
I want to put that back in north, right?

29
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.630
What I'm going to write this year is, firstly, because there is no nothing.

30
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.170
It's been mentioned that is first name or something, so.

31
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.550
Similarly, I am putting your first name your.

32
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.730
Then not.

33
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.500
I'm not going to write it, I'm going to open, so I'm going to appended your own.

34
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.500
Last name.

35
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.820
OK, you can put your selection.

36
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.410
Always remember slashing.

37
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.770
This not in any.

38
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.640
Again, not up in.

39
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.500
Similarly, I'm going to put everything here now, email every everything.

40
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.810
So similarly, this lake that you can put everything.

41
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.440
Email.

42
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.970
Then in caught up in.

43
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.880
Password.

44
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.630
Ideally, you should not store any password, but I'm considering this as a database, so I'm watching

45
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.170
this as.

46
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.650
In email or password also?

47
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.300
Then in a lot of pain.

48
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.250
Slashing.

49
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.670
Capacity again, capacity.

50
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.460
Let's.

51
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.710
This don't is the name male capacity.

52
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.320
Not a band.

53
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.520
Alternate.

54
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.300
I mean.

55
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.300
Let's.

56
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.870
What would this this alternative?

57
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.810
Emily, what do you mean?

58
00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.100
That's it.

59
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.910
No, I'm going to close, always remember this is best practice.

60
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:04.820
To close everything.

61
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.810
And just system dot.

62
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.480
Outdoor retailer.

63
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.990
Data stored.

64
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.080
That's.

65
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.130
Now, this is what story we need to create for in part on some similar.

66
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.800
They've been.

67
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.100
While.

68
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.490
Midterm.

69
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.490
Public or it should not be public, but for.

70
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.790
System convenience, I'm going to use this part to redefine.

71
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.630
Similarly, you are going to use triage year for.

72
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.110
Exception, any exception?

73
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.090
E!

74
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.940
System, not a lot.

75
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.290
Println E.

76
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.060
And, sir, this you're going to handle it.

77
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.150
Yet I'm going to use file reader.

78
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:23.490
Method, you can use input stream, these are very efficient, putting your output ceiling, boosting

79
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.940
that will you realize this?

80
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:25.510
You realize it.

81
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.730
These are very helpful.

82
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.710
But due to time constraint and also there is no need to put everything.

83
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.640
I'm just going to use this file name as mentioned in this file, I'm going to copy this part.

84
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.660
No calls also this wasted.

85
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:52.460
I'm going to time constraint and then just I'm creating value because it will look through the characters

86
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:59.660
and in that, so it is very difficult to understand, but it is very helpful for the small, small part

87
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.290
and project.

88
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.080
If not, there is some default build up.

89
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.380
What is that part?

90
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.190
Bill?

91
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.950
Marty, well, two minus one, which is basically not null.

92
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:21.290
What did we do it we print system, dot dot print in the console.

93
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.310
What did we print?

94
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.020
It will bring.

95
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:35.140
Correct stinks because it will accept that in all what we can say in the integer part, but I want to

96
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.630
present it as a character so it will ask for character.

97
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.910
Once this one is done.

98
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.880
I'm going to a front door.

99
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.800
Close, your connection is close.

100
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:55.260
And this part is done if you want to be one foot here, one fishing or a dog println statement just

101
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.670
this to you.

102
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.030
Look at.

103
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.770
And we are done with this, but we haven't created anything in that email mean part.

104
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.430
OK.

105
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.200
So as you know, for this, I want I will extend that part.

106
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:17.120
So as fifties exist, but no, this part is for the store data in you.

107
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.220
No sixth option is for.

108
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.040
Display data from.

109
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.330
And now the seven part for Exit.

110
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.410
Similarly, we are going to change this in this part.

111
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.880
If parties are as it is, but.

112
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.460
I'm going to end this statement what?

113
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.810
The stall him one not.

114
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.160
Stole by.

115
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.830
Then four of the precondition is six.

116
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.440
Ian, were not.

117
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.020
Redefine.

118
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.430
Precondition again.

119
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.200
Then if someone is known.

120
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:13.640
System not.

121
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.380
And, Alan.

122
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.640
Thank you for using.

123
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:23.180
I wouldn't.

124
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.350
Application.

125
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.520
Then again.

126
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.110
Now we're going to end this condition also soon.

127
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.990
But now we are done with our project, but let's run this part and I will explain how you can create

128
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.070
some sort of failure.

129
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.430
So let's run this part.

130
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.570
And.

131
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.250
So will ask for the first name, James.

132
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.880
Be.

133
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:08.410
So new employee name is James V. I'm setting it for sales department.

134
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.900
I will ask for the show in full.

135
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.230
Well, it's unfolding for now.

136
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.830
You can understand it.

137
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.350
Each time this is different and it is not a no no.

138
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.250
You can see it is just putting some random variables and everything.

139
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:31.390
Info, then I want to store it and do the fine if it's loaded into the data stored, as you can see,

140
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.500
destroyed to the.

141
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:38.860
If I am cooking six display data you can see now this is printing to this, you will understand why

142
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.820
this is printing to this, so you need to change something here.

143
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:51.130
You will understand what we didn't mistake here is as this is done, but before that.

144
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.700
In the choice or in the store for you.

145
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.340
I'm reading this statement.

146
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.670
This will create some error, you can remove this part.

147
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:12.790
And also just removed this slashing also, so it will create step by step, so it is very difficult

148
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.570
to understand.

149
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.780
So always, never do the science lesson despite.

150
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.340
Now I will read it again, and I will fill you.

151
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.150
So.

152
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.590
This is all about no application or.

153
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.420
I will put the dog in Jim's meat.

154
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.530
Since the parliament again, it's stolen data file is displayed at.

155
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.510
You can see our detailed displaying.

156
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.340
Oh, no.

157
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.910
Let's see what I mean.

158
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:57.250
I mean, when Ed superintend just footprint here and also you slash in your two hour that it.

159
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.810
Selection, selection, selection, selection and selection later.

160
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.020
They're just renewed again.

161
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.590
Now we deal with our problem, as you can see it, sprinting character by character because of the print

162
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.280
and instead.

163
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.440
Oh, and when we put in statement.

164
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:29.190
James me, since department store into their data display data, so as you can see, it is displaying

165
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.200
the data capacity and everything.

166
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.050
So now we are done with our project.

167
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.650
But let's see how we can create one single file.

168
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.890
Or we can see some single data for you.

169
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.500
File for executing this part.

170
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.710
We have already done with our project.

171
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.470
So as I told you, we are going to create one single executing file without apology.

172
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.700
So for this purpose, we're to this file option project structure part.

173
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.930
In what you can see, these was that are box, but go to artifacts here.

174
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:10.220
But is ad buttoning up, Draupadi, and we want to create with dependencies, moralism and application?

175
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:17.580
So as you put something here, it will automatically detect this, but meaningless.

176
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:23.310
We need to put in last week, OK, once it is OK again, OK?

177
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:31.780
It should be system before, don't change anything here, then click Apply and didn't hit Enter OK.

178
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:40.560
Now, the artifact is not, but we want to build it, to go, to build here and create this build artifacts.

179
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.750
So what will you option?

180
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.770
You will work.

181
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.320
Rebuild clean and do something to build.

182
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.830
So it will take time to build.

183
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:57.500
As you can see in their dialog, Box Hill Bottom, it is building this and it is doing so it will take

184
00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.550
time to build.

185
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.340
As for project requirements, our project requirements are we releasing this.

186
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:10.490
So now you can see in the hope and artifacts, you can see this email or just an email application.

187
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:16.430
So if you want to run this part, you can you have to edit the configuration.

188
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.840
So go to this M.E.N: Elite configuration part here.

189
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.360
You will see this ballot box click Add New Button here.

190
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.670
Then there is a huge list for this, so go to down here.

191
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:40.110
Or inside this, you can you have identified this job application and you're looking and then you're

192
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:47.160
going to give the name, I'm going the name is email at local machine and do the job part to you.

193
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:55.440
So in this job, the parties always in out artifacts and it's you can see your vision, but happily

194
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.420
you can run this email app.

195
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.960
And as you can see, this is printing this everything.

196
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.030
Our John, if I lose it any.

197
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.530
And then on that plus, we are running, no, we are running it justified.

198
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.790
Let's see how we can run the command prompt.

199
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:19.420
So I'm going to pause this part and I will show how we can on this in or do this in the command prompt.

200
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.200
You don't need bullets run over.

201
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.630
Java Java slash jar.

202
00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.010
And that name of your job for you.

203
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:40.680
So you can see this is running again, putting this James B then as developments in an interview, as

204
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.090
we can see influence pretty similarly like that you can create one application.

205
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.160
So this is a very basic application.

206
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.150
We are going to use.

207
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.780
But you then move further with that.

208
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.470
Any part like you can create job affects you for this and anything.

209
00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.180
So let's see what we do in this.

210
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.370
So as you can see, we created one part if name.

211
00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.900
So for the overview of our project, we created one random method.

212
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.450
We use that to create email application.

213
00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.560
So we created different methods and we are used in this.

214
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.920
So this is all about our Project Java application.

215
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:21.450
Thank you.
