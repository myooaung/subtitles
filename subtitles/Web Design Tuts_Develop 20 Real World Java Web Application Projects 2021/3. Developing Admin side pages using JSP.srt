1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:10,730
We already started our project, which is based on Jarablus system, which I am the name is Connect

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,480
the Globe because I'm keeping the people throughout the software.

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,630
Or we can.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,810
So where are you planning to be, Angela jealously?

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:27,190
So if you have seen we already created this in our space, we created indexed on this page.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,560
And I already quoted some part, I will tell you the significance of this part.

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,760
So this is the index page, which is basically first loading beach or landing with the page you can

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,980
see knowing what if these things?

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,360
I will tell you later, but this is very important.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,290
I'm referring my page language a Jawa, not a demon, so I'm embedding it, meaning the Java coding

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:53,790
HTML.

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,880
You can see Jews.

13
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:03,360
So the beautiful thing of Jews being ignored is these are all the JavaScript where I refer to some see

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,110
as this place.

15
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,210
So if you have seen these things.

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,740
OK, let me show you these are the GSP to create.

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,870
But if I'm going to downward a little bit and I will tell you where I'm using in.

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:27,170
So all these things are basically just be just be language.

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,360
Or are we going to lose language?

20
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:38,510
OK, now you are saying this not logging message, editing out print, it's basically not estimate it's.

21
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,940
So I'm embedding inside these these other things very important sitting in the green, so the Green

22
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:52,780
Party's jealous, so I'm using you to GSP, know why I'm using GSP instead of using it and you say it's

23
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,520
very useful you can use this in the stimulus long, but thing is very printing this message.

24
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,040
You can see this.

25
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,690
I just want to bring non blogging message or something like that in this.

26
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,650
What I have to do?

27
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,620
Oh, I have to create one steam and then I have to submit for the silver lining back in the general.

28
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,170
Now I can create one just just fine.

29
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,440
And in that only I can use Java.

30
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,870
I need reloading.

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,380
So that's a beautiful thing because I don't want to create any stimulant that makes so little time.

32
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,140
It is.

33
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,360
I will tell you what is the gist?

34
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,120
Yeah.

35
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:39,070
Then I created an admin page at Ninja SP, which is pretty similar, which is pretty similar.

36
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,960
But the one thing is here is.

37
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:50,030
Just ignore this, I just I didn't see nothing but just the same things, if you know the job or the

38
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:55,980
stimulus is just writing this, but because I do, I'm going to add some imaginary part.

39
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,930
I even just this platform again.

40
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,070
And these are some images I'm downloaded from the internet and.

41
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,230
Here you can put some things, then all the things you can put here.

42
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,920
So important thing here is his form.

43
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,170
Well, then what is the form?

44
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,630
Basically anti-logging?

45
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,310
I've been logging procedures in the direction.

46
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:24,590
It will ask for username and password, name as username and password you logging everything you need

47
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,970
is very important, and I'm including who directed him and who at that super and which is the designer

48
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,660
who directed him and basically nothing but which mean some links, images, then something like that.

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,980
So we all already created I just added admin to speak with this.

50
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,000
If you want to create another team you like just on your phone, you can activate Google minimalistic.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,830
Look, I'm just adding all the text here.

52
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm just copying that part only so you can add that part.

53
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,150
So let let's see what you the GSP be basically.

54
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,600
So I would.

55
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,090
So let let me go to this whole post.

56
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,150
If I told you that, so what is this?

57
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,020
It's so pure.

58
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,980
You can add extremely insane that where its requests are, what I'm just posting each in related with

59
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,220
this.

60
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:28,290
But what if I can use only if I can put them job only on the network instead of being on the server

61
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,810
instead of giving load on the server?

62
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,070
Because Server is also searching that file for that particular part.

63
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,790
But instead of that, I can put Java in the network.

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,100
Player, which is basically network, is also having some storage capacity.

65
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:53,550
We can say where we can transfer copies if you so I can embedded that pipe in the forward network,

66
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,290
including each and every team, then so important parts.

67
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,160
I'm going to tell you if you know, the Solarte team bought on Berkshire estimates, this is just for

68
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,070
the frontend Java servlet program for banking or logic.

69
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:15,570
We can see and Vivek's email to control flow of webapp each and every one instead of this great piece

70
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,140
of Java.

71
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:22,830
So they just basically Java language inside a single page, so you don't need to worry about them,

72
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,020
not email me if I use any law and order.

73
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,880
No need to worry about that is, to me, will take care of itself.

74
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:34,970
We know that syntax, or we can say scripting syntax for that was to link between Java and streaming.

75
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,970
Do you then cannot use drinking for dirty money, sending me money that you need to create dollar,

76
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,690
single dollar for you, for the debt?

77
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,140
Like, please notify everything.

78
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,440
So that's another thing.

79
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,790
But I don't just for fetching power, just for this playing part.

80
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:57,480
I again, you just feel so juiced for technologies used to create web application, just like cellular

81
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,150
technology.

82
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:04,810
It can be part of extension of so little because it provides more functionality than solely like expression,

83
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,740
language just in general, scripting languages, everything.

84
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,070
Transcript language also provides.

85
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:19,330
So Jaspreet Page contains statement explicit GSP text, as I told you before that.

86
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:25,980
But then GSP pages are easier to maintain because of soldiers because we are designing development.

87
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,480
If you know, like let me show you.

88
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,190
These terminologies.

89
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:38,630
On that is more padding here, but nobody's asking you, is this part of you?

90
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,870
So it's very big file, as you can see.

91
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:50,590
So as you can see in this part, you can see this are all the teams are basically designed and these

92
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,120
all the things are a basic part of our development.

93
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:03,000
So GSP is easier to maintain what we can say, easier to specify the gap between designing and development.

94
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,390
If I'm using a steel mill and late.

95
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,650
And what is the difference?

96
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,260
I have to here to one another fight which isn't going to slow down the silver and which just going to

97
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,590
load.

98
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,900
So it takes more time and everything.

99
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,620
Maintenance is very difficult.

100
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,830
In that case, it provides additional features, with some expressing in languages custom tags.

101
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,550
You can create some custom tags in scissors or JavaScript.

102
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,590
You can use that directly in jiffy.

103
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,480
So that's a very good thing.

104
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,800
A lot of things happen.

105
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,560
But what's the advantages?

106
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,670
Basically, I'm going to tell you it's an extension.

107
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:42,720
So if you know, just like we have so many mutations, like four legged forward material, each and

108
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,580
everything, you have to remember everything, syntax, each and everything.

109
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,400
But here there is no such case.

110
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,160
You can provide as many as four cases.

111
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,880
Everything and extension are solid because random extension, you can use some implicit objects you

112
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,740
tags because sometimes you can create expression language you can create.

113
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,930
You can create other methods in just be.

114
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,350
Also, this link to lets you have to remember you use this index.

115
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,600
What this will do is be embedded in just that triangular arrows with precision.

116
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,580
And you have to indicate this.

117
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:25,180
Who do you recall that estimate, hearing some buildings that easy to maintain, as I told you, it's

118
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,200
very easy to maintain.

119
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:32,200
We meet a lot of business logic with presentation, logic and solid like logic.

120
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,900
You basically do look at this video and you have to make Meeks look like for the simple part, each

121
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,150
and everything else could outdoor and you didn't.

122
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,890
Oh, then fast development, no need to complain.

123
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:50,580
I will tell you what is the 10 year old solid if you create a new zone, if you are really it down in

124
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:58,200
your butt induced B, consider, you know, the one goal induced field you can say, you know, no one

125
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,350
and which is related to your got a -- thing after you created industry for you.

126
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:13,140
And after developing all that violently blowing on the silver, I'm not playing under this law, but

127
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,770
I'm getting one on of wood after three weeks.

128
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,110
You are as a developer.

129
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,530
You have some mistakes in that you need to add a one more GSP.

130
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,700
You can add them just spin that slower part.

131
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:30,600
Or we can say the plumbing part just added, you don't need to redeploy.

132
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,500
No need to change that dot com part or your part.

133
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,650
It just added it just acrobatically really blurred.

134
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,060
So no need to re compile it once it is really oh, what are we going?

135
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,010
Say there is no interest in that DSP.

136
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:51,840
You can really blow it again and again as many as I want because I going into clearly plug in JVM or

137
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,590
Java support.

138
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,960
Similarly, if GOP bridges is modified, we don't need to compile redeploy.

139
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,490
So let girls need to updated RE compiled some names autobahns for reaching their database.

140
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:11,550
If we are militarys, the black teams also swing them so it's more on if we change the look and feel

141
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,810
the application and everything.

142
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,240
We are needed to the internet so that it means we need to stop this all, but we need to redeploy.

143
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,390
And then again, small but Indexer would like.

144
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,550
So instead of this, what are we going to do?

145
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,170
We're going to just add to just being said that, I mean, oh, we can perform such actions.

146
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,150
So let us in the IED.

147
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,610
What I created already, so do the Adam and Eve person I put along in this.

148
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,910
So let me along in procedures.

149
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,900
So this is very simple for you.

150
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,630
More than putting the ad may not have been my password.

151
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,100
You can choose any differently because I'm saying this only I don't want to specify.

152
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,540
Oh.

153
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:57,440
Thing here, and this is importing this apart and all the things into this plane.

154
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,970
So this is all about power.

155
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:11,270
I'm creating this, but let me tell you the basic thing here is, Oh, if we have seen this far, oh

156
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,740
already, oh, I'm listening to a status DSP.

157
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,950
So I will tell you later, what is the significance of this is that knows everything, but always remember

158
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:30,520
one thing while developing this, you don't need to recompile it again.

159
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,610
As these are the GSP files you don't need to compiled.

160
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:42,370
So what you are going to do is just here, just add that file in your project in GSP.

161
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,270
As I told you earlier, how we can add these files in your GSP.

162
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:54,370
Similarly, you need to add that file in, just be just be complete and you are going to develop your

163
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,990
files and each anybody can hear.

164
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,660
So this is all about how we are going with this.

165
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:10,920
So in further videos more, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to create some files here and I'm going

166
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:18,300
to build it throughout my project with some difficulties I'm mentioning here.

167
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,890
Some place you need to create here, but.

168
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,560
All these women will create all faiths, don't miss any food profile or anything.

169
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,840
So this is the age status and I'm using a school.

170
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,230
I will tell you what is the significance of this glam, putting the school file in each and everything?

171
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,340
Logo dispute I'm going to create.

172
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,680
I'm putting everything here, so I will tell you what is the significance of this each and everything

173
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,760
in later part.

174
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,220
So this is how we can create.

175
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:58,430
Well, so let us create one mortgages we already created.

176
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,520
It's just to see what you can see in the file.

177
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,560
It's not very useful for because there is no logic inside this.

178
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,570
But let me show you what is the file.

179
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,240
So specify the file name is in here.

180
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,860
You can finish.

181
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,370
So it will take time to produce before it, once it is loaded.

182
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,880
Oh, you're going to see this file.

183
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,810
It will be all of this.

184
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,450
With win lose faith, I'm hoping this as it is because.

185
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,170
I want to stress and we going to go.

186
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,740
So let me tell you what I'm going to do this year.

187
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,420
So my plan is very simple.

188
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,440
You say she's very simple.

189
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,920
What I'm going to do is I'm going to create one.

190
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:55,150
I'm going to use one HGTV protocol here, which is basically nothing but some.

191
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:02,450
Well, what are you going to package your some templates here, which I to use?

192
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:11,270
So it's nothing we're just creating the objectivity thing and creating some, I'm going to edit some

193
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:11,960
locations.

194
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,460
So if you want to add more locations, you can add.

195
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,920
But I just started only two or three locations.

196
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,070
You know?

197
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,680
These are the locations I ordered and I found on internet easily.

198
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,640
These are some random locations I did, and I just want to put this.

199
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:41,520
So if you want to, you can hear more using or creating objects.

200
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:49,020
So these are the probability and these are the only JavaScript things so that suitable period or DSP

201
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:55,650
which I created, you can be it in this part, if you want, you can develop this far parties.

202
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,540
Very easy.

203
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,390
But I'm adding some functions here, as you can see here.

204
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,740
So this is how you can develop this part.

205
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,060
Function functions and learning all these things are related to script JavaScript, so if you want to

206
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,580
add Java, you have to mention that syntax, but I just started reading JavaScript parts far differently.

207
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,970
So we can create this part.

208
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,610
I hope you understand.

209
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,590
In the first part, I'm going to explain the mean logic of this girl Baqir here with their database

210
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,040
connection.

211
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,130
And this is it about this problem.
