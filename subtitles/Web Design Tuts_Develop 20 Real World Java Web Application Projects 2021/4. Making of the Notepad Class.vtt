00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.850
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:12.000
So after successfully creating the frame of the ban, we are going to add I can do the.

3
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.170
Yes, I can do that.

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.090
No tear, don't take over.

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.520
So invoking the Matildas image, I could.

6
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.410
Naming the variable American, we have to set a new icon,

7
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.530
for the most part, they're told by.

8
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.680
So the method to do this is get glass first, get the glass.

9
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.080
For the image being broken and get resources

10
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.150
from the folder itself.

11
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.320
So for setting the image, firstly, we have to put name right.

12
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.240
So yes, this is done.

13
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.560
New standard spending.

14
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.060
I am going to.

15
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.130
Pasted her, so I am grounded and now going to use it.

16
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.510
The name is suggesting no standard, Bindi.

17
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.300
So the images ended successfully.

18
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.390
Now let us try to run the program.

19
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.620
So I'm running this program.

20
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.530
Let us suppose that I couldn't you said, yes, perfect.

21
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.970
This is the like we have said for the noted down title nine.

22
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:04.160
And on minimizing it, the icon changes from the Java Cup coffee mug icon to this notepad icon.

23
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.170
So we have successfully said the icon for the northwest.

24
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:20.970
Now let us switch to creating the number for this, like currently it has only a body in this title,

25
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:29.160
but let us be into tending bar, which will contain Barton, says file added health and so on.

26
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.100
Now we are going to create a menu bar for this slowed down.

27
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:49.100
So to create them anew, but we have to use this celebrity devastating as it has a function form, a

28
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.380
new moral social gym, a new bar from jealously calling this.

29
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.740
And naming the third as menubar.

30
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.420
And create a new menu, Mark.

31
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.570
Yes.

32
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.790
So the menu bar is created successfully.

33
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:30.870
Now try to earn some change to the menu bar scene so that new menu will contain supposed file file option.

34
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.910
New menu find.

35
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.220
Soyuz.

36
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.040
And we have created fine.

37
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.570
Let us try to run this again.

38
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.820
And running this.

39
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.180
So, yes, this is no.

40
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.750
We have to add members to them and.

41
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.470
If we want to see.

42
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.390
So below the constructive path we are going to call.

43
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.810
At a minimum.

44
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.970
From the nearby Swing Library itself.

45
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.200
No menu, no.

46
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.100
Not turned by.

47
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.690
We are doing fine to them in Yuma.

48
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.400
Now let us try to run this again.

49
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.420
And running this back.

50
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.800
We have our file now.

51
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.050
We have to move it to Upwork's, and the heading part is on the top of the bin.

52
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.970
Not in the middle of summer, so costly.

53
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.310
Move it to adding some more things to the menu bar.

54
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.110
And then shifting it to the upwards.

55
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.110
So let us send and then help option.

56
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:40.830
In a similar way, we have added fine, Michael, being the same and changing it to end it.

57
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.940
And have.

58
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.790
Yes.

59
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.850
Similarly, placing the string on government forces this day menu.

60
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.860
Oh, yes.

61
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.440
And after adding this.

62
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.590
Many of us.

63
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.990
Noted and it.

64
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.120
Many, many more authentic.

65
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.810
So many than have.

66
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.700
Hmm.

67
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:40.770
So we have successfully added two more things to the menu bar, and now we will try to run this again.

68
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:53.680
So, yes, the fields are added to the menu, but now they may try shifting towards upwards.

69
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.500
So we have our it as an menu.

70
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.950
But that is a separate method of adding menu bar.

71
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.210
So.

72
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.320
Now, mentally there, said Jim and Umar.

73
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.050
No menu, Mark.

74
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.160
Now, let us try to run this again and see what it is.

75
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.180
So perfect.

76
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.080
We have it in the menu bar map behind it.

77
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.590
We need the title and we have a fine editor and a Halliburton.

78
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:52.770
So currently they have no options attached, but we will try to add some options inside the file.

79
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.250
A written.

80
00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:06.800
So let's minimize it and try adding some functions inside the File A and has buttons, here we are adding

81
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.720
a menu bar items.

82
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.200
It is also from the library itself.

83
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:25.350
No, I don't let let's call it does new, I suppose, if we want to open a new file in the northwest.

84
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.840
Production goes for.

85
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.290
The Jim Menu item will be.

86
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.290
Called in new.

87
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.600
Fair to be.

88
00:08:49.190 --> 00:09:00.380
We have created a method for the file option, as we know, let us search some more options in a similar

89
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:00.800
manner.

90
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.130
Let us address this as open plain.

91
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.120
Safe while.

92
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:25.420
Parental neglect, as we have discussed in the introduction, Brinton, Except.

93
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.590
And replace it.

94
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.420
Hurdles so open.

95
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.600
Say.

96
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.480
Playing.

97
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.210
And what?

98
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.050
Now, let us try to run this and see in the file button contains the given options or not.

99
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.350
So clicking on the file.

100
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.780
OK, so we have to end it.

101
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.240
In the constructor also.

102
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.090
So adding a tear.

103
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:20.290
Filed or 10, similarly, that we have added more items to the menu, but like file edit and we have

104
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:25.570
to add methods to this file button as well as new file.

105
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:36.220
And again, hoping it five more times and twisting.

106
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:46.010
But open plan exit then say so and open.

107
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:56.390
They've.

108
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:02.060
And.

109
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.680
Is it?

110
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:12.610
Exist.

111
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.650
Yes.

112
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.030
Not to change her.

113
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.460
This will remain and for all of them.

114
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:32.000
Just change the argument and say that matter.

115
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.800
So let us try to run this again.

116
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.660
Running this court.

117
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.830
They're not part of this.

118
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:47.440
Yes and no.

119
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:54.250
We have new open, safe print and exit option for the final button in the menu bar.

120
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.080
Similarly, we will search something for edit and in the next.

121
00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:09.880
And then practice this with with your with your compiler and explore more about these buttons, the

122
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.420
frame and the panels.

123
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.820
See you in the next part.
