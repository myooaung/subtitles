1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:08,860
Now, so that we have covered everything up to the download button and the text, see whether you are

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:16,940
al is going to be like Princeton and then on clicking the add download button event is going to be performed

3
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,370
that the download is to be started after that thing now in the next part.

4
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,960
We are going to set up their download stable.

5
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,980
OK, so this table is going to be set up with the help of this part of the goal.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:38,480
And this part is going to create a new table model with the help of the datable component of string

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,620
library as well.

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:47,960
And this table is going to like select like action list that is attached to that table also.

9
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:55,370
And whenever we are going to, like, select any event from the table, then our event is going to be

10
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:55,810
changed.

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,610
Like, suppose our download is started and like this.

12
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:07,700
So like this, suppose this is going to be after like this to the law and this is like continuously

13
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,180
changing.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,970
So the action is to be listened continuously and then downloaded.

15
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,680
The progress bar is increasing and everything is like in motion all the time.

16
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,150
Not in this, but in this part, everything is in motion.

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,190
So the table is set to event.

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,990
Values are getting change.

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,470
So the argument is don't list selection event.

20
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:39,350
So we have like this action performing at the time, so that function is going to be considered for

21
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,650
this.

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:49,280
And similarly, for all of them now after this, like, we can select only one at a time to play, pause,

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:57,650
resume or to perform any other actions we can order like a pause do often those at the same time.

24
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:07,280
So we are going to use this single selection method of the list selection model for doing so.

25
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,910
So, yeah, so only one rule is to be selected at the time.

26
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,090
Now we are done with the the selection part of the table introduction.

27
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,030
But now the progress render.

28
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,920
So the progress bar is increasing continuously from zero to 100.

29
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:32,350
And this renderer is also saying so that zero and hundreds are going to be the starting and ending five

30
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,090
of the progression in the next bunch.

31
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:44,240
We have like a certain string painted through like by default, the if that rule is selected.

32
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,560
So the progress render is by default set to blow back down.

33
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,170
You can see it here that it is showing a blue background thing.

34
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,020
And so if the download is here, then it is that background.

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:07,850
Now, if it is completed 200 percent that complete the block, this progress render that is converted

36
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,040
to blue background highlight.

37
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:18,110
After this, we are setting a high standard for the table and the provenance, but also so that the

38
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,890
progress world do not exceed the table column.

39
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:31,610
So in order to do so, we are using preferred size in order to like, fix that progress bar within the

40
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,910
column, not to like, exceed outside of a column.

41
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:41,270
So this is doing that now we have to set up their download plan.

42
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,150
So what actually, the download final is?

43
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,580
This complete thing is the download panel, and this download panel is going to be like, contain a

44
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,210
title.

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,210
So that title is containing the word downloads.

46
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:02,980
And inside this, we are setting our layout and the size further download the label hence.

47
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,480
You can see this bold download is updating with the help of this.

48
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:15,250
So, yes, we have certain that tighter border and border layout center.

49
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:24,200
So this is going to be the like layout and position of the text according to the table size.

50
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:32,420
So it is in the middle of the above line and the below line we have above and below border for this

51
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,390
text now, but panel.

52
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,790
So this buttons panel is also a very important part in this.

53
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,540
We have this button panel.

54
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:52,970
Once a specific door is selected, then only the button panel is going to be highlighted and also the

55
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,760
player is disabled in the beginning.

56
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,810
Once we have like selected arrow and.

57
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,710
And certainly then only we can clearly or otherwise, if that are not done, then we can simply clear

58
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:07,890
it.

59
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:17,250
But if they're downloading is a progress status, so we cannot clearly directly, we have to first cancel

60
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,560
the download, then only we can clearly.

61
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:29,340
OK, so looking up to this new law bottom column, this contains four buttons for it, as you can see

62
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,330
and clear.

63
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,020
So what actions are attached to those boxes?

64
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,780
So we have used like all the components of the celebrity.

65
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,260
So in this, we are also we're going to do so.

66
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,460
So this pause button is going to call action for us.

67
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:56,070
We are going to create functions for every button in the action event thing we are going to create later.

68
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,080
So action last night is going to be attached to our last download manager.

69
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,240
Firstly, let us like understand what is happening inside this panel.

70
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:12,780
So initially, we are like setting everything inside up and then only we are going down actions.

71
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,500
So yes, this is for the pause button.

72
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:25,160
It is going to create actions of one function with event as an argument and action is going to be boss.

73
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,510
Similarly for Zoom and for cancer care.

74
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:38,370
So everything is going to be written inside the G button component as all four of them are like pins

75
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,840
and nothing else.

76
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:48,180
So I guess after looking at the addition of these buttons to the panel now after this, we are like

77
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,220
setting this clear button to disable it in the beginning by this one.

78
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,350
So by default, this certain number, each side of the argument is Boolean.

79
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:04,590
We have set this clear button as follows and buttons panel, and we have added in the clear button to

80
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,310
the panel.

81
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:13,350
Now, similarly, we have added all the buttons to the panel and this is for like and fairness to the

82
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,040
display.

83
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:22,890
So we have four buttons, so we are adding all the four buttons to the theme after this for the exhibit

84
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,400
program, we have created this action exhibit above here.

85
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,050
We have done it in the first part, I think.

86
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,320
Yes.

87
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,640
So this is for the closing window event.

88
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:40,260
We are going to perform in order to escape the application window.

89
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:48,270
So yes, we have created this exhibitor program function, which is going to call like system exhibit

90
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,090
and it is going to say its donuts null in order to escape from that application.

91
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,810
Also, we have added all the panels to the display now after this.

92
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:08,030
We have covered this exit program program by now to add new down.

93
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,390
What is this?

94
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,130
So this is the addition of a unique role.

95
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:21,270
One snake based on what else in the text field and hit that download button.

96
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:28,570
So this part is going to be responsible for adding unique roles for every download.

97
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,660
Like in order to attach it to the table, we are like making.

98
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:43,140
So this table so far this fine every row is going to be added for a specific download.

99
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,720
You are then modifying the order.

100
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:53,820
So this modified you are is a component of that string library as that which verifies that whether this,

101
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,030
you are told, is like a valid one or not.

102
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,560
So by default, that this is said like not the null.

103
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,220
So we have to like based your order in order to add it to the download button.

104
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:16,410
So after this on clicking the add download button and new download is going to be either that or like

105
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:16,800
this.

106
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,430
So we have pasted the order now.

107
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:27,990
It is not equal to null, then only we can click this and download and then this is added to the arrow

108
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,360
and the download starts.

109
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,030
So our text field, said Texel.

110
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:43,930
So this text field is reacting to this action and in order to like, make things like, yes, this action

111
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,860
on is a we have added this are the banner.

112
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:54,450
So the banner now after this, we are attaching like the action is null for that, our panel, which

113
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,350
we are doing here.

114
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,610
So initially, the text field is empty.

115
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:07,110
Once it pays to know you are there, then it is going to start their download and to the frame also.

116
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,720
So is the suppose.

117
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,890
If you analyse north of Ireland, then what is going to happen?

118
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,120
So it is going to display that invalid, invalid download.

119
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,450
You are.

120
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,230
So suppose that you miss think in the best like pasted are wrong.

121
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,320
You are in and then this ah, download button.

122
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,500
Then this is going to like, show out there that you have pasted it wrong.

123
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,620
You are to try pasting another one and then start laying down the new download process.

124
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,750
So yes, you should import their download you very carefully.

125
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,090
In order to make us successful, download.

126
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:57,930
So this is the new download, but now for the verification of for the other, like we have covered in

127
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:03,310
the introduction part that wants to be base like input.

128
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,180
Are you are and ED was displayed.

129
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:15,180
So that is going to reject her that whether the link is not broken or that link is like error free,

130
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,990
then only the download is too restrictive.

131
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:30,260
So it is going to check whether the link is starting with as TTP and then all that text like in fibrates

132
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,150
inside I you are is in lowercase.

133
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:39,450
And also we can like start things with SDP on a stick of this.

134
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,760
What are the protocols?

135
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,410
Valid protocols?

136
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,030
Just this s.

137
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:51,960
The notes are secured and this without us is simply hypertext transfer protocol.

138
00:11:52,380 --> 00:12:00,020
So yes, we are like a modified to the you are at least very valid are not now.

139
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,420
Format of the URL is going to be checked and using and try and get the exception.

140
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,600
Handling return you are in is not null.

141
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,950
Then ratified you are in is to be added with the new you are in.

142
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,140
And the argument also say so.

143
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:25,200
But as if like there is any exception, they all is not valid, then things is going to be like stop

144
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,410
and it is going to really turn on.

145
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:38,190
So make sure that you are in specify the phone so like you are and should contain a file like you can

146
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,630
paste any lame, which is not containing anything.

147
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:49,350
So we have to like check that whether this link has a file attached to it or not.

148
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:58,800
So yes, this is going to check whether the user is verified in all of these are not like modifying

149
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,990
the download other format of the UI and specifies the file whether they want to specify the file or

150
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,230
not.

151
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:11,620
And then after all this, we are going to return the verified you on.

152
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:18,600
So this is the total process of modifying the unknown, whether it is valid or not.

153
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:27,120
Now after this, if suppose everything is modified, either download has started successfully now.

154
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,620
After this supposedly select specific you are it specific is selected in order to perform any part.

155
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,890
So this part is for that.

156
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,860
We have to like check the back over there.

157
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,620
The selection is that to be made is not a null, then only we can perform.

158
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,150
That got us so if not glaring.

159
00:13:50,430 --> 00:14:01,320
So this if statement signifies that we have to add a clearing like suppose this download is not cleared,

160
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:09,930
it is already present, then only we can add like receive notifications from it, like whether it is

161
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:15,180
downloading that that is, then error or the download has completed.

162
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:21,030
So these are the specific notifications we are supposed to receive now.

163
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,350
Pause or assume cancel on clear functionality.

164
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:34,140
That added, here we have created a POS function similarly for the resume and for cancer, and clearly

165
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,880
so these three are like working in a similar way.

166
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:46,500
But the difference that I had in the clear button in the by default, the cladding was set two floors

167
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:46,950
above.

168
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,300
We have discussed it.

169
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:53,970
So for clearing, we have to set the Boolean clearing object total rule.

170
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,930
Then we have to like enable that clear button.

171
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,720
Once that guns are like.

172
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:06,020
Once the download is selected and it is cancelled, then only this buttons becomes enabled.

173
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:12,650
And yes, so we are going to like certain clear that's the specific selection.

174
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,840
A specific selected rule is only going to be cleared, not all the rules.

175
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,180
So yes, we can clear one brew at a time, not multiple roles at.

176
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,780
So once they're selected, row is cleared.

177
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:33,890
Then again, the clearing boolean object is set to force and everything is like back to normal.

178
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:40,550
Selected download is again sectional now, in order to clear something else, we have to again select

179
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,190
and one.

180
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:49,280
Then this null will set to like a specific item and then we can perform all the actions pause, resume,

181
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,560
play around, cancel everything.
