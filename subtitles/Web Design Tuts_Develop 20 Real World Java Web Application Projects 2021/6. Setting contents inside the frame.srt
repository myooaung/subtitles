1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:09,840
So by far, we have covering the contents inside the frame like we have been clear things, the contents

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:19,520
of the frame by initializing the frame, our furniture settings panel inside of me like attaching to

3
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,250
it, we have set the background color to the panel.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,810
Like initially, we have to see if we can take a look like this is de panel van.

5
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,610
This is the first panel.

6
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,390
Now this is the second where it is.

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,520
So we have three panels.

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,170
This is third panel and above it we have the second panel.

9
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:52,920
So in total, we have three panels below and up, like buttons attached to all of the all three of them

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,990
and all that.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,790
See, four buttons are functional like we have actually.

12
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:05,250
It's not attached to that button and some event is going to be performed after clicking on that specific

13
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:05,760
button.

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:14,010
So now let's take a look at the window of running the program and check whether everything is working

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,420
fine now or there are any exceptions.

16
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,490
So let's take a look at the function.

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,080
So getting to this tried on in Java and waiting for the program to execute.

18
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,720
So yes, we have our theme.

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,080
We can maximize it, minimize it.

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:41,790
As I already told you, that the frame is like the size of it so we can decide this and it will adjust

21
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,750
accordingly.

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,860
So yes, so we have three panels.

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,890
We already talked about it like the three panels have been attached and then this is and one.

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,830
This is between two and this is the entry.

25
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,940
And if they click like by default, that equals signal.

26
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:11,280
His keyword was responsible for starting the game with the X character initially.

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:21,440
So if I click here, I am getting X symbol with red color and the font size, then I'll find a way and

28
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,260
a specific font style, which means that in that program.

29
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,040
So the first to Martin is working perfectly fine now, taking a look at the second one.

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,770
So after the excess chance, the chance transfers automatically to or in the next button.

31
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,200
And similarly, for the third, then that chance is transferred to X.

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:54,510
So our tell all three panels are theater, three buttons are created, an action, listeners are attached

33
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,230
to those.

34
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,760
But then this negatively.

35
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,510
But what is going to happen after the click of the button?

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:07,290
So like one by one, we have covered all the panels and the voters are looking at that.

37
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:15,270
We have already set the font style that font, the bold light weight of the font and everything.

38
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:28,010
So in total, we have like 15 buttons in the or like frame, so we have to set total 15 banners and

39
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,550
number 10 attached to them.

40
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,600
And then actually it's not attached to that, but this respectively.

41
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:41,280
Now that after completing that three panel, successfully getting into the fourth panel configuration

42
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:49,740
and this is responsible for creating like a new panel and we have some dimensions to the panel, some

43
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:58,050
colors on that panel is added to the frame, of course, for the functioning and panel for the layout

44
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:05,520
is two zero zero initially jailable and the fourth panel is not actually doing so.

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:16,920
The panel is responsible for like handling a label which is going to contain the score of the player.

46
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,060
So we have two panels for the score.

47
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,440
This is like the name of the player on this list for that school application.

48
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:34,470
So in this, we are covering the name part like the running this year will be get a clear idea about

49
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,630
what I am actually talking about.

50
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,030
So waiting for the execution soirÃ©es this panel is created.

51
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:49,530
This is a panel created right now and this player is containing a text called Player X.

52
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:59,160
And this is going to be this thing and this is going to be in our raw and handling the score off.

53
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,700
Lyrics, so we are done with this.

54
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:10,260
Now we will close this and try to, like add this similar thing for flair also.

55
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:17,460
After which we will look at the score of Nation Bloc also for vote of the players.

56
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,890
OK, so you may be wondering that why I said this is the panel.

57
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:31,750
So x count six columns like this is going to count the score of the player next and I am setting it

58
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,320
2.10 to like column in the row.

59
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,680
As we have nine britnell columns.

60
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,730
It is Zone four, the chances to be played by both the players.

61
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:52,270
So this is going to be placed like this here after the nine blocks so that this a player playing like

62
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,870
Ronaldo will not get affected by the score.

63
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,280
This is a separate thing like this nine and this six separate thing.

64
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,710
They are outside the window.

65
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:16,690
They are not going to be changed by the players anyway after this, like similarly adding, we have

66
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,590
successfully added banners now.

67
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:28,210
After this, we are going to are like taking into consideration that how the chances of the players

68
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,980
are shifting after each player played chants.

69
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:45,490
So far this we will be going to initialize up, then calling it Delbarton forward and New Martin for

70
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,260
that, of course.

71
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:58,050
Initially, the button is going to contain empty string, and inside this, we are going to like an

72
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:06,270
actual listeners so that bartend floor is going to consist action last night and we are going to add

73
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:14,780
actually similar to now, but then we are going to choose it from this side of cost and new action list

74
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,100
that is going to be placed.

75
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,140
So our action is not.

76
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,740
Listener.

77
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,080
Yes.

78
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:35,210
So we have our listener for the weekend, for and after which we are going to like create the function,

79
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,310
initialize the function of calls.

80
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,370
Now this is something.

81
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,950
We have placed this at the wrong place, I think.

82
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:46,730
Yes.

83
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,470
So there was a bracket.

84
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,870
Missing, we have to place this here now again, creating the same, but that.

85
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,160
And this is this is not our channel is not an issue that be in for.

86
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,410
And what actually it is doing.

87
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:12,800
So this public wanted action performed function, which contains action events at zero as the argument

88
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:21,560
and the action attached to the event, like me are calling the button savvy event and what event is

89
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,860
going to be performed on taking that again.

90
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,530
So the game is set to start in the initial stage.

91
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:37,730
By default, the game is going to start now without like escaping or closing when we will that close,

92
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,370
but then the game will be closed after that only.

93
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:49,520
So inside this if statement we have initially, like already set the first player eggs and the button

94
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,520
color is said yes, so before it is said to one initially.

95
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:02,840
So suppose that the first chances played that the fourth or like, let me show you yes.

96
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,790
So this is the fourth column for the button, be whatever we call it.

97
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,260
So when X is going to play, it stands head.

98
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:19,570
So we are setting off color to the font and we are implementing the I like.

99
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:27,530
The next spread is going to play that chance after that that only so before it is going to be placed

100
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:34,520
hat and I've of it, the chance is going to be played had not this place is implemented.

101
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,590
So we have already set conditions for return one we to be dancing.

102
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,460
Now we are done with 10 four and I is incremental.

103
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:54,380
So we have total after nine nine like guys from one to nine and already we are like implementing four.

104
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,370
I do four.

105
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:02,560
Now if as like suppose if zero is playing that, John said before supposedto is playing John chances.

106
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:10,130
Before we saw that color that will be reflected through the text is blue and before will reflect zero

107
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,820
like before will be starting zero at this place.

108
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,100
Like simulate this similar to this.

109
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,700
Yes.

110
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:26,270
And choose player winning game is gone after this like more than the minimum look like the chances to

111
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:26,820
be played.

112
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,910
To make a specific man.

113
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,970
So minimum four chances are we replaceable explained this chance.

114
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:35,440
OK?

115
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,550
And so you play resistance in the second chance and after which?

116
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,420
Expedition's now the next chance is transferred to zero.

117
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,400
So we have already covered like four blocks of specific specific.

118
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,150
Now the fifth, the chance is going to be like our decider.

119
00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:03,680
If no x has already placed in the column and only one is left for X to make it, then so we are going

120
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,230
to flatten winning game after this only.

121
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:13,310
And I suppose the X comes in and then the game will be over, X will win and the purple will appear.

122
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,500
That X means congratulations.

123
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:25,760
So now, in the similar way of everything for me, I have set conditions for Derby Day and five and

124
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:35,270
the panel is also up being like, Suppose we have a panel of 15 buttons, so one two three four five

125
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,830
six seven eight.

126
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:45,380
So what actually within six is so from the panel it is not like five six seven eight.

127
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:56,000
Like if panel is considering the lack of great layout of nine one nine one was covered in the frame

128
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,850
off panel and the panel asked that each one is going to be considered as per the six to be PM six.

129
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:12,320
So yes, we have within six and after we have initialize the panel ID.

130
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,810
So we are like setting boundaries and then we are setting buttons.

131
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,380
So initially we have three panels.

132
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,140
I i the program and showed it to you.

133
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,590
So we had three panels and three weapons.

134
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,440
Now we started incrementing that.

135
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:40,640
We made the button store 15 and the panel is still 15 or so, and each panel has about 10 attached to

136
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:40,850
it.

137
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,300
And that building is performing some specific tasks.

138
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,410
So we are like checking these nine families first.

139
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:57,010
Oppose the what are the actual takings of the games taking that if a player in the build up these this

140
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:04,480
side of it in the initial stages, if any player, even then only we are going to have the loss for

141
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:04,660
us.

142
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:13,250
So initially, we are going to like listen to the action of these nine blogs and these six are like,

143
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:20,800
Oh, we have our complete panel, but only six and nine, but those are going to win listen for making

144
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,300
up narrative.

145
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,100
So there are differences.

146
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,300
So we have our listeners attached to all the nine buttons.

147
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:37,090
Yes, we have a black line border alert and everything, but every panel and between all the actions

148
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:45,070
are, listen, we have got alerts for the X and no for the O's, and we are choosing the player every

149
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,120
time, like every time.

150
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,580
Action is in a sense, every time we are choosing a player.

151
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,320
So simple action is listen for the player that we are choosing the player at all.

152
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:04,960
And similarly, wait, the action is listen for we are choosing the Player X and this July there is

153
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,600
a function we have needed above here.

154
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,370
Oh, OK.

155
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,930
So it was created very early stage.

156
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,690
I think so.

157
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:22,960
Already it was Oh, let me find it for you all so that we can take a look.

158
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:24,940
OK, so head.

159
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,160
It was so like, we are choosing a player.

160
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,740
Initially, it was set to X, so by default, and if there's a chance, then zero is transferred to

161
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,030
the next round and as X is transferred to the next.

162
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:46,480
So we are calling this choose player again and again and after which we are calling this reni function

163
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,290
again and again.

164
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:54,970
So the winning function was taking into account a consideration what this near-death experience I noticed

165
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,540
earlier or once we discussed earlier.

166
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:05,010
So again and again, we are calling these two functions only inside of the action list of the weapons.

167
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:15,430
Now we will try to like run the program and see what the actual frame layout till now after completing

168
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,670
this part of the code.
