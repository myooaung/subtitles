00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.400
In previous tutorials, I told you about how we can create participants, I know and everything.

2
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.940
So after the adminis log in admin rights to create event no event name with coordinator, name coordinator,

3
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.850
no fee, venue date, etc., etc. So you can add your own things.

4
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.750
And so this depends on your scenario, your creation.

5
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.540
So for this case, you need to create one instrument so you can create one.

6
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.850
So let's file directly, but simple case you can create one instrument.

7
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.850
So as I told you as well, these are the event details and everything.

8
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.780
So.

9
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:49.430
After the participle adminis log in, so I created one page name as admin event page basically like

10
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.600
for creating and accepting everything from the admin.

11
00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:05.260
So in this this is and these are the main event page event, written speech and inside this admin event

12
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.670
page, what it shows, it shows event dates and transaction details.

13
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.640
So this is very simple I created with links.

14
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.240
So for the event details, I need to create one even detail which shows the creative wrangling and beauty

15
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.750
wrangling.

16
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.470
So these are again, the links to for the creative wrangling.

17
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.980
As I told you create e dot, I created one for me.

18
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.010
So this is a very important step here.

19
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.960
So for this purpose, what I created, I created a one form method.

20
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.350
What is the form inside these shoes, I already told you?

21
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:50.870
Then I'm going to use one name as event as you can see event here and today's post again with even no

22
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.250
event name coordinator, no coordinator name everything fee for registration venue for the event date

23
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.730
of event.

24
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.370
So I'm considering this all as a string, not I'm considering anything you can consider as some date

25
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.950
for native feeling as equal to that.

26
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.660
So for that purpose, you need to change into the database connection and everything.

27
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.640
So this is a very simple case I'm choosing here.

28
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.290
So this is just creating one form inside H.M. and action is active.

29
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.570
So for the storing purposes, what I'm going to create, I'm going to create one package.

30
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.880
So incentive source packages.

31
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.250
So as I told you, what is Java so late?

32
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.410
So similarly like that we are going to create Java Servlet.

33
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.320
But before that, I'm going to tell you some methods or in, so let so let interfaces.

34
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.680
Then the leaves, the connection and et cetera.

35
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.580
So this create the email we just created one form activate.

36
00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.380
So before that, you need to create one a able order database for an event.

37
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.580
I'm going to tell you about that also, but I will add some images of creation of evil and everything

38
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.950
inside.

39
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.190
So before that, let's see what is the Julie Bishop connection and.

40
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.910
We already gone through how we can create the GBC connection, but we don't know about the basic scenario

41
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.870
reading this.

42
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.250
So for this purpose, I'm going to tell you the basic scenario about Julie Bishop connection.

43
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.800
So as I told you, we have already gone through with great enforcement in Java, so.

44
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.190
So these are the main methods inside the Java.

45
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.090
But we can use some other solid interfaces also like solar interfaces.

46
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.680
What are this?

47
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.230
Old interfaces basically object obsolete request is used to provide the client request information to

48
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.900
such as content type, content length parameter names.

49
00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.520
Value added information attribute means the information that you just type on the page or a similar

50
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.500
scenario or a female form we can use.

51
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.900
So let's request for that.

52
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.310
So like, there are several different methods for so let interfaces like mixing it parameter is one

53
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.750
method parameter value.

54
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.230
This one method enumeration with get parameter names maternel means it will go to the parameter names

55
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.160
for that purpose.

56
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.700
Get Len to then characters, including extraction.

57
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.950
So there are two main emitters already created.

58
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.580
These are the by default methods so we can see default method inside this.

59
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.860
So this is all about not so let request interfaces.

60
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.010
So what is basically a request dispatcher?

61
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.280
And this method was, I will tell you later, but before that, let's see what is universal connection?

62
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.290
So do you stand for Java database connectivity?

63
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.110
JTBC's the Java API to connect and execute query letter to the database.

64
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:06.280
So GBC is a very stable API since the database on Java are deployed daily because very standard Java

65
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.760
API.

66
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.110
We are going to use here.

67
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.930
So for different databases like MySchool has a different guidebook than Oracle at different, really

68
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.350
busy for the deployment on the servers.

69
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.740
Postgres is also used or different nowadays.

70
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.080
MongoDB is also used for that purpose, so they have some different delivery connection drivers we can

71
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.620
use.

72
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:34.590
So what we are using or JTBC's, Oracle, Judy, we see APM is so inside that Oracle GDC Java API.

73
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.470
No statement is full statements and it is already written so widely.

74
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.660
Just we are writing this.

75
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.200
It will also use the Java Sea connection.

76
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.190
So it is.

77
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:53.230
Java is the standard edition part and Julie Bishop uses duty drivers to clean the database.

78
00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:01.060
So now always remember there are four bits of Julie Bishop drivers or all these drivers, which are

79
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.490
basically we are using either the bridge connecting drivers.

80
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:10.030
So as we are using localhost, we are using this native drivers to basically specify to the specific

81
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.720
databases.

82
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:19.000
So our cases arrival database, but it's not all native driver because these are some all these drivers

83
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.440
and need to what it means.

84
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:27.210
If you created some dedicated database on your different database on some or all storage, then it's

85
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.940
an attitude driver.

86
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.650
We are a network protocol driver and teen driver are going to use.

87
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.490
So again, there are two types like we are also using Teen Driver also for that.

88
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.630
Not only the British driver, we are also using the teen driver.

89
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:48.510
Train driver means it had some minimum requirements and some minimalistic or simple dollar database

90
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.060
connection.

91
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:57.300
So we can use the Java, the Liberty Bell to extend their time alerted us to it in the relational databases.

92
00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.730
So we are going to use relational databases.

93
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.260
Other than that, one motive is very advanced database, which is a new school and everything.

94
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:11.610
So we are going to see updated page data from the database to the jury to see how the judiciary works,

95
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.060
actually.

96
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.210
So this is Julie Wikipedia.

97
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.430
This is our job application database.

98
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.930
So, Julie Bishop, yeah.

99
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.270
So to the job application, we are accessing what delivery driver for the database and Julie Bishop.

100
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.590
So this is very simple.

101
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:33.060
So for the delivery of Oracle database, I already told you we have to create one driver class first

102
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.850
or to access everything here.

103
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:44.820
Then we have to always remember that these oracle Julie Bishop Travel, not Oracle driver, then our

104
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.930
connection you are in connection.

105
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.290
You are in for Oracle Danger database.

106
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.610
You are to use these local laws with that portable power number.

107
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.850
Now, do you remember this word?

108
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.340
No, is always we always see oracle service name and everything.

109
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.600
So you can check for that information.

110
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.960
DNS names dot audit.

111
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.090
That's a file inside the database file.

112
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:15.780
You can always, always find these information if your code is different for a localized user name for

113
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.670
it is very important.

114
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.760
Before this system, I'm going to use your default username.

115
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.310
You can create your own user.

116
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.580
You can do the password on some.

117
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.270
Before that, I already told you how you can change the report of database.

118
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:33.820
We have to execute this thing for changing the world would always remember if you change the board,

119
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.960
you have to see these fine DNS names.

120
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.480
Not what if aliens are in this to check your power number to change the condition you are in?

121
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.910
And some other than that, you can change the glasses.

122
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:54.670
So for this project, I saw the error that your mostly glass fisher bodies cannot be deployed because

123
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.350
it's using same port as Oracle is also using it.

124
00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:05.980
Port and Google Glass, which is also using a duty port, will be changed either for Lake or for the

125
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.290
Oracle database or the glass server.

126
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:14.700
So the changing the glass feature, it is very easy just to go to that config file and change it.

127
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:21.880
I already told you in the previous some lectures that how you can change this or to another.

128
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.160
So I am going to use 2002 World in Black with silver.

129
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.540
But before this, if you don't want to change that board, you're going to change in this port.

130
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:38.690
Also using this greedy executives and do they distribute new political activity basically to 2002?

131
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.030
Go to change this port.

132
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.950
But again, remember, you're putting this into the connection.

133
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:52.260
You know, before that, you should know how we can create a bill and how you are inserting data, how

134
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.110
you're teaching basic school basics things here.

135
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.790
So this is all about the GBC.

136
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:05.210
So let us know how we can create the O form or how we can execute this form.

137
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.200
So let's see how we can see this.

138
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:15.490
So we already created this part for the form they're using create event H.M. and we are going to an

139
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.140
event in next year in the beach.

140
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.360
Our money from the stimulus bill to the data is so simple method.

141
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:31.510
I'm going to use first in all the libraries first, which is basically employed in both Java and all

142
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:38.950
Java School and so little empties, then public class activities deemed to be sold, which extends to

143
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.400
that activity.

144
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.030
So this is called into.

145
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.660
You can say we are extending the estimate, so let's.

146
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.190
Plus, we do default method or default plus.

147
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.010
So I'm going to use your again public word Duplass.

148
00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:01.240
You can either use to get also here, but I'm using too many things or I am going to sell too many things

149
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.460
and do great method will restrict me for some time or some cases.

150
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.640
So I'm going to have to use do placement.

151
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.300
Always remember, you have to create some -- request and then actually be response.

152
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.930
So let response, which is also an index option.

153
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:23.610
So you have to handle the exhibition also, you then you have to create responsible content.

154
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.750
A store statement, I told you the significance of this again telling you that you are writing some

155
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.460
extremely taxing in Java.

156
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.680
So what it will do, I want.

157
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.770
If the event is added, I want to show the event added theme or event today of all things.

158
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:45.090
So what we are going to do, I'm going to invoke some tags like issue statement.

159
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:52.820
But by using these tags, it will show me the really adamant in saying that it will show for the full

160
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.780
day not accurate, but it's a visual bug.

161
00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.800
We can see so for that purpose, said content is fixed or extremely so.

162
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.320
Java will take care that this is the achievement tag.

163
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.550
So when you present on that external page?

164
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:15.140
Or if you see a text showing it says there takes a page for print, right, that for the response,

165
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.590
get ready to go all these numbers.

166
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:26.390
Now I'm going to fetch the data from the original page from Beijing, data from a steel mill.

167
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:32.660
Then again, I'm telling always remember these names and these names should be always same.

168
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.100
These are all things.

169
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:44.940
Connection with database, again, we already have seen for the long way we have to use the trial because.

170
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.440
It make you do some insulator, so we have to handle it, so you can either specify this and say like

171
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.810
this also throws exception, so little exception, crop circle exception.

172
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.720
But I don't want to explain everything, so this is using tools.

173
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:10.720
It will not show me the property in a so for showing the property other than for the property ring or

174
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.860
error handling or exception handling.

175
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:20.930
I'm going to use your try to return to class, not for the new ruling class in connection, string name,

176
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:27.110
username, then connection, but I want a manager to establish the connection.

177
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.430
I will again commend this, but also establish connection.

178
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.200
You can either put some outdoor print in statement also here.

179
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:47.350
That is system total internet connection is successful in everything, but you have to take all the

180
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.620
command from inside your ID or you are executing well part.

181
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.430
So I don't want to check everything again.

182
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.280
So statement, I'm going to create one statement.

183
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.870
So to insert these into the event database.

184
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:08.810
The Dow already created inside this insert this into the event, did I miss what I'm going to do?

185
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.330
I'm going to insert into event.

186
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.760
What do they lose?

187
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.790
So I'm going to insert these values.

188
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:22.310
So I'm putting it one eight two eight three eight four eight seven two did this, and I'm going to insert

189
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:22.910
this.

190
00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:29.160
Similarly, like we are going to insert in our log in page or sign up each of the participants.

191
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:37.880
Similarly, like that, I'm going to use this event A2, A3, A4 if you and A6 insulin.

192
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:45.530
I'm going to always remember to close this with semicolon, then research, settlement equity and all

193
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.110
things, including the database.

194
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:53.120
I'm going to include this event title statement and it should remain on the same page.

195
00:14:53.990 --> 00:15:02.450
Then System Dot println to bring this to the oh come on from that added to the database permitting that

196
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:10.510
because it will go in that binder, so it will not show any anomaly there and conduct close for look

197
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.390
losing the connection.

198
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.860
So that said, about how we can create this in for lower case, I'm going to tell you how we can create

199
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.330
transaction history and everything, but also what is the difference between including forward?

200
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.410
So let's see how we can create that part.
