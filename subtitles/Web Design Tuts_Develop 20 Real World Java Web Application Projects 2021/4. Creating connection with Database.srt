1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:09,780
So in previous seasons, I told you I'm bored, I created this session with some username.

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,910
Then suddenly part log out, but I'm with you.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,770
So I just started some mortgages before and I will tell you, what is this post?

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,520
So these is to just be, as you can see, there is nothing new.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,070
So the clear topic to create and upload is good on an attribute.

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,590
And please log in first.

7
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:40,930
If I log in or I'm just logging into this parameter topic an email, I have to send the email and which

8
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,580
is I'm going to perform this, which is basically select start and I'm going to stop.

9
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,670
So let me tell you what I'm going to do here.

10
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:55,810
So all this is all about this plus and Bob and Judy be sitting here.

11
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:03,100
So let me mention my password if you know your password you can use because defiantly, I'm just adding

12
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:09,840
this system and oracle system is username and password for low level database who give entry to the

13
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,750
Oracle database.

14
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:18,370
Still, I haven't created this part, so I need to mention this topic each and everything using the

15
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,270
my listening part.

16
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,450
But I will tell you when to do that back later.

17
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,800
So this does seem to.

18
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:34,690
Then let me show you the deleting is deleting is also similar, I be because I changed it to the my

19
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,140
team.

20
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,820
So this is all about to delete that part.

21
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,940
Then for the discussion part also.

22
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,800
These are all things you'll following the discussion.

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,080
So I'm just adding some random text to your question each and every time you.

24
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:01,100
So this is all about how I'm going to develop this, you.

25
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,700
OK, so.

26
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,710
Let me show you the phone following a plane.

27
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,730
So basically, my name is to find the username here.

28
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,880
Oh, and this is the oracle you need to understand this is these things.

29
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,210
So you are in or we going to drive our team here.

30
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:33,060
And this is where my people sit and select Styrofoam is something to create and all the things I'm going

31
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,600
to check here.

32
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,810
Then the finding is also similar.

33
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,740
I in my first full year, I haven't created any table internet, but I'm using Java file only to create

34
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,200
this and I will tell you how to do this.

35
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,120
So when name one is for finding the name, so all the teams are having some useful things here.

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,690
As you can see, this is very similar to this, but there are more usefulness for this that I will tell

37
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,640
you in later about

38
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,370
each find him as having their own functions.

39
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,000
But I will tell you what is the significance of this in little?

40
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,540
To remember that for printing each name, you don't need to create each things.

41
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:31,170
But while developing this, I understood that for checking from different, different aspects from country

42
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,480
I or find from state, I need to create this instance.

43
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,370
This link form finding the insert.

44
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:48,910
I need to create this through the image, so I need to create another frame here because I don't want

45
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,830
to mentioning the.

46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,530
So let me say this first.

47
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,970
Close this close, because these things are over.

48
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,680
As you can see, these are all the teams here.

49
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:13,320
And when I just arrived this, so I need to add one library here, so I'm just not.

50
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,070
Let me add John on for Libya.

51
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,630
Once they see it, we roll to this place.

52
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,270
So let me go to my played here.

53
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,680
So it is that is this?

54
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,020
In all equality, that is.

55
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,880
I am having this you or.

56
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,720
This is idiotically looking, so I will be open.

57
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,380
This will open, Judy, you see.

58
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,350
It will take time to load.

59
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:56,920
Yeah.

60
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,470
As you can see, this is loading nearly 14 percent.

61
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,830
So you can use this part.

62
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,300
So as you can see, this is loaded now.

63
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:07,830
So we.

64
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,440
With for education, these.

65
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,710
So again.

66
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,250
So instead of doing this again and again, you can create one another job, I failed to mention this

67
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,860
part, but I'm doing it again and again.

68
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,990
More than one quarter, if you forget some still to get in for each and everything and adding here,

69
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,540
if you want to add some more power in your plane, you can add this.

70
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:50,150
So I didn't do this by just for backup, but you can see these all the things with some, including

71
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,180
part and is nothing.

72
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,610
But I might even win here in one file.

73
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:04,250
Beautiful tool for this purpose logo just for each and everything I'm adding so that suitable who added

74
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,770
Let's create one user noted here.

75
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,480
So what is the listener to?

76
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,970
Is just basically to create one or two.

77
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:19,490
We can say, create all the teams here like this creating not creating only the solid.

78
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,920
I need to create everything here.

79
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,750
So let me do this.

80
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,220
Well.

81
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:31,920
So.

82
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,610
No, I don't want to practice.

83
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:42,700
So what I'm going to do is I went to Atlanta, Georgia, classing default package, which is basically

84
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,180
sold.

85
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,190
Mentioning the Soviet name as this might, so that you can add the package you.

86
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,890
OK, so we've seen we highly recommend do not add this, so let me handle this.

87
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,830
It may create one package instead of creating the wreckage.

88
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,190
Let me create one dollar package here.

89
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,600
Oh, the dollar packages must be confirmed.

90
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,780
Great finish.

91
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,070
So.

92
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:25,550
This let me add one, so let me miss my solid mechanics, and I have this information to examine so

93
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,560
it will take time to learn everything.

94
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,320
And once this is done, you then you're going to have this done.

95
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,510
As you can see, OK, so this is done.

96
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:46,790
What I'm going to do is I'm losing despite maintaining and I'm doing this and this and this because

97
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,570
I don't want to put everything in.

98
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,620
Let me import some in cold Java export.

99
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:09,840
Not Stern, then in all job on the school.

100
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,810
Don't start.

101
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,350
So I'm going to add these plates.

102
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,370
Oh no, let me create one public class.

103
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,650
Public.

104
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,070
Glass.

105
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,900
My.

106
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,590
Listen or give me more time.

107
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,400
OK, in my listener implements.

108
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,350
Oh, no.

109
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,640
I need one thing here.

110
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,370
Oh, vital.

111
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,710
I need to create implementation using solar.

112
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,630
I don't want to put that everything, electric and everything.

113
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,530
I'm going to use it.

114
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,980
No, but I don't want to put that to the requisite responsibility.

115
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,410
What I can do, I can earn directly here, so let.

116
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,000
Context listener, so which is need to but.

117
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,600
So.

118
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:26,060
It will take care of these families, so it's not abstract.

119
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,840
OK, so currently it's not an effect.

120
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,230
So what I can do is I can implement that all abstract methods later.

121
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,710
So I will tell you what, I'm going to do this and everything here.

122
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,630
But let me add a one year team.

123
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,060
Because it's there isn't one, because I need to build on the material.

124
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,990
Public word this.

125
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:53,570
Mr.

126
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,770
And on looking cited.

127
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,670
So it's saying that.

128
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:20,440
Error is not shown, do not override with context, so little context, event or anything, so I need

129
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,010
to create this class all data.

130
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,290
So you can create abstract last here like this.

131
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,580
You can mention this.

132
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,040
So this is the one thing here, I just want to mention.

133
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,470
And let me create the one connection.

134
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:52,710
Then I need to mention string user equality, his team, Ginger, for the Oracle database.

135
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,480
Then I need to mention string boss.

136
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,150
Phosphine, be my database.

137
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,550
Do this.

138
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:13,780
Okay, so I'm going to create, but let me create one glass for me each and every time because I won't

139
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,030
mention the right block here.

140
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,770
Give me 11.

141
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,800
Look also.

142
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,920
Exception.

143
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:27,810
He.

144
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,140
The student loan on board bring Alan.

145
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,750
S..

146
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,330
He selected I'm no going to mention it would be like Glass falling, which I already created.

147
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:05,960
Then on, I'm going to create a one connection here on the sequel to try to manage everything and mention.

148
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:14,620
So I don't want to waste time in this, so what you can do is, oh, I already created here somewhere

149
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,460
in the new fine.

150
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,100
Can you just review?

151
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:31,870
OK.

152
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:38,470
So instead of using this word again, mentioned India, because this is a direct question and I want

153
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,790
to create a strict India for what I can use and destroy.

154
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,320
You grandpa's because he's a leftist icon.

155
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,380
He was very clear.

156
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,770
So this is all about who I can perform this.

157
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,530
So let me add some prepared statements and create everything you.

158
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,680
So new all the time and great.

159
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,880
I mean, I thought, well, I'm going to.

160
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:23,310
So these are the things which I'm going to have to get nuclear settlement, execute update on the table

161
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,920
so you can create one sequence here, each and everything.

162
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:34,220
I'm going to create your way to replace some trivial to some, it's all the thing here.

163
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,370
So this is all about who I'm creating here.

164
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,200
If you want to add one more thing, you can add another things here.

165
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:46,630
OK.

166
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,250
Let me please, as this is.

167
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:55,150
So let me add one more thing here, which is basically to update everything you.

168
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,670
Okay, so let me add one more mental.

169
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:12,400
The show casualties are deployed and deployed, so that's who I can, and this is my listening part.

170
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,560
So they're suitable to work and apply their triggers.

171
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:25,210
So this isn't about this process, and my estimate is just for creating or replacing their trigger creating

172
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,350
table, which is basically as you can see this for re registration.

173
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,440
And if you have seen this, you can see this forum.

174
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:39,160
I don't see how they or you can see everything here is I'm going to create through this project.

175
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:40,850
My listen.

176
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,910
So what you can do, you can execute this post and you're going to mention this or what you can do,

177
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:53,910
you can directly run this place or you can directly run this on your site and you can develop this so

178
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:59,990
infertility that I'm going to create on you to run this file directly, my listener Java.

179
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,300
So help you understand this part.

180
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,190
I will do everything in the whole world.

181
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,030
Displayed everything.

182
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,250
All these parts and next part, I'm going to tell you, what is the next thing I'm going to use you?
