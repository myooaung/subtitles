1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:12,780
We have already seen that how are we going to set up this project for online quiz project for GSP?

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,040
So it's very simple.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:21,900
You have to just create the project inside your ID with the Java Virgin Enterprise Edition origin.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:32,310
I'm going to use your arrival database glass office server for all or database connections, then deployment

5
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,000
on the server.

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,910
So before proceeding, I'm going to tell some important part regarding to this.

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:48,720
So what I created agenda in this HTML for the loading page loading landing page, I will add on to your.

8
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,630
Landing.

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,180
Beach, so this is our landing page.

10
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:05,490
I also ordered some boot straps, courses and then some images here already, and I changed this part.

11
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,240
So as you can see for admin, admin, log in just we have to create student log.

12
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,260
So in this version, we are going to see how we can do this.

13
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,270
So this is very simple.

14
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,700
And this started with seven cases.

15
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,390
You can see when things are created here in websites and everything you can see here.

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:39,570
So packages, then all things libraries also added some or all things related to this part.

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:46,980
So this is all about how we can create how we can set about it.

18
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:58,200
But before proceeding with our project, I'm going to specify some simple Java solid concepts and some

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,490
just concepts also.

20
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,520
So let's see what is the Java solid?

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,680
So Java Servlet is nothing but technology in Java, which used to create the web application.

22
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,590
So, so it is a Java API.

23
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,970
Which is application programming interface, basically, which provides many interfaces and classes,

24
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,250
including with the documentation part, any written source of documentation is already written.

25
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,870
So what is the Java so?

26
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:33,650
So you have written the external code and you want to put the data from that data.

27
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:41,990
This means you are assuming from data or your anything on the front and back to back in order you have

28
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,250
to able to do so.

29
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,950
So for writing the logic behind this, we are going to use your Java solid.

30
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,090
So.

31
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,350
So we let the user interface must be implemented for creating any solid.

32
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,230
And so it is also class which extends the capabilities of the servers which respond to requests.

33
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,680
So you can see that we are already running on the request and response types.

34
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:15,560
Similarly, so is so work to improve this regarding like databases and estimate part.

35
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,280
So, so it is a web component that deployed on the server, not on your client machine is deployed on

36
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,890
the server park to create dynamic web pages.

37
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,960
So what is the static and dynamic static means?

38
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,930
You are watching some part and it's static.

39
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:38,960
There is nothing is changing or you can see it is not showing content again and again, it's not updating.

40
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,310
So it's static.

41
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:47,480
Like you have created one university information page in the static without showing the card information

42
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,530
page static.

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:56,360
But if you want to add at some part in that information using not using only the code, you have to

44
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,520
use some simple text to do that.

45
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Or I can say on the website you tell your how to write.

46
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,930
You are going to see is that dynamic with pages?

47
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,960
It's updating, so it's dynamically pages.

48
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:20,120
So how so works, actually the source of little on request and expense line sense response to server

49
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,590
and server response generated, and it's moved to the client.

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,450
So it's just like a copy of that part and saying to the client.

51
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,590
So, so we let you this request, dispatcher, so request, especially the interface, provides the

52
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,690
facility of respecting the request from another source given so little GST.

53
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,370
So what is the GST?

54
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,150
Basically, just be the Java servlet pages, as you can see.

55
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,720
So-so GSP contains all the things in further part.

56
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,940
I'm going to shoot so late and this people also.

57
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,180
But before that, we'll do the difference between so late and this is so let's not do your job afterwards.

58
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,600
There is nothing inside.

59
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,640
It's like you can add a steel mill course without all that part.

60
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,390
But this being so late are both different.

61
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,120
So, so it is just for connection, but more than just we just you can visualize.

62
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,330
You can create design, also using scissors and instrument.

63
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,730
So this is an interface also used to include content from other resources.

64
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,320
So it's a one way also servlet collaboration, or you can say there are two methods forward and include

65
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:42,270
forward to forward requests from solar to another resource, or includes all content of citizens from

66
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,500
Lake.

67
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,460
You have to add in to the same results you are using my.

68
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,980
Or do you want to forwarded to something you have to use for over?

69
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:59,790
Then I told you forward, like for automated request, whose gender did it seems to solve one created

70
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:06,680
the response for automated was instant, so led to I can see or I can suggest B or anything.

71
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,370
And under this one time to the client.

72
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,230
Similarly, for the included method of what is done, it's up again.

73
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,230
So let's say you are created to two soldiers are created or considered which emails are created or to

74
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,310
issuing statements.

75
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:29,600
We can create, which includes in the same page responses, generate similar responses and send to the

76
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,020
client.

77
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,500
So, so less important parts of the estimates, this is just as pretty.

78
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,910
Davos on program for biking and logical.

79
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,720
Not accessible for control.

80
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,720
That's it for this overlooked important part.

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,900
So as you can, if you have seen the Soviet curse, you can see it, Steve Mills added in so July.

82
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:53,990
OK.

83
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,740
Is it is it?

84
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,700
They didn't say Gela.

85
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:05,110
In GSP, what is we are going to insult Java language and say this Jamila pages, so you can see it's

86
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,270
like scripting language where it's pure Java language, so a Java, so litigious.

87
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,340
So jsp use technology is used to create web application just like solar technology.

88
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:24,370
But what is the difference between these are so let's are only job quotes, but just be as person which

89
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:32,680
contain some Java language so it can be part of an extension of it, you can see, but it provides more

90
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,060
functionality then.

91
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,030
So such as some expression languages, GSD and there are some gestural technology also you can use.

92
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,460
So this BBH concerns experimental tags.

93
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,750
Some DSP tags.

94
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,550
Also, GSP beaches are easier to win than you have to always remember that these are very easier to

95
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,180
maintain, you no need to take for every step.

96
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:03,170
Again and again in GSP, and it's providing some additional features like expedition language and custom

97
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:03,470
decks.

98
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,360
So let us see how we can create this space inside our ID.

99
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,680
So this is my idea I already created.

100
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,590
So, so if I could just convince all your packages, but before that, in good to the web pages, you're

101
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:26,920
just right, click here clicking you and you can see is, you know, just be.

102
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,940
Hope you can see the G-spot here.

103
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,970
One to right click here, click new and just be.

104
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,290
Click here.

105
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:46,920
You can see all the entity collapsing, but to just be back, so specify the name for these ones that

106
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,000
another dialog box is basically created when you are doing this.

107
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:58,630
So for me, let me close this and let me check what is OK.

108
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,710
I'm going to copy this part basically because my name is this.

109
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:12,120
Once this is done on your books, on the pages, senators and banks, will you?

110
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,610
You have to do anything.

111
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,090
Oh, then click finish.

112
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,120
So it will take time to create one day prepared, as you can see, just be pages created.

113
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,420
Let me cancel this because.

114
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,410
And.

115
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,300
OK, so this is our GST push.

116
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,480
Let us build our budget.

117
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:51,280
Let us see how it's so clean and first then I'm going to change here because I want to create some in

118
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,750
form.

119
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,380
We can say I want to create here.

120
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,800
So that is lost cleaning, Bill.

121
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,230
If your windows are not saying I'll put windows in watching, go to this and click or output, you can

122
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,210
see really successful.

123
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,280
Now let us run our project.

124
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,080
So it will take time to order the glasses server first thing when you are entering the first thing because

125
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,050
Java hotspot.

126
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:25,410
So what we aim is running, so we take time to load their tool and deploy all the pages on that server.

127
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,970
But once it is done.

128
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:33,750
No need to again and again executing this in the GST, as we are doing in Java, so that we are able

129
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,370
to again and again build that part.

130
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:43,430
No need to build that part again and again in just admittedly this one time and just you have to add

131
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,010
your code.

132
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,700
Then of all things are done, just click final.

133
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,460
And you can take.

134
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,980
So as you can see, it's taking time to honor.

135
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,700
So as you can see, all things are deploying.

136
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,550
So once you do done, you can see where this water is deployed.

137
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:49,190
You have is there delay of this loading because the water, then I'm using these images using through

138
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,220
your and I'm inserting some scissors.

139
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,100
So we already created this student page.

140
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,200
So when you play this, you can see the GSP pages loaded here.

141
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,300
Hello, world, which which we already created here, as you can see.

142
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,260
So just be patient we already created.

143
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,950
So I am going to change my career and I'm going to explain also that part.

144
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,260
So remember, these fees sometimes slow, then Java solid.

145
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:29,050
But as you can see, we can add some or exciting animations and things and say just as we have some

146
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,460
power to change all external codes using just.

147
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,380
So let's see how I'm going to change this part.

148
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,410
So, uh, let me.

149
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,270
Delivered this first.

150
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,650
This is ask for comment, but on.

151
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,710
So I'm just due to time constraint, I'm going to just use.

152
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,340
First, I may look cool in another file.

153
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:12,110
So I will explain that goal, but due to the angles and I'm not going to print, it's very big time

154
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,830
taking part.

155
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,240
So as you can see.

156
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,370
These are the H.M. quarters only.

157
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,540
Let me say this back to these other extremely girls only.

158
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,270
This, you would step see is this I'm adding and everything because for that purpose, I told you or

159
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:35,690
up I was then this is all about to see is this team move around this with student logging so.

160
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,780
What is this?

161
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:46,030
This more detail, and with this what I'm going to it's going to get parameters for the message, but

162
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,300
I it's certain that Hayden destroyed the grid.

163
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,210
So this is all about the large border.

164
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,300
Your username is invalid, your username is valid.

165
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:00,850
So after this party's done, I'm going to specify it means little to put this back.

166
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,070
So important part is this actually this information?

167
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,790
This is valid.

168
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,490
It's students.

169
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,080
And what is this all?

170
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,500
Yes.

171
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,040
So I'm going to create that part with valid student.

172
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:19,420
So this action just I'm specifying this controller and everything, but I'm going to change that part

173
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,900
because for previous purposes, I just created this.

174
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,630
But later, I will change that.

175
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,010
Also.

176
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,010
So validate student and all things here.

177
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,890
You can change as your requirement.

178
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:42,210
So this is all about this and the location basically now what is the location each area, which is basically

179
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,140
on click event.

180
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,350
Or to exit that part.

181
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,100
So let us see what is deployed by now.

182
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,520
On the go and click reload.

183
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,170
So let's go to the long information.

184
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:08,200
So as you can see, our student log in is been when not once I click it, what is happening?

185
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,980
It's going to the first page, no letters logging in.

186
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,590
So it's not.

187
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,560
I'm created, though, for their page here.

188
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,290
So if you would name your addition, it will show your user ID and password.

189
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,250
So this is all about the student logging in for the videos.

190
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:33,430
I'm going to tell you the GCP basics, then how we can create administrative page also, and some more

191
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,580
information about GCP.

192
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:43,450
And once this is done, I'm going to use some Gallup polls also to validate, as you can see, you're

193
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,820
using directly this validated student.

194
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:52,570
So I have to use some methods validate students and things to.

195
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,160
Create and regulate that part also.
