WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.150
In previous part, we already set up our project.

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.480
We already created one in desert H.M. and some boots at.

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.990
We'd see us also, as you can see.

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.810
So we need to create one just before Stewart and Logan and for long.

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.370
So you can use your email also.

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:27.350
But if I am using DSP, handling the job is very simple, also very convenient, and you can customize

7
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.340
it easily.

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.420
So I'm going to add this to the analog in beach first.

9
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.120
As I told you, I already created this part.

10
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.480
Let me show you the student logging method.

11
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.160
So all these things are extremely tense, as you can see, these are extremely tense.

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.340
To this building.

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.760
Also, because these are all already seizures pardon on board.

14
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.860
So I don't want to include another this failure.

15
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.230
So I just but it's diluting here.

16
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.540
Say it's or just be patient.

17
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.090
You can easily use CSIS ish D.M. plus Java using this.

18
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.710
So this will be very helpful to create student log in peace as I created our duty.

19
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.350
So this is basically linked with state shoots and everything as we're going to see.

20
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.000
And that is student logging so many parties about all these things.

21
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.490
So it will bring this to the end logging and everything from calories read for which part.

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.250
So if I'm going to specify message this message later.

23
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.990
But what I'm doing this to parameter is not basically the there is something normally like for the username

24
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.490
or password are different.

25
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.780
It will show that that more username and password are incorrect.

26
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.390
So for that purpose, we can use this part.

27
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.370
So for displaying this, you can use Java program.

28
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.000
I'm using it, your program insert.

29
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.810
And so it is just slippage.

30
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.630
Similarly, for Welcome Orsomething message, I can put this using DSP.

31
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.800
I did this.

32
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.800
So another form action, are you dear?

33
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.940
So as you can see, this is very good student if I want to use default package and I will not mention

34
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.380
this, but Oyi is not controlled.

35
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.960
But what I'm going to do, I'm going to create some packages on LED examination system package.

36
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.220
So why I'm doing this, because for the database teaching and executing data, I will create another

37
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.280
four student and admin both different.

38
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.300
So let's then for validate students and validate that means I'm going to create another links for quiz

39
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.710
purposes.

40
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.400
I'm going to take one another.

41
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.430
So let also, though, it will create tremendous amount of what we can see.

42
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.910
So let's.

43
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.740
So using the for the package, it's not very helpful, but for the managing purpose, both fixing and

44
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.160
everything.

45
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.990
So for a nice project management, you should create packages within enter packages, meaningful use

46
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.980
of packages you can create.

47
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.780
So what is the controller convinced?

48
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.820
Controller contains all the controlling parts like log in, page, signup page, you read page, everything.

49
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:21.460
Though I mentioned it here later, I will create this part with the post and I created one format username.

50
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.470
We always remember this should be meaningful part and password this.

51
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.350
If I click it, it should go to exert extreme and otherwise it will go to the log part.

52
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.780
If I needed to and this correct.

53
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.850
So this is all about these things.

54
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.220
So we are done with student logging on then, and we know wouldn't just be, which is basically similar

55
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.210
to the student logging.

56
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.100
But remember, you log in with some another message I'm going to print and correction is validated.

57
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.110
So let us see what are the basics of GSP?

58
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.780
So GSP, as I told you, is nothing but a Java language and traditional base.

59
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.310
So GSP is used to create web applications just like Solis technology.

60
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.850
Oh, and it's very useful.

61
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.960
As you can see, I just can't connect the description to request or get parameter.

62
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:23.620
So as you can see, well, if you know the Java so laidback, if that request parameter is null, it

63
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.730
should bring back when you.

64
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.680
So its language is similar to Java, but there are some different things, as you can see.

65
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:39.340
So what is it I want to do so, despite all our advantages of this, these basically extension to our

66
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.120
so late so we can use all the features of.

67
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.290
So let me speak.

68
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.660
In addition, you can create implicit subject predefined des expression language.

69
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.910
You can also use it streaming services, as you can see a dispirited, slightly shifting side DSP.

70
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.520
So you can do.

71
00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.840
Easy to maintain because the is eliminated because we can easily separate our business logic with precision

72
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.410
technology.

73
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.350
So business logic is basically backing basically up.

74
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:17.800
So you can choose the mix over things, but in solid what is, well, things in doing so, it is only

75
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.550
pure for business and we present it.

76
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.530
So it makes the business logical presentation logical for development.

77
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.550
No need to re compile and really plan if just people are just as motivated.

78
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:38.710
We don't need to redeploy and compile all the original, but so let codes need to updated again and

79
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.980
again.

80
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.310
And we.

81
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.170
So here for this project, we are going to create so solid plunges.

82
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.930
So consider using the DSP.

83
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.420
No need to redeployed again.

84
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.870
But for the solid part, do you have to redeploy re compile everything.

85
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.470
So you will see that I'm already compiling and rebuilding the project again and again, but it just

86
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.580
for this overlooked goods.

87
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.210
So what is the lifecycle of GSP beach?

88
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:11.300
So if you know the lifecycle of Java, it's similar to the GSP scheme translation of GSP beach, comparison

89
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:20.030
of GSP, the translation of GSP, which basically is separating the extremely taxing or GSP dense compilation

90
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:26.300
of just before that compilation of Java file class loading for the lower class instead.

91
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:33.740
And if you created any object to or something inside that GSP, then initialization of this that matters

92
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:41.210
again, then the request processing when it's done all things class loading value loses that request

93
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.410
and destroys for the end, you can see speeds that interfere.

94
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.550
If you create Long Beach days, Gigi's injured, you're similar like that for that purpose.

95
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.430
So I would like checklist translation compilation.

96
00:06:54.730 --> 00:07:01.570
Plus loading initially and vision initialization request processing destroy as simple as that.

97
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.510
So no need to declare all these things like you should not remember this, but this is very important

98
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.960
part.

99
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:15.100
You should remember because if you have some errors while compiling on, then no need to check for your

100
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.510
syntax or anything for that.

101
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.100
Like, if you have some errors like logical errors, like class loading errors.

102
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.680
No need to check for translation in that part.

103
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.750
You can directly check for request is processing or not, if requested.

104
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:35.260
Processing If request is not processing at that particular ruling and everything is not what requested

105
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.070
is not processing.

106
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.690
So there is some error with our database or something like that you can check.

107
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:50.040
So I will throw in the general manager, editorial manager, so just be just be translated, then solid

108
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.690
file, then it will compile.

109
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.520
It will be creative and classy.

110
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.960
It will go to the Jedi Java random environment, then servlet objects.

111
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:04.230
Then before that is dynamic content actually before then for loading that page.

112
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:12.120
Step by step, if you have loaded all the pages inside the server, as we are noting only done on the

113
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.040
local authority, our machine will take all or our computer will take all the load of that.

114
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.530
Nothing but what this buffer will do.

115
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.660
It will create some stack of pages and it will load it into Denzel.

116
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:30.360
So it just takes more time then so for loading purposes.

117
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:36.990
So but it's time we can see the full complexity while writing the GSP is very easy.

118
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.210
So most of the times we prefer GSP over the Java subnet.

119
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:48.720
So in the first part, I will tell you about the delivery connection instead of just being able to do

120
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:49.820
so.

121
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:56.890
Let us move on to our D.C. So as I told you, we have already created an urban league in part.

122
00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.230
Let us stick for the valedictorian part.

123
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.700
So no need to worry how we can create inside the social package.

124
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:09.370
This click right click new and create job package or as your name, I choose or yes, online examination

125
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:09.790
system.

126
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.080
Insert that always.

127
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.360
I'm going to create some packages.

128
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:20.230
We use controller for the controlling part or use model for deploying all the more later.

129
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:26.650
It's like if you have some deep database parts and everything like if you are, this is validating just

130
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.830
by storing part and everything I'm going to use.

131
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.430
We use DB for database management and that connection part, everything.

132
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.550
So I separated these different parts.

133
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.390
So let us see how we can create related student.

134
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.130
So this is our package.

135
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:43.330
I'm building this.

136
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.890
You can just import like this.

137
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.110
Also import Java.

138
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.150
I your start on on.

139
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.710
So so no need to write this again and again.

140
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.200
So it will take part of that.

141
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.040
I've always.

142
00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.600
So.

143
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:08.350
Let me lead this, but also because of oil writing, these are some different things you can take here.

144
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.740
OK, so this is all about these things.

145
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:22.140
So who is Debbie, and I'm going to create some part here admin for the database student for the student

146
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:27.970
database, admin for information, student video, for that information, I'm going to limping inside

147
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.380
the mall.

148
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.720
So we will create in the next part.

149
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.690
So all this is all about these things.

150
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:42.510
Always remember you can also use this also because I bring everything again and again here for the Java

151
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:43.470
servlet.

152
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:51.010
What you can do is you can just start here and you can take this what for simpler purpose?

153
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.850
I'm hoping this all the files I will get in warranty.

154
00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:58.500
All.

155
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:08.100
Liabilities, if you have some Java expert, you can go with the libraries and you have to load the

156
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:13.770
Java expert yet so as you can see, I already loaded inside this JDK.

157
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.570
Despite Java, it's bad, it's not loaded.

158
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.650
Just click here, right?

159
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.050
I got a folder.

160
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:27.000
Download the Java from that purpose and open it.

161
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.380
So.

162
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:35.260
This is a dollar that is loaded, so no need to worry, it will show the error or not, it will.

163
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.990
There will be more and I will take care of that part also.

164
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:46.340
So in saying this, I'm I will tell in the next part how we can use this to post and everything better.

165
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:53.480
So look, postseason Methodism, I'm requesting that barometer and I'm using this validated part here

166
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:59.330
