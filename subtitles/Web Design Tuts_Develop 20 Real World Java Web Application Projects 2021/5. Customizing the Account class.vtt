1
00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.560
So, yes, we are discussed are discussing about the chickens depositing method, like getting that

2
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.360
deposit in bull and the dry and gas block exception handling methods.

3
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.250
I mean, call and these they're asking for a month to be deposited in their checking accounts.

4
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.780
So there are some conditions to be checked before depositing any amount, whether it be that chickens,

5
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.320
deposit accounts or the savings deposits.

6
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.980
So yes, it is going to check like that.

7
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:44.440
Checking some balance, an amount which we are willing to deposit is greater than zero and the amount

8
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.650
in which we are going to deposit is also greater than zero.

9
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.570
So the combined sum of the balance and the amount and the specific amount should be greater than zero

10
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.320
as a whole.

11
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.180
And then it is going to like look at the checking deposit amount.

12
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:09.910
So suppose if we have 10000 already and we want to deposit two thousand, then it is going to like calculate

13
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.450
everything.

14
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.830
We have used this calculation for deposit.

15
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.300
So yes, it is going to calculate everything and then I'll put the current savings account balance,

16
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.600
which will be us, some of that deposited money and the current balance.

17
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.430
So yes, this is going to out for the overall balance after the deposit and as the block is going to

18
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.920
return, like the balance, if it becomes less than zero, then this if not executed and this is well

19
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:53.050
executed inside this overall try block and this is going to like show that balance cannot be negative.

20
00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:02.050
Suppose that you have already one thousand in your account and you want to like deposit some negative

21
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.620
number like suppose you want to deposit minus two thousand do your account, then the overall balances

22
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.490
become minus one thousand, which is not possible at all.

23
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.840
The balance cannot be negative at any cost.

24
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.760
So these things are kept in mind before depositing all of it to drawing money from this system.

25
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.260
So, yes, this is all about savings to withdraw.

26
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.800
Similarly, we have chickens deposit.

27
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.870
So in the similar way, we were checking everything with the tribe lock and gajraula.

28
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:46.570
We are checking here in the same way like we are checking the balance, whether the sum is like combined

29
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.240
sum is greater than zero and the amount we are willing to deposit is greater than zero.

30
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.560
Not if yes, then it is going to like system down, putting them in the cart and checking account balance.

31
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.970
We have like operated everything initially.

32
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.380
This is.

33
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.800
Yes.

34
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.840
So after their deposit, the balance is going to be like current savings account balance and this is

35
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.390
going to be returned in this manner only.

36
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.690
So yes, this is the apple we are receiving here.

37
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.950
Yes.

38
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.550
So everything is written in the call logs.

39
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.540
Yes.

40
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.890
Inside the Australian gas blocks, we have commands for everything in case if there are any exception,

41
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:46.350
then it is going to be invalid terms like suppose you are inputting some basic things, endeavoured

42
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.400
to draw many choice option, then it is going to like output, invalid choice.

43
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.900
And if the balance is negative, then it is going to stop this if Block's execution on this block is

44
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.250
going to execute simply.

45
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.980
And we have already covered this in Malik's choice.

46
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.680
So, yes, the next concern is to get that deposit in board.

47
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.110
So a separate function, we are going to create public void.

48
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:17.700
OK.

49
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.140
Checking some bolt.

50
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.300
So checking the positive report.

51
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:35.760
Yes, the second one and this chicken deposit being bought is going to be responsible for like checking

52
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:44.610
the kinds of exceptions arising in the depositing bite of the checking cell phone, like we have two

53
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.300
types of accounts checking some savings accounts.

54
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.940
So we are handling both of them separately.

55
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.960
We are handling the withdrawal and deposit bank separately for work on them.

56
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:09.060
So initially, sending the end false and a while loop is going to be executed like before end of this

57
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.780
process.

58
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.990
What what is going to be performed?

59
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:22.530
So our try block, of course, which is going to check that everything is correct or not.

60
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:34.130
So this out and this is going to match, slash and display the current savings account.

61
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.460
And so we are checking it for the checking account.

62
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:53.340
So it is going to display the checking accounts, checking account balance and avoid any kind of typos.

63
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.920
I will fix this.

64
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.560
And then all of the typos are mistakes done then?

65
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.800
Yes.

66
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:11.390
So the current balance will be displayed and this is going to be done in the form of money for motive

67
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.460
and not format.

68
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:23.430
What is the argument we are going, but this is going to be checking balance, is this.

69
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.170
So we are done with this.

70
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:38.730
Like this out thing now, this next concern is to ask the user the amount they want to deposit to their

71
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.900
checking account.

72
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.310
So now they're asking the user about the amount they want to deposit into their savings account.

73
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.030
OK, so this is the checking account.

74
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:59.880
We will be replacing this with a savings account right now and then doing the same for their checking

75
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.040
accounts also.

76
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:09.750
So get saving deposit in gold and then it is going to current savings account balance like display the

77
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:18.480
balance, then ask the user the amount of deposited and then it will be simply add the card into balance

78
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.940
with that amount, which is going to be deposited then.

79
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:30.780
And and that whether it is yes, later than zero or not in the similar way we were checking it for the

80
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.910
checking deposited in full.

81
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.360
So yes, this is done like this.

82
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.920
Now after this, OK, so this boolean then.

83
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.940
Get savings account savings deposits, yes.

84
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:55.300
So there is no lack of a place or maybe extra.

85
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:04.730
So, yes, this is going to display the current savings account balance if everything is fine.

86
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:13.640
That is no exception, then this if block is going to be executed and if this is not the case, I suppose

87
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:20.550
the balance is less than the sum on this, like both of them are executed together.

88
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:28.880
Any offer one becomes false, then the complete statement is going to be like it existed on this Earth,

89
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.850
block will be executed.

90
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:38.210
So both of them should be true in order to make this if statement run properly.

91
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:46.060
So savings amount and amount, suppose they become negative, they are less than zero, then this is

92
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.750
going to be executed.

93
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.260
And it brings balance cannot be negative.

94
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.320
So we have to keep in mind these things.

95
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.160
Yes, OK.

96
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.570
The next step is to execute the catch block.

97
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:07.180
Getting that trans funding put is also one of the major concerns inside this account.

98
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:15.320
We are done with the saving deposit in both the checking deposit input and saving with the drawing board

99
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.610
and checking this the.

100
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.710
So all four of them get the metrics that go on now.

101
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:33.020
The fourth one is to get the transport input so public won't get transferred input.

102
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.290
Is the next concern?

103
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:48.410
And inside this argument, which is going to give us initially, is that they like initially it is asking

104
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:57.560
that type of account like let us possibly in court today, argument and then I will show you what actually

105
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.430
this does.

106
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:07.940
So yes, this gets transfer in court is asking for that type of account and we can see that.

107
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:09.490
Yes.

108
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.960
So, cheer select an account you wish to transfer funds to.

109
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:21.010
So initially it was asking for a string in one, which is going to be the type of account, whether

110
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:27.530
it be the checking account or if we are already in the taking seconds and we're going to be asking for

111
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.520
a savings and.

112
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.440
So you have to choose from these two.

113
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:42.980
So this get transfer input in going to working back to me Boolean and in the similar way as the alternate

114
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.220
methods we have to till now.

115
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.590
And while.

116
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:56.150
Not is equal to and then this tri block will be executed.

117
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:57.440
And then.

118
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:07.010
If there is any kind of exception, then we will be having a celebrity like catch block also.

119
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:16.130
For catching that type of exemption, so inside the try block, we are going to.

120
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:25.850
They like the if statement, check back down type, place, knock down, die because.

121
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.940
The chickens are gone then.

122
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.210
The our ports are going to be.

123
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:41.780
Natalie, we will be looking, you know, the sea south.

124
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:53.480
So if we are in check in seconds, then a backslash, then select then account you wish to transfer

125
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.060
funds to is going to be the.

126
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.930
Like message on your screens.

127
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.300
So, yes, this is the one select an accounting average to transfer funds to.

128
00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.510
Select band account.

129
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:18.680
You wish to transfer funds.

130
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.150
No.

131
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:21.870
Yes.

132
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:27.500
So this is done in that the real case of selecting type of account.

133
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:36.670
Now the next one is going to be the list of choices and the choices are going to be we will be like

134
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.290
copying this whole case of firstly, let us.

135
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:48.080
In that type of account, strength input containing savings.

136
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.180
And exec.

137
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:59.070
And after that box lesson with choice, so copying this two more times.

138
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:06.610
For the disarmament plan, the second one is going to be exit.

139
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.040
If we are in the.

140
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:19.750
Bus two months there will be a if my turn also are like as if not one, if we are in the night checking

141
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.560
stuff gone down.

142
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:25.960
We want to transfer funds to the checking account, then things are going to be different.

143
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:34.990
So, yes, this is going to be the three sixth out for the choices, like a list of choices we are going

144
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.000
to have now in the next budget.

145
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:46.760
We are going to declare the choice variable for the type of choice user input.

146
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.480
So input not next in.

147
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:52.570
Yes.

148
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:58.740
This is in business like riding a bus inside Java.

149
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.990
So yes, and choice and good next choice.

150
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.100
And then after this, we are going to like initialize a switch gears.

151
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:16.060
Suppose if you user inputs like one for the savings account, if they are in the checking account right

152
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:22.000
now and they want to see it switch to transfer money into the savings account, then switch gears will

153
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.410
be executed in order to like ask the user what is the money they want to transfer and everything?

154
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:30.880
No.

155
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.160
Yes.

156
00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.440
Let's switch gears six, executing that humanity's choice.

157
00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:45.240
So we have one, too, and the default case, the first case is asking that if they want to like transfer

158
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:51.050
of money to the savings account and it is going to output to the current account balance, then we ask

159
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:58.850
for the money they want to deposit to the savings account and then the next step they will like it output

160
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.750
the present balance after the successful transition.

161
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.140
So yes, the same time we discussed above is the cheque there.

162
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:17.000
The balance should not be negative in any case, and invalid choices are also checked out in choices

163
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.190
should be made very carefully.

164
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:26.190
Now, similarly for this checking, Seccombe say that things are done in the similar way.

165
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:32.750
I have already discussed this about this as if we are taking the same thing for the savings account,

166
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.390
the types of account and everything is done in the similar way.

167
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:45.320
We have checked this for the checking account since the string expressive type is going to be this similar

168
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.510
for the savings account as well.

169
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:54.910
If they choose to transfer money to the checking account, then these will be the questions asked to

170
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.490
the user.

171
00:15:55.550 --> 00:16:02.510
What is going to be the type of account and the money they want, then deposit and then the calculated

172
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.570
balance will be displayed.

173
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.750
So do you then that what they transferred and what is actually left with them?

174
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.170
So this is all about that account glass.

175
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.600
We have covered all the calculations required inside this now suing the next by.
