WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:08.770
So previously we have seen on live here and how we created everything, I don't know.

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.790
We are moving against barbecue addiction, goodness, JavaScript events on deployment, but you.

3
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.620
So it's looking good JavaScript, an extreme, it's not a programming language, it's a programming

4
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.780
picnic modem.

5
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:31.700
We're developing any JavaScript coaches juicy projects is a set of development technologies or techniques

6
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.970
using web technologies.

7
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.620
This claim saved created a synchronous applications I am using here awesome commissioning turbine modules

8
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.570
using grass method.

9
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:51.030
Let us consider splitting the request or blog or compliment anything on my page simultaneously.

10
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.440
The more it can get it in, so I need to maintain two processes different as those synchronous spikes.

11
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.570
So I need to hear asynchronous back to you.

12
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.680
I don't want to create synchronizing the 30 or so I can get one synchronous.

13
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:12.360
I want to get asynchronous part, so I'm using it agents so web application can run again and only to

14
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.840
conserve those even without interfering or displaying the myriad of existing page.

15
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.580
Because I don't want to change the behavior of my face to just edit those synchronously.

16
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:32.580
So the more he gets the file occupancy flowchart of objects working from the volunteers and you insult

17
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.090
this building a similar to I find to great sandy difficulty Chris through the internet.

18
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.140
So do whatever.

19
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.580
We like good deeds and it will create these fans through the internet.

20
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.260
Browser will be done.

21
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.250
All of the process will be done using dollar and data for each content.

22
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.920
So the exec inside this and new projects will use Ajax to so basically asynchronous JavaScript and examine

23
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.720
it's not the programming language.

24
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.010
I'm going to create awesome methods.

25
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.950
So let us move to the API.

26
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.840
So I created a few more things here with login process, which is nothing but for the log in using email

27
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.820
and each passwords with some file your system and we can create.

28
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.570
Then load for the load, GSP, everything I'm going to create, I want it for the logo.

29
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.570
I'm going to just sitting in it will pull through the front page of you.

30
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.840
Then this is created and created open.

31
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.600
So let me show you where I use Alex.

32
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.940
So these are all in time using you, creating objects, putting into this type and grouping and printing

33
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.480
that part.

34
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.210
So next thing, I'm going to use it.

35
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.590
It's very little thing.

36
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.550
I'm using this.

37
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.880
Well, you're creating the open post.

38
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.670
Also, I mentioned this example is GDP.

39
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.860
So where to put this index point?

40
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.520
As you can see, find each and everything I'm using here.

41
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.670
So that's really building.

42
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.360
Let's see what is these things and what do you hear?

43
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.060
Specify is basically it's a load document file with some simplicity.

44
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.230
You can directly embedded this and you can create the change content.

45
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.670
Everything here, you can do this so that set of Opal I'm going to create, but it's similar to the

46
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.780
request object.

47
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.690
So if you know the object, what is the object so it can be used to exchange data between the server

48
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.530
behind the scenes?

49
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.480
It's a request object, so you can use this object to request the data, and it means that it sends

50
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.380
a possible object parts of the pages without actually reloading the page.

51
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.670
All we can say will the page.

52
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.030
It will reload that part, so that list includes back.

53
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.360
So there are different methods in different things.

54
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.000
Using this, you have to change.

55
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.060
Jake did but miss teen years, which exists across the domains.

56
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.390
No need to change along.

57
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.190
If you have seeing domain, you can use this, but if you change, a domain, object remains.

58
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.490
So for the New York Times, you to use new to teams everything about method.

59
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.350
You need to see it.

60
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.840
Then there is open to the same method.

61
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.800
Also, you need to create.

62
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.500
So next, all about you can create what I remember about the four states, or you can see three states

63
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.890
there to me to go under these four again four zero three four four million and four zero four four nine

64
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.380
four three.

65
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.200
So.

66
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.830
If you notice, oh, you are going to create a logic here.

67
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.400
So that's it about how I created addict's logic.

68
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.670
So let me show you some more thing here.

69
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.120
I created one post to mention this again.

70
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.280
This is again, some Ajax logic, and I'm adding some 10 years or.

71
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:06.160
Just in a lot of these things that I used to mention this, I just found some pool locations as a lazy

72
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:12.380
about abiding love from whatever nation is to do this.

73
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.840
And I found this on the internet that I just started random things here.

74
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.630
I don't want to mention focus on that part.

75
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.930
If you want to create for your own location, you can add that.

76
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.700
Then similarly, everything I'm going to mention here, so next to light creating.

77
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.890
Let me show you one more thing you did yesterday.

78
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.880
So visit home to these two posters.

79
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.810
I need to mention the other.

80
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.800
So this is your own.

81
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.790
I'm going to create betting for a lot of mortals, I'm going to show you, Oh, how I can perform these

82
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:49.360
actions.

83
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.280
So we already created miles an hour to deploy that clip pages.

84
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.570
Then this status is for showing the status like Diesel Eater or everything.

85
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.760
I'm beginning to say this part only.

86
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.620
So Lululemon's and I already timetable the thing, and I'm going to show you this.

87
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.770
They will were looking in employment.

88
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.530
In later, but I will tell you, I can perform these actions.

89
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.380
But before proceeding with this, let me add to three files here first.

90
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:32.430
So this is a total I can create, but you need to create this part of the School of Law part also.

91
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.430
So let me.

92
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.310
Well, we do.

93
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.190
Log in process.

94
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.970
OK.

95
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.340
So no more of these, these things I you mentioned with you.

96
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.660
So these are the two of them and you need to mention this quarter by quarter by is basically what I

97
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:49.280
call development.

98
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.990
You can find on the internet, what is the tenure and public member for?

99
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.060
Look, quite so.

100
00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:03.010
I'm creating user name and accepting and user pass for the user passing method and Boolean to create

101
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.790
one status.

102
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.650
Then I'm going to create Oracle and I'm going to create and mention the silly.

103
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:18.580
So once this is done, I can type in my command prompt to get that connection is done.

104
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.960
When this is done, it will actually set email to Gmail user name.

105
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:31.270
It will ask me for the same source if and not directly, it will create me.

106
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.070
Username and password does not exist.

107
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.270
It will read all through me from that page.

108
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.240
We did this Long Beach today, the speech.

109
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:49.140
Then logo dispute, and I don't do it here on TV, I already created this part.

110
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.870
So this is it.

111
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.860
I am mentioning this, but no.

112
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.920
Remember while developing the Meisner?

113
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.160
Oh, you can see I already created this part.

114
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:16.840
So the only is that data from that part only and it will me review me everything here so you can use

115
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:24.490
to select everything you can use, replace, execute, update, you can do here so that see who I created

116
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.400
this mindless model, which I already mentioned.

117
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.660
But oh OK.

118
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.040
So there are some teams also required here.

119
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:43.160
Because while developing this saw before, you are each little.

120
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.410
You can see this.

121
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.170
You can see it created from Google or everything.

122
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:54.690
These are all the vials contain either Ireland who create triggers.

123
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.000
Similarly, for the logging process it will log is very simple.

124
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.550
Once I click that log, it will decision message.

125
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:11.350
Then let's see, Auburn posted what is Auburn hosting and mentioning here am putting this in a million

126
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.580
people watching this, I need to create one is year, so.

127
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.350
High school is very important you.

128
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.660
Because I'm going to add it to my security.

129
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:34.060
So looking forward to change this year to Washington in the country.

130
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.270
So this will be my dream.

131
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.300
Is Good Beach.

132
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:46.960
Well, I'm boosting this bar, so it will be remain similar, but after continuing this party, we'll

133
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:47.830
go to another park.

134
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:57.310
So ah, this is open post to you, which you will see your post the mentioning your if you had an image,

135
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.040
you can imagine, so you can do that.

136
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:06.300
Then I created Open Post for opening the steeples and you can see ads.

137
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:11.050
So I also gained for the board to change here one time.

138
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.500
It is see.

139
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.580
If you are me and I think you can change that.

140
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.890
Now let me explain this first.

141
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.900
Not on the list, so I'm adding this existing in new.

142
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.570
These are the functions and adding to the Dallas people.

143
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.490
So I is very important.

144
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:45.650
If do if you please enter some text, if I might, even if we find the means when the GST as this is

145
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.280
similar to DVD window.

146
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:55.740
I mean, this is one of the things I told you again, that I don't want to load or reload the fighting

147
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.060
again.

148
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.580
I'm going to load just that window.

149
00:10:59.060 --> 00:10:59.450
OK.

150
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.990
You mean his name is phoned or something like that?

151
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:11.530
If not in any way, you can selectively bring me that data so there suitable quantities.

152
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:18.470
So I just want to display that name after finding the name without reloading the free flight because

153
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:26.620
it takes it, takes time to reload everything as a vocalist, only I can perform this for.

154
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.080
Furthermore, but while developing this, I can use Ajax.

155
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:36.020
Similarly, for the boost I created, introduced for everything I mentioned or I used to just be using

156
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.780
and similar for the registering despite intimidating registration processes along similar.

157
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:50.590
I already mentioned this, but then still does GSP again similar, which is going to show me the status

158
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.920
here.

159
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.750
As you can see, this is good for you.

160
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.850
So always remember you need to.

161
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.770
Well, engineering school.

162
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.880
It would explain everything.

163
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:11.530
Neatly, because sometimes like this it we throw it at him for me.

164
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:19.200
So let me say this on, this is who I am going to mention in the next part, which is the last part

165
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.240
I used to.

166
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.310
In that part, I'm going to mention everything I will.

167
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:28.680
