WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:11.570
He had developing an employee platform on the platform using spring framework, and we already set up

2
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.200
our project with spring and we develop some models.

3
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.480
Now let us see what is happening saying hybrid.

4
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.600
Basically, Hibernate is basically used for the database concepts this autumn, basically object relational

5
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:36.590
mapping, but you can say it's not more related to the Java interface is more related to Java database

6
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.150
connectivity, so hibernate frame.

7
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.660
So if you already know we have already GDC Java database connections and so we can perform database

8
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.580
like that back in part with Java.

9
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.280
But why, instead of using so little, we can have a first thing you can use injection dependency in

10
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.940
hypomanic plus.

11
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.690
It simplifies the development of Java application.

12
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.680
It's if you closely look in natural light code that you can change that we are building their dependencies

13
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.790
directly that that Java database, we are already directly.

14
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.000
We are not performing as application, but we are performing that audit of this connection as a class

15
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.660
properties.

16
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.350
So there is a coupling between this if there is an error in something, so our application will not

17
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.860
deploy.

18
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.910
If we have some database status, so we don't want to go home.

19
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:42.670
And also we are embedding the it means directly link slick starting all the teams, then inserting things.

20
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:53.870
So that's very difficult thing, and it's not appropriate while developing all, although what we can

21
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.450
say is so it is an open source, late maturing object, relational.

22
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.850
Plus it's hibernate implements the jibia, which is job persistence for the data systems.

23
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.710
So what you really need is distance if you close the loop or default entries in database rules.

24
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.910
Relational database I'm.

25
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.450
So it will not accept national database.

26
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.960
Basically, it will accept only the valid databases, I wouldn't.

27
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:33.370
Then why are we so what is are included in subjudice Apia as its indirect EPA, but it's for data creation,

28
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.990
manipulation and taxes, so it is basically programming technique with mass objects that are stored

29
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.150
in database, and you can closely do this job application.

30
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.360
And this is the object you can select like we can create an object and our application, which passes

31
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.340
through audio and which goes through the database.

32
00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.060
If you close the solid database and you revisit the responsibility, banks passes the school students

33
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.910
throughout this school.

34
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.310
So we are eliminating that friendships in building the illegal settlements in Java.

35
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.200
We're excluding that part.

36
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.500
We are directly approving that, and I will tell you what is the Jeep?

37
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.630
So Jeep is basically Java Persistence API Java.

38
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.650
You can say here is Java object oriented obstinance.

39
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.000
Basically, the GPUs you can set up, but a distance from the classes and interfaces.

40
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.610
So let us see in the IEEE part, but we are going to perform different things.

41
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.430
So we need.

42
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.410
Take me up on sale properties first.

43
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.160
Can you believe in we can change that in Cincinnati, so I'm going to in book.

44
00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:03.910
So for the proper visualization and editing, so currently we have unemployed and you can see these

45
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.870
are released, and I already created one interface for that purpose.

46
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.890
So just to interface like the interface is basically just using that section, which provides no goods

47
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.170
in that section because I don't want to anyone to change this part.

48
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.150
So I will tell you what is that getting played by Amy and what is two things you?

49
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:37.520
Basically, so are life saving play is going to see the blue eyed and before things here then.

50
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.050
One thing I need clear one employee.

51
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.820
So I mentioned during employment, I haven't mentioned or is the employee.

52
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.950
So if you want to check your persistence in it, you can install the plugin dubious structures and you

53
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.690
can get all the hype when it comes to exit.

54
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.660
Currently, I'm not implementing any TV connection, so let us create one team your model.

55
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.100
So as you can see, go to this editing.

56
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.860
Basically, oh, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to create one package here.

57
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.390
Oh.

58
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:19.080
Let us assume one package you're new and I'm mentioning as package than.

59
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.300
It's.

60
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.160
It's.

61
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.990
That's.

62
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.710
Mentioning him as model.

63
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.870
So as you can see, this insane isn't going to create one class and.

64
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.570
Well, let me mention the class name and employment, because I'm going to be that employed.

65
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.530
Inside Nissan Bluffs.

66
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.210
No.

67
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.750
We don't prepare this to focus on this on me.

68
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.850
Now, let me create one our import package, increasingly.

69
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.460
Java Export Assistance, which is basically a.

70
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.300
But this does not start because I'm going to implement everything it.

71
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.940
Then.

72
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.640
Currently, these things are I think that we want.

73
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.590
But let me mention here.

74
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.960
So it's very useful and easy, as I told you already.

75
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.800
No need to mention anything, just to mention.

76
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.630
Definitive ratings entity.

77
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.990
In the end, you should mention it will.

78
00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.360
So people.

79
00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.220
Insertable.

80
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:08.360
You the name, so in the database, I'm going to mention names employed, as I told you are to blame.

81
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.680
None.

82
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.170
Oh, as you can see, these teams are done.

83
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:22.050
So what I need to do this morning will face the data from the database and will do the database connection.

84
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.320
So it's very easy indeed the ingredients in their database.

85
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.330
Oh, I need to mention.

86
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.550
I'm going to create later that it will inside a database.

87
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:42.060
So as I mentioned, this was Eastern Time, everything you can jigger on this logo will come.

88
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:47.520
So there's some mention it's a dial up assistance which provides the database connection.

89
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.000
Now let me mention one thing I'd.

90
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.260
I eat so it is nothing but beer to generate you and bring everything so.

91
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.870
Know the some default fund generated the value you need to engineer a strategy strategy.

92
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:14.820
As you can see, it's excellent for the strategy, so it's a matter of basically strategy, and we need

93
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.420
to mention the red tape 18.

94
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:25.800
Generation identity, so it will create one unique and interesting identity.

95
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.670
And inside this unique dimension.

96
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:34.440
Private.

97
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:37.500
Long.

98
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:39.010
I.

99
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.140
So what if this things go?

100
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:48.400
As you can see, I created this I.D. so we will access through that I.D..

101
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:55.360
I'm going to create an I.D. inside a table so we can change that data to that idea.

102
00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.700
So no need to require permission.

103
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.090
You are what you can see.

104
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.590
It's good segment select start from where everything.

105
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.150
So it will automatically detect this is identity and identity parties.

106
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.940
So now let me mention the columns you.

107
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.470
Column.

108
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:18.000
Pelham is the first column I'm going to mention a name is equal to.

109
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.010
Girls need to remember all these names to me.

110
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.230
And again, private admits isn't string.

111
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:33.570
Well.

112
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.770
Amoxicillin is a person, so this will be the entity inside database.

113
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.040
Now let me copy this part, so I am hoping I will tell you.

114
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.620
Well, I'm going to mention it again.

115
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.730
Last name and email William Schilling your last name.

116
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.090
Again, the last name again.

117
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.140
And again, I'm mentioning in the third column.

118
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:11.470
Even so, remember, these entities should be same in the database also, you can mention this.

119
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.430
So it.

120
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:18.760
Chicken.

121
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.020
Violence.

122
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.740
Of the database.

123
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:43.210
So this reminder databases know what I need to mention, I need to create one veteran center property.

124
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:48.790
So for these purposes, though, instead of putting again and again, what are you going to do with

125
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.530
this old insert to insert that here?

126
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.000
So for you, I think it will create one gendered option.

127
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:06.780
So I don't know what is the or different shortcuts for another system, but for windows you should insert.

128
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:12.010
You can check two of the keystrokes also get transferred or go to the transit Armitage.

129
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:17.130
Then you need to create for everything in your transit terminal.

130
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:22.030
So choose everything and you're looking.

131
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.820
Once you hit, OK?

132
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.100
You can see it will create all the greater entertainment that sort.

133
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.390
These teams created.

134
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.160
These are my columns, so let me do one thing.

135
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.420
This is probably going to be OK after this.

136
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.860
I mentioned in the columns and a prediction creating a great friendship of this.

137
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.050
So let me get.

138
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:58.880
Determinants, so this is what of getting sick of it, so you should be public.

139
00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.180
No need to change anything you need.

140
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.790
These things should be public, so this will be the data from the database.

141
00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.770
So now we are currently seeing these things are not deployed in anything.

142
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:16.910
So I will create and I will tell you what, we are going to work here and everything in the later part.

143
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.320
But in the JPA, as you can see, you can take care of the classes.

144
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:28.520
This package in this table is this no need to take first in line clubmate in employee database, although

145
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.300
you can say Implique plus we need you as my table.

146
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:39.730
So let me close this because should you be a panic and exit, you need to work around the.

147
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:49.770
So now it's got a new in the food related problems because our world is not properly developed, as

148
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.640
you can see, because we haven't mentioned, it employs any methods here.

149
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:58.530
So in the later part, we are going to check what is the implementers, how we are going to perform

150
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.100
this, how we are going to connect with my skill.

151
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:08.400
So if you are developing on deploying one laser on laser, would you need one online database for that?

152
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:14.640
So my recommendation is go statistical bias good or would he be my motive is not relational database.

153
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:21.060
So the again, these things are going to change in that database, but preferably go with my school,

154
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.870
my school.

155
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.290
So it will help you understand.

156
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:25.920
Thank you.
