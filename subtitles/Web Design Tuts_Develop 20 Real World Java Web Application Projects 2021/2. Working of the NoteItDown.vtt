00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.810
Hello, people.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:10.070
I hope that you all have went to the introduction, but also noted that the application will be warmer.

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.060
So if you have went through the introduction, then, you know, get an insight of what is going to

4
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.210
happen in this noted down application.

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.440
So now let us understand the wording of this application.

6
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.190
I have already told you that we will make this application and that July WP engine are ready and packaged.

7
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.290
So let us see how they work, I suppose, in this application that is upstream.

8
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.590
So then the same thing from the program that WP Library of Java.

9
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.210
Well, that is a class Lindsey three.

10
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.110
So yes, this is just the name of this application.

11
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.630
I am also anxious to see if this is the frame of the application.

12
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.360
Now let us see what other skin cancers suffer.

13
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.760
So in the headline, we have new application, not a bone.

14
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.900
So yes, not down shelves.

15
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:29.530
Now this is the type of application we can see that the new tax law, which we're building, are going

16
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.390
to be in this budget.

17
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.500
So, yes.

18
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.580
It contains a file button and a little button, and I'll help button.

19
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.440
So see the options inside the file.

20
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:54.500
We have a new open, so I and this option in there that we have copy this got select.

21
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.610
So we want the best we can do it by copying and pasting it, then even getting any part of the text

22
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.630
and then posting it is all just simply the moment.

23
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.520
And also, it contains a selection sensor so that we can select all the text and export data, whatever

24
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.800
we want with the single desk.

25
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.180
Also, it has a health option, which contains the bulk of this note that the other window, which we

26
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.040
have discussed in the introduction.

27
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.830
So it's like making this about option.

28
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.490
Yes.

29
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.780
So this is not about things now about window opens, often picking this button here.

30
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.410
So in the about option, we have the basic idea behind this application.

31
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.670
Like the name of the application and what it does not down to the word processing program, as we have

32
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.080
already discussed and allows us to test change the best of the competition like it has an introduction

33
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.790
similarly to open option also so we can open any file from our system.

34
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:11.400
And that's what the introduction by about 12 things about navigating the text in our competition.

35
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.770
Already existing file in our computer can be called noted down application also.

36
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.080
And of course, we can pick on text document from scratch.

37
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.460
Also, this will be arming the rebels to create documents, as I already said, so I've been making

38
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.550
this argument that this will be closed.

39
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.870
So yes, often.

40
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.170
So the about section I I hope you must have then and I doubt it.

41
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.730
Now, let us try and write something like if we create a new right.

42
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.970
So I suppose.

43
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.170
Hello, everyone.

44
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:05.630
Today we are going to learn Java.

45
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.800
So yes, I have found some random text.

46
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.690
Hello, everyone.

47
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.790
We are going through Jello.

48
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.830
So if we let's.

49
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:28.000
Yes, so from a little initial lock up, the option of the facility, some boxes everyone today and

50
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.500
copying it, and then slightly pasted to say yes.

51
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.200
Thanks.

52
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.070
Excuse me.

53
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.340
So if we try to select some text.

54
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:52.020
Copy and then try to pass the test says everyone today is copied from here and then tested again so

55
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.200
that adoption is working perfectly fine.

56
00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.890
Now if you want to get something, so we have to select it like we want to get non-German.

57
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.200
So we firstly may have to select this click on the card.

58
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.320
So yes, it is correct now in Milan, the piece disappears in the next line.

59
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.300
So yes, we have got that number and now we want to make it.

60
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.800
So yes, we have pasted this successfully in the next name.

61
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.290
Now the other option C select on.

62
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.380
So selecting one.

63
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.180
With the help of my mouse, but now maybe this election with the help of this shark.

64
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:43.520
So yes, you can see that after getting the select all voted that on, all of the text in the notepad

65
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.330
is selected.

66
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:52.440
Now, supposing they want to cut, so yes, everything is cut, select the anchor.

67
00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.000
So, yes, they did return, and it features are completely explain.

68
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.120
Now let us move to the final option.

69
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:09.180
So yes, if you want to open any file from our system, you may flick this open.

70
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.210
And yes, yes, it's done.

71
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.060
Five thousand.

72
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.440
Now close it.

73
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.380
Yes.

74
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.270
So if you want to save any fine, suppose you have to.

75
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.330
They can do everything.

76
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.350
OK, so say I want to save it.

77
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.020
I want you on the save button and open.

78
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.160
Yes, so I can save it in Senate and donate at any place.

79
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.880
So if my documents?

80
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.520
All right, everyone, listen.

81
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.650
This is a beautiful linking of the system and this not down application.

82
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.520
Next, we're going to learn.

83
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.060
So if I click on say yes, so this.

84
00:06:52.260 --> 00:07:00.690
So if you have upgraded at best, you can also print this document and it will be turning a page or

85
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.820
whatever you want it to.

86
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.860
So yes, print option books also find.

87
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:15.460
Now that they have done all the functions of this application now creating a new opening of saving painting

88
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.930
now and then.

89
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.620
We are going to exit this operation.

90
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.880
So, yes.

91
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:32.920
Every second that we did the program successfully now trying to run this again.

92
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:41.870
So, yes, after exiting the program, we have a leader in the program and trying to throw some more

93
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:48.680
features of this application, so you can see that after every option, we have a shark attack.

94
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:49.640
Yes.

95
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:57.990
So we have a short code for creating a new file and open up the folder from our system, save them brain

96
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.630
stem and eggs.

97
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.720
So let's try to use the shark.

98
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.940
Next up, this right?

99
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.640
So there's no text and from your keyboard, click control.

100
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.120
See, and the text will be copied.

101
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.860
So, yes, cable shortcuts also find him.

102
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:28.590
So as you copy this and no change the line and try to paste it, so yes, from Contrave, I remember

103
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.920
to face this text again and again.

104
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:42.300
So I warn you how you want to text with the help of keyboard shortcuts or directly from the application

105
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.570
may have been the number.

106
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:55.110
OK, so this is the working of this note down application, and I hope you must be wondering how can

107
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.790
we make this application?

108
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:04.740
So we should start learning the code for this program and explore more about it.

109
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.170
One thing I also want to learn that we can also open.

110
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:16.450
Save, print and escape by pressing escapes.

111
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.410
We are looking for this Shakur's also have assumptions of that system.

112
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.610
Next up, one, if I want to save it, I will play gun control.

113
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:32.750
And yes, so it opens up your system as many want to see it.

114
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.060
Similarly, if I click like this, if I can't be.

115
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:47.570
Different option Pops Up says all the shortcuts have all attached to Christmas, so in the next part,

116
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:53.550
we are going to make a new job, offer this a project in our favorite compiler.

117
00:09:53.680 --> 00:10:00.140
We just will go code and try to write this code for program noted down.

118
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.700
Thank you.

119
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.800
See you in the next class.
