WEBVTT
1
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.910
Our project projected blue management, so we are going to create one platform based platform where

2
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.270
we would create for employee management system.

3
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.650
So I'm going to create one simple platform for that.

4
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.330
You can enhance it more.

5
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.210
But you know, sometimes you said, I'm going to do with some simple metric system with database Java

6
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.680
Spring Framework and how we can implement all the Java object oriented programming here in this.

7
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.060
So our framework is Java spin, which is basically my own framework.

8
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.250
And we are going to see how we can incorporate database with the Java Sea.

9
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.420
So labels and even further, I'm not going to use your aims of late concept to use your pure and I have

10
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.340
in concepts yet.

11
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.710
So we will learn that later.

12
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.090
So our project in.

13
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:05.160
He's employed, so let's see if we can create a world project was so.

14
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.730
This is my idea in there, Julia.

15
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.450
So I'm going to use this because I will tell you or hope we can set up our project first.

16
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.690
So let me change.

17
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.890
That is like.

18
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.870
So it will be more readable so you can change your color also happening to your performance, I'm going

19
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.520
with like and go to projects and see what projects.

20
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.000
You then see this project and you can create a new project because I haven't created anything low play

21
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.460
places.

22
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.090
I already created, but I didn't in she research prototypes to you.

23
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.540
Or you can branch you do this for GitHub.

24
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.960
You can open it on your new project here.

25
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.630
So will for some time what it will create a new project for me, so I will tell you what we are going

26
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.590
to do here.

27
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.160
So wait for something.

28
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.350
Once you're done with this, you will see this dialog box will be open and go to your Java Spring,

29
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.150
initialize it.

30
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.000
I am using

31
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.750
Java or intelligent for anything like that education booklets.

32
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.630
But if you are not using this, go to this website so where you are and you can see Sadat's putting

33
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.930
your tile in the web in your web.

34
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.290
I will tell you how we can proceed with that also and use the name for the.

35
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.420
So.

36
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.380
Let me give the name for the project.

37
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:46.060
Well, I'm giving the name of my MP so this so empty, so foods Java, then Marvin, then if you want

38
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.140
to change and change your mind package like through Basic Group, is you so package names as it is?

39
00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:01.180
Artifact it your Java 16 and Java was not the only job he buys, it is its next.

40
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.730
So it will create your next choose the one we want you to stay, but wasn't currently happening.

41
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.450
Jenny, stay with us.

42
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.120
2.5 people, people.

43
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.890
Then I need spring boot.

44
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.270
This doodles then go to a school.

45
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.880
I'm going to use your my school.

46
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.500
So I'm adding my ice driver.

47
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.580
Secrets to any other user and spring data GPA.

48
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.760
Oh, well, if you want to add some people, so you can.

49
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.610
But I'm not adding because I will create that later.

50
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:42.040
So my suggestion is currently don't add anything, just add dependencies, bring my skill level driver

51
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.650
and bring that click finish here.

52
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.470
So it will take time and it will create a new spring for you.

53
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.780
So why are you creating a legacy?

54
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.970
I hope we can both.

55
00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.800
I hope we can implement that.

56
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.670
I would see it so in places in improving Amy's delivery, web application for employment, even assisting

57
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:14.350
states of developing these products that we are then going to take a minute and just like this on understanding

58
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.260
different ways, what we are going to use here.

59
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.460
Then some other basic concepts or what is that thing called Java is going to work here and in between

60
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:25.360
then?

61
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:35.100
There are different also stages for database my school database, so we have what some call the web

62
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.430
interface, so I'm going to incorporate that in the database.

63
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.410
Everything I'm going to teach you.

64
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.420
So that's all in place.

65
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.610
Then application requirements, they're going to.

66
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.100
We should have some basic knowledge of a stream of web development tools.

67
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.430
I'm going to use your JDK 16 inside in spring initialize that you can use my school database if you

68
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:04.020
are not familiar with endangered values, any other platform for that purpose that is being ideal available

69
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.190
for listing development.

70
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.500
So I will show you how the spring initialize if you don't have that idea.

71
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.850
I will tell you how you can.

72
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.530
Go with this feature.

73
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.950
So go to your browser, search for this standard springboard, are you?

74
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.990
This is very helpful to create any project.

75
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:35.540
Then Sally, go to email, then Java doing two snapshots again, because these are not stable version,

76
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.210
then hit 2.5.

77
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:44.280
But we use the package name then 16 void and you're going to lose your ability.

78
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.730
Add dependencies from next.

79
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:55.700
So you can add spring boots, then add, as I told you, for this purpose we need, you can actively,

80
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.210
for instance.

81
00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:02.560
So I forgot to add, I will add it later that team leave and everything on then.

82
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.300
I knew, knew, source or you can choose any other thing here, my school drivers and everything.

83
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:19.640
Once you're done with dependencies I told you he'd generate, you noted it will give you the easy way

84
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:27.170
or so you file or you can extract it and open it with your I.D. so that you can do this.

85
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.320
And this is our application requirements.

86
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.090
So for loading and then you hope we're getting the basic knowledge.

87
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:44.400
Jovicic is very easy thing you can do, actually, because the dollar I'm telling you, I'd consider

88
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:52.850
voting three visits when he's given GST and you can give him the speech of our Tin Machine D-Ariz geliyor.

89
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.800
And I mean, it's just a dollar.

90
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.260
So this basically allowed you to construct it.

91
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:06.860
So these are not only important, but important is a letter the spring initialize that he's working

92
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.050
on.

93
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:14.140
So I'm going to tell you how we are deployed on the server and everything like this very important disciplines

94
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.080
and Judy can use then dormitories and classes.

95
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:25.820
It's very useful for a neat team of integrating everything in his Java Business Insider classes, along

96
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.050
with a team of senators.

97
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:33.620
So consider really, for example, Oh God is an object and God is some boot sets.

98
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.660
We can go there, but it has.

99
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:41.620
Some are defaulting on its own like we are makers also like driving.

100
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.600
So you can consider class using object constructor or blueprint for the creating object.

101
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:54.030
So object is basically used to class or execute particular class, basically.

102
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.200
So object for the calling because of classes you job.

103
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.280
So submitters are declared in the classes it contains.

104
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.520
Call for particular functions like as a tool for drawing of card.

105
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.540
You need a code for driving a car?

106
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.040
Not really.

107
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.810
You are creating a simulation.

108
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.200
You need to create a code for driving a car.

109
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.850
So for that, you need a code.

110
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:22.300
That code is considering a well-functioning functioning referred to the methods in the other.

111
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.740
Some interesting things that are done values explicitly are some default attributes, such some things.

112
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:34.610
So these are the things as object classes are created to exist methods so you can use Object X display

113
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.120
towards.

114
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.630
That particular object for accessing Limitless also.

115
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.380
So this is all the intro I will tell you.

116
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.320
We are going to set up this thing and everything in later part.

117
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.570
But this Jake alert our of them.

118
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.580
So let me show you.

119
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.710
So it's currently permitting.

120
00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:02.010
I'm doing everything in court so you can see already some additional things are added.

121
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:08.220
Let me add one more thing here, which is basically team leave for dependency.

122
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.530
So I really do hope we can add dependency.

123
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:17.340
It's very, very easy to in a job on my own project because we are having one.

124
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.770
Which is basically bombed our ex-militant yet, which is very easy.

125
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.250
And once you look out that part also.

126
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.130
You will understand that is very easy to.

127
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.520
So let me add one dependency, which is basically thinly.

128
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.880
So this is my getting started.

129
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.130
Just close this door in between.

130
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.260
You can see everything you're already it here.

131
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.060
Well, look 1.6 million rescue properties of our team.

132
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.530
Well, you can take here.

133
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:04.080
Some dependencies are already added my school and every team, so.

134
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.960
We're sticking them to indexing, and that stuff's.

135
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:20.890
So we on time when it's finished, as you can see, it's currently the network.

136
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.220
He.

137
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.410
So, Paul, let me tell you.

138
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.570
What is this the Davos framework for us because we already created a spring project and everything?

139
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.630
But what is the jealous spring framework?

140
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.320
So Java Spring is nothing but oh, you can.

141
00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:02.680
They like in the late breaking free, which is new to most new with Black Stone.

142
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:11.530
It's contain some already established frameworks like J'espere Hibernate Everything, so you can select

143
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.750
that.

144
00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.320
It's a framework of networks.

145
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.030
So all Mozart added in spring.

146
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.440
Now you can use the springform.

147
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.070
So that's a framework more or less.

148
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:27.560
You can delay that it isn't structured to find a solution of different kind of technical problems.

149
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:34.010
So when you are developing slowly, you will understand we are currently writing too many lines of orders

150
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.420
to finish deleting everything.

151
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.690
So in this, we are not going to use that techniques.

152
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.900
So I will tell you who we are going to use that.

153
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.980
It's basically contents of several modules like who are in this game.

154
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.290
In this basically with Marvin and everything already.

155
00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.960
So now let me move to the IEEE part.

156
00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.650
So these are my probably not as simple as you can see yet.

157
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.420
So.

158
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:09.190
You know, is this so you can see it, some dependencies are already at it.

159
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:17.950
But let me add, my cumulative dependency simply is nothing, but I just adding this dependency and

160
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.570
it will indexing that, but it will directly download that dependency for me.

161
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.380
Tim Live is nothing but for the thrombin part.

162
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:33.580
If you are using a new selection estimate, it will reportedly delete that part and it will vote for

163
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:33.760
you.

164
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:41.670
But regardless of that part, it is very well, beautiful thing because it's extremely small, pretty

165
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:42.060
far.

166
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.040
You can say or analyze thinly, basically.

167
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:51.400
So it will it will allow you to add some detailed settings in spring.

168
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.080
So it's good to add dependency for what you can directly add from.

169
00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:06.440
That part also known it will analyze immune dependency for me, so you can see your moment and you meet

170
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.450
one warning, which is.

171
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:09.970
You don't.

172
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.040
So you can check your warning.

173
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.710
It's an upgrade, OK?

174
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.410
You can upgrade this.

175
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:22.550
No.

176
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.080
It should.

177
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.990
Not giving any.

178
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.820
Warning for me.

179
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:41.640
So, OK, so I am focusing on Bob Bombed-out example, because this is very basic thing you have to

180
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.720
choose because of deploying this project on anything like any sober local observer.

181
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:55.370
It will first responder explain it will check that that server side part will check that weather.

182
00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.710
Already, all dependencies are added or not.

183
00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.680
So that's for this or once this is done.

184
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.770
Ignore these all ignoring everything.

185
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:11.940
Ignore these things which are important ombudsman will do is that you can choose your different.

186
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.180
Folders like you can see here, different folders mean on.

187
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.920
And it's what you mean, oh, you can see two folders, Java and resources.

188
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.890
So resources is basically about application properties.

189
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:30.280
We are going to use the replication properties, but it will contain different data and you can contain

190
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.080
all the backend part.

191
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:37.680
So as you can see, one already thing is really here, which is basically minty.

192
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.250
Never, ever try to change this part.

193
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:50.060
Because if you are not interested in to change the development part or even initialization, but they

194
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:54.110
will change this part because it will automatically initialize your classes.

195
00:15:54.530 --> 00:16:00.650
So what we are going to create in further videos or further tutorials, we are going to learn how we

196
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:07.160
can create some packages here, which is regarded to more sources than different things, sources or

197
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:07.960
services.

198
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.900
We are going to add.

199
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:18.020
So they are going to add a somewhat easier Java classes programs to create you, like create backend,

200
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.430
access the database and everything.

201
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:20.960
Hope you understand.

202
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:27.200
We will see further, more details about our project in next door to three.

203
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.310
Hope you understand.

204
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.060
Thank you.
