1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:09.210
So now we are going to create that normal function for this nie, which will be responsible for moving

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.040
the snake inside the frame.

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.880
So initializing the void more function and I think the functionalities inside the function.

4
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.630
Lastly, we will create a for loop and then for the dots.

5
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.580
And if there is greater than zero.

6
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.080
Then there the minus minus.

7
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.090
So the snake will start to move in the left direction like we have zero to three hundred.

8
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.500
So if the snake is that supposed twenty ninth position, so it will start moving in the left direction,

9
00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:01.190
so z minus minus and setting the coordinates for the X and Y axis like X then.

10
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.420
Is equal to.

11
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.460
X z minus one.

12
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.820
And similarly, for the violence.

13
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.080
So I am hoping for the Y coordinate.

14
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.020
So the snake is moving this way.

15
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.830
Yes.

16
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.880
Now the snake has started to move.

17
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.790
So what happens then?

18
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.170
The snake moves in either of the four directions like left and right or up and down.

19
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.880
So we have to update the continent, its environs, if any, of the more takes place.

20
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:58.770
So I suppose if the snake moves in the left a direction, then this will result two x zero as a decrease

21
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.050
in their dart size.

22
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.980
So X0 zero minus not size.

23
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.660
Not science.

24
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:20.430
And had we are now similarly, we have to do this for four more times, like for total four times.

25
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:30.630
So copying this and trying to paste it three more times for the other direction says right.

26
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.860
Up and down.

27
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.210
So we have to cover all the four directions and what the consequences are going to be.

28
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.410
So if the snake moves in the left direction, the X coordinate decreases if it moves in the right direction.

29
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.250
It is going to be increase.

30
00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:02.680
Similarly, if it goes in direction, then the y going to notice will decrease and isn't down direction

31
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.210
than the Y coordinate is going to increase.

32
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.790
Yes.

33
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.310
So here we are.

34
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.590
OK, so I change the same thing.

35
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.120
Let's do this and do this here.

36
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.030
So this is for the like.

37
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.830
I think I have pasted it.

38
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.590
One extra time.

39
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.330
So this is for the first day.

40
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:38.590
Yes, so that left direction is responsible for decreasing the Nazis in the X-Cart, and it will be

41
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.550
plus.

42
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:49.320
Now, as a quick explanation, if this any more than once, so we are going to blast like in the comments

43
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.760
I will show you.

44
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.670
What is this actually makes up for this?

45
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.040
Currently, the snake's explanation is up to five feet in the Y coordinate.

46
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.780
And if it moves downward, dragging this here.

47
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:09.720
So yes, suppose this y is equal to 240, and if it moves in the downward direction, then suppose it

48
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.210
is moving 10 units in the right direction.

49
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.690
Then this is the down key and we are the I have to update them regarding it as +10.

50
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.900
So this is what we are actually doing.

51
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.940
So 240 plus 10 is going to be 250.

52
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.940
And similarly supposes this snake moves up that action, then the white board and it is going to decrease,

53
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.020
not in these legs upward of the snake is here and it starts moving upward, not this leg, but this

54
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.290
thing.

55
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.150
So if the snake starts moving upwards, the Y coordinate will degrade her.

56
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.070
Though I got an intense zero and hand, though I coordinate this three hundred.

57
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.660
So obviously the snake moves upward.

58
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.260
Now I got an advanced degrees and similar is the case for the left.

59
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.690
Then the right direction keys.

60
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.690
If it moves index direction like level direction, the X coordinate will decrease and for the right

61
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:13.650
direction, the X coordinate will be headed to zero x and her X is equal to 300.

62
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.150
So we are done with the more function.

63
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:27.180
Now, as far as we have created, all the functions required in this snake borders our class.

64
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.650
We will create the action list not as.

65
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.740
Public void.

66
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:46.030
Action perform like what action is to be performed when any of the function is being called saw action

67
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.810
performed.

68
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:56.340
And so creating this action performed function and inside the parameters we are going to pass action

69
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.030
event as suppose a saw inside this function.

70
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:11.250
We are going to check if the game is on like I call it, as in game, I call in games.

71
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.030
Game is on.

72
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.930
You must have heard me before.

73
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.040
So if the game is on, then.

74
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:36.440
This is places, so check that the police there also check that the collision is performed, our lawn

75
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.450
check collision.

76
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.350
And move destiny.

77
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.480
So let me explain this thing like what action is actually being performed?

78
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.630
So there are three functions check Apple Check Collision and then move.

79
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.630
So I am going to explain this with the help of this frame.

80
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:08.930
So firstly, we have to check that the police present are not like if that is not up, then where this

81
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.050
snake is going to.

82
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.620
So the first thing we have executed inside the action of one thing is to check that box.

83
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.230
Then we have checked the collision.

84
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:27.060
Like, suppose that we have started the snake from this garden and then the snake is not going to move

85
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.880
at all, like the game will be over in the beginning.

86
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.800
So we have to check if the snake is not going to stay long.

87
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.780
So after checking that the police present, there is no collusion.

88
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.380
We are going to move the snake, simply move the snake.

89
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.390
And what is actually moving?

90
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.220
So hand moving the note.

91
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:55.020
We are now moving up down, left and right, and coordinates are operating in this way only.

92
00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:01.290
So yes, the action often listen event is also covered.

93
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.360
So after creating that action list, that event.

94
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:14.730
Now we will come towards this big component like what actually is going to be done after the snake moves.

95
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.370
Next up was the snake moves itself.

96
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.260
Then what is going to happen?

97
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:25.980
So this paint company is calling the graphics like we have given the graphics here.

98
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:34.390
Above, so this graphic is going to yes, that is the graphic.

99
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:41.920
OK, so the graphic is going to end one more night behind the pale of destiny.

100
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:51.790
So now 50 SuperDart paint company heads of two and that image behind like I already told you, there

101
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:52.990
is no Disney.

102
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:59.320
We are just standing image after image and this we are going to do with the help of the parent company

103
00:08:59.680 --> 00:08:59.920
now.

104
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.210
Graphics Andrew.

105
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:11.110
Three things are responsible for that now so that we have created super component and draw and draw.

106
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.310
Now the image will be drawn after the tail of the snake.

107
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:21.070
So insane the action placement part like the EA variable.

108
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.710
As we said, we have to call it Apink.

109
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:33.580
So the the parent is going to paint after the snake moves and stuff like checks if there is that.

110
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:41.170
But there are no collision and the snake moves and each step, then it will be an image after that tail

111
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:41.840
of destiny.

112
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:52.360
So after covering everything now add one more layer like let's try to run the function and check whether

113
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:52.630
the.

114
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.290
Now, before this, I am going to instead focus Sable.

115
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.080
Like we are going to contain.

116
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.100
This project and control the project as.

117
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.560
Keyboard functionality is only to myself being focus able to true.

118
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:22.370
The app will open in their default manner, like if they will click keyboard, then it will perform

119
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.080
their action.

120
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.300
And before this, nothing is going to happen.

121
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:32.030
So try checking that map is working or not.

122
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.320
Like if the snake is actually performing.

123
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:43.100
So yes, the snake has started to move from Iran and Apple has upgraded at random position.

124
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:51.470
But with the help of the random they have created and the function is also working correctly.

125
00:10:51.920 --> 00:11:01.700
Like, if they are pressing the up key, it is moving y minus the y coordinate is being subtracted in

126
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.340
when pressing the left key.

127
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.370
Next, coordinate is being subtracted if we are going right.

128
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:17.360
The Y coordinate so an index coordinate is being added, so the snake has grown enough.

129
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.680
Now let us check that the collision five.

130
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.630
So hitting this advanced obstacle.

131
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:30.360
So the snake heads after the war and the pop up of as game over.

132
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.000
So everything we have created by far is working fine.

133
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.110
The snake was moving.

134
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:46.260
You think that Apple and the sides wasn't like you made the added one after the other and once Snake

135
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.900
hits, the stake in that game is over.

136
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:57.930
Now, one more functionality is to be checked, not whether the snake dies, if it hits itself or not.

137
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.360
So let's check that.

138
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:08.010
Also for that, we have to grow this snake for a minimum five pointers before.

139
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.160
The snake is not going to collide itself.

140
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.300
Let's hope that it does not emerge.

141
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.540
The walls mean in the mean time.

142
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.230
So let us try to shape the snake, which.

143
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.990
Let us grow it some more.

144
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.800
And now, yes, the game is over.

145
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:39.020
The head of the snake disappears and all the body parts are seen as the darts only and the game is over.

146
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.800
So let us summarize everything we have created.

147
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:49.040
We have created the snake glass inside, which we have called on new board.

148
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:58.940
We have our flame back and the resizable it is said to fall like the app is not being maximized.

149
00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:05.090
The size is fixed of 300 density 300 with now coming to the border DOA.

150
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:11.630
We have imported swing and NWT packages have used the packages inside them.

151
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:19.220
The components like action listeners and inside the action list that we have created dedicated actions

152
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.300
for everything like fast moving forward.

153
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:29.660
The keyboard keys like controlling the keys for gluing the snake for the collision and everything.

154
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.380
We have successfully added the image icons.

155
00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:40.340
So make sure that you send the parts correctly in order to name each appearance.

156
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:48.920
We have initiated the game center time or we have located that, but we have checked that if Apple is

157
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:54.940
eaten or not utensil increasing their darts accordingly.

158
00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:00.170
We have created paint and graphics for adding images one behind another.

159
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.440
We have created a game over functionality.

160
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:10.730
So what should we appear on the screen when the obstacle is hidden and what is that functionality which

161
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.430
we are going to face when the game is over?

162
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:21.560
We are checking the colleges if the snake heads itself or any of the four rolls and the game is over

163
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.240
and time on this stuff.

164
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:33.890
So I hope you all must have gone properly to this project broke down and we tried to make the game on

165
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:34.470
your own.

166
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:41.900
Thanking you all for attending this session, and we'll see you later with some next project.

167
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.950
