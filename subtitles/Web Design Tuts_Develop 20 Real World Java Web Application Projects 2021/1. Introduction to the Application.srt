00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,260
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:09,270
Sowing the seeds of learning how to make products in Java today, we are going to learn how to make

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,170
our download manager back in Java.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:20,850
So on your screens, you can see the title of the project, an image attached to it.

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,810
So the title of this project, says my download manager.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:36,480
So by honing that idea, I hope you have gained like or what have you about what actually we are going

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,470
to make today.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:47,790
So we are going to make our download manager by writing code in our I.D. and the download manager is

9
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,550
going to be based upon Java language.

10
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,200
I no other frameworks we are going to use by making this download manager.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:04,080
It is going to be made simply encode Java so that you made your on your screens.

12
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:05,780
Yes.

13
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:14,610
So this is the interface which is going to like open menu based link and click on the download button.

14
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,670
Initially, there will be nothing here.

15
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,330
Currently, we are having two links pasted on.

16
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,660
The download is taking place, but initially there will be nothing.

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,210
Just you have to like paste.

18
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,960
This is a input text free.

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,120
You have to like paste the link link.

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,740
Also like stupid controlling should be pasted in this input text field, and then you have to click

21
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,600
on the download button in order to make their download start.

22
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:53,550
So this is the frame which is made using frameworks that toolkits of Java.

23
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:59,500
We call it the AWB string and we are going to use that.

24
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,790
Those name works only by making this project.

25
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,730
So this is the title of the frame.

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,910
Like this keratosis file?

27
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,870
So this is the title bar of this name there.

28
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:23,010
In the second part, we are having input text fee and then also in the main table for we have basically

29
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,020
a table format, which is having several rows and columns.

30
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:36,720
The rules are going to contain the names which we are like wishing to download, and the columns contains

31
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:45,980
details about the download, which is taking place like the details of each, specifically the details.

32
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,440
Seems like this is the other column.

33
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,750
This is the size column.

34
00:02:52,050 --> 00:03:00,120
The size is going to be displayed in megabyte, we call it, and we saw the size is going to be displayed

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,700
off that file in megabytes.

36
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:11,130
So we have currently two files, one bit of a starting point in Temby, and the second one is forty

37
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,110
four point eighty nine and so on.

38
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:20,020
And these so the target column is like an important column.

39
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:27,960
We can see that it is showing that the how much the download is completed like we have of progress,

40
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,860
but we're just showing the progress in percentage.

41
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:43,470
So once the download is stagnant, no Agnes Ma starts from zero percent and upon the time when the download

42
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,750
is completed, it shows 100 percent like a completed status.

43
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:55,020
So basically, these are all columns are linked in a way.

44
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:03,790
Suppose that the size is going to remain c a menu item is going to remain the same, but all the L the

45
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,790
S columns are going to like Vati are depending upon each other.

46
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,350
So the progress if increases, then the status will like.

47
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:23,580
When the download started, the status bar is sure that the downloading once the download is completed,

48
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:30,200
the status bar will show completed or if any and like libraries.

49
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:39,180
So it is going to show that status like a status of this download issuing some edits so that will be

50
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,430
displayed in this status bar.

51
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,710
Also, yes, we have Paul and the Zoom option.

52
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:56,010
We are like having separate buttons for pausing, resuming, cancelling and clearing us like individual

53
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,670
columns.

54
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,670
We have to select that column and.

55
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:07,750
Then in order to play, pause, cancel the download all clear the like role from the table.

56
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,900
So we are having buttons for that also.

57
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,520
Now I was talking about that, these are linked.

58
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:22,660
So suppose that initially the donor started from zero percent, then the remaining time is going to

59
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:31,450
be like supposing it is taking minutes, so their time will be like this Red Hat, that's two minutes

60
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,200
and elapsed.

61
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,600
Time is going to like display zero.

62
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,120
Like initially, we have no elapsed time, just not meaning time revision.

63
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:47,710
Once the progress bar increases six percent, then elapsed time is going to increase and remaining time

64
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,600
is going to like decrease.

65
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,590
And they are like linked to each other.

66
00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:01,420
They lapse time will increase exponentially on the remaining time, a decrease in that manner only.

67
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,370
Also the average spin.

68
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:09,100
So it is totally dependent upon your bandwidth of your network.

69
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,780
Like, suppose you are having a bit of what the bandwidth like.

70
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,450
So the average speed will be shown good.

71
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:27,400
And if the network is like bandwidth will be low and the speed speed is sure showing that in kilobytes.

72
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,280
Also, we have our speed column and the average speed column.

73
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:44,200
So speed column is the speed at that point of time, and the average speed is the speed like the total

74
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,820
is divided by the total time elapsed.

75
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,590
So speed is like the total size divided by the time.

76
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,140
So what is the this we feel now is this blog showing.

77
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:07,390
Also, this column is for this critical condition, and this is for the inset speed calculation of that

78
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,410
instant only.

79
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,940
So OK.

80
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:20,140
In the next five days in this, we have a company to download like this link is pasted and the download

81
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,040
is completed.

82
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:31,360
So these buttons are automatically like disable them says as we have selected columns and the download

83
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,490
is complete there, so there is no point of pausing resuming the download.

84
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:46,570
OK, so here we have pasted the link and the download button highlights up on clicking this add download

85
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,050
button.

86
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,080
This download is going to start.

87
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,400
So we have this download completed the sizeable five MP.

88
00:07:54,730 --> 00:08:01,090
The progress here showing hundred percent complete saw this status is showing, so the remaining time

89
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,600
is zero.

90
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,540
Like we have no remaining time.

91
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,630
The download is already completed and elapsed.

92
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,430
Time is 16 seconds.

93
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:21,340
So now you can also like like calculate what is the total dine in this done so every ping if it is a

94
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,660
complete package.

95
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,430
So this download manager is a complete package of everything.

96
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:35,320
We have a progress bar, we have up speed, we have average speed, we have elapsed and remaining time.

97
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,360
And this dude does, of course.

98
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,690
So yes, this is the like us.

99
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:47,230
They are then another window off their download manager with just showing the complete download.

100
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:55,990
Now in the next part, we are going to like this because the specifications so the specifications of

101
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:03,720
this project is this is basically a download manager and reactivating this with the help of Java.

102
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:09,360
So it is a software that is managing downloading files from anything.

103
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:17,470
So we are like good taking links from somewhere and then pasting it to her so that everything is on

104
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:17,890
the web.

105
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,940
We are just like taking that link and pasting you to and then the download is starting.

106
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:34,570
So OK, so this download manager is just a tool of downloading things from the web to your specific

107
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:41,710
system on which the download manager is running now for after the download, you can then share those

108
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,380
files and things become portable.

109
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:52,930
When you download it, then you can share anything with external drives also so that download size could

110
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,800
be anything.

111
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,440
This is going to download everything there and it is using the app.

112
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:07,930
You are getting the connection for downloading files so that as they like the links containing as you

113
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,390
connection I, it will be wasted here in order to download the files.

114
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:21,630
So the features of this download manager, we have already discussed that we can pause the download

115
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,970
to resume their downloads according to our convenience.

116
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:31,720
Like, suppose that we want to bother download extra, then we have to like, go somewhere.

117
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,500
Then we can pause then and then again, come back and resume the download according to our needs.

118
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,960
Also, we can like cancel and download in the middle of the progra process.

119
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:52,180
I suppose that we have mistakenly started downloading the wrong side, so it is not like necessary to

120
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,010
wait for the download to complete.

121
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,570
We can cancel it any time in order to stop the download.

122
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:06,400
And this is, of course, agnostic user interface application meetings hour.

123
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,700
So it is our best window interface application.

124
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:20,260
You can run this application on your next stops by creating a separate type, and it is simply going

125
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,140
to act like any other download manager.

126
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:30,190
You can open this download manager link and then start the download off your files, and we are creating

127
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,120
this user interface with the swing controls.

128
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,130
So swing is our framework of Java that we are going to study about.

129
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:46,540
So in the next part, we will be discussing that what are actually the concepts we are going to learn

130
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,570
while making this project before making any project?

131
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:57,610
It comes in our minds that the what actually I am going to learn after the successful completion of

132
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,300
this project.

133
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:07,990
So after this, a successful completion of the project, we will be having a good grasp on object oriented

134
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,050
programming in Java as we are going to.

135
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:16,230
I use the object oriented programming very deeply in this project.

136
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,870
Everything will be around classes and objects and methods.

137
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:29,250
We will be like declaring glasses or declining functions, accessing my thoughts and objects with keywords

138
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,540
and so on.

139
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:39,540
And also, we are going to use this ring with these frameworks of Java in our very extensive manner.

140
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:47,610
So everything is going to be like the convene with the help of string anything WTC unless.

141
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:59,060
So we are going to use companies offering the same goods, such as Flame Jeep and menu bar item.

142
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:08,260
Jim Martin and so many more life components of in library we are going to use by making this project.

143
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,550
Also, this application is made in core Java.

144
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:18,850
We have not used any complex like tools instead of gold java.

145
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,790
So yes, this is going to be a cool Java application made from scratch on your side.

146
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,680
So functionalities of our download managing app.

147
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:38,230
We are also going to learn how each of the functionality works, how we can play, how we can read the

148
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:47,680
balls that are downloading, how we can clear the specific column, how we can like cancel specific

149
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,270
download from the middle, how the UI travel connection works.

150
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:59,350
Like everything, we are going to learn about this download managing application and of course, in

151
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,610
that and object are part of object oriented programming in Java.

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:09,280
So obviously we are going to learn handling classes and objects in Java.

153
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:16,670
So I hope you all must be excited about the making this project on your own.

154
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:25,040
So in the next part, we will be understanding the wording of this application and then we will directly

155
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,500
jump start the programming section in our ideas with no delays.

156
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,630
So see you in the next little walking and the programming section.

157
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,290
Thank you.
