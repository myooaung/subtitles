00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:10.600
So in previous scenario, I created this glass, which is an IT monitoring Java out of Java logic program.

2
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.860
I send all the teams here.

3
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.190
Let me tell you who had changed this previous pilot and specified this much more.

4
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.670
But the thing is, I would argue in these extreme arguments, which are going to be are going to use

5
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.350
the command line here.

6
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.260
It's not integer, it's OK with string, but we are considered into our board.

7
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.760
So for the utilize that part, I'm mentioning this as integer and I must say in to the board, if you

8
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.620
are using string, it will not accept.

9
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:51.080
So for that purpose, I change the integer hello, and it's acceptable to put this in arguments.

10
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.720
So I created one x koning sawdust, which is they want us basically.

11
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.810
And it's going to run a public word then, which is you can take it.

12
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.380
Just stand with a committal on May 13, and I'm going to use here all the things, so you know what

13
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.650
I'm going to perform yet is.

14
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.410
Right.

15
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:26.650
So he said this trying to catch on Sunni exception, even if you don't respond.

16
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.020
Let me.

17
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.030
System not of.

18
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.100
I'm.

19
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.440
Don't.

20
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.940
And he said, if we pay this and we are going to move it right here.

21
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.530
So I'm going to and one it sounded as if we could do something.

22
00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:01.560
So it is not quite as late as what we can say over the course of it.

23
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.630
We need to put out a job program or network or we are going.

24
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.750
We just don't connect with our current political so called echoes what we are doing on.

25
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.630
We are going to create Woonsocket committees.

26
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.200
You know, it's something so if we could care.

27
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.260
I need something else.

28
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.280
I need.

29
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:36.350
Socket, I assume it is going to automatically take with him or socket, and so I next socket, address

30
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.970
and platform, which is just like so circuits.

31
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.340
So let me put here source at this source.

32
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.770
IHOP is a new.

33
00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:04.150
And I want to mention here address all sorts of Ragnar's, if not zero, which investigative report.

34
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.480
So if you want to change this form, you can change.

35
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.720
So let me put that here.

36
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.670
Indeed.

37
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.590
She's basically common board.

38
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:27.600
Then our target is our new map, so I need to get one another's operators in exalted and this again

39
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.660
with Mr Nationhood.

40
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.340
Beautiful new.

41
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.550
I am so proud of this, a target slash.

42
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.870
All I needed.

43
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.530
OK.

44
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:56.090
So power source, you can consider sources you can control is our own source, or you can Google as

45
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.290
a local host and quite easily.

46
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:06.700
Zero zero 22 in the photos which are really common commonplace oh, people are using it is most common.

47
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.470
You can do so source.

48
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.810
You can check in and target in four languages.

49
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.230
So now we are done with this and target using basically any more.

50
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.450
I'm going to choose now.

51
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.640
I need to perform it's mind.

52
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.650
Soccer tradition.

53
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.630
Perform walks on the table, so service on the here.

54
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:35.920
I'm going to bind what I'm going to perform that socket link in that electrical socket.

55
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.360
No, you are not what you need to plug it to the wire.

56
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:48.270
So in that hole, when I need to bind over my sorceress, so similarly, I my thoughts are this.

57
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.890
But again, take any sort of suggestion.

58
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:53.840
Is not going to.

59
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.120
Destination, I need for a commuter destination.

60
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.910
The same, so I'm considering pilgrims looking for cover and it's not going very well.

61
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.580
I don't even look directly out of my team if.

62
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.260
Connected in its aim to create something, so if connected is not.

63
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.660
It's going to.

64
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.320
It's going to take if it's connected, it's is going to be really just brilliant.

65
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.780
If it's true, it's going to bring something.

66
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.560
So you seemed not a lot, but Britain works is going to print.

67
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.180
It's very interesting.

68
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.520
Isn't I?

69
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.510
Am I saying here when my new date?

70
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.040
If you are familiar with this new these are nothing by definition.

71
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.660
Job you influence functioning, apparently other.

72
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.410
Coffee, yeah.

73
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.970
As we continue now, oh.

74
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:13.190
And you mentioned source and target everything, so I need to do the space plus target, I need to put

75
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.700
up with your target, which is my target.

76
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:23.740
Then after this, I'm going to bring to my room slash, which is basically what called.

77
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:34.130
All plus, what I'm going to put here again is whether it's going to take or not, if it's connected,

78
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.440
it needs to print message coming and.

79
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.140
That's it else, which is basically.

80
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.030
It's not it's disconnected.

81
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:55.880
It's going to print this similar similar to let me message, Mr.

82
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.230
OK.

83
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.220
Oh, so now we're done with this.

84
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:08.720
And let me put here one more warning system.

85
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.050
Not out.

86
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.630
Not.

87
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.190
Didn't.

88
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.240
Debase is not exists.

89
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.260
Slash.

90
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.010
Not coming in to.

91
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.850
If you care.

92
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.760
Basically, if I'm having the exception in this.

93
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.170
So that's it.

94
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.660
We perform.

95
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.680
So long, let me tell you who we are going to run.

96
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.750
So first thing what I'm going to create, I created here one socket.

97
00:07:51.990 --> 00:08:00.150
And this task is, I say, this time they must schedule will delay and we did everything but with source.

98
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:05.960
I'm going to mention the destination address and port and mention, and you can choose.

99
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.230
So the chicken part is very important here.

100
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.500
And let me tell you who we are going to perform this.

101
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:27.180
So, you know, we need to execute directly in this right because our arguments is not sick.

102
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:33.570
If you want to set arguments, you have to set your eyes with these everything and you need to mention

103
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.410
that part.

104
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.520
But if you want to use command line interface, let me tell you who we are going to pull from here.

105
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.520
Who might seem like a Marcondes working guru that directly.

106
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.800
It is basically it's hard to see for that.

107
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.750
If you've been to Java.

108
00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.150
You can check the Zoomlion Java command.

109
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.290
So let me clear this.

110
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:10.220
So I need to be on this network monitor Java, so it will compile this part first.

111
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.450
So it will take time to compile everything Java.

112
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.220
So Java keys for the compiling part.

113
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.560
If by printing this Java, no, you need to use these Java.

114
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.490
But now what is remaining time needed here?

115
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:36.140
I need to hear some old methods and I need to implement like our sources feast, but our target is not

116
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.470
fixed.

117
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.480
So I need to mention other targets here.

118
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:50.510
So when I do not one skill I mentioned not who or what I'm considering here or this simpler 8.8.8.8,

119
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.840
which is basically Google it both Turkey.

120
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.920
So I am mentioning this.

121
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.740
So this is my source.

122
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:10.230
So I don't know whether this address is, nor all these know what I'm getting my index option because

123
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:17.040
this address is not actually exist or which is not connected, so I don't know whether this address

124
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.090
is connected or not.

125
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.610
So for this purpose, I use this.

126
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.510
So let me move to the iPod and let me close.

127
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.840
So let us check for one.

128
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.950
You can hear.

129
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.190
Isn't that OK?

130
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.060
I work on this.

131
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:42.730
So.

132
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.290
Let us check whether my own IP address or thing is connected or not.

133
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.220
But are people serious?

134
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.120
Then again, these commands.

135
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.500
Java, and I'm not going leave here.

136
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:06.600
OK.

137
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:12.090
One thing I need to compile it again, so remember, I need to compile it again.

138
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:20.450
Once it's compiled, because I've changed little bit, so it to compile, so it will take time to compile.

139
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.130
Let me put you.

140
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.260
So this is my new IP address with new listings.

141
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.370
This is a destination.

142
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.130
This is IP address.

143
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:36.130
Guess?

144
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.080
And it is.

145
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.000
It is just basically for the connected.

146
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.360
So currently on this date and this it's not you never close this close to you.

147
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.360
Serious.

148
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:48.670
So.

149
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:55.100
Blunt warning to perform here, if I walk, you want to check your own light.

150
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.750
You can check one for the security purpose I'm not considering here.

151
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.560
I'm looking here one random address.

152
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.110
If you want to check, then this is connected to the network online.

153
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.190
8.8.8.8 to basically move like.

154
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:22.750
You can check, so I don't know whether this source, which is basically not my source.

155
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.330
So these are not also lame.

156
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.560
So you can take liberties.

157
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:41.010
So it's similar like being dot 8.8.8.8, so you can check you are getting the reply from pinging and

158
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:41.400
everything.

159
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.760
So oh, eight point 8.8 just for Google.

160
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.140
Something so.

161
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:55.960
If you know, the IP address of your target, target is basically the source, you can check your flight

162
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.470
later.

163
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.690
So let me.

164
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:07.560
On this phone.

165
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.540
Well, when I landed, I.

166
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.240
And let me change this to a liberal but.

167
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:41.900
First, you can check your own nine people and wounding one other random IP here, and I'm going to

168
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.760
check whether it's working or not.

169
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.870
And then Chikere here, be ECB board not to be called also if you want to you.

170
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.700
Going to see that as.

171
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:26.090
For you, let me check whether it's working or not.

172
00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.980
So this is another random lady and this is one lady.

173
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.580
And you can check whether these apes live on this.

174
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.830
So not these episodes were not lame.

175
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.360
So maybe there is a role with these all.

176
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:46.070
So these are really prime ministership capturing the IP and performing this.

177
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.190
So in the next part, I'm going to tell you how we can work on different things here.

178
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:53.540
Hope you understand.

179
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.250
Thank you.
