WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.640
So we already created some part of our application.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.970
So I created this generation of keep using ease who with secret key, initializing the vector for any

3
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.340
you get randomizing and ciphertext.

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:28.590
So we do a lot of cipher based, which is basically solid or leaning on Assad.

5
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.470
So now I we're IBM drones.

6
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.930
I repeat I'm just.

7
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.280
So this is very.

8
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.270
I mean, we put everything.

9
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.500
Speak with me originally decided, but I just knew.

10
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.810
Have you been able to speak with more initial?

11
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.990
You should be.

12
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.570
So this is the barometers states.

13
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.390
But I don't suspect of Cipher.

14
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.770
Block.

15
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.090
What aspects of.

16
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.120
And I want to ask you to say good luck to any initialism myself with.

17
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.320
So but.

18
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.800
And.

19
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.390
Safer.

20
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.890
Block and two initial administrative block with we thought safe would.

21
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.660
Typekit.

22
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.170
Doc, I need to mention the models in group mode.

23
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.930
Which will include more I need to mention not only ink, but with the secret key also.

24
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.040
And it is basically the secret.

25
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.200
Also that secret gear already created in the perimeter.

26
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.420
With which speaks highly parameter space.

27
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:24.410
What is going to didn't mean it didn't mean this effort is still needed to it would not be finalised.

28
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.440
There is one method by segment.

29
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.760
Plaintext, not gigabytes.

30
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.890
So if you are not mentioning this, it's OK, need to mention the standard me.

31
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.750
So we are done.

32
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:49.010
First of all, what we created, we created meant to create security with two random thing again using

33
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.250
the initiative as a random team because we are putting message, but it's going to use security limited

34
00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:03.080
to initialize that, referring to the negative part, randomizing things then for doing atheists inclusion

35
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.450
and creating plaintext to so with the key, I'm going to mention this no more than one dimension mention

36
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.580
from the reverse operation cipher to plaintext.

37
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.840
So I me talk to.

38
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.220
But a same.

39
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.130
So full.

40
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.290
Lyn, ciphertext, let's talk.

41
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.470
So I already mentioned here and Will.

42
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.510
So pretty soon, everything is so public spending now, it should be not always, but I don't think

43
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.490
we do it.

44
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.760
Bye bye bye.

45
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.060
So he is decryption.

46
00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:02.540
As encryption of encryption and on with some default parameters, I'd mention first is by separatists.

47
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.410
So full text.

48
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.060
Don't believe ciphertext security means security.

49
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.870
So because secret keys always remaining to new secret.

50
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.350
Great.

51
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.810
So, Rachel, Richmond, OK.

52
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.130
Take.

53
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.430
She get a cricket match in this morning.

54
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.270
Security.

55
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.000
And I need to initialize that with the lawsuit, because it's not.

56
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.960
Campbell argues that we should let them the truth.

57
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.390
Exceptional, it should to.

58
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.690
One exception with.

59
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.520
But no, so we are not recommending anything, OK?

60
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:28.440
So you bring your ciphertext, says MR Initiative to school and return decision to let us see how we're

61
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.910
going to do.

62
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.140
I mean, ask for safe food, small surplus, safely equal to cyber.

63
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.850
Not yet instance of which.

64
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.680
Is.

65
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.420
It is cyber mixed.

66
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.300
Then I need to mention that I remember.

67
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.810
This parenting speech, again, simply because this is not genetics.

68
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.260
No, I need to initialize even more so the.

69
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.580
Keep.

70
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:21.280
I had to initially support the need initially with sniffer told the reporter Negroponte, think of me

71
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.590
with which music and given it which I on because.

72
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.970
So he's going to do this and what he's going to do is it's going to meet.

73
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:43.240
Munition as bio Peter is, Peter, do you need a bio diesel cipher?

74
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.620
Not so far based only cyber.

75
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:57.100
Good final, it's going to bring fine, can you read ciphertext

76
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:06.790
self-addressed is going to give him the financing and it's going to return me.

77
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.280
Great new.

78
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.910
Dream.

79
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:26.070
Dessert, as she thinking in the industry as my dessert, so not wanting me to mention, I need to create,

80
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.200
oh, driver food here.

81
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.010
So looking through your.

82
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.890
But I recall.

83
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:36.960
Peace with him.

84
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:43.050
Somebody said, you quote a man of this again, it shoots towards the exception.

85
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:54.340
Exception we reached secret, not secret, secret.

86
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.070
Security with security.

87
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.330
Let me mention security and security.

88
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.690
And you can use a symmetric key also.

89
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.800
No problem.

90
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.730
We're doing it to you.

91
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:20.970
Let me mention Secret Kiss Cemetery, because it's symmetrical this.

92
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:25.360
Symmetry.

93
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.200
Create a scheme which will create me easy.

94
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.590
I will mention as asking.

95
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:36.570
OK.

96
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.900
Is good for this escape, then?

97
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.200
System not.

98
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.820
Hound dog friendly.

99
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.550
The cement three keep.

100
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.010
It's going to be a new industry for me.

101
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.080
Again, it's simple.

102
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.440
One is going to do here.

103
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.740
And you mentioned this one, sorry.

104
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.480
So let me copy this again.

105
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:20.590
Watching and listening to don't want to do it.

106
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.200
OK, so it will be interesting, Mike, before that.

107
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.580
Let me mention one system.

108
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.090
Not a lot, but in Berlin.

109
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.990
Don't start, don't start.

110
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.830
Do.

111
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.120
More.

112
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.840
It will make this increase more than what is going to go.

113
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:08.640
I am reading this, but I need to initialize when we see it because I'm not shooting in so.

114
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.720
Michelle.

115
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.740
We don't want enslave it.

116
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:26.280
Now, I need this method, which is basically created initially, initially rock, so

117
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:29.820
creating a shell.

118
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.860
So you the the that go.

119
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.520
So what you can do and you can you can MM to perform this.

120
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:51.670
And you can use different methods to perform this also.

121
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.750
So let me use these methods.

122
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:10.500
So we copy some call by directly, wouldn't am, because this is a very simple call, I will explain

123
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.670
how it's going to work.

124
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.570
It's very.

125
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.380
Useful.

126
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.980
So again, it's key.

127
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.280
And you shared with them.

128
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.480
And then again.

129
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:44.880
It's.

130
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:51.570
Was sharing.

131
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:54.670
And.

132
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.870
It is just for publicity for me.

133
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:03.740
So.

134
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.250
What it's doing, it's doing the encryption with plaintiffs.

135
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.240
It scares me security and it's going to initiate this.

136
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.600
So for these encrypted messages.

137
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.040
Again, who collect this?

138
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.050
OK.

139
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.600
With encryption.

140
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.590
It's going to take this message.

141
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.460
OK, so now we're done with this.

142
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:03.490
And I really care system not of but.

143
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.060
But Franklin.

144
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:15.750
With no, this is decreed tomorrow, OK, so let me mention this something.

145
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:30.260
Doing so long, let us sit on this and we need to stick with it.

146
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.770
We are cutting with our teams on.

147
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.410
So currently, you can check.

148
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.750
It's building.

149
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:43.610
OK.

150
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:44.920
Well, just.

151
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.060
So, oh, we.

152
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.840
I want to mention this.

153
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.650
It's not.

154
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.010
So let me check it again.

155
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.370
What is this text, which is basically.

156
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.960
So me do and again.

157
00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:02.870
So sometimes if there is one error, it might you the error, but no, you can check here symmetric

158
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.800
key is this for our message inside politics.

159
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.240
He's using this encrypted this message and you got the original message.

160
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.610
So this is it.

161
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.510
It's doing better.

162
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:23.030
Let me go for the more advanced which is and clearly already created.

163
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.520
This message and the message I haven't used.

164
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.620
So the message.

165
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.360
My name.

166
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.780
Still not a lot to get in.

167
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:56.510
And the message for me, so I'm asking for a message.

168
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.720
And let me mention one thing you.

169
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:08.180
Instead of creating, as you describe it, let we do want to.

170
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:21.260
Another news agency called this new standard because it's not going to take just a little.

171
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.430
I know the system, no.

172
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.020
Oh, God.

173
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.050
Kingdom session or.

174
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.890
Giving way to look stylish.

175
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.670
OK, now let us run this again.

176
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:04.290
So this thing we already we got all these new messages, this is what message you wanting to know what

177
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.010
I'm going to do.

178
00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:10.740
I'm going to bring me strong user and this is my symmetric key.

179
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:19.520
So it will ask me for this more, even more infrequent symmetric keys already generated internal message.

Hello, world, I'm wondering you can check your messages anyway, so this is my encrypted message and

181
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:32.790
in their equipment and equipment more, it's going to decrypt this message.

182
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.390
Oh, it's not like I'm mentioning here.

183
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.090
You can take in another decrypt them all.

184
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:46.950
You can use this and you can run another client for decryption also so that we can move my.

185
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:54.280
So let me do this in Java program.

186
00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:01.110
I am told that you can do so within a second.

187
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:07.950
So let's think about how we can create symmetrically encryption and everything using Java.

188
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.060
Hoping Understand.

189
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.790
Thank you.
