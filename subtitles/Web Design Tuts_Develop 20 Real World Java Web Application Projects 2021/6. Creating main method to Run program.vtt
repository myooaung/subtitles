WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:10.450
So in the previous part, parts what we did is we creating we created one glass with some kind of limited

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.680
private things firstname, lastname, department e-mail or the email generation application, or we

3
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.360
can see email administration application.

4
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.170
Inside this, we created one constructor name as email.

5
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.720
We created some methods for generating mail, asking departments, then the time the password.

6
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.790
This is a very important method to how we are using random random user, not it's not user defined,

7
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.050
its system defined or we can say Java defined already library in Java, then set password here.

8
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.990
This is also very important, and I can say for these very Lindi part of our project.

9
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.590
So what we did is or from the user, it will ask for what it will ask for the current password.

10
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.810
Password managers it will also tell you that you can change the new password, but if not, your current

11
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.620
password is wrong.

12
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.540
It will prove that incorrect password and you will be out of the that part.

13
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.880
So.

14
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.870
Let's see how we can use this part, like how we can run this part before that, we are not running

15
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.410
this part.

16
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.350
But if you want to run this part, you need to create mini method.

17
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.200
So why I'm using you object oriented, you can see this e-mail.

18
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.150
I can just put this like I created main material and I can invoke this.

19
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.740
But it is not very good practice, as this is already very lengthy as you can see now what I can do,

20
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.840
I can create another class in that I can create one object for this.

21
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.850
It will be very helpful to execute.

22
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.780
Also very helpful to understand including this, I can use that methods again and again.

23
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.740
So this is very significant, commented all in Java.

24
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.540
What about object oriented design and how we can create another class is very simple as we created that

25
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.230
email class.

26
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.060
Not similarly like that.

27
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.340
Just go to this email package.

28
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.620
Email at Package, right click here.

29
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.950
It will look good the options.

30
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.120
Wait a minute.

31
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.050
Click here.

32
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.880
This part.

33
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.700
This should you your all options.

34
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.080
No, wait a minute, it will take time to load everything.

35
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.170
This right click here, as you can see, Newport.

36
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.680
I want to clear java glass gelatinous.

37
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.350
And I'm going to put names, Eamon.

38
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.610
At.

39
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:59.800
So as you can see, both in other similar package and our app created our classes, created this package

40
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.750
and our app is created.

41
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.970
So before we proceed with this, I will import very important matter in boob job thought you did.

42
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.260
As you can see, this is very important legally and we already done with this celebrity.

43
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.090
Now.

44
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.310
In this, I'm going to create amendments, which is basically PSV.

45
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.620
Public static Wortmann.

46
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.300
And it will run our program.

47
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.080
Again, I'm going to create a scanner to see.

48
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.620
Or you can say it's similar to that scanner.

49
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.620
System not in.

50
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.520
System not in.

51
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.200
Yeah.

52
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.670
Then after this.

53
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.540
What I will do, I will ask for use it to put your name and their first name.

54
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.160
Then string.

55
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.870
Written string.

56
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.160
If name is equal to and not authority is not an exceed.

57
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.400
So or you can use the next line also here, or you can use next year or so, I'm going to use the next

58
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.080
only, not next line or something.

59
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.000
Then again, system, not outdoor rental and internet.

60
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.800
Last name.

61
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.650
And last.

62
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.310
Then

63
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.640
string.

64
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.660
And name is equal to his dog.

65
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.040
Next.

66
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.980
That's it.

67
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.740
So we're done with this.

68
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.260
No, I want to create some.

69
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.170
New employee, I only want to generate new employee.

70
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.710
We already created this email.

71
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.380
Now I want to invoke it this plus to disclose that email club.

72
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.830
Oh, I can do this.

73
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.430
I will first put, yeah, like, uh, in here only.

74
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.230
User.

75
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.280
In full.

76
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.810
Like this?

77
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.550
Now.

78
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.790
Really object.

79
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.210
Border.

80
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.090
You mean glass?

81
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.510
E-mail that e-mail, but email E-M1.

82
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.120
Although I can see object, I'm going to put you in, one is equal to new.

83
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.010
Email.

84
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.460
That's it.

85
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:52.870
But remember, before that bought and putting easier problem, is this this constant constructor plus

86
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.770
name and last name?

87
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.950
That's why I'm asking you to put the first name and last name, so I will put it like this.

88
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.800
If name.

89
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.520
And that last book.

90
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.540
Now, there isn't a letter in this book, so it will generate new.

91
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.550
Uh.

92
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.260
First name and last name.

93
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:24.080
But before that, you remember, we created too many methods for generating new password and then you

94
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:31.190
alternate e-mail mailbox capacity, and we are going to go to further also to see how we can proceed

95
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.640
with this.

96
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.410
What I can do is I will put your choice.

97
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.460
I'm putting it is equal to minus one because you can use the flag of shooting.

98
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.890
But I want to invoke it again and again.

99
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.560
So for this, I will use do I look?

100
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.740
Do I look?

101
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.390
Is similar that we create an orderly system?

102
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.100
Not outdoor retailer.

103
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:06.560
Then in this in the next lane that starts us, start something like then enter your choice or see me

104
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.710
again, I'm putting selection here.

105
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:17.330
And this is only for the what agency do you park or not?

106
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.800
Did you ever for some user interface?

107
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.640
One, two, three and four.

108
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.500
I'm putting it like that when.

109
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.990
For sure.

110
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:32.170
In full.

111
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:34.050
Then.

112
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.710
For Change password.

113
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.070
Then three four.

114
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.630
Change Mail Box, Repair City.

115
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.830
Slashing fought for.

116
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.110
When the space settled on Edmund.

117
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.220
And save for exit.

118
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:15.890
I want to read one exit method on some bayfront exit, slash and exit.

119
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:16.440
That's it.

120
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.880
No, we are done with this.

121
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:26.060
Now inside this, do I look, I'm going to ask Joyce Joyce is equal to his daughter next week.

122
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:33.690
As this is integer park, it's not an easy switch, guess?

123
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.290
Choice.

124
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.410
And.

125
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:39.570
This one.

126
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.640
Is this when is shameful?

127
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.490
So, as you know, we created this variable.

128
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:54.830
What I can do is this even when that object not we know that we have a method of getting full.

129
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.650
In that fight, we know we have one minute to call get for.

130
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:00.810
We already figured it.

131
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.130
Well, I'm just using that method.

132
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:05.840
After this.

133
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.780
Don't forget to put breaks.

134
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.840
Otherwise, it will show again and again that little.

135
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.400
Then this issue is.

136
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.920
Change password.

137
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.080
In one set password.

138
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.560
Mental.

139
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.510
Big again.

140
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:30.770
Yes.

141
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.800
Three.

142
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.350
Yemen not.

143
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.450
Said mill capacity again, struggling to get.

144
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.160
Then this or.

145
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.040
What is this case for ultimately, Imelda said.

146
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.940
Alternatively, I will alternate my lonely.

147
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.080
Back then, recruitment.

148
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:08.990
And I guess for you is nothing but just for exiting part, so what I can do is find.

149
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:10.810
System.

150
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:12.350
Not.

151
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:15.200
And don't.

152
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.370
Thank.

153
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.380
You are using this.

154
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.950
All I can say application.

155
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.150
And after this again.

156
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:32.310
But.

157
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:42.760
And there should be one default condition here, as you can see, it's too great a default condition.

158
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.730
System.

159
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.230
Not.

160
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.600
Of Don in.

161
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.780
Invalid choice.

162
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.070
And third, but I'll put.

163
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.190
Choice again.

164
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.040
Before that, I will put your submission.

165
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.300
Well, I.

166
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:07.790
This.

167
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.100
Invalid choice and that choice again.

168
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.220
OK, so we are done with this.

169
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.870
I want to edit this part.

170
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:29.080
Already created this file, so while I already explained to you about I hope we can use.

171
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.320
And that, if I put it, will exceed that.

172
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.100
So we are done with this part.

173
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:46.500
So we can run this part, but is we are remaining with our creating, fighting and storing into that

174
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.880
fighting and creating winning.

175
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.190
So I'm going to show you, I'm going to run this part.

176
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:55.910
In simple scenario.

177
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:05.460
Training, you can go to this also this all over the strip and you can see there is run out chocolate

178
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.090
chip in windows or you can check for other systems also.

179
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:17.130
Or you can use either configuration, but simple way that you can see here that the green arrow to run

180
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:17.580
this part.

181
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:25.160
So it will ask me an email and Dortmund, so it will run this email app and as you can see, configuration,

182
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.440
it will automatically detect configuration.

183
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.730
It will set the configuration.

184
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.810
Now, in this part, you can see.

185
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.640
All the building process here, this is output and everything, so what application is building?

186
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:46.010
So it will take time to compile then configuration, then directories and checking all everything.

187
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:54.750
So as you can see.

188
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.720
In this room configuration, our app is successfully deployed.

189
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.400
I can say I don't think so.

190
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.360
This is very simple app.

191
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.890
You can enhance your to more something like web app or something like that, but this is just the back

192
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.460
end of our.

193
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:14.830
So I will put here, like Jim's last name is.

194
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.780
B James B only.

195
00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.570
So new employees, James B..

196
00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.230
Now, what is its department and setting the sales department?

197
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:33.310
Now I want to show you your info, too, as you can see, he's in for it.

198
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:38.330
James Dalby, that company, as I told you, namely James v passwords.

199
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.580
This mailbox capacity and I'm not printing any mail.

200
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.770
So in the first part, I will show you, how do you can modify disowns?

201
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.150
So this is just, I'm sure, about how we can run.

202
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.200
I just stop this process here only.

203
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.380
So let us see how we can.

204
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:01.990
Move forward.

205
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.750
So I just created one simple scenario.

206
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:11.500
Let us add some this also because there is some mistakes here also.

207
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.600
Emails mentioned then.

208
00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:21.050
New employee also, there is one mistake that there is no gap between two.

209
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.050
This so this will help.

210
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.280
So no less than that again.

211
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:36.550
So as you can see, this is very back in on this very primary, but here what we understood that how

212
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:42.470
we can create object oriented design, how we can create system default methods use random.

213
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.650
James Lee.

214
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:51.340
Or I'm pulling for three accounting department not known for this.

215
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.870
You can see all the information.

216
00:14:54.230 --> 00:15:04.490
Let us see how we can use change password, improve inter-Korean passwords so the current password currently

217
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:10.300
and copy pasting this part only because I don't want to.

218
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.200
I wonder.

219
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.130
So it will ask for me and the new password, well, I will put one two three.

220
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:19.570
Bus.

221
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.800
Password change success will know if I'm hearing the info, you can see.

222
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:25.520
One, two three.

223
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.960
The password is changed.

224
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:36.800
And I'm not proposing any alternate you can take alternate lives, alternate James B and red Gmail dot

225
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.190
com.

226
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:44.770
And if I'm putting that you can see alternate said, you can search everything.

227
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:52.620
Let's change the mailbox capacity and put in here 1000 mailbox double change again, you can see one

228
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:53.020
thousand.

229
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.000
So we created this.

230
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.510
So this is back in part of our project.
