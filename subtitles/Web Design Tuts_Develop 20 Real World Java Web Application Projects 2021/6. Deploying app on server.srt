1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:07,450
But if you're saying, I don't, you know, we are already creating and testing here and actually basically

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,100
all the synchronized Java, you know, a stupid seven feet.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,950
And we already done with this.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,790
So more hijacks and everything is mentioned.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,230
Let me tell you what is the jobs he widows.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,610
The nation, which was in Java database function, really busy stand for January to boost connectivity.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:34,530
It's a Java API to connect the database, execute to create the database, form the update, execute

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:34,860
update.

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,620
Everything related to database began performing the Java.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,600
So it is about dollar for dollar.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,070
AC Java Standard Edition GBC API uses GBC drivers to connect with database.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:54,270
All different drivers we are using currently driver because we are performing Oracle database.

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,850
So let us see with this database what we can use.

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,690
We can use libc API to exist and loaded us stored in any dictionary database by the help of GBC API.

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,630
We can say delete the data from the database.

16
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:21,900
So it's basically API nearly API driver so that don't login if you see your name going to show you how

17
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,370
we can develop the spot.

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,390
So after doing that part needed to log in, I need to get back for Houston.

19
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:36,360
For that purpose, I created everything related to the register because you basically quite similar

20
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,350
to this with endless blank and everything won't mention her.

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,300
With the location, everything anywhere to getting this over everything at the mansion.

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,190
So next hour, I'm going to go at this, but this is it.

23
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,730
I am going to create my friend.

24
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,380
So new registered.

25
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,880
But this I need to get registered process for this process.

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,930
I'm going to create one try block.

27
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,690
I want to specify these names.

28
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,100
Now I created this new database.

29
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,250
If you want to create babies manually, you have to enter in there on a scale that commands.

30
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,880
And it was manually, but I'm providing this only.

31
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,680
So if you want to create this database, what you're going to do will be the service file.

32
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,910
Just going on this database, create a new connection and you can check for the Oracle, Okay, or Oracle

33
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,610
Tin, you can choose and you can create connections.

34
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,610
If their driver is missing, you have to do that.

35
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,000
New drivers earlier this year, there are different things.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,790
You can add it here, but we are going to.

37
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,100
High school is already deployed.

38
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,080
You can check for that purpose.

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,270
But Oracle's newly deployed.

40
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:53,090
If you want to respond to this proposal goes there may be some errors or some very.

41
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,570
Doing this.

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,820
So let's it about all these services part.

43
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,430
But in the projects only we need to create a registry process to create a registration card, then they

44
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,420
will look this on that part and we are going to create one just before doing this.

45
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:21,380
So Jim, I'm going to store it using this string username parameter to that, I'm going to specify this.

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:36,290
Then in this news, you just don't fall for it in part, as you can see, it is one of which is just

47
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:43,160
for fair and good, but I'm going to look this one in this and anyone wanting it is basically using

48
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,280
this GBC want and look, I'm going to fetch some data like this.

49
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,320
Select these IDs and everything I'm going to select and I want to create.

50
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:02,530
So in this part, I'm going to list this as a connection that's really simple, and we do.

51
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,270
Oh, let me show you how you can.

52
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,170
Create a coalition.

53
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,090
Well, first, let me tell you this connection, which already created.

54
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,080
OK, so it isn't all illegal.

55
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:30,830
OK, so let me add one more here, so it is not building because it's currently under review, so it's

56
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,510
not really going to cost.

57
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,000
And let me leave.

58
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,820
So, OK, now you can not see anything you.

59
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,440
Do your database.

60
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,750
Create a new coalition known you can you can just more quickly.

61
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,290
So this is what I call out is Oracle team.

62
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
Now you can see this is then.

63
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,160
I already read that the.

64
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,930
You can check for these changes to your system name.

65
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,800
Mine is for system only if we want to change.

66
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,780
You can change passwords for creating nation.

67
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:19,710
Then this connection you can see connection is like connection is there is a connection between.

68
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,390
This saw no need to change anything.

69
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,930
If we want to remember password next.

70
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,370
Then select ski mask is over 60 immunity people next.

71
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:39,980
System on default scheme, so you can see things soon on our database connection is finished within

72
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,650
this, so we don't need to create anything.

73
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:49,180
If you are deploying in the summer like look, you need to mention the contradiction in basically properties

74
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,300
actually in.

75
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:56,240
Therefore you need to mention post-victory dependency, which is related to that by virtue.

76
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,190
This is all the things how we can deploy or on this part.

77
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:09,570
So it is good to get this device, which is quite similar to this, which is select image from I.D.

78
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,810
And I'm going to put this and I'm going to try and put in that.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,620
But also, let's see who I can do like.

80
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,360
This is again, just a few nights ago, if you want to put your for you, get create for that purpose.

81
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:24,960
So.

82
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,320
Oh, again, to the applause for applauding part.

83
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:39,080
And each and every team upload image part I already created here so that see here.

84
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:45,000
And if we want to use, you're going to use this, do you upload and everything I mentioned already

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,190
here?

86
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:53,310
So no logic web pages, so you to blue cleaning.

87
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,290
So what needs to be done?

88
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,020
You can't help but can see.

89
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,030
But.

90
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,410
OK.

91
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:14,040
Forcefully unregister, so I just read this blog and really successfully close this.

92
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,810
Know what I'm going to do.

93
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,850
I'm going to run this project.

94
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,840
So it will take time.

95
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,600
And my bill is successful.

96
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,680
So.

97
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:38,210
We would do this, OK, now you can see my diploma and be successful if I could care and mean as my

98
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,880
anger, but I can go to the beach.

99
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,320
So.

100
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:55,170
I hate to go to the beach, sometimes you say time to scroll down through the park, but as you can

101
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,460
see, this is loading, but it's working really fine that it's moved.

102
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,080
Then this long embrace process.

103
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:12,920
And I'm going to specify this, so if you want to check, you can check your work log in process.

104
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,690
So this is the log in process.

105
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,220
It is going to use a year long process and it is going to deploy everything here.

106
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:33,960
Then currently, I don't have anything there, so it's not changing anything, but if I go to the admin

107
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,770
page again.

108
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,470
You can check if I'm using new user.

109
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,900
So log in as admin, I put here and mean.

110
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:47,790
I mean.

111
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,040
And when logging began to go to.

112
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,670
So here is who I'm going to create this part, so this is my admin page.

113
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,820
So Chrome supports because I was glad to be there to me is the beautiful thing again.

114
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:13,420
Well, this is all the things, that is the things I can take for these days to disclose your device,

115
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,730
your area post report, you can check here.

116
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,580
So let's see how I'm going to develop this more.

117
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:29,830
So post report is this you are going to post the report with your about anything you can do when you

118
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,900
get in force field report.

119
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,860
Pending your trade, you can perform.

120
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:42,490
So I'm considering only here one country and two if you want to add or you can add more.

121
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,600
Drop them in, if I log on, it will be logged from my page.

122
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:56,080
Currently, my system is performing very heavy load applications, so there may be some things in that.

123
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:03,330
And if I enter a new user letter here, it will show me the new user.

124
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,770
You can add the new files.

125
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,170
Also, as you can see, this is all the things I can do.

126
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,610
Then there is one discussed put on, so you can do your article.

127
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,100
Also, you can add your your area.

128
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,050
So you just like all we've for the globe, you can use your.

129
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,410
So that said about how are we going to develop this project if you want to add some more different things

130
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,220
here, you can add.

131
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,910
Oh, it's your wish to add more things, but you can see, please log in first, you can do here, hear

132
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,580
the new status, you have to use status and everything.

133
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,900
So that's it.

134
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,930
We are going to perform this, so I hope you understand this part in further.

135
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,200
Oh, so this is the full deployment of the software.

136
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,990
If you want to extend it more like you want to deploy on servers or you are going to do, Heroku is

137
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,010
one of the seamless platforms for this.

138
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,490
So let me show you this.

139
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:58,740
It'll.

140
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,110
So he always went on the cloud application platform.

141
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,580
Well, you can perform.

142
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,100
So this is not safe.

143
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,790
You can perform.

144
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,550
It supports many languages using this go by the time you need to, you go out.

145
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,170
So it supports which is a basically job.

146
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,900
So what you're going to do, you have to sign them disclosed.

147
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,380
But let me go to the one thing here.

148
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,040
All.

149
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,720
It is basically documentation, for part.

150
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,930
So in the documentation part, you can choose documentation for Java.

151
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,510
And in Java, what are you going to do?

152
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,370
You're going to deploy.

153
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,010
Java, absolutely.

154
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,290
So you can see it being a swimming pool for Java, applications can do everything here.

155
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,930
But remember, you need to install, you know who.

156
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:06,740
Oh, so you and my entry, as I mentioned numerically, you have installed that and you need to add

157
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,350
some standard equipment.

158
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,340
Everything is available on this platform.

159
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,020
Once this is done, you're going to get, you know, who have said anything closely with that part.

160
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,670
So this is it how we are going to perform.

161
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,560
So I deployed it on the software, which is basically local laws, but if you want, you can develop

162
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,740
on your local platform.

163
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,890
But it's new library.

164
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,660
So we created a global application using Java.

165
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,100
Hope you understand.

166
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,270
Thank you.
