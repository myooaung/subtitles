1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:07,630
So till now, we have covered everything about glass account glass and inside the option, many of us,

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:15,040
we have covered the noggin by then that's using that type of account, like this type of account the

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,650
user wants to make the transactions in.

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:25,840
You know, our next concern is to create a function or like separate functions for both, thus saving

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,920
account and or checking account.

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:36,310
So the options displayed by what that accounts should be covered within, they are different like separate

7
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,880
function.

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:46,180
So this public void gift saving is going to be the function for savings account, and the argument we

9
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,700
are going to pass is the account.

10
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,730
So that type of account is going to be the argument for this gift saving function.

11
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:02,530
Now, in saying this in a similar way, we will be using a Boolean data time for end.

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,320
Initially, it will be set to false.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:14,860
So if we are in the workingman, we are inside the saving account, so north is equal to end.

14
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,890
So when we are inside a savings account and we have not entered this process.

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,730
So what will happen using a trading block?

16
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:36,130
And so we have two systems that are not trained in all the five choices which are to be made in order

17
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,460
to.

18
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,460
Yes.

19
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,870
Make any specific task, whether it be New Balance, withdraw deposit funds or transfer funds to the

20
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,920
checking schemes.

21
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,950
So I think the choice is using sits out for.

22
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:02,670
For the first function, the type one, so that type one is for New Balance.

23
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,960
So type one, New Balance.

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:15,420
So this is the first choice inside the savings account and other choices that have been made in this.

25
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,050
Similarly.

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:25,050
OK, so inside the gate saving function, we have, like said, did all that type like the choices to

27
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:31,790
be made inside the savings account, whether it be New Balance, withdraw funds, deposit and transfer

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,160
funds.

29
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,750
And these are the list of choices inside that savings accounts.

30
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,300
Now we are like using switch cases for any of the options.

31
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,120
If they use their children, then what is going to happen?

32
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:54,610
So if the user chooses to view their balance, then it is going to like our full savings account balance

33
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,400
and like the variable is used for their savings balance.

34
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,680
So we have already created budget savings balance thing inside the account class.

35
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,590
So it is going to like access that balance from that class inside this option menu.

36
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,260
Plus now second case is to like it to draw saving money.

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,340
And the third one is forget saving deposit and the fourth one is the tax planning.

38
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,370
So we have created all of them inside the account.

39
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:33,990
Plus, whether it be the savings transfer calculation, whether it be the saving with the drawing board

40
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:43,310
or less saving deposit in the transfer input is going to be the same in both of a checking account or

41
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,480
other savings account.

42
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:52,260
So yes, this is going to be displayed whenever the users calls for saving need to draw our saving deposit

43
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,240
options after this upper transfer input for savings.

44
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,640
And if they to be here, then that process is going to be end and you are going to be like, exit this

45
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,520
problem.

46
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,730
And back to the main menu like we have already encountered inside the barking farm.

47
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,390
So this is all about the saving class.

48
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:25,500
Now our next concern is to create a similar class like this naming class for the chickens glass.

49
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,300
So yes, we are going to that and make that class also.

50
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:39,740
So for the checking account type, it is going to display the similar choices as the savings account

51
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,430
are, all the five choices are going to be similar.

52
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,970
Other differences will arrive just in the switch cases.

53
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:57,140
So if like it is going to display the balance, then the balance will be displayed for the checking

54
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,670
balance.

55
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,420
It is going to call the gift checking balance matter inside the account.

56
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,540
Plus, we have created this, so this is going to display the net checking balance function and it will

57
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,200
be just done.

58
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,440
So yes, similarly for the.

59
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,020
A way to draw, like checking with the drawing board and checking deposited input.

60
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,510
So all of them are going to be accessed from that account.

61
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,310
Plus, as we have used the luggage method also for that transfer input.

62
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,940
So if they want to transfer the input from the check ins accountable savings account, then there is

63
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,100
our dedicated function inside the account on Java for transferring money.

64
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:51,380
We have, yes, in the last part of that conclave, we have covered the transfer inputting, which is

65
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,580
covering both the chickens and the savings account.

66
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:03,830
So yes, this is going to like our food choices accordingly, whether it be the chickens and the things

67
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,690
we have like covering right now, the chickens are gone, then this is going to happen.

68
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:17,270
OK, so we are done with the border guard, checking function and get saving function.

69
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:24,650
So yes, navigating through this life savings account, these options.

70
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:34,880
So suppose if you were to leave New Balance, then this will be yes, the switch case will be executed.

71
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:43,280
And similarly, for all the options, the get method is like activated on that specific function will

72
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,990
be performed.

73
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,630
Now what's left like, we have to create account for the new user.

74
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,230
We haven't created our function right now.

75
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,180
Like till now, we have not created a new function for creating an account.

76
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,100
So our next concern is to create a function for creating a new account.

77
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:13,460
So yes, this public void created account is going to create a new account for our like are not already

78
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:21,350
existing customer and we have like customer number, which is initially set to zero.

79
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:29,720
And inside, the tribal user is asked to enter the customer number and like that.

80
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:40,070
And then like, get that entry by the customer and map it to that specific pin number.

81
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:48,950
So every customer number will be mapped to his or her pin number and which is going to be unique like

82
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,730
no other user can use that customer number again for making a new account.

83
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:03,980
So this is responsible for handling that and also that customer number could be in danger.

84
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,260
No other data will be allowed for no.

85
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:18,190
OK, so this customer number is already registered will be displayed if the user inputs are already

86
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:25,420
existing customer, which we have already discussed about the customer number should be unique for every

87
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,010
user now.

88
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:36,190
OK, so if the user enters anything except integers, then it is going to be a mismatch exception and

89
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,480
they were invalid.

90
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:44,200
Choice text will be displayed on the screen now for the pin number.

91
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:52,180
In the similar way things will be checked, but our pin number could be more like the same for multiple

92
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:52,580
users.

93
00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:00,070
Yes, the customer number needs to be unique for every user, so we are not checking things like this.

94
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,200
Customer number is already registered.

95
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,370
A pin can be like similar for more than one user.

96
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:14,500
So after the and throwing off focused on my number and pin number, your account will be successfully

97
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:23,590
registered to the system and now you can like use the benefits inside the ID management system.

98
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,330
Now, after this, we are checking the main menu.

99
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,180
So the main menu is about.

100
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,010
Inside this, this is the main menu.

101
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,950
So after the successful logging, what is going to be displayed?

102
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,280
Checking account savings account.

103
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:52,180
And so whenever a user enters this project, then load things will be displayed type one for logging

104
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,880
in and Typekit or creating a new account.

105
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:02,740
So inside the main menu, we are using triangles block for logging and creating accounts.

106
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:12,640
So suppose if a user like log ins, he or she is already existing users to diatom system, then get

107
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,130
log in will be gone from the account, not hourglass.

108
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,900
We have already created the logging function inside this.

109
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,790
And similarly for creating an icon, we have just created it.

110
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:31,810
So Create Account is going to simply navigate the user to create account.

111
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:38,650
And after this create accounts, everything will be transferred in the similar way for the logging method

112
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,440
we have created inside the account last.

113
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,930
So this is the main menu.

114
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,250
Afterwards, yes, we have exceptions not checking if the user interface set wrong choices.

115
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,100
We have only two options type one and type two.

116
00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:03,700
So anything apart from it will be like regarded as invalid and after the end, like suppose user enters.

117
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,860
OK, so if the user enters exit, in the end, we have.

118
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,250
Yes.

119
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,720
So icon, we do not want to access any of the gun.

120
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,970
We simply want to exit the project.

121
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,760
So if we type three, then this system is going to print.

122
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:29,140
Thank you for using this idiom, and the menu input is going to be close and system will be easy.

123
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,340
So this is all about the options menu glass.

124
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:40,900
We have covered so far, so we have options for everything from this stack to begin.

125
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:48,640
We have covered everything the logging net savings account, the checking account and everything with

126
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,140
that new balance and draw deposit and transfer and then existing it.

127
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:01,150
So till now, we have covered all that three glassell accounts, plus the main glass and options menu

128
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,510
glass.

129
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,750
Now let us try to like run this project and see that what actually happened?

130
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,780
Everything is working correctly or not.

131
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,020
And if there will be any bugs, then you will be debugging them.

132
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,150
Then again, trying to remedy.

133
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,360
So, yes, this is responsible for testing and.

134
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,160
So we are running the.

135
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:35,510
Mean glass and inside this, we are going to suppose create a new account customer number.

136
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,520
PIN number and then redirected to log in.

137
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,130
OK, so I think we have entered the wrong.

138
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,630
So yes, let's check that section.

139
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,560
OK, the wrong customer number.

140
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,790
So exception is working correctly now entering the right.

141
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,800
Pain and customer, no.

142
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:07,530
Now let us try to enter inside the checking account and deposit some money, so suppose we want to deposit

143
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,840
10000, then their balances changed.

144
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,600
Now let us try to transfer some funds to the savings account.

145
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,450
Suppose we want to transfer 2000, then the current checking account balance is updated to eight thousand.

146
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,570
And so let us try to, as we've done in the savings account, and check the balance.

147
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:36,780
So perhaps savings account balances two thousand checking account balances is eight thousand.

148
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,360
The transferring is working correctly.

149
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,750
The New Balance feature is working correctly and navigating between the type of account is also working

150
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,380
correctly.

151
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,630
So until now, we have covered everything about this active management system.

152
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:59,340
I hope that you all have gained much idea about what this project is trying to explain to us.

153
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,320
What are the concepts behind it?

154
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:08,460
And I encourage you all to make this project on your own and learn these concepts at events.

155
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:16,200
And I hope that after the successful completion of this project, you all must be aware about all the

156
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:24,780
concepts of Java classes and objects and everything about the data structure we have used, like Input-Output

157
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:35,250
exception, hash maps and the scanner in Java, like we are using the scanner in the most minting inside

158
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,000
this project.

159
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:41,970
So yes, the mapping, the scan and everything you will be aware about.

160
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:49,980
So I am completing this project on a good note and will tank you all for joining this session.

161
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,960
So, yes, try this on your own.

162
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:53,910
And thank you.
