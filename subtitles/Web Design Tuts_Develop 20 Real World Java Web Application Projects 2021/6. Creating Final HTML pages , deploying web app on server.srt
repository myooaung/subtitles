1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,660
So we already created everything.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:15,190
Well, let me explain what I created in the newspaper, so I added some form here in this British unit,

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:22,270
which is some extremely pages, as you can see, which is quantity and everything, and then a library

4
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:22,870
information.

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,450
So I created with mobile number and everything.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,770
These are nothing.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,440
I didn't go to jail for that.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,900
Esteem and purpose and everything I've created.

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,110
So this is all about how we already created this.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:42,080
So let me explain what I'm going to do is I'm going to just bring you the deployment in this fire.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,200
But let me explain what is room in Coral Gables and everything is done.

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,340
So this is a log in from.

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:56,320
Which is basically so let's then leveraging library and logging, I'm creating so.

14
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,680
You didn't say this of late, if you want to do you have to mention this again?

15
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,680
Then there's all the email address and password method I'm going to lose.

16
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:12,850
Oh, so this is basically navigation at the Ministerial Page Navigation Home page, then written book

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,340
form to form and written book everything.

18
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,910
So your budget each and every part here.

19
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:23,020
Otherwise, you will get sometimes error your way, log in and everything.

20
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,350
But.

21
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,950
So let me close this issue in a bit, and I will explain this.

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,600
So I with it in my traditional thing, but I'm going to add some librarian methods here.

23
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,270
Hope you already created everything, intelligence and integrity, Java, you mentioned everything here.

24
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,870
So let me do one thing is it is I'm going to mention.

25
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,000
User.

26
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,250
And it makes them mention the boxwood of this.

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,170
As a password, anybody can get.

28
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:57,970
So.

29
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,200
Look, I don't want to deploy it again because I already deployed.

30
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,620
So this is done in we.

31
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,900
Let me explain what is this?

32
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,250
This is the part which is a condition of a school.

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,950
Always remember to mention Julie Bishop.

34
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,820
Drivers don't see it.

35
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,630
So this ad part here, I'm going to add the part and what this is, this is done, Mukesh.

36
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:33,200
So this in the library and so we can see this for the library in part only then after this ad, from

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,990
when creating an e-book from it is just amazing.

38
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:43,340
But I written in HD email with the job up to the request, dispatcher and book form and everything here.

39
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,870
So there's nothing but just printing the statements, it's demon codes here.

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,640
Then in this part is also very important here, so it's adding the librarian inside this.

41
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,770
And this very simple and more lenient with some extremist pages.

42
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,010
Oh, well, then this is a libertarian form.

43
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,520
As I told you before today, your paycheck, each and everything you're written would not actual content

44
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,180
written book, but you need to mention various written books.

45
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,380
So let's again, then you have to mention fully specify the name.

46
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,630
Then you have to check this also.

47
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:33,130
Everything, so I look for me again so late, so we have to mention this again, so late.

48
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:39,810
So you mentioned this, then you also need to mention the foolish whisper names.

49
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,630
Otherwise it will do the internet ears again and again.

50
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,020
So our already created this part.

51
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:58,210
But remember, you have to be in this stricken navigation home page, also don't don't click that button,

52
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,100
otherwise it will start in the running part.

53
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,310
So now we are done with this part.

54
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,760
Some extremely on Zoom.

55
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,900
The navigation admin page.

56
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,500
I already mentioned everything here.

57
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:15,640
Then in admin, log in or library and log in of also mentioned the solid part here.

58
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,400
Then this is no longer just for convergence, let's.

59
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,060
And we should also mention, so let's again hear.

60
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,260
Then in the admin log in from the book also, I need to mention.

61
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,560
So let's start because it's really important here.

62
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,630
I library and also so let's not.

63
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:40,620
So.

64
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,970
And, OK, now we are done with everything.

65
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:54,500
Always you, the fully specified name and these admin login form or to inform, as I told you inside

66
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,190
the Java, then you can include some things because we already created this part.

67
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,950
This this is done basically.

68
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,980
Let's go to the lead.

69
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:19,600
I created one delete your delete library and materials like did because we need to mention this part

70
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,450
again, delete library and you exclude deleting the library in a library and basically deleting that

71
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,320
library in part.

72
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,550
And all things I haven't done, you should book is very important.

73
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,780
I value traditional form and it should be an introductory year for the form, literature and everything

74
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,090
that is clean and this first.

75
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,830
So you can directly use these methods, all you can create your own methods also, you're with a different

76
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,070
name.

77
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:50,250
So if you're in the marching output as a tool, you go to windows and that put your.

78
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,730
And hope you can see, you know, mine will be successful.

79
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:01,060
Let me run this last few server so it will take time to run on the glass, which will be successful.

80
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,760
Well, let me one groom was.

81
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,630
My thing is going to the only.

82
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,160
Then.

83
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,950
I will add that.

84
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,100
Part.

85
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:28,660
You can see this is my team and let me go you the aluminum, as I know this is aluminum 1-2-3 on your

86
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:29,970
noggin.

87
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,540
I'm going to add library and basically, as you mentioned, John.

88
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,280
John?

89
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:46,770
And the IT University in +40 gave one to three mobile number I'm mentioning names will be four or five

90
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,320
zero one.

91
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:59,470
Maybelline added Successful if I click view, LeBron is not doing anything, you this, so we created

92
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,590
everything here as a librarian and everything.

93
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,360
So this is all about how we can create our methods and everything.

94
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,920
Hope you understand this.

95
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,160
Always remember to specify some default names and everything.

96
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:23,200
Oh, and don't need to mention each and every time your or everything inside law library in the field.

97
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,770
So you can see some methods I already created like Siri and everything, so always give some meaningful

98
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,970
names to these teams.

99
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,240
And I already created this part again.

100
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,160
Why is it showing me?

101
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:44,380
Sometimes, because if you've seen my level in winter, there are four things name I.D. also yet.

102
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,930
So let me add one more thing you can see ID and I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going to mention that

103
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,210
IDs always some default thing you can see.

104
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:05,010
So entirely is equal to one, I'm mentioning IDs all with one.

105
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,910
And because I haven't mentioned that part post inside this idea.

106
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,160
So let us move this.

107
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,660
Let me make question mark here.

108
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,340
OK.

109
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:34,090
So because there are few, for instance, are this one two three four five in the library in Madrid,

110
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,990
also one two three four five.

111
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,570
So sometimes you can give it to me.

112
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:40,710
Yeah.

113
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,930
Second, this is the third.

114
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,480
This is old and this is it.

115
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,150
Then what is the first part is?

116
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,870
Yes, don't sit.

117
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,220
String.

118
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,240
One woman did basically I.

119
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:11,100
So you can do this also, or you can take your methods also like I'm using get name, get your name

120
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:17,190
on things not so you can use these onshore or otherwise you can mention directly like.

121
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,150
One here.

122
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,160
You can really play these things.

123
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,570
And again, you can check so.

124
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:33,730
Always remember have to keep that part specific.

125
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:40,080
Like, if you created two or more things and said this part.

126
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,960
Always, you have to mention.

127
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,300
Those similar things.

128
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,250
And you have to create some similar things on site.

129
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,710
John Howard University.

130
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,780
One, two three.

131
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,440
And J, one, two, three.

132
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,480
One reason they nicknamed you.

133
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,260
You name.

134
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,010
Submit.

135
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,760
Now you can see why these things are adding, because I haven't mentioned it.

136
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,190
So you can create, edit and everything, but I don't want to change this.

137
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,130
I'm mentioning that you can create a loop and you can do everything.

138
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,570
So I know this is my email for the Liberian purpose.

139
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,180
If I go to design, I'm despite.

140
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,770
And you one to three logging.

141
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:40,220
Now you can see I'm going to the login page and you can hear everything you just got a little part.

142
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:47,090
If I go to the ATM book, I can add the book if I click The View Book, I can click The View book.

143
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,750
Let me add one book is called Number One Name Is.

144
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,690
Wings.

145
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,220
It is a big.

146
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:04,470
Publisher is mentioning anything up or don't change that and remember quality and quantity I'm mentioning

147
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:12,190
to so bookseller successfully, you can see this will be an issue you should book if I created Calombaris

148
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,290
one student elitism mentioning S1 01 student name is.

149
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:30,110
James Student Mobile in lining up three four five zero one two.

150
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,630
If you look because you'll successfully viewed this, you look, you can see this is you.

151
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,590
If you want to return, call number one, it's number one zero one written book.

152
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:48,020
So sometimes it gives the error because it's one zero one is not inside this because you can see it's

153
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,560
one zero one.

154
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,300
Is this and you'll do it in that book.

155
00:11:51,870 --> 00:12:00,000
Always so this is all about you can create elaborate methods, and this is all about how we can create

156
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,870
each and every part.

157
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,170
If I create log in, you can see username and password is.

158
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,010
Not correct.

159
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:15,370
If I go to the home and if I put this, you can see the very know informal part and you can create item

160
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,030
informing you.

161
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,760
January is also I won't mention each and every year, but you can create such methods and you can create

162
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,230
a library in part.

163
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,270
Also, you're as a creator.

164
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:25,570
You're.

165
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,360
If I go to this and I believe you can do this, I can delete this part on so you can see now it's deleted.

166
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,870
Then no, I'm going to this logo.

167
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,290
You can do that part also.

168
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,960
So this is all about how you can create the logging method.

169
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,420
Always remember to use some specific names as I made some mistake while giving died.

170
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,640
So you can do that part also.

171
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,290
And you what are you going to do?

172
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,920
You can create one loop here and you can do it before.

173
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,610
Like, I just want to use that loop again and again.

174
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Using for loop, you can put after one, you can put the two second third fourth leg that you can create.

175
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,700
So these are all about how we can create elaborate motor.

176
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,350
So we created all this old partner waiting.

177
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,540
Now we are human.

178
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,250
We did everything.

179
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,140
Oh, then we created and we created so and we deployed on the glass receptor.

180
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,270
So this is all about our project.

181
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,500
Thank you.

182
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,820
Hope you understand this project.

183
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,890
You can build your own on things like e-library hospital microphone.

184
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,130
So.

185
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,950
So this is all about and this very simple project, I told you, oh, you can put a little more extend

186
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,110
to some garden methods.

187
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,250
Also here you can create QR codes.

188
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,510
Also, you're using some steamy parts.

189
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,040
You can change the UI on this also.
