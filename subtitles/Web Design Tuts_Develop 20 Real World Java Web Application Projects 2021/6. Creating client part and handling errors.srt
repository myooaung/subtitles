1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:09,400
So in previous part, what I created a trade which is using runnable interface and mentioning, I mentioned

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,150
you're in the keep going part.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,860
I created each and everything with the right message.

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,280
I'm going to write that message and that message for the level, a possible reason for the WHO is an

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,060
agent, et cetera.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,600
Everything.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,980
So I need to mention a close method also to close everything.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,400
So.

9
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,770
Notice anything but this part, and I mean, the latest version of.

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,630
As you can see.

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,330
All this is done, basically.

12
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,280
Now, all I need to create one right message part, also you're.

13
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,450
Wait a minute.

14
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,900
It is run by basically.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,040
OK.

16
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,620
Well, we saw the close, this is for to keep going.

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,260
This is for Darren.

18
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,340
So keep going.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,800
Should be ended first.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,880
As I told you.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,670
So let me do one thing.

22
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,700
Keep going is in the first.

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,470
Well, you can see this switch cases in the first.

24
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,340
Then after keep going.

25
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,430
Well, then.

26
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,600
Let me do one thing here.

27
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,990
This is for all with Jake, your lubes, because I'm just using this part.

28
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,560
Keep going.

29
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,070
It ended.

30
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,090
And after that, keep going is ended.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,530
I need to close that training, but also.

32
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,870
This is not at all the question one.

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,350
OK, so I created Alderley Keep going and each and everything and now news trading partner and this

34
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,600
is basically my glass part.

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,350
So what?

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,270
I'm creating new and created all things, and I'm in that part it will that closing part.

37
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,140
It will be directly through that user out of that sort of part.

38
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,300
So this is done, no work or required thing easier.

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,840
We need to create the right message material.

40
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:00,140
So losing my retirement in return, which is basically writing that Bob, and so bullion with connected

41
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,670
interconnected, that writing message error in the sending message and.

42
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,000
So this is all about server part.

43
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:16,180
Now we are required, some, as I told you, is in log log in getting messages and everything inside

44
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,210
a giant message to let me go with the chatting message chat messages.

45
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:21,990
Very simple.

46
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:23,650
He.

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,420
Let me import one thing.

48
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:35,850
In both Java and thought I ordered started because it was very important, but now what is required

49
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:43,860
things is this class is defines the different types of messages that will be what we can to exchange

50
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,780
between clients and so on.

51
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,270
So let me mention.

52
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,650
No specified this class will.

53
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,420
But a form.

54
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,250
For.

55
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,980
Different types of.

56
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,820
Messages.

57
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:11,690
OK, then second thing is when talking from Java Land to Java server, this lot easier to pass objects.

58
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,380
No need to count bytes.

59
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,410
Then wait, then lime and foods by each frame and saying what you can do.

60
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,160
You can create and parse that full object inside the frame.

61
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:24,670
So.

62
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,940
Is easier to bust wall.

63
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,950
Object.

64
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,700
Instead.

65
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,390
Of white stream.

66
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,080
Frame of BCB is really.

67
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,760
So I am mentioning here is I'm creating I already created it.

68
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,000
So I'm going with this, so different types of messages.

69
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,000
As I told you so these are the different ways in message, which is already in text message and local.

70
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,180
So let me let me suggest here.

71
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:15,070
So let me tell you, what is this basically status for a cuisine message and logo degenerating?

72
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,190
Well, if you change the Green Line, you can see the addiction, the buttons.

73
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,810
And so these are all private things you cannot change this year.

74
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,240
So let me create one constructor here.

75
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,720
And Procter.

76
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,070
Genetically chat message.

77
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:40,160
And so that message, what I'm going to mention here is apron strings message and I.

78
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,510
Bring.

79
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,300
Message.

80
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,050
So I already created this.

81
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:54,470
Then this tape to this tape with, you know, who you can assign to that part.

82
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,280
Then this dark message.

83
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,320
Is to message.

84
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:10,560
So these are all the things you can do know, what is required this year is get time and all the things

85
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,920
you need to create your book in your type.

86
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,730
This is basically mental.

87
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,390
Return.

88
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,220
I.

89
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:26,640
OK.

90
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,200
No more these remaining two more remaining injuries yet the message.

91
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,120
Get the message.

92
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,200
Written message.

93
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,610
So, David, how are you going to do now, you can see?

94
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,760
There is no it is there are some warnings here, but there are no errors inside our server class.

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,770
As I already created this part.

96
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,850
Let me ask you this part and save this part.

97
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,080
So no one ever thought we can run that server if you want, you can check also.

98
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,300
Let me do something here.

99
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,960
Let me run this over.

100
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,210
But on server mean, so it will run that part.

101
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,890
As you can see, it is building.

102
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,570
And it is raining and dust each and everything, so it will take time to compile each and every part

103
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:23,860
here.

104
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,650
But it's building now.

105
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,300
Our server program is running.

106
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,080
So in Iran program, you can say at this time that things stem.

107
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,390
Mr. Robot is waiting for the client and on board this.

108
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,700
So I will explain what is the burden each and everything, so our server program is low, you can see.

109
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,980
And this time also the program is like.

110
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:59,560
Well, you know, for their part, I'm going to tell you how we can do this stuff, our client and client

111
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,040
Java.

112
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,530
Again, it will be very simple, but it will take time for each and every part.

113
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,850
So I already created this part or let me use that part.

114
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,330
Most timely review.

115
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,990
So I will explain this blindness.

116
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:28,570
OK, so what is the message here is it will ask for me, the different parts here mostly declined or

117
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,810
notify us as input for its input.

118
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,780
Its output for that purpose socket is for the socket private string server plus user name and load.

119
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,630
Get user name for the user name citizen and for the site name.

120
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,610
I'm invoking this part for setting username, each and everything.

121
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,480
And as you can see, start bizmeter for that purpose.

122
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,920
To create that socket and put in that stock socket using some sort of work creates a trade to loosen

123
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:01,990
up server and your username will be saying there are no exceptions for the purposes.

124
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,170
Don't these are letting send a message for the sending message, discontent for the disconnecting from

125
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,380
the initiated exception, each and everything similar like this?

126
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,050
Now this is very important, but I'm stating the port number is 1500, although you can say one five

127
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,530
eight zero zero.

128
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,190
Why I'm using this port only because what is on that boat?

129
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:27,580
If you want to change this port, you can change, then change the number four digit number with zero,

130
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,410
two, nine and new digits.

131
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,190
You can change that.

132
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,360
Again, this is localhost sinews and then default is anonymous.

133
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,420
If you want to input, you can input that and you then scan it and directly put that in this.

134
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,570
Argument as a true luxury.

135
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,000
The debt limit is greater than three Garlock land use an important Amazon address.

136
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,770
And each and everything.

137
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,680
But if word is invalid, it will.

138
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,950
Similarly, it will do that.

139
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,100
Hello, welcome to chatroom instructions.

140
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,130
It will bring first instruction or even spaced this username.

141
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,740
Your message you make is that you can fit within for all the instructions here.

142
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,670
And I create the log in and load them into it.

143
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:20,160
Then again, I need to create failure and this is basically that no, what you can see this from this

144
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,600
part and each and everything I.

145
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,000
So let me turn this over.

146
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:34,000
So first, you need to run the server, and if you want to check more clients, as you can see, I can

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,320
run only one client here.

148
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,020
But if you want to run more clients, you need to use one plugin inside, which is basically my didn't

149
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,170
I tell you how we are going to do that stuff also?

150
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,510
Well, let me run your.

151
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:56,320
My client also you can use control issues often also, but I'm using the following year, so now I will

152
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,090
put names John.

153
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,900
So welcome to chatroom each and everything it will, my local news connection is accepted, and now

154
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,120
you can say who is in, you can mention that name.

155
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,740
So you can say at this time, John, I joined the chatroom.

156
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,970
So this is how are going to create this.

157
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:23,260
So if you want to learn what lines or you want to take, basically, as I told you, I ran this only

158
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,290
I ran this only at one instance, Glenn.

159
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,060
What I'm going to do, I want to run more claimed.

160
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,000
So what I'm going to do?

161
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,500
Go to edit configuration.

162
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,340
After edit configuration, you can see there is a one dialog box.

163
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,540
I think I'm unable to see here, but you can see a new box here first in that new box.

164
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,800
What you are going to do, you are going to create new configuration.

165
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:57,850
You need to install one ideal plug in to this ID, which is basically multi multi multiple plug in.

166
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,520
You need to mention the name of the plug in tools configuration to run.

167
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,440
You can see there are two things you run server and client run blind.

168
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,020
You can use that part.

169
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,440
So in that way, you can create your own or tinker.

170
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,380
Basically on these are some similar things.

171
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:30,090
For all you can say, adding the plug in each and everything, so you need to mention that which is

172
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:38,170
you are adding here, so I'm adding the client to it and then so what I'm going to do and adding another

173
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,530
client.

174
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,200
So as you can see, there are two clients I'm running currently.

175
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,660
Another name is Sam.

176
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,060
So as you can see, some have joined the room.

177
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,910
Let me add one more client here.

178
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,960
Is this in more detail than.

179
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,920
Lion, the.

180
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,990
And it will run the Oketch.

181
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,420
So these are another blank, you can see there are big lines drawn, Sam.

182
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,290
I don't want to diminish Johnson.

183
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,350
And this.

184
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,980
ABC, OK.

185
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,340
So in a server party, you say, John is then stem and then ABC adjoin.

186
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,170
So I want to broadcast some if I want to get queasy.

187
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,180
So.

188
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,280
What is the exception is writing in general, everything it's been.

189
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,770
It's basically not serialized, but you shouldn't put this on me.

190
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,550
So now.

191
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,950
There isn't anything news of this or exception.

192
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,580
You can print.

193
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,860
OK.

194
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,180
Establish the kind was awarded for no host machine, so now why?

195
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:55,780
Because.

196
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,840
Exception is and John has lived.

197
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,700
So as I told you, you need to mention each and everything.

198
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,550
Well, let me just stop this process was.

199
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,460
John, let me run that, John, again, topping it even.

200
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,620
So.

201
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,660
Let me run stop all the things.

202
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,520
Let me run server first.

203
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,290
Then let me run a line first.

204
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,530
He's basically John.

205
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,460
Let me run, stop and rewritten.

206
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,990
Then first.

207
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,290
Then let me run.

208
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,670
This again.

209
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,080
Which is basically ABC.

210
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,970
So let me check first easing.

211
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,080
OK.

212
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,750
Oh.

213
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,200
But then.

214
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,770
So now we're done with each and everything.

215
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,550
So.

216
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,290
What I'm going to do is I'm going to run the server first.

217
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,040
Then I'm going to mention the client here.

218
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,650
Then I'm going to run your line one here.

219
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,150
I'm going to run line three year.

220
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,220
First name is John.

221
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,970
Second name is.

222
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,680
This didn't want to go.

223
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,770
Her name is ABC.

224
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,650
So as you can see, Simon, each and every one is joining this room.

225
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,480
This is the John Howard.

226
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,810
So if I would, who is in?

227
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:58,780
It should be printed and everything, so similarly, you can create more threads for each and every

228
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,050
part.

229
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,100
So let me go with some more parts here also.

230
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,340
So we created this back in the next few days.

231
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,580
I'm going to tell you how we can create Java swing part each and everything.

232
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,130
So hope you understand this part.

233
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,910
If you want to check more parts here or you can go, let me.

234
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,510
Jake, first year, OK?

235
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,740
So let me run this again server by.

236
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,470
So I will tell you all the functions, you're lost.

237
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,190
No, because I heard mention that in earlier.

238
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,110
Then my line should be running.

239
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,090
Then my client one should be running.

240
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,690
Then my client should be running.

241
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,280
So as you can see, I can create more claims here.

242
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:59,410
It's a beautiful thing for what we can say Java and multithreading.

243
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,720
ABC.

244
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,770
So you can say all the things that are doing here.

245
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,110
If I want to broadcast message, hello.

246
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,450
I'm except getting the exception of my radio station because the river is closed, the connection for

247
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,020
that purpose.

248
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,790
OK, so similarly going to do this stuff and you can proceed with this part.

249
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,420
So this is all about how we can create this park.

250
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,880
In the next video, I'm going to mention the server part, plane part and jack message each and every

251
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,320
here.

252
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:39,990
So this is it where we can create all these jobs in the for the I'm going to tell you what, this part

253
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:45,050
also lets some Java swing and you are part of the client groups.

254
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,620
So hope you understand this, but.
