00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,970
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:10,250
So I hope that you all have went through the introduction and the working of the project by then.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:19,010
And in this fine, we are going to start up for this section of the game in our idea by creating a new

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,810
project from scratch.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:29,720
So after visiting the introduction and working part, you all have given a rough idea about what actually

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,850
we are going to make in this project.

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,230
What are the functionalities we are going to attach in the program?

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,530
What are the like frame designs we are going to put up in the hold?

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,980
So I hope everything is now on like roughly clear thing.

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:58,220
So now we will the like put up things in an organized way so that drafting into an organized thing?

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,300
So let us start making this project from.

12
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,620
Visual Studio Code Welcome page.

13
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:13,540
So this is the welcome page of Visual Studio for an hour, like the installing this idea and installing

14
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,440
do they get parts has been already covered previously.

15
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:24,940
So before starting this project, make sure that you all have already installed this compiler.

16
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:31,780
We use studio code for writing the four of them and also the latest version of duplicate.

17
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:39,340
So make sure that all the Java functions, like the Java programming, can be done without any errors.

18
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:45,430
So I'm hoping that all of you have already installed both of them.

19
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:53,620
So I am going to start this project by creating a new project, by selecting a location and then starting

20
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,150
the code creation.

21
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,910
OK, so look at this file icon on welcome page.

22
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:08,560
We call this explorer and on clicking on this explorer, we will open up our options tab.

23
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,420
So let me increase the font size for better view.

24
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:20,290
So I hope that that everything is now clearly visible to the viewers.

25
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:28,120
Now on this Explorer tab, we are going to select this Create Java project option.

26
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,240
Here's this blue, but then we are going to click.

27
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:39,730
So on clicking this, we will be open upside input like text field, and we have to select from these

28
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,130
options that the water, the toolkits we are going to use in our project.

29
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:53,440
There are several toolkits like MAVEN, Springboard Works, Micro Profile and so many other tools in

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,540
Java for making Java projects.

31
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:03,200
But in this project, there is no requirement of any other toolkit, so we will be choosing not based

32
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,160
all options from the lake.

33
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,710
This option taps so on clicking no tool option.

34
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,310
Work with source code directly without any windows.

35
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,510
So we are going to write the source code directly.

36
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:27,220
Like I already told you, we are going to write the code from scratch on this, each of the functionalities

37
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:33,190
and making my thoughts objects on everything like glasses on everything from that.

38
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:42,970
So on selecting this non-menthol options, we will open up the final selection of the project to select

39
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,950
the project location and the final user of your system will open.

40
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,110
And inside this file user, you will have to select the latter.

41
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,210
What is the format of the folder?

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,670
You'll want to keep your project in.

43
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,950
So make sure that you select the project location ready carefully.

44
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:13,710
So after that, if you restore like, reopening, it did not get like missed up order like you forgot

45
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,550
where the location also to make things like the less complex.

46
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,360
Make sure that you select the project mitigation by me.

47
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:30,130
So I am choosing backstop for creating the folder of the project that we are going to meet today.

48
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:38,380
So I'm clicking next up and then selecting the Project Location Input tab will again.

49
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:44,090
I've got like up in and ask for any important Java project.

50
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:50,070
To me, it is asking for and you have to choose earnings for your project.

51
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,050
And that name could be anything of your choice.

52
00:04:53,350 --> 00:05:03,670
So suppose like I am naming this game as not like you can name it, anything I am naming it does not

53
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:10,180
cross this, and I don't keep things simple.

54
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,780
I am not adding any and or any like above the punctuation things.

55
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,900
I am simply keeping the folder name and not crosses.

56
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:26,550
And on hitting enter, we will land up a new project like folder.

57
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,600
They automatically open.

58
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,620
So I am looking into and you will see what happens.

59
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,860
So I click then bam and this new window open.

60
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,600
So closing this meathead in our project window.

61
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:50,950
And there are stories in many files and folders inside this Nazem process project.

62
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:59,470
So now understand that we have scored all folders like in red folders, which are already like in big

63
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,620
folders whenever we create a dial up.

64
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:14,770
Jack in the studio could also live and see order in many folders of new Java projects, and the most

65
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,740
important folder here, which is already a patty, is supported.

66
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:28,180
Every important file of this code, like all the functional part of this code, is going to be stored

67
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,580
inside this SIRC folder only.

68
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,460
So there is no important folder of folders other than this is actually folder.

69
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,340
This is actually folder that is already creating.

70
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:47,950
And our job of file and inside this Abdul-Jalil file that are like already upperclassman and that last

71
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:57,760
name is app and this thing is going to execute when that is any of the exceptions authorized in the

72
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,310
application, which we are going to make.

73
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,740
So suppose that there are some bugs in the applications and the like.

74
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,470
Could the compiler want you to like the compiler rule?

75
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:17,590
How the compiler will let you know that there are some exceptions in your code LEGO and debugging your

76
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:17,940
code?

77
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,960
And then again, try to run me.

78
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,300
So this is a special feature that we have in Java.

79
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:32,710
Like, we have our exception and towing function, which with two exception whenever there is a runtime

80
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,060
in yet from them.

81
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:44,070
So now after covering this then Java file present in the Southeast folder, now we are going to pay

82
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:52,870
our actual file, which is going to be required to Lycoming, which is actually responsible for this

83
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:58,840
testing and running off the application and let Rachel's name for the file.

84
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:09,460
Like, I like the name of the file similar to the name of the folder, which I have chose, and the

85
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:18,220
file name is going to be knots and crosses, so there will not be any predominance of punctuation.

86
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:28,660
So I named the file as noughts crosses dark java and on hitting and we will land up to that window off

87
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,670
like that file.

88
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:37,360
So we have created a class of public not called noughts crosses.

89
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,920
And inside this, we are going to write that actual program, which is required for the functioning

90
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,120
of this application.

91
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:59,310
So in the end, in the initial steps for this project, we have to declare some of the variables like

92
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,880
the inside class.

93
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,220
We have objects we do not have idea, but we call them objects and objects that we are dual entities,

94
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,600
which we already know.

95
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:20,710
So inside this class, we are going to initialize some of the objects required file making this project.

96
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:31,420
So in the beginning, we are bothered about like creating the frame inside which the consistent of this

97
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:38,320
project are going to be placed so private different.

98
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:48,510
Private Jeffrey Amanda Alexis named the famous simply frame.

99
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:57,020
So this is the object of the frame, which we are going to like, make.

100
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:07,690
And firstly, we have to import some of the liabilities inside, which claim is consistent so far too

101
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,220
important for frame.

102
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:18,050
We are going to import Java X swing and inside swing.

103
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,600
We are going to like, call dear friend.

104
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:32,220
So let us write first this and then inside the G-string, we are going to import Jeffrey.

105
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,800
Yes.

106
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:41,500
So we have important the frame inside our applications, and you can see that there are latex animal

107
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:53,180
after which we are also going to like initialize other variables in quite so private text field is the

108
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,110
next object due to extreme.

109
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:57,980
Yes.

110
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,680
Heritage.

111
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:09,950
And that text field is going to be responsible for counting the squared off x like we have to place

112
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,520
accent.

113
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:23,210
Oh, and the second text field is going to be responsible for counting the score for oh, so replacing

114
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,380
it with her.

115
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:34,520
And afterwards, we have to like initialize to integer object for counting the scores of like extend.

116
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,590
So private then.

117
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:49,920
Private and an account, and we will initialize that gown, those Zino in beckoning as initially there

118
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,010
are no scores with any of the players.

119
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,720
So zero.

120
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:03,390
And similarly for like we have to change the variable, we can't put same name for two objects.

121
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:14,070
And in the similar way for oh, so we have successfully created integer objects for storing the scores.

122
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,780
Like initially, the scores are known.

123
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,560
It will be updated in order.

124
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,370
You will write.

125
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:27,000
We will like play the game and we have a separate function for updating that score, also after which

126
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:33,120
we have to like initialize the string, which will be responsible for starting the game.

127
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,240
So initially, the string is going to be.

128
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:45,140
So private string and the string is initially of the game.

129
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:55,230
So at the start of the game, we will call start again and we will set it up like we have already discussed

130
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:55,960
about it.

131
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:04,470
That's by default, the staff that is going to take the Symbol X for playing his last chance.

132
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,050
And we have to close.

133
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,840
This is growing inside double corpse.

134
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:15,650
And here we are, after which we have like nine locks taken.

135
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,650
But we did for each of the chances to be played.

136
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,000
So we have to like declare a night.

137
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:33,540
We have nine blocks for each other, so we have to declare it nine integer objects for storing the chances

138
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,270
of players so private.

139
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:46,350
Then suppose we have block one in the Magne and initially, like all the vault blocks, I say so then.

140
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,340
And after which we have to copy.

141
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,780
Nine times.

142
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,850
And then will change.

143
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,430
The one two, three, four, 10.

144
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,770
So changing this one to two.

145
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:14,980
So you may be wondering that's why the initialize these be one to be nine Madiba's 210 light, then

146
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:21,970
I can go to the grid layout so we can set anything less than 10.

147
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,910
We cannot set anything between one to nine.

148
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:33,310
Otherwise, the values between the blocks will overlap over one another and it will become difficult

149
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,580
to handle each of the blocks individually.

150
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,560
So we are setting value.

151
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,020
10.

152
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,820
Initially, we can take any value greater than nine.

153
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:49,240
It does not make any difference, but yes, but not take any integer between one two nine.

154
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,420
Now, similarly, there is that integer I like.

155
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,640
This is going to be the isolate for moving between the blocks.

156
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,260
We will see later soirées.
