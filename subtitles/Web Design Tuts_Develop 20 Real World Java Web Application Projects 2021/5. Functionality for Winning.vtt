1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:08.370
So in the previous five, we have covered the condition of player plan explaining the game, and in

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.650
total there are eight statements with some queries inside it and showing that these are the conditions

3
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.210
for making the player excellent.

4
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.990
Now what are the TOTALI combinations off making a player then?

5
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.340
So there are total this three three three three eight four six and eight four oh, so total.

6
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:42.390
We have took our 16th statement in a row to check that if a specific player wins the game or no one

7
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.340
so far checking that if zero wins.

8
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.440
So these are the assisted statements inside which we have written the similar combinations like one

9
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:06.030
two three four five six seven eight nine and one four seven two five nine one five nine nine three five

10
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.170
seven and at last oh nine.

11
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.840
So there is an additional issue.

12
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.030
We will come to this later, but let's take a look at this combination that totals 16 combination we

13
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.050
were talking about.

14
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.680
So there are similar rules for Fnatic winning as you are for the player already.

15
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.820
So we have similar combinations for with this.

16
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.200
So insane conditions are also seen just in the matter of fact that four player all winning.

17
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:48.600
We are updating the old count to +1 for Player X, meaning the X count to plus.

18
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.080
So you can see there are two blocks.

19
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.700
This is for the X count and this is for the account.

20
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.900
And if the player next means we are updating the scores and if X is, then we are updating the scores

21
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.770
above.

22
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:14.730
So this is the only difference in these two stats like FedEx winning and winning, and there are no

23
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.640
other like the visible difference I can see between these two functions.

24
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:30.540
So yes, we have covered all the possible conditions for making the player wins and at last, like we

25
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.290
have already assured them, I said we have talked about the dialog box and everything we have already

26
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.960
discussed, so we have a three to take grid and as you mentioned, possible combinations and we are

27
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.450
talking about 28 combinations for next winning and eight combinations for playing or winning.

28
00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:02.680
So the one condition which is left in both to the player's chances is this case in reads like I said

29
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.780
two nine and what is nine like that in all the blocks are red and no player wins.

30
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.930
Initially, we have set out those zero and one by one.

31
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.230
If the blue blocks are started selling, then I is updated like I.

32
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.920
If this box office, I will be updated the one.

33
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.570
If this is, I will be updated total and total of nine.

34
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.280
So if suppose all the nine blocks fail and none of the possible combination of above mentioned here,

35
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.180
I did not arrive.

36
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.600
Then what is going to happen?

37
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.600
So if I make them sign, then none of the possible cases above mentioned, I don't know.

38
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:54.210
So that dialog box will appear and say no one wins and this will be going to the heading of the like.

39
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.550
I am talking about this now.

40
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.580
We have we have already discussed it in the introduction, but a similar dialog box will appear this

41
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.800
way, showing that no one wins.

42
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.030
With OK.

43
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.450
But then when we click Now button, the game releases.

44
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.790
So yes.

45
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.640
So this is all done like 18 conditions by far.

46
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:31.270
It's common in both and like it did for our Newtonian examining and the conditions for money in both

47
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.650
Netflix player winning is if I becomes nine.

48
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.620
So this is common.

49
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.190
So there are total nine plus nine incarnation scored by fun.

50
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.330
Now this thing is, I think, completed.

51
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.410
So we have checked the functionalities of making that specific right now in the next class.

52
00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:02.130
We are going to set the function for choosing the player like this function name is going to be choose

53
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.080
player and.

54
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.010
If there is an if statement in saying this starting game.

55
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.660
So they're starting off game equals ignore.

56
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:31.240
Equal signal case, so basically expand or add height, uppercase alphabets only that are nothing special

57
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.440
in the same.

58
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.000
So does that game.

59
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.120
It should be so small.

60
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:48.200
So inside this if statement, if the starting case is X, then start and then next to players should

61
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.220
be zero.

62
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.620
So star game should be set to zero or whatever we see it.

63
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.630
And if there is this, there will be a notice, of course.

64
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:12.490
So in saying this, if the game is started, so I am going to copy the same stuff for this is and will

65
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.610
be stated and said this or to X.

66
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.940
So this part is covering that supports the Player X is starting the name.

67
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.510
So the next chance will be transferred to zero.

68
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:34.450
And if this is not happening, then the next chance to be given to X.

69
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.650
Of course, the zero is starting new.

70
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.710
So the next gen should be given X only.

71
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:49.250
So we have covered by far all the reigning cases like launching the application and choosing the player.

72
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:56.960
Now our next concern is going to be like initializing the contents inside the for.

73
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:04.010
Now you can see that this is our frame and we have to initialize contents inside the frame.

74
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:11.390
You can see that there is a great layout team which has five in a row, one three in a column and there

75
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:22.070
are total 15 blocks are like a banner title by then too, but it is basically an active and two scoreboards

76
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.530
for Playtex and zero, respectively.

77
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:34.490
So now that we have a dedicated function for initializing the icons contents inside the frame, we have

78
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:40.820
used this initialize head also, and I told you that we will be looking to it later.

79
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:48.290
So this is responsible for launching on the application like this application will open and after opening,

80
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.500
what is going to be consistent inside the frame?

81
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.610
So yes, this is going to be consistent inside the frame.

82
00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:04.610
We have a frame with the mercy of a different component of this main library, and this is going to

83
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.880
give us a new frame of this dimension.

84
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:17.600
This is not like Atlanta with the highest of all the four sides of the frame.

85
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.230
All right.

86
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:28.280
This one submitted by this line, after which we have our default node operation attached to that frame,

87
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:36.740
we can exit the frame and that will be responsible for escaping the window in which the gap is opening.

88
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:46.780
We have a great content spin and the modern layout is set to zero, so let us try to check that whether

89
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.520
the frame is correctly opening or non.

90
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:57.500
So while we have I am free, we have like this pain.

91
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.910
I was talking about this was the pain.

92
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:08.150
We have a headache pain and there is upstream of this dimension we have already discussed.

93
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.770
So we have already converted our frames, so congratulations.

94
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:19.670
Now we will be setting up 15 like grid layout blocks, two buttons and those scoreboard.

95
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.190
So let us look towards that.

96
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.520
What are required after this?

97
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:32.570
So after the creation of frame, we are going to create the contents of the panel.

98
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:40.430
So we have a frame and inside the frame we have a panel which is going to kind of consist of now.

99
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:46.330
So to initialize the things within the panel, we are going to.

100
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.510
So these two are the functionalities of panel.

101
00:09:50.780 --> 00:10:00.080
We are going to like bring it inside the frame and the panel is going to contain a great layout offset

102
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.130
three by five.

103
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:10.820
And then the weight of the border is going to be two by two, after which the panel is going to contain

104
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.860
a body now aligned border.

105
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.790
Like, you can see that here.

106
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:22.280
So I am going to run this and show you what is actually happening inside the frame.

107
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.990
So perfect.

108
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:34.480
The panel is created and we have our five by three divisions, which we are going to cover later saw

109
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.560
by the panel inside the frame.

110
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.730
And after this, we are going to add more functionalities inside the frame.

111
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.890
So I've been the life dimensions for the panel.

112
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:57.100
Now we are setting a the of lectern for all for Dumbarton Fast, and that button is going to be like

113
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.620
our action performing Gorton.

114
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:07.810
That is the action listener attached to the back button and an event is going to be performed on clicking

115
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:08.650
that button.

116
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.460
So we have a set that takes to start the game.

117
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:19.540
So if starting game equals ignore x, then Barton said foreground color to red.

118
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:26.470
So this first look is responsible for the first chance we are playing.

119
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:35.890
So suppose the first thing we are trying to play that John's my x, so we will click here and the first

120
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.390
chance will be played.

121
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.500
We are going to check this by running the program also.

122
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:51.340
So let's go and right on, Angela for this class and check that whether it is working on or so perfect.

123
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:58.260
We have set them back down for our first five minutes and we have also, said Barton.

124
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:05.920
Like our action listener, Barton, which is responsible for playing that fast just by default to exit.

125
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:10.930
So we have set the color like text for and therefore we will see it.

126
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.380
Firstly, check into that if it is working or not.

127
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.570
Actively soirées person.

128
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:26.350
We have set this part of working button, which is an event attached to it, and the button is listening

129
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.760
to the actions attached with that event of the specific time.

130
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:37.840
So we have checked it now we will go back to the program and look at the functionality.

131
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.860
So yes, this was the bottom thing.

132
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:53.050
We have said the button there in the background color of the financial blue and the action attached

133
00:12:53.230 --> 00:13:03.010
to the button is that suppose if we hear click that button, then X symbol should appear in that block

134
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.740
off the grid layout.

135
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.240
So yes, we have done this for the first panel now.

136
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:18.070
We will be doing this for either nine, like we have total 15 blocks in the grid now, so we have to

137
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.590
set every day for every day.

138
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:28.140
But then like we have a separate input covering inside every button so that ninety nine like the to

139
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.110
the grid layout, is going to consist the X's and 0s.

140
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:39.970
The four blocks are going to be responsible for starting this course off the what the players and the

141
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:45.110
rest of our teams are going to contain these certain exit buttons.

142
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:45.600
Yes.
