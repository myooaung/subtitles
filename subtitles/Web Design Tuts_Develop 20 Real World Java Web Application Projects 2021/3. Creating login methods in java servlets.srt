1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:07,670
Who in previous drills I told you how you are going to create this project, which is basically every

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,140
new project.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,790
So this is a very title page and I will create your make.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,620
Welcome, E!

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,960
So this is over.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,700
My name.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,690
What I can do is like this, OK, so these are basic name and.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:41,660
I'm going to create two things here or between logging, and another thing is Artemis Logan, so first

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,030
grade Logan Logan is very simple.

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,920
As I told you, this is important level, which I will put your footing.

11
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,630
Nameless for the Lebanese to post commentaries for the postings, and I'm going to add something she

12
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,150
had been longing for.

13
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,760
So we are remaining with now, whom I will create will now, which is basically going to the navigation

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,480
page again.

15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,160
So let me create one Web page, which is navigation home.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,990
This very simple page.

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,480
I'm going to create.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,940
Let me do this first, and I will add that my home page.

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,680
So this is my navigation homepage.

20
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:40,830
So once this is clear in this and it will go to this start, never, I mean, it's basically the first

21
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:46,580
page of this forum going to index, which again and like between EU level and global.

22
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,760
So I have to create logout admin part of here.

23
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:56,010
So let us see how we can create logo admin, so it should be in so late.

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,940
So let me mention that part also.

25
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,200
So let's.

26
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,480
Not.

27
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,390
As you can, as you if you know this.

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,700
This competition will seat again.

29
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,100
So now let me create lobotomy barcodes.

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,310
I'm going to show you this.

31
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,500
This shouldn't be this new novel doesn't mean you finish.

32
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,150
So this is my lobotomy.

33
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,380
I will do one thing I will be my new Simpsons movie star.

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,670
Then I'll get using.

35
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,340
Start here and.

36
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,740
Eugene, start here again.

37
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,900
So no need to do this.

38
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,610
No need to.

39
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,760
Nic, this production.

40
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,510
New York in the process request and everything is required.

41
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,420
So they do nothing but.

42
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,710
OK, so this in my class and I'm building libraries.

43
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,680
No, I'm importing when another library.

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,280
Which is basically.

45
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,840
Java, it's not so late.

46
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,860
Not a notations, basically, because annotation is basically there is overriding.

47
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,450
And nutrition not start, not OK.

48
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,660
So now I'm done with everything.

49
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,560
So.

50
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,930
Let me add one thing here and there it will be, so let.

51
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,360
And so in this bracket.

52
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,670
What I'm going to mention is you're so late about.

53
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,970
Name is logo.

54
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,670
So I'm done in this, no, let me create one protected award.

55
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,190
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to.

56
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:22,570
U.S.

57
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,880
Defaulting in.

58
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,020
Well, I don't want to waste time in this, I will explain this, but it is very easy for.

59
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,370
If you know this part, so it will do great, it's due to be the commission's response.

60
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,000
It was so without exception are exception.

61
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,400
That's it.

62
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,950
So let me do this.

63
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,320
OK, now I'm going to mention request.

64
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,000
Not.

65
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,800
Get session.

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,950
This decision not included.

67
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,280
So what will we do?

68
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,430
It will be invalidated that decision directly.

69
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,300
As you can see.

70
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,890
Well, it will be a good response.

71
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,940
Cindric United basically said that it.

72
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,360
It should we go in lakes, not.

73
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,100
So that's it for the logo part.

74
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,610
Let me read your comments.

75
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,760
Importing images.

76
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,250
Logo.

77
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,630
For.

78
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:40,800
And.

79
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,180
So now we are done with Lord Automated off our admin.

80
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:52,740
So now we required some more things like we created now admin and you can see a library and view library

81
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,340
and logo.

82
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,700
So we need to create some form methods once a year.

83
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,120
So this should be inside the solid part only.

84
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,300
So let me create your own phone.

85
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,120
Let me write this knowing why this is important, I'm mentioning the location of this sort.

86
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,250
Once they're done with this, I will explain what is the significance of this?

87
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,020
OK.

88
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:25,990
So for this purpose, and if you see here admin log in, you can see there are different bewildered

89
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,130
superlatives for the food papa.

90
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,170
So beautiful, but nothing but its ending of everything.

91
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,820
And then now home is basically the navigation home, which is similar to the next major thing you need

92
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:45,960
to required is also navigation admin for admin part, and it is, again, if you will pardon me, as

93
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,330
you can see, collapsed and everything but you and additional information on the library in port.

94
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,730
Now we are definitely looking for so I'm mentioning admin logging as defaulting here.

95
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,510
If you want to add some more admin here, you can end using ElSaffar.

96
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:07,570
Also, if you want to use, you can you switch gears also maintenance here, but I'm considering only

97
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,380
one part here.

98
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,580
Then in this rotation and for the next part.

99
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,560
So let me understand, I mean, look, this is what we know and.

100
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,090
Just knowing you created a lobotomy part.

101
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,100
So.

102
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:32,400
And then with this now let us see inside, but that part, we knew the admin admin library in log information.

103
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,720
Let me copy this part because I'm going to create a let.

104
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,810
Or you cannot see the dialog box because it's another window recording.

105
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,320
But the thing is very similar.

106
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,980
You need to choose solid, you need to mention the class name.

107
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,020
This is basically the copied name that part.

108
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,450
Then add information to deployment descriptor, which is basically X-Men.

109
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,620
You have to check that mark and click the finish.

110
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,750
Once this is done, I'm going to clear this because.

111
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,260
We already going through this, so let me use this part.

112
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:24,050
So let me put on packages, basically, I get so late because we are accepting that solid, but then.

113
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,960
Let me use this part again.

114
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,660
So, OK, OK, and forward to add so little, so then.

115
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,260
Not.

116
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,670
OK, now let me explain what is this?

117
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:53,370
So if I create a low level region from which I'd love to be informed, basically it should go to the

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,790
desired level library inform not.

119
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,800
OK.

120
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,340
Understand.

121
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,380
So very simple.

122
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,300
It is just for wording part.

123
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:10,310
So let me create one extremely patient for this admin log in from.

124
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:21,580
If not, it will go to the navigation admin panel, and we're doing that part again for new instrumentation.

125
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:28,470
I will use this and finish creating new initiative for this purpose.

126
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,180
So let me use some defaulting third year mission in Michigan and be logging informed.

127
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,180
And that's it.

128
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,400
So what is a librarian?

129
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,990
It should be the name, email address, password and mobile, so that's it.

130
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,190
Be required here.

131
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,710
Let me say this and let me say if you are not suing, you can see there is a black market and so you're

132
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,230
so adamant log in form.

133
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,930
I will again, I will optimize the inputs.

134
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,970
Because.

135
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,740
Optimizing imports is very important to.

136
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,830
If you want to describe all things, then it's no longer required, but.

137
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,940
I'm optimizing the inputs, and I'm curious.

138
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,570
Bolting.

139
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,440
So now when we're done, we try to log in form.

140
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,480
So this is done, but as you can see, this is admin, log enforcement, et cetera.

141
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,230
As you can see, there is one level librarian.

142
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:47,230
So we need to create some add librarian method also to invoke that and would be in the database because

143
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,450
we are going to use your database connection also.

144
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,750
So in their part, I'm going to tell you how we can going to do.

145
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Always give full name for that purpose, as you can see.

146
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,260
You can copy this from here because it's in a solid package.

147
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,130
So copy this part and you can hear again.

148
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:15,120
The admissions for longer than let me run this project means they will kill women and build.

149
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,120
So how could we know it will take time to clean and build everything?

150
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,550
As you can see, all in the libraries, we added some files.

151
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,360
So let me add another outfielder also, because we have another job.

152
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,720
John, let me add Alex Johnson.

153
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,760
So now it's added, and let me run this hourglass fisherman.

154
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:55,390
So it will take time and it will be deployed on your day itself, on your web browser, to the glass

155
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,020
fishbowl.

156
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:04,090
Sometimes it gives the error that bill is, then there should be a in Java or something that you have

157
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,410
to rectify that error first and then you have to deploy that part.

158
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,680
So this is just we are doing with printing and we are fetching the data.

159
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,720
But now what we are going to do.

160
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,900
We are going to put that data into the database.

161
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,420
But before that, we need to create one user in the database or a different user.

162
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,420
If you want to use default user, you can use.

163
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,250
But I'm going to create another user for this.

164
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,080
As you can see this no viability viability.

165
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,700
Well, as you can see, your module has not been deployed.

166
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,280
OK.

167
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:44,620
Let us see what is different and why it is doing so, as you can see in Lebanon in.

168
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,320
We created everything, but there is something missing always.

169
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,130
Oh, let me check, wait a minute, family's created admin log in for me, it's created.

170
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,040
All things are created, then what is the missing part here is basically we haven't deployed every part

171
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,580
like you can see that, I mean, and if you live in.

172
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,220
So this is not done yet.

173
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,040
So we need to create this method also.

174
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,810
So in the next part, I'm going to tell how we are going to create this part.

175
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,940
You leave it in and everything.

176
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,970
So first, create one user different user for this part.

177
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:38,290
I'm going with default user, but if you want, you can create another user for database and you have

178
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:38,830
bigs you group.

179
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:46,960
Some grid is there because you need to execute that part or aren't going to store that part inside their

180
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,500
database.

181
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:54,700
So or in further videos, we are going to create each and every part here, and I'm going to show how

182
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,770
we can execute this because we haven't mentioned some part here.

183
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,800
Lake view LeBron is not clear.

184
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,970
So in next part, I'm going to create new LeBron logos and I thought we already created.

185
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,200
So we will have it in method will be created in there and we are going with that, but.
