00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,020
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:09,010
So I hope that you all have went through the introduction, but and the working of the applications

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,490
by pretty well.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:18,430
And now you all must may wondering and the power of to the coding section of the application and must

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,390
be excited about start the programming part.

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:31,720
So let's begin this by opening the welcome page of our IEEE Visual Studio code, in which we will be

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,490
creating this application.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:42,220
And once opening the welcome page, you will be seeing like interface like this on your screens, where

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,590
you will be provided some options like file, edit and so on.

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,420
So on the welcome page, you start to make the application.

11
00:00:52,420 --> 00:01:01,570
We have to click on this File Explorer icon, and once you will select this explorer icon, some options

12
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,120
will appear on your screen.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,170
Let me maximize this in order to make it more clear.

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:15,730
So we are having options like open folders, long repository and future projects.

15
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:24,100
So we are going to create a new job up in L.A. from scratch, so we will select this plan and our project

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,680
working from this this explorer option in the welcome page.

17
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:37,360
Once we will select create a project option, then we will be provided with some options.

18
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:45,160
And these are basically the toolkits which are used as a support to make any application in Java.

19
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:51,280
There are two gifts like MAVEN Springboard Plus Micro Profile and so on.

20
00:01:51,970 --> 00:02:01,120
So in this, we are not going to use any soft Java support any tool kit, except like we are going to

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,430
make this application from scratch.

22
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:10,540
So we do not want to embed any of these supports in our applications.

23
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:19,380
So leaving these and making no tools, and we are going to work with source code directly without any

24
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,220
details, so we are not going to use them no tools in this application.

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,440
So clicking on normal tools and interface will open up files that are off your next stop will open,

26
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,070
basically.

27
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:40,930
And inside this, we have to select the location of the folder of the project we are going to make.

28
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,880
So I am choosing backstop as my project location.

29
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,970
You can choose any location of your choice.

30
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,460
But keep in mind that you have to remember that you have to choose their location.

31
00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:03,220
So and later, if you wish to like open the application, it would be better if you like remember the

32
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,660
location to make things more time soon.

33
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:17,920
So I am choosing desktop as my project location, and I input the text in the past asking for input

34
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,960
as our project.

35
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:27,880
So we have to input our project the name of our choice, which is going to be the title of the folder,

36
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:35,800
which will be created inside which the main folders and files of the application will be consistent

37
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,250
so you can choose any name for the project.

38
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:51,760
I am going to name it as phone ordering system, so my choice of names suggest that I should name this

39
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,360
application as this one.

40
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,920
If I want to give you all that, we should the name of that application, our projects according to

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,330
the functioning of that.

42
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:11,770
So that data makes us clear in future that what actually this project was made for.

43
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:22,090
Like, suppose if I named this application as a whatever any of the X-Y-Z on any other like fancy name,

44
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,950
but that would not help me in any way in future.

45
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,780
So it was an infusion.

46
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:37,650
I have to sign that whether I have made the food ordering system application in my boss and I would

47
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,070
like, I am not remembering that I have created this.

48
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:51,100
So this will be like very complex inserting like a b c x y z or anything, any fancy name and so on.

49
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:58,210
Things becomes complex on naming applications, you know, fancy or anything like anonymous things,

50
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,140
so we shouldn't name our app.

51
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:09,300
Occasion in such a way that then becomes easier for us to find the gold like what is the significance

52
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,680
of this application?

53
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,680
So name your project projects wisely.

54
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:21,320
Choose appropriate name for your applications in order to make things more like it.

55
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:27,750
This was basically a tape I wanted to give you all of the but otherwise it's upon you.

56
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,110
If you remember things, then you can name any names.

57
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:39,120
So, yes, I have selected the name for my project food ordering system, and now I even hit enter to.

58
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:49,530
Land into our projects, folder soirÃ©es we have and turned our projects folder, and there are some

59
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:58,870
inbuilt folders in this project, so we have selected the key project option from the Explorer tab and

60
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:06,180
inside this project called US Food Ordering System, we have our darndest and not in the squad folders

61
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,960
and these folders are written myself.

62
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,860
I'm going to compile.

63
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,040
This has nothing to do with our project.

64
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:22,890
We are not going to use these two folders in our project in any views so that ignore these do we are

65
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:29,580
going to use this site see folder as a whole body of our project?

66
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,520
So suppose that is a body.

67
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,050
So inside the body may have body parts.

68
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:45,410
So this SIAC folder is the body which is going to contain the parts of our project and these parts,

69
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:54,150
I say I mean that files and folders, which will be consistent inside this ASIC folder and will be totally

70
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,660
responsible for testing and running of the application.

71
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:07,050
OK, so now switching to the prototype, which we made in our to so like understand the functionalities

72
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:14,290
and workings of this application, the first thing was to create a new project in which we have done

73
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:14,980
already.

74
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,420
Now in the next part, we will be creating a main class of this project.

75
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,220
Inside this are simple line.

76
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,570
As I said, this is the main body of our application.

77
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,080
So creating the main class, calling it label dart the job.

78
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,990
So we have to create finds and miles creating files.

79
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,800
We have to keep in mind that these file names should end with dark java.

80
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,820
So in order to make it as our program files.

81
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:54,700
So we have to enlarge our as a necessity while making files inside the folder on any object inside any

82
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,480
other folder.

83
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:02,470
So the main glass is called as labelled our java on head thing, and then we will be landing in the

84
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,260
label that is our logo file.

85
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,750
And we will be.

86
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:08,820
Yes.

87
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:17,680
So there is already a class main called App Dot Java, and this after Java then run once there will

88
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,780
be any exception in our app.

89
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:28,780
So this app Java will run in case of any runtime set arising in our application.

90
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,410
So basically, it has no functional use in our application.

91
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:44,050
It is just an inbuilt file inside this default and contains no functionality of our application.

92
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,580
So yes, we have created a label that Java file.

93
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:55,420
Now inside this, we've been declaring a class which will be called as a label.

94
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,750
So we have labelled jealous in a class name is going to be labeled.

95
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,310
This is a public class.

96
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:11,230
And inside it, we will be like declaring some of the variables or we can qualify as objects as there

97
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,950
is a class.

98
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:22,930
So in third class, we have objects, and inside this class we are like declaring the objects as public

99
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,680
static.

100
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,380
Final long.

101
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:35,510
So these are the optics which are going to be used in our application.

102
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:45,910
OK, so these are the objects required in this project in order to make the form complete for ordering

103
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:53,770
the food items, and these objects are from the single library.

104
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,030
So you have to import in order to make things working.

105
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,010
So we are importing everything one by one importing data.

106
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,020
I am already like this first this that we are going to like.

107
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:15,010
Use this Minion NWT frameworks extensively, so we are doing that now.

108
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:26,380
So we have imported all the objects here from Java Swing and Java Swing is the main circuit which is

109
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,430
responsible for making the frame of the application.

110
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:40,180
So inside this class, we are going to initialize the constructor called as labels as well.

111
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:50,140
So this public label constructor is going to contain the layout of the lake, how the interface will

112
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,440
look.

113
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:57,010
So a sad thing now, Tim NULL, as this is going to be in default state.

114
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,890
So we have set the layout now.

115
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:06,700
We are going to set the size of the frame and the size is going to be suppose.

116
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:18,810
The said size is going to be 600 by 400 are the height and weight of the application, and we have to

117
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:25,380
import something in order to make paint like we have not demonstrated the metric.

118
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,030
So we will see it sometime later in this class as well.

119
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:39,240
Firstly, let us set everything in order to make the frame ideal, like the water frame is going to

120
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,870
look as so location delayed if you.

121
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,580
Relative to.

122
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,660
None.

123
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,020
This is also going to be nuts and after this.

124
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,200
We are going to.

125
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,910
Said some more things.

126
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:04,210
OK, so before setting the size and layout of the frame.

127
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:13,600
Firstly, we should discuss the water, the objects we are going to use while making this frame on application,

128
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:22,840
we can say anyways, so we are the initializing along the water type for Virgin.

129
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,450
So we have a serial number for every menu item.

130
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,020
Similarly, we have like four levels.

131
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,640
We can see it here.

132
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,510
So we have labels for size, for how many glasses we want to order.

133
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:48,880
And similarly, for the report and beverage, we have ordered that dialog box will have also contains

134
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,360
labels.

135
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,830
So if you like, memorize it, you will get to know.

136
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,530
So this label is for all the labels inside the application.

137
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:10,330
Similarly, this combo box method, that type of string is responsible for this size, like the combo

138
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,660
box is basically that are what we call it.

139
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:22,030
It is not like options which you are pairing her as the Mali medium large.

140
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:32,910
You can see her small, medium large, and these are possible with the help of a combo box or the sizes

141
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,200
that are three sizes in whole.

142
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,300
Also, we have radio buttons for all the items in the menu.

143
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,510
We have already discussed in the introduction five that these radio buttons.

144
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,580
One two three four.

145
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:55,810
According to our choices, that how many radio buttons we are going to use in eastern Libya are like

146
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,590
declaring for radio buttons for juice, water and coffee.

147
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:09,430
Similarly, for Bathurst, we have buttons and order, so Button Group is to be declared before and

148
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:16,390
then after we are run, initializing the martins with the help of Britain and with the Northern.

149
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,760
Also for the state laws, we are declaring a next free.

150
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,930
But how many glasses of the specific item from the menu we want to order an amount of.

151
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:37,120
So this is that antigen which is going to like, contain the amount of this fight.

152
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,410
Next, you so this is going to take integer outputs input.

153
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,640
So we are going to save it does amount to with the help of this.

154
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:55,930
So we have declared all the objects associated with this application.

155
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:06,640
Now in the next five, we will be looking at adding some more stymie and force with separate beverages

156
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:14,470
as coffee bean, water use and add ons attached to it will be declared in size.

157
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:22,060
Those glasses only so everything will be attached inside the glasses, and we have to add functionalities

158
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,470
of each menu item within their glasses only.

159
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,230
