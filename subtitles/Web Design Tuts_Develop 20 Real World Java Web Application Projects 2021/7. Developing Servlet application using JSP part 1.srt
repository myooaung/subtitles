1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:09,960
So we already created one command lemak for this, so now we're going to create one solid F or web application

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,370
platform using this symmetric key encryption anti-corruption.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:23,550
So considering I'm using encryption pardon decryption part, the same interface for my purpose for the

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,010
project proposed to display, it's working.

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,730
But what you can do?

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,240
You can create two different programs for such things, and you can display that.

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,670
So let me show you how we're going to work on this is it'll be inside a button inside.

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,690
You can choose this Aurelien choose endangered for web development, but preferably for web development.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,620
If you want to simplify this, you will be thinking instead of using in danger.

10
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,080
So he'd enter.

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,690
The new project will be Java, the application or I'm giving them as.

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,610
Encryption.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:19,520
Oh, my name for this kid next to their server, I'm using Glasby Server Java eight even context for

14
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,880
you.

15
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,970
And then the next belongs to basically anything if you want to specify Marvin's application, which

16
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,420
bring go with this, otherwise never do anything.

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,110
Yeah.

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,120
So it will create logic for us default, which of course.

19
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,030
So wait for something it will look.

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,730
So, OK, so now we then will cover encryption.

21
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:54,970
So this is indeed not criminal, and it's in my individual testimony, and you may find all these things

22
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,240
here.

23
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,340
Source packages, these things and all the things to manifest.

24
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,030
So let me just because.

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:15,510
Also discarded in the Web, we never required delayed in big stories to me because I'm wounded GSP,

26
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,400
we're just jealous.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,250
So litigious.

28
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,740
So know what I look.

29
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm going to create here one filter.

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,450
So what is a filter in the default package, you can create new packages also.

31
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,690
No, I like it.

32
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,240
So let me mention one Java package as

33
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,510
any sort of game.

34
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,520
OK.

35
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,370
In this encrypted, I'm going to create a new order.

36
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,780
What is a dirty Indonesian?

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,390
I'm going to create a filter here.

38
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:56,090
Next name address in group printer.

39
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,170
I'm going to mention those in group filter.

40
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,360
Then you turn the nest egg smell.

41
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,760
Oh, and I need to you the.

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,220
Enter at least one you are editing, so I need to enter this, so to that request.

43
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,210
Thank you.

44
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,520
Everything is mentioned below.

45
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,900
All three so and influential African-Americans.

46
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,820
Okay, so I need to mention this next.

47
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:44,320
So in the encrypted I created, one filter filter is limiting, but you can sing all the tunes that

48
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,360
already mentioned here.

49
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:52,480
Saw this package and delete these 20 lines.

50
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,250
Because it always comes with some important things that we.

51
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,320
Also, just like so latest showing me the error.

52
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,350
Let me tell you why it's showing the error.

53
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:19,340
First, let me add Library Johto, which is Java X.

54
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:29,380
And if you haven't been installed, my suggestion is already download Java Celebrity.

55
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,060
So I already added Java exceed my heart, so.

56
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,900
Wait a minute.

57
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,720
I did it all wrong, you.

58
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,010
John Ford, famed for La Jolla, exciting to.

59
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:16,000
And you do you fix excuse for delay affects you, so it will take you out of this part, guys.

60
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,550
And what I'm going to create here is to remove these points.

61
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,390
I need to remove some part.

62
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,380
And let me tell you, I am doing this later.

63
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,620
Let it be known about this material because this is no longer required.

64
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,110
The right good part and everything they mention.

65
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,310
It's not always working.

66
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,420
Released in the inner cities.

67
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,360
This is the filter, basically.

68
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,900
And let me do one thing.

69
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,990
The not of more concern.

70
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,850
They're to remove all the things you're currently and.

71
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,600
Let me add

72
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:58,690
my things here first, so I created different things, so let me implement my own things here.

73
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,990
And it.

74
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,600
Package name.

75
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,690
In.

76
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,320
And let me implement some in to you.

77
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:02,030
Then let me I used your other team, so let me mention these things also.

78
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,960
So this is just lurking here.

79
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,920
Then law filings need to change.

80
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,480
So change it accordingly.

81
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,160
I will tell you what this is doing and everything.

82
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,870
So this is just a filter.

83
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,500
We threw that in for.

84
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,420
With all the message.

85
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,470
And everything.

86
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:36,440
So when we're done with this, Peter King, but we required a one page order, you can say GST.

87
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,270
Let me mention this peace index.

88
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,580
Looking to finish because in these jobs, very important you.

89
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,230
Check whether your files are ready.

90
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,550
We've not examined.

91
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,320
So.

92
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:12,310
There is no way Botox, family or creators, so we need to create this framework and also.

93
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,010
In later part, we did our reporter noting.

94
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,630
If you hit the properties.

95
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,130
You learn the idea on the property, so let me add in next page for you.

96
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,680
So this is so late, I'm adding with my.

97
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,970
And.

98
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,060
But.

99
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,470
In.

100
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,850
Encryption like encryption.

101
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,400
So we created this.

102
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,090
Now let me tell you what, we are missing.

103
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,150
We created one filter thing, but.

104
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,270
If you check.

105
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,280
Let me check with the.

106
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,680
There is an option.

107
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,530
OK, so I made one mistake.

108
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:45,800
You're.

109
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,660
Basically, it's very hubristic, actually.

110
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,920
I haven't heard it in the broad experience.

111
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,530
Didn't create one thing to do with encryption.

112
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,280
Senator.

113
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,490
Next and information, click next.

114
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,190
OK, so now it will added that part in my.

115
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,120
You get me copying that clock again.

116
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,250
I need to refactor this file, also the rename.

117
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,030
What I then it is encrypted, incorrect feeding.

118
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,650
Because I read in the paper economy.

119
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,450
And that's a very huge mistake.

120
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
Later, he picked.

121
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,600
Slide showing me the era.

122
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,630
OK, OK.

123
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,310
So it will take time to effect the list.

124
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:30,210
It's not raining here, but truly, it's OK.

125
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,010
And we've not examined you mentioned the freedoms earlier.

126
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,680
If you want to check our filter, is it working or not?

127
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,020
Press cleaning to windows and us?

128
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,180
You can check here, but let me tell you what is the encryption filter is working here.

129
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:55,940
So this is just like a backing bar with filtration, but like I'm adding what I'm going to do.

130
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:07,130
I'm going to create the one database in the jar off label, creating log file in Java file only restore

131
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,570
all this encryption keys.

132
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,440
OK.

133
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,070
So as you can see, believe success will define the new.

134
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,600
He OK when you have already been auctioned off suit.

135
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,060
I don't believe.

136
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,260
Specifying that location also.

137
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,900
Starting my police service will take time for something, but it will work, so in the next part, boredom

138
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,370
and booze show you.

139
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,570
I already created this in the next part of what I'm going to create.

140
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:55,150
I'm going to create one see our friend in part for this purpose to create one response, response and

141
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,660
everything.

142
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,190
And I'm again going to use.

143
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,050
And remember, I am using filter instead of creating the servlet.

144
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:11,710
So Luke can easily anyone can check that part by the filter team.

145
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,800
No one can change easily.

146
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,720
So it's currently running and starting.

147
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,400
New York, the silver.

148
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,900
OK, it's looking.

149
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,230
Move back, I presume you.

150
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,630
So for the first time deployment, it will take time.

151
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:49,460
After that, it will really give you the starting circle.

152
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,940
So.

153
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,070
It mean running.

154
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,840
And while it's running a what is this thing?

155
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,530
So instead of using directly these things.

156
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,240
So let what I can do.

157
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,270
I can create one filter pipe and filter is just like food information.

158
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,180
So there is one mesh in filters.

159
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,400
As you can see, there are different log methods also stored in one file, which which.

160
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,580
We brought in, as you can see.

161
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,130
So that's my painting I created.

162
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,840
But that simple thing and.

163
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,790
So currently, different frameworks are deploying their own work.

164
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,880
And it's in place of employment.

165
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:50,910
So remember, you have to always add, I made the mistake, and when when that bogged in that we similar.

166
00:15:51,270 --> 00:16:00,840
So what I work on this, as you can see, not really wrong, but you need to create another way broadcast

167
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,980
on your own.

168
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,250
So.

169
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,410
That's very.

170
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,160
Not a good thing to go home again and again.

171
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,960
So currently, it's still working to be successful and working.

172
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,090
No, wait a minute in this room.

173
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:34,080
OK, you you don't kick over encryption as was working in and do application, so we in this part know

174
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,720
the further part.

175
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:41,270
What I'm read, I'm going to create one similarly between index and everything part in later.

176
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,440
Hope you understand.

177
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,890
Thank you.
