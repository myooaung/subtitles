1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,440
Well, our project is basically we are going to create a chat application.

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:13,850
So we already created three classes server client chat message server for the server establishment,

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,160
90 for the user side and chat messages for the handling on legitimate use.

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,060
So I immediately glasses or you can see three job offer this year.

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,690
So first, I'm building this.

6
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,640
Which is basically sort of what if I.

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:38,120
So as I told you in previous sessions, I did this and I created a constructor.

8
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,760
Am creating or start?

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,220
And each and everything.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,040
Always remember these start and some run out.

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,930
Both are related to the.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,420
Basically related to the what we consider trading concepts.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,030
So is what I'm going to do is I'm going to build a function to stop a server.

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,130
I'm going to create a function to stop serving, and it's protected.

15
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,290
Protected void stop.

16
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,110
My pleasure only.

17
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:25,060
Then, you know, there is one information keep going is equal to wholesome telling here.

18
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:33,690
And creating a trap because all settlements should be and then you it.

19
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,560
Introduce a new dimension local post.

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:41,980
All.

21
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,670
And.

22
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,420
Wanting to lose.

23
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Match exception.

24
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,730
He.

25
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,680
Kim wrote a book detailing.

26
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:13,370
So we handle this exhibition, and I created to stop this, then I need to create.

27
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,730
So do you remember why I created a project and because I'm going to use in saying this only I'm not

28
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,390
invoking injuring the client or I can use this as protected also.

29
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:25,940
So.

30
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,450
The specified is protected.

31
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,100
This May.

32
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,080
Even consume and consume or do we consume a function private?

33
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:41,900
Would.

34
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,670
Display.

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,070
Dream.

36
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,260
I'm bringing a message here.

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,670
But and you bang, so basically saying time is equal to is death dot format.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,210
And so this what I'm going to do is I'm going to specify this new.

39
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,270
Did.

40
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,720
As it is.

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,010
Plus.

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,320
This this.

43
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,340
Even even with this special edition.

44
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,170
So we are a great addition and wouldn't lose anything, but just not.

45
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,150
Not println.

46
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,150
What I do, I'm going to bring it in.

47
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,410
So now I am going to create a synchronized shooting.

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,410
Or you can say.

49
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,080
Who brought the cost?

50
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,130
Message.

51
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,680
Two on.

52
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:15,570
Of claims, this private, synchronized world wide shouldn't be synchronized, I will tell you.

53
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,190
Bullion.

54
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,020
Broadcast.

55
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,000
Because I'm going to handle it in a trade.

56
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,490
So it should be synchronized on this show, I created synchronized stream.

57
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,030
Already created, imagine for him creating your message.

58
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,450
Now, I understand this very important and timestamp.

59
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,490
Bring.

60
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,090
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this because I'm going to use this again.

61
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,790
For broadcasting the message.

62
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,200
That's it.

63
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,640
And.

64
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,860
What I'm going to do is.

65
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:18,890
I'm going to check in private or not check, because I'm going to create a constraint which can be like

66
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,420
you can send message private.

67
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,980
There is see to see claim, to learn to basically.

68
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,070
So what I'm going to do is for such purpose, I'm going to split the message.

69
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,200
I will tell you what is the significance of this, and I will split this message in this.

70
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,010
Know what I'm going to do is.

71
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,790
If character is this what is you do, this is basically edited if you put something like.

72
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,680
And John, are you going to say its it's John?

73
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,280
For the region, then space message.

74
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,980
Private message.

75
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,310
So I'm going to do this, so it will help me.

76
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,250
Make that and limit is three way.

77
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:20,020
I'm raising the limit is trees, as you can see, one two three four.

78
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,440
So that it should not be exceeded.

79
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,660
So I'm using this and.

80
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,910
Now, let me use some.

81
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,280
OK, so I will use your.

82
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,050
OK, I will tell you, what is this, all things?

83
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:49,060
So if private mission sink mentioned username money using this, so it will go to that particular point.

84
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,880
And we knew winning was our order to find dimension and basically I'm kicking in reverse to check your

85
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,480
username.

86
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,350
Well, look.

87
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,750
And I will tell you what to look.

88
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,120
Get username in each and every year because I haven't created any client, so I will create that and

89
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,820
I will tell you, what is this basically?

90
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,490
So this is all about this.

91
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,580
But what if messages and not from this?

92
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,410
Let me do one thing here.

93
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,880
If the message is not from what I'm going to do is I'm going to listen to.

94
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,690
I already created this, but I will tell you.

95
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,440
So.

96
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,240
OK.

97
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,160
We're doing it, OK, so all about how we can do this.

98
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,560
Vitamin.

99
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,200
So if this is true, I'm going to mention this.

100
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,250
What if?

101
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,300
If I'm printing else something else, basically?

102
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,470
It should be given some more.

103
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:27,990
Things so what I'm going to do is if messages broadcast message, it should be printing something now.

104
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,890
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this part.

105
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:39,120
You basically inspire you if it is not what I wanted you to be broadcast, so it will be directly put

106
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,950
out to the client and it will go to the right and I will tell you what it is.

107
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:47,190
You didn't send the client on me, so I will tell you what is the significance of this?

108
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,670
So this is all about how we can create this.

109
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,540
Now I'm going to create one logo dimetrodon.

110
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,240
So you're.

111
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,490
You create one lovely thing.

112
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,990
So let me go with the local thing one, so.

113
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,460
Well, this is the end of private and everything, OK, now.

114
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:08,720
OK.

115
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,810
So let me explain all these things.

116
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,790
So we already created this mentality, if you know that what is the starting news, what the starting

117
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,510
of the server?

118
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,810
Sort of starting.

119
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,160
Then this is the constructor, basically, as I told you.

120
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,010
Then this is all about sort of starting why?

121
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,760
Because I'm using some before libraries here and we'll keep going.

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,410
No, I'm doing this and printing stops and each any looting.

123
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,990
And then I created protected way to stop this server.

124
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,410
Because while I'm doing this, keep going, it's false, it will stop this event.

125
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:57,030
Now this is displayed console message and to broadcast message all, I'm going with this new format

126
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,600
and if and everything, if the message is private, I'm splitting this.

127
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:09,900
What it will do it, will you check something and each and everything year first, then what you do,

128
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,420
we will do measures should be, you know, blessed with basically that length and it will time plus

129
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,750
measure.

130
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:24,720
It will print William from musical defaults because I'm stopping that part and I'm reversing out I can,

131
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,570
looping the part in reverse to check that gland granted and using it username.

132
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:39,480
And I'm sending to that particular username only from its phone, deliver the message and basically

133
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,020
break the loop.

134
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,570
If fund is not equal to be basically generally not user fund, it should be written false or involved

135
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:56,100
is basically nothing but error messages, a broadcast message not with any underage audience.

136
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,670
It is going to know in this.

137
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,340
And what are it will do?

138
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,710
We will look in reverse order to remove the client also because it is disconnected if it's disconnected.

139
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,580
It should be removed from the client.

140
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:22,490
So I'm removing to the client and Glenn traditional thing at least, which is to pull the blankets on

141
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,750
each and everything.

142
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,550
Then I created one little augmentative that string disconnected on each and everything.

143
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:35,900
And similarly, I can use this remove that as you can see this remove it is basically system defaulting.

144
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:44,720
And we can see for eel, which is basically at, we can put removing it and had broadcast demonstration.

145
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,130
It is not available.

146
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,160
That is basically going to this.

147
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,740
Room model, you can see this is all about how we can do this.

148
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,250
After this, what is the remaining thing is?

149
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:07,070
All I need to create a server and to run a chat application on the server side.

150
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,660
And you to mention some things.

151
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:16,050
What I'm going to do is I'm creating your and basically public static void main.

152
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:22,820
Then what I'm going to do is here, I need to mention some.

153
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:30,910
He's one of the things I'm going to mention is word no.

154
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:38,710
Then switch gears for Argument Linton each and everything, so I will mention him or no?

155
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:47,810
Is equal to 5000, I mentioned in photos, and you can check your port number, then switch gears and

156
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,460
each and everything I'm going to mention.

157
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,940
Here.

158
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,800
So let me use this first.

159
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,950
So what is doing this?

160
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:04,620
It is going to pass that, in turn, this is the exception in really no doubt whatsoever, but nobody

161
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,420
in our phone dear basically will, but it gets zero.

162
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,310
Is basically is that usage our server because it is not using and creates sort of what object to start

163
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,970
this ability to start that object is server is basically this.

164
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:29,670
So we have we are done with this part, but we are remaining something here, which is basically no

165
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,810
OK, which is this part again?

166
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,560
OK, probably started, and this is part and this part did not work at all.

167
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,730
And did it instead presume it should be?

168
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:43,800
OK.

169
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:52,320
So we created this part and now what is remaining thinks we need to create one blanket then, which

170
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,900
is basically we need to create one plus for that purpose.

171
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,180
And we already did this.

172
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:02,580
But now the client reading or letting said remaining here, which is basically very important and we

173
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,370
are going to create this and now we can stop this, basically, which is basically public class and

174
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,130
each and everything as you can see our client through this machine.

175
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,980
Now I'm going to create one client $3 for you.

176
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,760
OK, if I'm reviewing this.

177
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,640
As you can see, nothing is.

178
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:30,050
This thing it is all about, and we know it is, which is basically not undeclared, declared already.

179
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,150
No, I'm going to declare that part.

180
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,900
So this is how you can do this part or you can do this part basically.

181
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:45,320
This is basically said we're saying I'm creating when at least in four unique graded format or no keep

182
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,450
going format, I'm using your local.

183
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,360
Also, no need to mention each and everything else you're going to see.

184
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,250
I'm using local only.

185
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,380
You can change the board.

186
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,110
No to this.

187
00:14:54,590 --> 00:15:00,890
So what I did this is I'm created vision to start this over, basically, because all these things are

188
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,420
mentioned here only.

189
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,970
So once you do started, all things are embedded in this only.

190
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,390
So what I'm going to do now is I will do I will create one planter class with some metals like good

191
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:20,180
use of the name, great message, then all the things like stopping each and everything user name on

192
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,320
something new to engine.

193
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:28,490
So I will go with that part and in the later part, I will tell you it's very cold as ice as you can

194
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:28,790
see.

195
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:38,420
I already done our own design, but it will help me to run all the processes on the server side, and

196
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,880
the client program will be very easy in this part.

197
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:48,260
So in the next part, we are going to see some plan things also in chat message things also including

198
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,880
I'm going to create $3 here.

199
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,590
And before that, I will explain the trading partners.
