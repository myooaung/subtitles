WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:09.480
So as far as we have covered everything about with our download manager, plus the progress and the

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:18.870
download stable model data us now the last class which is going to like compile up everything is download

3
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.970
not the Java, which is going to create a class called download and inside this download class.

4
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.560
We are going to like initialize all the objects which are going to required like suppose whether it

5
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:42.420
be the size of the download buffer, whether it be the status names like downloading paused company,

6
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.920
canceled order.

7
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:53.970
So we are going to like initialize all the statuses, size and everything which are going to be required

8
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.400
inside the Soyuz.

9
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:04.080
This is the packages required to be imported inside this download class.

10
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.330
We are going to extend this download class to observable.

11
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.890
And this is going to be implemented on was inside this, I suppose whenever like table is concerned

12
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.530
specific columnist concern, then status is going to display where there are downloading files, complete,

13
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.850
cancelled or errors.

14
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:37.250
So this is statuses is an area here and containing has five elements and the maximum buffer size for

15
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.380
the specific download is one zero two four.

16
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.050
After this, it will be like converted it.

17
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.690
Suppose that we are showing the size as the one for me.

18
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:58.010
So once the larger size is completing one zero, forgive me, we are showing the size and maybe not

19
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.360
the site size.

20
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.340
Thus we didn't give me the size it is in me.

21
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.170
So suppose one zero two four am be discovered, then automatically the size is going to be increased

22
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.830
by one.

23
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.860
So if it was for me, then it is going to be converted to five in and it is displayed as a full float.

24
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.750
Now it is one of the objects which are required inside, this is you are this size downloaded.

25
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:38.410
So all the members of the yes, we have declared this area, so all the member of the added I declared

26
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:48.040
as I read global variables inside this download, plus an added comment or to like signify what action

27
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.530
in this declaration is about.

28
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.660
We are declared everything globally in order for use later in this class.

29
00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.420
Now the next part we are going to see is our constructor for the download.

30
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.960
So we have created this download constructor.

31
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.020
This is you would use to access, though you are.

32
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.970
Then you are declared you are still here.

33
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.910
So firstly, we are accessing that.

34
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.240
You are then decreasing the size by us.

35
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.630
Like we have said, the size initially minus one.

36
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.030
So once that you are, all is added, the index is starting from zero.

37
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.980
So we have said the size of minus one in the beginning, after which we have said there downloaded two

38
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.810
zero in the beginning as there are zero downloaded files in the beginning.

39
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.590
The status is said to downloading by default.

40
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.040
Otherwise, if any kind of changes updates occurred, then this status will be updated to weather and

41
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:56.260
then initially only downloading is going to be displayed if the successful download it has started.

42
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.290
So inside this download class, we have like declared everything the construct.

43
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.230
It is complete now to the begging the download.

44
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.540
We have got this download function.

45
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.660
So yes, this is like this.

46
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.400
And now the next part is to get everything declared here.

47
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:26.950
We have to get all the variables as we have to like, declare it as private.

48
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:35.920
So in order to access this in other classes of like the download manager, there are the download table

49
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:44.880
one that if wishes to access the these objects of this download class, then we have to use get the

50
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.110
method in Java in order to make these things accessible.

51
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.400
So yes, we will be setting get a method for there you are.

52
00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.750
Then the size, the speed, the average speed and all of the columns here.

53
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:12.200
OK, so we have called all function for getting all the column names like you are no size speed, average

54
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.720
speed, elapsed time, remaining time, and with the help of this, we will be able to access all of

55
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.830
them as like accessible variable on this global variable is set to private.

56
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.760
So with the help of this get method, we will be able to access all of them in any of the other classes

57
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:42.130
except of this download class now so that we have used to get the method to access all of them.

58
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:51.820
Now our next concern is to all, like said at that time, how the format of time is going to be displayed.

59
00:05:52.570 --> 00:06:01.330
We have to time column names, the remaining time and elapsed time, and we are going to set our format

60
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:08.110
in the form of a string, basically so that for time format is going to be displayed in the form of

61
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.560
string.

62
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.710
So we are using like access, specify it.

63
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.230
We have like integers, so we are converting that integer.

64
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.420
So string or two we can call it long.

65
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.500
Also, long is a large or general friend integer.

66
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.310
Nothing is.

67
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.870
So there are times showing in hours, minutes and seconds.

68
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:38.890
So we are multiplying the hours by three three six zero zero, the minute by 60 and simply in like putting

69
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.450
the seconds directly.

70
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.480
So this is for formatting the time for both that remaining time and the elapsed time.

71
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:54.390
Now after this, to get their download for of this, we are multiplying the size by 100.

72
00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:02.800
Like, suppose the total size is suppose for 500 and we have downloaded hundreds.

73
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:09.880
So we are going to like put up things like 200 divided by 500 in two hundred.

74
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.970
So it is going to be OK.

75
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:20.950
So it is going to be one by five and one by five if converted in the form of a decimal, then if these

76
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:26.500
20 percent so 20 percent progress bar will display.

77
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:35.130
Everything is like solid mathematically, how the person will be displayed, how their time will be

78
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:35.820
displayed.

79
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.720
So yes, everything is written in a scalpel to the man.

80
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:48.960
Now for this like changing the status, like for me, canceling a prestigious download, the artist

81
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.670
setting specified functions for Paul.

82
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.930
What happens if we click on the poll?

83
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.370
Then the previous elapsed time will make it to the elapsed time.

84
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.920
Like, everything should be free.

85
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:09.610
They left, I'm sure the 1980s and the status, which is already set to download in the beginning,

86
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.640
is to be set as Paul and the state change function is called.

87
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:23.190
Similarly, for the resume, the status is again, if I suppose, then it will be ActionScript or downloading.

88
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:29.220
If they cancel any download, then previous elapsed time will be again equal to the last time.

89
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.520
There will be no increase in the last lifetime again, and the rest of the things will be maintained

90
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.930
and the status will be just updated from downloading to cancelled.

91
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.050
OK, so what happens if?

92
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.240
The previous elapsed time is.

93
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:54.920
Yes, so if that is an error, so the previous elapsed time is going to change the previous elapsed

94
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.850
time and the status will be displaying error.

95
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:02.420
And again, the searching function is going to still change.

96
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.230
Function is going to be called start or resuming the download again.

97
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:13.460
Suppose if the download is pushed and we have to again resume so that resume zoom function is going

98
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.470
to like create a pen.

99
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.910
A trend is a group of processes taking place.

100
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.260
So suppose our process has completed two 20 percent.

101
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:32.630
Then once we will resume it, it will again start from 21 percent and it is going to be like nothing

102
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.070
will be broken.

103
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.760
The download will again start from the previous date.

104
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.170
It will simply like download from the way it was paused.

105
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:52.770
Now, after the like every check-in, we have the mother download anything we have talked about resuming

106
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.640
the download.

107
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.950
Now what about the one?

108
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:01.650
So there you are apart is going to be displayed in the form of ice cream.

109
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:10.170
And how to check that validation, suppose that there is some, like invalid, invalid.

110
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:20.880
If they are and are inside the urinal, then are you you aka a neural connection box is going to throw

111
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.870
an exception.

112
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.220
Suppose that downloads started and there is some error.

113
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.430
Then the cache block will be executed.

114
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:37.230
Otherwise, this trial will be like checking that if the connection is checked properly, the bytes

115
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.130
are correct.

116
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.390
Everything is done.

117
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.500
The download manager is connected to the server.

118
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:52.200
From there, the download is to taking place and make sure making sure that the connection is made in

119
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.670
the range of 200.

120
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.090
So this is basically the network bandwidth.

121
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:06.870
We have to make the connections successfully in order to make their download take place correctly and

122
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.480
the content should be less than one, then it should throw another.

123
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:18.630
So we should at least contain One UI in order to start the downloading process.

124
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.570
So yes, this is about the validation of the yuan and five after this.

125
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:29.310
Now, after this, we have to like change the size accordingly.

126
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.570
The progress is made.

127
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:39.600
Suppose that the hundred 20 percent off the download is complete, then the size should change accordingly.

128
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.550
That this size is like we have to multiply the progress.

129
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.840
According to that, in the order of streaming, I need download.

130
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:57.360
We are connecting things to like making connections between the server and the download manager window.

131
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.540
Then we have to make light streaming thing.

132
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:10.050
We have to make like check that whether the size do not increase the maximum buffer size, that is a

133
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.870
buffer size.

134
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.890
These all are like the computer network pings.

135
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:19.590
If you have studied computing networks, you must have been hard about these.

136
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:27.870
Don't let how are downloading buffering like everything goes hand-in-hand in networking.

137
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:33.240
We have a time for every bit, every bite.

138
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:41.730
There are transgenic transmissions from the server to our system, so that is going to be updated in

139
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:42.570
that manner.

140
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:50.700
Buffering is taking place, so the download will be made in that supports 20 percent is complete.

141
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.690
Then the download manager will send a message to the server that we are completed 20 percent.

142
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:05.110
Now, if you hit the pause button by selecting that specific role, then the download manager should

143
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.690
send a message to the server that stops sending the file.

144
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:18.450
The user has paused, so once the event will resume that I will inform the server, then only you can

145
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:23.910
start sending me bytes and streaming sure, like Zoom from that time.

146
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.740
After this, we are going to like check the status.

147
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.910
So that status is also going to updated.

148
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.850
And similarly, we are changing the pausing and resuming ping.

149
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.730
We have to like notify the server also not currently we are downloading.

150
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:42.990
We are complete.

151
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.630
Then we have to change the dust DBS.

152
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:54.900
So after this, once the downloading is complete, then we have to cut the connection from the server.

153
00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.900
Yes, we are done with the downloads, but now we are nothing to do with the this.

154
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:07.530
No connection is stopped and the download is like downloaded to your system.

155
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:15.480
You can check it whether it is downloaded inside your next stop or whether whatever the location is.

156
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.960
So yes, this is all about this.

157
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:24.930
Now we will try to not know whether everything is working correctly or not.

158
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:31.350
So for this, we have to connect donors first and then check the downloading part.

159
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:40.580
OK, so let's try turning this on download manager, not our class, to check that everything is working

160
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.510
fine or not.

161
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.060
So hitting on this run button?

162
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.630
The Newman novel Open.

163
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.740
Yes, it is working perfectly fine.

164
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.340
We have our free panels inside the frame.

165
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.890
Now let us try pasting a link.

166
00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.620
This is BP control.

167
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.020
You are controlling.

168
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.120
So the link validation will work fine.

169
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:11.290
Now hitting on yes, so that you are at least showing in the string and the size the progress.

170
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:16.510
And once the progress is completed, the status is updated to complete.

171
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.770
Now also check that whether the play pause button is working or not.

172
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:28.090
So selecting a specific little pausing this rule and then our yes button highlight is also working fine.

173
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.050
Now resuming the download, now pausing again.

174
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.030
Let's try to cancel this and that status is updated to cancel.

175
00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.500
After this, I'm planning that all sizes decreased by one.

176
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.650
So, yes, everything is working perfectly fine.

177
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.370
Below we have covered everything in this download manager.

178
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:49.960
Yes.

179
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:57.850
So all the classes are doing a special function containing a special functionality, and everything

180
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:01.060
is like working in a proper way.

181
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:09.400
So I hope that you have gained more concepts about Java after the completion of this project.

182
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:16.450
Now that I am making this project on your own and practice all the concepts we have discussed in this

183
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:23.800
tutorial, and I hope after like completing the project on your own, you will be experienced.

184
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:33.100
Java project broke down this idea, and so I am wishing you all the best for making and practicing this

185
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.340
project and thanking you all for joining this session.
