1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,540
Hello, everyone, I hope you all are doing well.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,970
And let's start this day with a new project in Java.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,680
The title of this project is school payment system.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,490
I hope you can see it on your screen.

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,870
This is the output that the program outputs.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:31,250
Or we can say that this is the result of this project we are going to be today.

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:40,300
So like this, banging with the specifications of this project and then start explaining the project

8
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,340
what actually the project does.

9
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:51,520
So coming to the project specifications, hey, it is listed that this project manages everything about

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,510
school funds.

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,150
Are you going to see that school's money?

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,260
Basically, it is a money management system for the school.

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:07,950
Yes, like in our school, we have to pay the salary to the teachers, collect the fees from the student.

14
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,670
And there are many other expenses.

15
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:20,410
So, so in a management system, that's been the main aim is to gather all the funds and then distribute

16
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,250
it to the required ones in a very managed way.

17
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:31,480
And the aim of this project is to keep track of the student audiences.

18
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:39,910
And one fee is already paid who I know, who are not who have not paid the fees like this.

19
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:48,040
Also, we have to keep that track that which teacher has paid in his hour, her to study, which teacher

20
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,950
is left to be paid his or her salary.

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:00,780
Sitting at a right angle, you have a school, you have beaches, you have students and you have other

22
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,210
employees also in this project.

23
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:11,220
We are going to consider school as a main body and that expenses only as the teacher's salary.

24
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,780
Of course, this is not the only expense a school best, but in this project we are discussing the basic

25
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:28,530
concept, so we will keep it simple by the expense of the school as their teacher's salary and not earning

26
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,480
as the fees paid by the students.

27
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,070
Yes.

28
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:41,110
So let's start back on learning the concept behind this project before making any project.

29
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,600
You must wonder what are the consequences of learning this project?

30
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:52,350
What are the significant features of Java or any other project you are going to build?

31
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,590
What are the significant features of that language?

32
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:03,720
We are going to learn by making this project and you are doing no wrong as we want to make any project

33
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,290
just for the sake of learning the concept of language and not making the project is the best way.

34
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:20,340
I think it is that or it is the main way to learn the concept of any language we are going to make projects

35
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,670
in.

36
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,780
So, yes, let's dig.

37
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,370
I dig into what this project actually teaches us.

38
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,990
So the first one is object oriented programming in Java.

39
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,250
Second one is bending Java apps.

40
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,170
Part one is Gauzere.

41
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,050
Like your Dorian?

42
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:44,730
So, yes, this project is a tutorial which we are going to see two core Java concepts to afford.

43
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:51,990
One This Java School Funds Management System As I told you, we are going to manage the funds of our

44
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,470
school.

45
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,980
So, yes, in Java, we are going to learn our school fund management system project.

46
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:05,460
And the main feature off Java we are going to learn in this project is classes and objects in Java.

47
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,920
This example, as the first feature, is object oriented programming in Java.

48
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,960
So that is no object oriented programming without classes that object.

49
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,550
We have classes, objects and methods that makes the programming of the project very, very convenient.

50
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:31,320
So let's take a look at what actually object oriented programming in Java is and what types are that

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,800
feature?

52
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:44,310
So this is the official site of WPC schools, and you can learn very good concepts on this site.

53
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,770
So I am open about Java Ops and we're going to take a look at what Java is.

54
00:04:50,790 --> 00:05:00,090
So yes, OB stands for object oriented programming in earlier we have basketball oriented programming,

55
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,320
which was the.

56
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,160
Conventional way of programming.

57
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,320
So let's differentiate between ferocity on programming and object oriented programming in a quick way.

58
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:19,200
So in project programming procedural programming, we have a certain method.

59
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:25,830
But in object from programming, we have to create objects that contains both data and methods.

60
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:33,330
And the main difference between procedure programming and object oriented programming is that real world

61
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:40,380
data handling in object oriented programming that is data is handled by prosody prosecutors broke down.

62
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,860
There is nothing about Real-World data handling.

63
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,280
Yes.

64
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:51,420
And the features of object oriented programming or procedural oriented programming are listed here.

65
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,680
We know that UPS is faster and easier to execute, and the structure of the court is ready.

66
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:06,970
There are defined and very clear in object oriented programming in ops, that is.

67
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:16,150
There are many features like inheritance data handling, data binding and with the help of the inheritance

68
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:23,320
weekend, be to recreate the class with the help of inheritance without writing it again and again.

69
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,040
So yes, this is called as dry.

70
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,400
Don't repeat yourself.

71
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:34,390
We do not have are already mixed classes in our program again and again.

72
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:43,630
We just have to call that class and had it is everything will be applied at just one click.

73
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,080
Yes.

74
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,880
Let's take a look at the core concepts of object oriented programming.

75
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,010
We are going to learn in this project.

76
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,250
So we have classes on the object.

77
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,260
Let's take the example of what class and objects are.

78
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,530
Plus, suppose Asiedu is a class.

79
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,690
We all know about food.

80
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:15,630
The type of foods we eat, like we have apples, bananas, mangos, guavas, etc. So we can consider

81
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,400
food as a class and object, as some as a member of the class.

82
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:20,790
Yes.

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,170
So object as a member of the class and it is a real world object, is a real world entity.

84
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,770
We can define the object as it is a member of an entity.

85
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:45,540
So coming back to the project, but in this project, we have three Java classes we already learned

86
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,250
about what classes are.

87
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:53,100
And in this program, in this project, maybe will have to be Java classes.

88
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,580
They will be schooled at Java B, just not Java and students Java.

89
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,660
So yes.

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,220
In the execution part, I can't explain what this program is doing.

91
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:15,710
So we have created a school, suppose that the school answer yes, one lakh, ten thousand rupees,

92
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:25,700
but even so, yes and schools should spend for the sanity of teachers they can.

93
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:36,070
So the schools will give salary to the teachers, receive the fees from the student, and the whole

94
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:44,170
year funds will be distributed instead, to me suppose that each student has to pay for your one lakh

95
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,580
rupees to the school.

96
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,490
Yes.

97
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:53,290
So this is the fee structure of the school student have to pay one rupees by the end of the school.

98
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:01,750
So from the one lack of fees from each student, the school has to pay the teachers so they will learn

99
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:11,350
how, with the help of Java, they will distribute the salaries and the students fees and then receive,

100
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,680
well, what about the money?

101
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,020
What?

102
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,650
What is the fund left in the school at the end?

103
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,800
So let's start with the coding execution back in the next review.

104
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,730
Thank you.
