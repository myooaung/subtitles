1
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:11.100
So to end text area inside the notepad, we know first we are going to create a text area with the helpful

2
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.390
Java Swing Library below this.

3
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:25.440
We are going to call a text area function and then name this as text area.

4
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.680
New.

5
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.700
New tax data.

6
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.740
Yes.

7
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.240
So 10 days, is the text area successfully added to the call?

8
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.790
Now we are going to add it to the constructor.

9
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.300
Yes.

10
00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:04.270
So not oh, let us first, and the about section we just created in the help section help.

11
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.870
Not that about.

12
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.680
So we have added about what?

13
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.580
No.

14
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.450
We are going to the text area to the north side window.

15
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:31.840
So the about section is successfully added to the health, but then health news about glass is ended

16
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.470
now to the text area.

17
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:45.910
We created a new menu items, text, text areas, text data now invoking it with the help of the constructor.

18
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.920
We will call it a scroll pin because the text is going to be a.

19
00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:05.470
Scrawling stuff, there is no limit of three or four words, the text can be as long as we've wanted

20
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.790
to, so naming this variable as cruel pen new and.

21
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.180
You things.

22
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.170
So documents passed in Saturday's attack stadium, basically.

23
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.420
And I think the scroll pan to the flames.

24
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.970
I keep scrolling to that frame and.

25
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.580
Now, let us try and run this.

26
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.750
So perfect, the text field is added here, currently, the font size is so small.

27
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.920
So let us set the font size first.

28
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.830
So increase the text size should be done this text area.

29
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.540
Not set find.

30
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:22.190
And the rest of the contest, sensory plane and say this 20, let's check if the font size as in these

31
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.650
are not perfect.

32
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.830
So the font something and clear.

33
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.960
On typing, something you can see there, it is going through in a horizontal manner, which is not

34
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.950
a good practice.

35
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.630
The patient may come in the next line automatically and not go through the horizontal scrolling.

36
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.060
So to prevent this?

37
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.980
We are going to call something in our function and prevent this from happening.

38
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.500
So we need a vertical scrolling and prevent the horizontal scrolling.

39
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.580
So in the scroll thing preventing.

40
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.300
No vertical, the horizontal scrolling is.

41
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.150
Setting it as never so a scroll thing.

42
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.120
Shouldn't call it, does horizontal scrolling never affect?

43
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.980
And similarly, we need the vertical scrolling surveillance circuit to as needed.

44
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.960
Just spin.

45
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.160
Horizontal is done, so more take this as needed.

46
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.800
Yes.

47
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.550
So now we can go and check if the ruling party's fixed fixed not.

48
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.150
Running the program.

49
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.690
And not a strength of terror, something.

50
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.510
I think there is something missed.

51
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.770
Let us try to fix this again.

52
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:34.130
Attacks should switch to the next line automatically, so calling to my turn as text, Dahlia said line

53
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.490
the.

54
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.950
As true.

55
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.150
And the second one.

56
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.390
Is set it up style war, I think.

57
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.500
Let us try.

58
00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:02.900
In the next line, text, Dania said that Epstein was so diverse then she'd made it up give the horizontal

59
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.890
line is false.

60
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.260
We should switch to the next line automatically.

61
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.760
OK.

62
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.230
So try running this.

63
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.760
Typing something.

64
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.910
OK, perfect.

65
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:34.320
So text is coming in the next line automatically and the text version is completed in this way.

66
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.750
Now let us try to add some actions to these buttons, like clicking on the new button, clicking on

67
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.980
the save copy.

68
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.180
Got anything?

69
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.510
We have to set some actions to the button.

70
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.210
Sorry, I'm going to use action listener for this purpose.

71
00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:03.490
So extending this with Action Listener's action listener.

72
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:16.950
So to make things worse, firstly, we have to import name and class from Germany, N.W.T..

73
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.960
So Java, N.W.T..

74
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.250
Not even.

75
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:35.150
And exporting everything from this class, we are using extra care so that all the classes from doing

76
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.010
what important here.

77
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.110
And in this class, we have to do a fix.

78
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.790
My implementing nest.

79
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.300
So, yes.

80
00:07:51.760 --> 00:08:02.380
Override function is created automatically, as for isolated action is less so coming to this and adding

81
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.720
some actions to the buttons.

82
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.560
We have already created a world class called Action for Fun, Victor, even E!

83
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:18.600
So firstly, we are going to an action listener with a reaction out there.

84
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.450
And actually, listener.

85
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:30.220
And in the parameter, we are going to pass this, you work.

86
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.500
So that it gets invoked as far recall this action.

87
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.850
Similarly for.

88
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.450
Every matter.

89
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.470
New file, open file.

90
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.490
I've been fine.

91
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.920
See, fine.

92
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.730
Bring Brexit and whatever.

93
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.750
They're supposed to end in the.

94
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.530
So save in Texas it.

95
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:16.050
Exempt, select all copy paste.

96
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:24.110
Collectors just done this and try to.

97
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.550
Try to avoid this.

98
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.830
So I can say this action perform event creator.

99
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:44.300
We have an election listener with every important like new option save an exit, copy paste, select

100
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.380
on and about.

101
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.500
So every button in the North Bank has attached action with it here.

102
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:59.520
Use conditional operators if and also like if they click the new button at abstract text.

103
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.290
The abstract button should open an area as a text area.

104
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.300
And initially the text should be empty.

105
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:16.910
So this function is used to create the empty text field area that said text and then say nothing is

106
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.100
printed and save.

107
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:26.050
If we click on open at that time, we are going to look at only one button.

108
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.680
So that's why we are using the conditional operators.

109
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.840
So I suppose if you aren't looking to buy tents at the time, is that possible?

110
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.210
I don't think so.

111
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:48.040
So, yes, the only purpose of using if and this conditional operators are to add actions, those a

112
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.230
specific button, if ones.

113
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.710
Otherwise, if the other bottom is me, what action should we perform?

114
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.120
And in the same level for every item we have at our function?

115
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.460
So the actions related to the parties are using this.

116
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.570
This override action buffer plus.

117
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.230
So the complete actions before that is completed.

118
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:23.020
Now, in the next part, we will be looking at how to add more features to this.

119
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.000
Knock it down application.
