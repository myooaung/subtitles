WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:10.050
Our project is Java online with this, so we are going to create one which platform for university level

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.430
basic or you can create with for students and teachers in module you can consider like that.

3
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.100
So we are going to create one on language design with the backend written in the Java.

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.970
So it's very useful to understand this box.

5
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.670
So Java, but to do this project is based on JTBC Jospeh Java, so networks are already planning.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.470
So I'm considering when you go back in.

7
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.800
But I mentioned Java slowly and so our deployment, I'm consider this.

8
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.690
So we are going to create an online quiz system at the university level with using a GSP as a main backing

9
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.880
with the help of Java Servlet, also we are going to use we are going to connect with the database and

10
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.830
we are going to finally deploy on the server.

11
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.000
So I'm going to consider here only and we project here.

12
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.460
There are different libraries inside and written on Java or different applications like Java.

13
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.810
Like you can use Gradle, you can go with a machine on Zoom.

14
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.550
So these are some famous O frameworks in changeovers pretty much like that.

15
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.090
But I'm going to consider only the end project because it's a very simple, basic and easier to understand

16
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.350
than other frameworks.

17
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.840
Even though it's very basic thing, but it is a very helpful and essential or gigantic effect duplex

18
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.060
or and the project to create some online system from scratch.

19
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.390
So before proceeding with the project, I'm going to tell you you should have some basic knowledge about

20
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.640
Java classes and methods, then about some knowledge of Java so and basic condition.

21
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.990
But this is all about the back and part.

22
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.430
In the other part, I'm going to learn how we can create frontend and everything.

23
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.930
So let's see how we can create or we can proceed with our project.

24
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.810
So our project team is basically developer web using Java for this platform at the university level

25
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.240
events examination with the help of Java.

26
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.920
So let's just be duly so Java on their GCP jtbc out of the main backend part of our project.

27
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.820
But.

28
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.930
These are mean part I'm going to do.

29
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.470
This is basically a Republican state, software development is listed projects that we are going to

30
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.660
set about logic, then understanding what we are going to use your different tools, we are going to

31
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.830
use your son I.D. then duplicate and some sort of work part also.

32
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.610
So we are going to understand how basically they are going to work here.

33
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.370
Then just the basics.

34
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.850
You should not just be basics.

35
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.510
I'm not going to tell like you should learn through thoroughly from this, but you should know some

36
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.620
basic part of GSP.

37
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.060
Then basics of databases like my ask a lot of Oracle.

38
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.860
You can use your.

39
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.390
So how we can create databases, then creation of stable, then invoking and inserting into the table.

40
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.270
So basic knowledge about database relational database.

41
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.140
I'm considering it Java.

42
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.480
So you'd use your connection.

43
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.260
You should know basic part of Java development and use your connections and deployment on the server.

44
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.260
So these are the some steps of our development.

45
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:26.700
But before that, I'm going to tell how we get to see living in the projects before proceeding this

46
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.040
object.

47
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.910
We should know about the basic outline.

48
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.250
So we are only two users here, which is basically posters, teachers and students.

49
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.460
So teachers are basically admin roles I'm considering who has the right to change questions, then see

50
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.980
the student leads and then publish them the results and exit Brexit.

51
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.100
Second thing, which are basically student students, are going to attempt their quiz.

52
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.270
They can see their marks and some results so you can create some advanced things which apply for each

53
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.720
teacher will get notifications or remind the commission for that like the question or answer is wrong.

54
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.310
So I'm considering here only the in-situ level or multiple choice questions here because I handling

55
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.390
multiple choice questions with the DSP is very easy or we can specify and we can get precise marking

56
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.230
system inside that.

57
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:26.420
For advanced things, you can create some long questions like, um, brief questions or two to learn

58
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.960
questions, you can add in into that, but it takes more time to deploy with the server or deploy with

59
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.770
the database.

60
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.140
And according to that, you have to change the relational database and relational tables also ensure

61
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.860
database.

62
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.550
So application requirements, I'm going to tell First Dollar program, we need to display all the web

63
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.260
contents inside the Java program.

64
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:57.390
So these are the Java programs only, but with the late and some JS few items, then Java program basic

65
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.720
knowledge.

66
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.090
You should have Java program basic knowledge classes, methods, the parameters attributes what is the

67
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.890
public and difference between public and private, then whom we are going to create static things here.

68
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.900
Then basic concepts of fiscal dispute basics, I'm going to tell the basics inside these walls.

69
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.680
But if you know the basics, the understanding of this, this project is become very easy to understand.

70
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.440
Then for these all over the back end, but what about the front end part of the front end part?

71
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.040
I'm going to use your estimates, CSIS basically with the help of Bootstrap.

72
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.320
Also, I'm going to create your better you.

73
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.320
So consider this I'm not going to develop a stimulant users front end from scratch.

74
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.690
I'm going to use some radiometer to see if this is available on the internet or no.

75
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.940
I already created for the different projects.

76
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.310
Plus, I'm going to use your remote bootstrap programs, which are already freely available on bootstrap

77
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.520
platform to deploy on our planet in part.

78
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.590
Because creating from the skies, it's very difficult for due to time constraint.

79
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.190
Also, we are not focusing on the front end part of our project.

80
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.010
We are mostly focused on our back partner and developing the Java program for liquids system with little

81
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.940
disconnection also.

82
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.030
So we are considering here both are two use cases.

83
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:32.050
Ermey instruments admit that basically teachers and consulting as the admin of our website or way.

84
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.920
So there should be two longing for teachers also and students also to learn how to first register and

85
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.180
then go and mingle.

86
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.340
Now some privileges to change their parts and everything for admin or teachers.

87
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.520
We have to do some administrative actions like active Christians, then search for children, etc.,

88
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.510
etc. Also then they have to build options like registered log in tweets, submit and students, which

89
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.510
are basically non administrative actions on these platforms.

90
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.990
If you see I have seen some of these platforms online, you can choose or content of that out and you

91
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.320
can develop your own peace platform according to that.

92
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.890
So we are going to require this duly given pointed.

93
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:21.460
So I am considering here only JDK 1.8, which provides Java eight Virgin Enterprise Edition vision for

94
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.380
the Web develop deployment.

95
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.050
So this is very old yet again concerning, but it's very effective.

96
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.280
And finally, with without any bugs or errors.

97
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.600
So I am considering this only then it.

98
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:44.050
I'm going to use your name means you can choose or any other famous idea like eclipse English idea you

99
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:44.610
can consider.

100
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.620
But creating with the it means it's very easy as I'm going to you.

101
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:54.280
Judy Garland pointed Java EE Virgin and is very useful for the web deployment.

102
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.920
What a lot of my school database.

103
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:02.200
You can choose both, though, as your databases, but with Oracle.

104
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.450
You going to choose my school, but you have to specify all things in my school.

105
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.330
So Oracle using Oracle is very easy.

106
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.700
You can choose or blast free server for deployment or tomkinson or deployment.

107
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.790
Remember, intended to Tomcat server, you can change your attitude.

108
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:24.250
You report exit rate settings, but remember or don't get over, let it stay on guard.

109
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:29.020
Server only supports Java, so when according to that, your opportunity can everything.

110
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:37.000
So I'm going to what I'm going to use blast this server, but I told you how I will tell also how we

111
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.870
can change our port and exit inside.

112
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.060
And follow what I call.

113
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.540
I'm going for the database.

114
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:49.090
I'm going to use your arrival database and you can easily downloaded from the official website Oracle

115
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.350
19, so you can see where you are.

116
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.460
So this is all about the application requirements of our project.

117
00:08:54.970 --> 00:09:01.750
So these are some basic things we required for our project before proceeding with the project.

118
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.900
Let us see how we can.

119
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.370
Set up a little project was.

120
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.270
So as you can see, I already created everything.

121
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.490
But I will tell you from the scratch.

122
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.780
So let us see how we can create it from the scratch.

123
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.980
So go to the file first and create a new project regardless of who you have created any other project.

124
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.860
We'll do fine, create a new project, then go to the Java.

125
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:34.160
And there you can see there are different applications like delamanid, which is basically the advance

126
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:41.220
team for the Java to map different projects you can create with Java Gradle.

127
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.340
But I'm going to with, going with and.

128
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:51.570
Then you can see the various options here, Java effects, then go of him to consider the web and click

129
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:51.900
next.

130
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:59.510
Then new, the project name, then project location and project folder, you can choose this October.

131
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:06.170
I'm not going to choose this part because it will automatically create one library violence on the next.

132
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.840
Then, before proceeding, you are to specify the service and settings.

133
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:17.180
So I'm choosing over the last few server to meet with Java eight.

134
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:24.050
If you don't downloaded it, click and then it will show you the downloading page for that and you can

135
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.820
create some context.

136
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.050
But I will change according to your project next and create an interior finish.

137
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:35.870
I'm not going to click here or finish because I already created one project for that purpose new route.

138
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:36.440
I am concerned.

139
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.210
So you can see in this instrument, it's very basic in the human.

140
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.630
I already created one another in the instrument for my purpose.

141
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:51.530
So you can see room created on really individual textural pages pages here.

142
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:58.670
So once you download it, you can go to our tools here and you can choose the server part.

143
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.650
So you can see this issue.

144
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.190
You Gillespie Server I two words for the issue to report in your clipboard.

145
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.520
This might be different for your purpose.

146
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.950
Once you go to the this part, you can see the one dialog box opens when you click the server part.

147
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:25.450
So you can see the STEVE report is basically a before your case.

148
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.430
But I will tell you how we can change that or.

149
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.020
So let us see how we can change that.

150
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.880
So first, go to your glass fish server platform, basically.

151
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:46.400
So we'll wait for the diagnosis so you can go to your C drug users and go to your default name, then

152
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.110
go to the blast server, then go to the Google Glass fish.

153
00:11:51.680 --> 00:12:00.110
That config finder and we'll be the domains, then your default domain, then go to the config and check

154
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.620
for them.

155
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:15.850
Booming, not extremely failure, and open it with your default $482 default screen, you can also use

156
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:16.810
the notepad also.

157
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.390
So we are going to change that a little bit.

158
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.540
But for your default on.

159
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:30.000
What basically your default for this duty in my guess, I already changed to 2002.

160
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.880
So you can see one lane that network using it.

161
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.540
I will show you once again I will show you inside that thing.

162
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.170
So.

163
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:47.880
But defaulting is your order, oh, and gender to.

164
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.290
You're you're in your case, you can change it to the different thing.

165
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:56.840
Also.

166
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.660
Like, I already changed to the or 2002.

167
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.000
As you can see.

168
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.490
As you can see, I already changed to the.

169
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:18.660
2002, but in your case, you should be at Ginger to 2000.

170
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.590
So this is a very important step for this purpose.

171
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:31.510
It should be located inside the dome interdiction and only on these very important state for creating

172
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.780
or basically creating basic outline for our project.

173
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:40.370
So let us see how we can go through this.

174
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.800
So this is a basic GSP program we are going to create here.

175
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.670
So before proceeding the project, I'm going to tell you some

176
00:13:55.690 --> 00:14:01.190
more part about how we can create this so you can choose this.

177
00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.430
And so this is very basic.

178
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.140
I'm choosing for some bootstrap jury programs here already.

179
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:15.260
So these are some remote files, if you read this part, you can see in the remote files of our project

180
00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.020
also, these are the lurid excuses and everything.

181
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:24.680
So news, the navigation button, everything I choose, then I use this image, then I would.

182
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:30.860
This will come to our platform online examination system with some information with Basic based on Java

183
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.330
project I created.

184
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.630
Then I created one I container and everything.

185
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.490
So these are some basic things I use yet.

186
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.080
So to use these things, what you are going to do is very simple.

187
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.340
You are going to create.

188
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:54.550
Just inside your project, if you are using which means it will do online, then with that project or

189
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.850
project folder, then go to the web and you can see the web.

190
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.510
Yeah, any individual instrument.

191
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:07.480
So just copy paste these all things and you are going to use your access, then bootstrap.

192
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:14.830
Then I'm going to mean to not just for yes, but then some logos part here.

193
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.650
So these are all about how we can proceed with our project for the time constraint.

194
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:25.630
I already created this in with admin log in and shoot and log in.

195
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.370
You can change your to the features, log in here also and extend everything.

196
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:37.270
So in the next two days, I'm going to tell you how we can create with admin log into our speech to

197
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.830
log in at their disposal.

198
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.890
So let us see how we're going to deploy this.

199
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:43.750
Just click here.

200
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.890
Clean and build.

201
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.690
Once it is done, click run here, so it takes.

202
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.140
Few minutes to deploy on your before.

203
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:04.090
Project or program, and it will take time to load everything because I'm using some, you know, web

204
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.280
based images, so it will take time.

205
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.390
So as you can see, you can see welcome to our world online grid system.

206
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.840
And so do you basically load empeche for this animation?

207
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:21.000
I'm considering only like you can see these animations in this animation until your power.

208
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.610
I'm using your bootstrap program here.

209
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:31.750
So as you can see, I can change these images also to different things, as you can see.

210
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:41.010
So this is our basic loading part of our G-spot in the next videos or next tutorials, I'm going to

211
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:46.680
tell you how we got going to produce student log in page in admin log in with the help of GSP.
