1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,650
So in previous videos and tutorials, I told you how we can create some days before year and we are

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,430
done with a so laid back, so we are now focused on with just be.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,210
So let me close this in a minute.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:25,160
So we created an admin panel just before admin panel student list just before the student list instruction

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,880
list for their instruction purposes and question list.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,940
But the question is what is there to see how we can create an update to the NTSB because we mentioned

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,630
the objects weren't so need to grade average student?

8
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,270
So.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,220
Let me create one job of the student here.

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,360
You finish.

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,790
So he and his son and.

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:02,690
Remember when you are writing Java, for instance, are this you need to specify?

13
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,390
This takes.

14
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:14,090
So let me create an update to the news with a list their student.

15
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,270
Then.

16
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,660
Let me show you sort of these language Java Studio, because it contains that object student.

17
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,560
I'm using least your own some.

18
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,960
So let me print your title is a bit.

19
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:35,860
Done.

20
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,160
I'm using bootstrap method in this.

21
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,320
Again, this is you said I'd be.

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,170
All of them things.

23
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:56,520
Then, student, you am using this method, I'm invoking that ArrayList, then this all student.

24
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,650
It will fetch if requests don't get better, the username for that particular user is if their user

25
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:09,020
name, which is basically sort of that specific user, if that is correct.

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,490
What it will be do.

27
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,480
It will go to the end of the extruder.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,140
No, no.

29
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,250
What is that object to?

30
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,150
The note we already created a bit shouldn't just be so widely required.

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:27,230
So if I want to change the username, if I want to change the name, if I want to change the password,

32
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,100
there should be another file to process that.

33
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,430
You can include in the same just before.

34
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:42,950
But for some simpler purpose, or we can see what the user friendliness and managing purpose.

35
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,330
I'm going to use this.

36
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,550
Again, get user name for this object student.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,070
You already created and this for their religious children, so these very simple Jewish people, as

38
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,650
I told you, you need to create only this part.

39
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:08,860
And if that or look, it's that, which means if that meant just to that part, only you can easily

40
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,110
use this X will be the specific that name only.

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,980
No need to change that because the student is not available symbol.

42
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,090
So let us see how we can create objects to Duncan the to here.

43
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,650
So let me copy this.

44
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,450
I'm going to create another here.

45
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,200
So as you can see, we have some more JCP faces than.

46
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,120
Our park.

47
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,830
So this will contain basic logic of updating part soon.

48
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,980
Let me.

49
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,790
Use this part of good student.

50
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,570
And this is.

51
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,110
Instead of this and what I'm going to put this.

52
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,240
The thing?

53
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,650
To Ben.

54
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:14,830
In this, so it will use this degree, not because I want to update in that part, only with student,

55
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,330
the new model will inform this only and released anyway.

56
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:28,520
But what it will do will new user rating, new password, new name with original ID, U80 and everything.

57
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:35,540
If this is done like student, these jobs, we are already created to enlist.

58
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,550
It will send that to that part.

59
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,950
It's not, and it will go into that error in the database.

60
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,310
And then so this is all about how we can create a black student, nobody.

61
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,340
So this is just a logic, not very important.

62
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,910
Or you can say you can easily using the average student only, but I just created another part.

63
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,980
So this is very important because this contains the logic of changing username and password and name.

64
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,240
Which originally means.

65
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,970
So this is the new tablets front, so let us see how we can create some delete student potentially here.

66
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,850
Let me create GSP failure again.

67
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,510
Dillard's student.

68
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,670
This part, because this can some default poor while you are creating is.

69
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,010
So we don't want to be in the year to that, we need to create logic for indigenous students.

70
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,520
So let me clear the student part here.

71
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,910
Delivered to student.

72
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,730
People just need to remove that part.

73
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,730
So what we are doing is it's just deleting that part.

74
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:08,420
With the student list and delete record, delete records already mentioned in a database, and we are

75
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,340
going to delete that record soon.

76
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,990
Let me change the title.

77
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,540
You're also.

78
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,090
Delete student.

79
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,680
Now we are done with that, the student part.

80
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:31,280
So we just created a good student and student update student, then a good student.

81
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,360
Nowadays, you can directly use these quotes because I already created this part.

82
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,690
So remember what I mentioned the student days with the new student with username.

83
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,840
This if the user name is this, I'm going to delete records and it will send me to this.

84
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,130
If not, it should print it under.

85
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,150
So that it about how we can create delete student.

86
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,680
So now we are done with student lists.

87
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,780
Let us see how we can create instruction listing all that we need to create instruction, update instruction

88
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,510
and all listings.

89
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,040
Operating instruction.

90
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,690
Pages of GSP failure aren't going to create.

91
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,850
Ability instruction.

92
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:24,120
So in further videos, I'm going to show you how we can create prononcer agreements, so I don't I have

93
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,350
very little time limit here due to time constraints.

94
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,720
I'm just doing this.

95
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,240
So let us see how we can get rid of this construction material.

96
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,980
So as we created of that student part, we need to create a Buddhist instruction methodology.

97
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:49,390
So again, I mean, we're doing all these things, you mean, but I'm inputting pages, all pages.

98
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,280
Let me enjoy this.

99
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,310
A did.

100
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,590
Instructions.

101
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:06,300
With this number, because it's no good product instruction operation, the operation in the city,

102
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,560
basically for the public part, will get the parameters for that purpose.

103
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,980
If that part is equal, it will go to that park or otherwise, it will go to the toilet part.

104
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,700
We'll update instruction and deliver instruction.

105
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,900
Remember, I need to create an instructional method also because it contains the logic of that object

106
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,670
instruction to me earlier as a creator for.

107
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,190
Student.

108
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,970
So result will contain all the desert information for that student purpose.

109
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,940
OK, so update instructional.

110
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,820
Let me say this first and let me show this what's going on.

111
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,530
So as you know, I've added instructions to Ernst Non-confidence this.

112
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,430
I will just copy this because I want to insert title European.

113
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,550
I'm reading.

114
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,430
Options.

115
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:21,950
OK.

116
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:30,790
Lexi, similarly, we created this, I need to hear this part again, because if original then modified,

117
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,550
if this instruction list, it will send me to direct you do that, but it's not true.

118
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,010
I mean, so this isn't basic logic for that of instruction.

119
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,900
No, what we require.

120
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,630
So we are done with this.

121
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,320
So now we are needed.

122
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,730
The lead instruction part also let me create another, I believe, the instruction.

123
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,480
Just justified on religious people union.

124
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,510
This.

125
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,440
New GSP.

126
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:10,700
OK.

127
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,480
Remember the names here, if you are mentioning some of their names, it will not look.

128
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,060
OK.

129
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:20,930
No.

130
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,370
Listen, Dylan, this.

131
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,620
Again.

132
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,960
Do your instruction.

133
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,930
So let me deal to deliver the instruction, but also your.

134
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,250
Again, simple logic.

135
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,390
Or delayed instruction?

136
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,210
Instruction night, that instruction get parameter, which basically means instruction, if that delete

137
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,550
record.

138
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,560
So there is the delete record I'm using is.

139
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,080
Delete instruction.

140
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,720
So this from the TV and.

141
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,860
Instruction.

142
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:29,920
So I'm deleting I'm what I am using digital economy to insert the instruction to you.

143
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:41,740
So now you can understand why I'm using the so, but if I'm not using different packages, it will take

144
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,590
too much time for the creation of the solid.

145
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:52,320
So creating this alert is a task for the developer, as you can see, because they need to create and

146
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,730
I need to mention everything and serve that purpose.

147
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,900
So once I created this internet model, it contains instruction to delete record, so I'm using that

148
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,280
method in that part.

149
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,530
So as you can see inside the model instruction to open this digital economy.

150
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,870
So now we are done with the instruction part.

151
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,280
So our remaining part is no the question list.

152
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:25,020
So let's see if we can use that question list again, because it also contains some Christian or Christian

153
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,990
list object question.

154
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,520
It's a new GSP.

155
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:37,800
Similar things I'm using, I'm using similar logic, but variables are different just because it contains

156
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,580
all different.

157
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,740
And it's it is using the database.

158
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,940
So let me create and I already it.

159
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,610
Let's see how we can correct.

160
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,230
This winter.

161
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,860
OK, so.

162
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,120
Update, Christian.

163
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,970
So now this is done only.

164
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,410
OK, now this is done.

165
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,620
But the question now is remaining, which contains logic and this very similar thing like.

166
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,640
These only and let me put theories of that question.

167
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,780
And it will create this GSP and square this part also.

168
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,340
Miller.

169
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,860
Delete that part because it contains some default code.

170
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,060
Go to this part.

171
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,570
So I am not deploying it again and again, because at the end of this program or everything, I'm going

172
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,640
to deploy the single thing on I am going to deploy.

173
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,670
No single party will be sold.

174
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,900
Let me use this one.

175
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,230
OK, so similar thing.

176
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,550
I'm using his.

177
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,850
I'm getting.

178
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,580
Christians.

179
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,790
OK, so.

180
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,430
This will import everything.

181
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,950
I mean, importing only Christians, do you, because these are only required, no need to important

182
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,270
before anything.

183
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:33,860
Option, the option B options, the Option B I'm importing is the answer, then if you are changing

184
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,610
something.

185
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,440
Or questions?

186
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:45,240
It will relate to this part in the state of Missouri has acknowledged it in the database.

187
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,670
It's not exhibition is open.

188
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,380
You can put that part.

189
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:55,460
So this is all about how we can create in B and everything in, for part, I'm going to create some

190
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,140
articles, questions and everything.

191
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,570
So I will just go through that and I will declare our project on the sort.
