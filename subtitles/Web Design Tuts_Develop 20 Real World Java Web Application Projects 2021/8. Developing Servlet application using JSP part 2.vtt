00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:09.000
So in previous rebellion, I told you we already created a filter for feeding and checking that box.

2
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:19.060
Now what we are going to do on what we are going to perform, it's commenting if you haven't noticed

3
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.500
that this is my encryption filter and everything I to mention here.

4
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.790
So.

5
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.340
I give it as a ladies, you may delete that part also.

6
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.180
I just told you how we are going to create a filter party to your.

7
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.400
In Java.

8
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.550
So you can be able to spot audio.

9
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.360
You can keep it as like this one.

10
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.990
So I do index, but to mention, let me mention Lake Lake image.

11
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.440
OK.

12
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.280
Or at least message for this part.

13
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.170
It rose and with their next idea, incriminating music data to create a reset anyway.

14
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.390
So next, in this simple form, it's like creating host.

15
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.180
Now this is my response time.

16
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.350
We're just going to put encrypted and decrypted data here.

17
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.160
So let me just use.

18
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.440
I already created one glass and everything that we can use that are completely clear.

19
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.690
First of all, I already.

20
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.130
William already created new buildings, and I will explain how it's going to work.

21
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.560
Basically what this is and the bills.

22
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.330
OK, so the whole thing is not, so what is this thing?

23
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.150
So this is my interim free dorm room instead of using what I'm using here.

24
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.920
And distinctive filtering.

25
00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.960
Also broke the glass with celebrities running and stippling, so it will my part again.

26
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.270
So.

27
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:14.900
Take me to one can let me close my personal economic meltdown to encrypt part I already created.

28
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.770
I'm mentioning the decline in bullion as we learned through the country as it is then do see therefore

29
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.020
the filtration filter and message.

30
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.130
So I'm thinking long message as a message and similar thing.

31
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.520
I'm going to read it, but here I am.

32
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.110
Using it as means a lot.

33
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.280
He is algorithm I'm using, I'm using here B, which is a very strong algorithm.

34
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:50.930
The previous encryption, which is using his very strong delivery algorithm, Kimberly is using it like

35
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.380
it is creating the option for latent, encrypted multiple times.

36
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.420
It's decrypted multiple times to avoid the more security needs.

37
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.840
Excellent platform.

38
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.590
First, I mentioned only is so it's one thing only instead of this I'm using to building stability,

39
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.780
then I'm setting the attributes here.

40
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.300
And request this budget response to.

41
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.430
Wait a minute for me.

42
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.020
It is boss, so it will go directly to that part.

43
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.230
This boss dodges that request.

44
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.530
And with all these things, sort.

45
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.550
But you know what animals are, so if you want to check, you can check that it's raining.

46
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.560
And that's a little hot here.

47
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.290
So.

48
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.940
Deploying is an interesting building.

49
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.500
Let me go to this encryption little messages.

50
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.620
Hello.

51
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.230
Well.

52
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.000
I already created Helloworld Encrypt data.

53
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.220
So it will encrypt data for me.

54
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.170
No, you get it.

55
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.760
This is my people.

56
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.860
It is encrypted algorithm design.

57
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.660
Hello, world, is this if you want to do another thing?

58
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.550
I am owner of this application.

59
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.590
I just.

60
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.200
And team.

61
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.810
OK, so that's a random message, including energy he's created.

62
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.410
So.

63
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.670
I created both platforms on the same path.

64
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.270
Let me tell you why I created the shortlist, not performing, no application for marketing.

65
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.820
You can create encryption data from trees next and decryption data filter is another program.

66
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.180
If they want the same data, you can put and send this data to your friend or object.

67
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.440
So if someone is existing data, no one can understand, what does this mean?

68
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.020
There is no meaning for this, and there are scarce goods also, but it's decrypting and water of this

69
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.580
application.

70
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.580
Ask me anything but.

71
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.470
So this is how it's working, the encryption and decryption of data on this.

72
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.940
So I created one simple platform You can work, you can extend it more.

73
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.380
You then create jet application with this ciphertext downloaded on you.

74
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.230
You can handle messaging things like this.

75
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.480
But then for the most part.

76
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.370
So will you understand?

77
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.840
And I will explain briefly this call if you want to choose.

78
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.600
You can delete this or this is no longer required.

79
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.230
All right.

80
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:59.240
So I'm using this as my info to do this, but I told you it's how it's looking.

81
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:06.350
Firstly, the encrypted mode and creating encrypting decryptor, and I'm printing and doing that request

82
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.190
dispatched to this.

83
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.540
If I'm reading the catch neuter, it will bring me this.

84
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.820
You can easily do it.

85
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.080
So but the problem with solid is it's printing the output in console also.

86
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:31.340
So that might be one data breach euros so you can check the URL if you're putting this in our filter.

87
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:38.720
You might get this also if I'm using so that you will not get these all back in part.

88
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.820
But what is this so little of context and why I'm putting this?

89
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.170
I can create one database entries with this lock files.

90
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.730
Hope you understand.

91
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.690
Thank you.
