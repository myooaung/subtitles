1
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:09.760
In previous part, I mentioned the functional requirements of a block system, building block block

2
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.090
system, and I know you how we are going to perform each and every year function requirements, application

3
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.750
requirements.

4
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.360
So in this part, I'm going to mention what I'm going to perform here, which is basically solid despite

5
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.320
Judy's connection each and everything yet.

6
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.120
So stay connected with this and let us see what these other.

7
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.110
So Java.

8
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.280
So if you know what is the banking part of the, well, front end is basically what you're looking to

9
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.480
do is stimulants uses what you consider that is one thing in your web page and you are writing that

10
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.810
song.

11
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.110
If you want something, you go into your new store.

12
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.230
So what is the latest?

13
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.410
So do you go to the database and you enter in that database?

14
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.100
No.

15
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.260
The thing is you are writing in the form of a.

16
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.020
So how are your knees faced in the hallways stored in their databases?

17
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.770
Because the message on this is good for you.

18
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.020
What do you gain from the search results?

19
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.340
Suggest we do this because a great place.

20
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.650
So these are more different.

21
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.930
Contents has been considered as a structure.

22
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.010
Each journey would be very different.

23
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.640
Make some good statements like create and so on.

24
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.200
So these are interesting, but maybe your writing experiment is very complicated.

25
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:41.450
So each increase in consideration people are not against fun as a parameters, and I would our Java

26
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.700
will handle that page that that and we did it and will be in that database.

27
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.020
It's basically like a request and response system in Java in the subject party.

28
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.350
So, so is there technology which is used to create live education?

29
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.440
Again, Solarte is an API that provides interface and class for editing the interface and class, if

30
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.630
you know those are mistakes.

31
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.460
Classes are structures of objects and interfaces and you can see instance of classes.

32
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.920
So these are all different concepts, much of the performance interfaces and classes, but the next

33
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.500
half of Soviet.

34
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.660
So, so ladies and interface that must be implemented for creating this attitude.

35
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.040
Are you going to say there is a solid part which can perform the Soviet actions each day, but also

36
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:41.380
soliloquies of glass as soon as you start to form as a glass with 74 lenses that look sort of Olfson

37
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.390
was, I mean, so suddenly it's deployed on the sober part of me.

38
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.120
Extends the capabilities of the surplus and response.

39
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.270
You know, I hope you can say these bombs look incoming request.

40
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.190
So we're going to request any response.

41
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:04.860
I will tell you why you are so keen on a move for cars and of us searching cars on a movie that you

42
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.610
request.

43
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.320
Just sort of show me the information about God's got us.

44
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.720
This would be ghastly motor vehicles.

45
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.410
So you are asking for the request.

46
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.250
So no.

47
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.130
So what's your response to that particular page on it?

48
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.800
Consider these two photocatalyst you will want to see.

49
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:35.100
So so what if that food columnist and we respond, we are certainly so these very complex thing as well.

50
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.780
Whatever it may be, a standard more is becoming very became very complicated request and responses.

51
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.780
Very helpful for deploying your evaluation because the replication performance performs, some dedicated

52
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.380
perform actions like mine in my guess is from the blog system.

53
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.390
But for the other applications considered as a liability management, there are some different actions

54
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.210
to so for particularly that we need to write cool who perform such actions.

55
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.010
So it can respond to any request.

56
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:17.350
Why we are proceeding with Java, so there are many other options you can see C++ both languages on,

57
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.210
so you don't even use JavaScript, which is very popular when writing such cases.

58
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.880
So, so they're designed with components like deployed on the server and create dynamic pages.

59
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:38.540
So one advantage of Java solid what we can say and learned this over about nonrenewable on a plan to

60
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.170
extend your abilities with some limitations.

61
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.880
So this isn't about how we are providing the Java solid.

62
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.320
So let's see to really build additional Java.

63
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.600
So.

64
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.400
This is my client.

65
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.790
It was a new request, sort of what we just heard one response, oh, at the right time, and it really

66
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.940
needed someone who looked clap in that response.

67
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.000
So it can be some copy of a document can be your data.

68
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.470
It can change anything you can provide.

69
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.860
We can see silver, can we?

70
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.630
So there are different things requests this it in so late, but before the end, I just want to mention

71
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.800
there, are they blowing on the sovereign?

72
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.340
So what is the beautiful thing?

73
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:32.650
It will be handled through the tailpipe heating part 2.0, the data control clearance you just saw in

74
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.260
Europe, long a.m. on my system, only simultaneous video and using this my system.

75
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.080
So sometimes due to the mindset of what is not really strong, I'm using some.

76
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.660
Low level sort of alone, we can say low-cost suitable for the deployment of my application for boss

77
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.550
who.

78
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:59.690
Oh, because I don't want to waste documentary money on that part owner of this block system.

79
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.470
I just implemented the silver port on the lower end.

80
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.870
If I use some other technologies, I need to mention multi-threading Typekit.

81
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.130
You know, because it will not end before I need to mention.

82
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.300
Otherwise, it will have some clients with the different processes.

83
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.630
And as I said, what is very low and sort of what it cannot handle that many requests.

84
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:32.320
So instead of that, I can use Java Salute, which in real time ability to create multitudes.

85
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.660
What you the more degrading things of lucid process divining the different, different small process

86
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:44.530
is known as a text, and multitasking is like handling many processes editing so it can be very draining

87
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.760
the client as one process.

88
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.700
It can really delayed so several takes and can be used as my or application to run.

89
00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.640
But before you can use, I can handle more request using military training in Java so like other than

90
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.430
anything or any other platform.

91
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:11.450
So reverse dispatch, it is basically then in the thesis what we can see interfaces of Java solid despite

92
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:17.860
the request to another resource from another resource basically just proceeding from one page to other

93
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.100
page.

94
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.770
It can be extremely stable, so let this be.

95
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.920
You can use anything here.

96
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.530
So for what it is, just basically forwarding and improving, just basically including the scene file

97
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.550
inside your team or you can see insert the same page you're going to see.

98
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.030
So this is the forward forward emitter, as I told you.

99
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.520
And you can use this.

100
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:50.890
So what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to use some default things here or like some uses, file.

101
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.280
Style and style ceases to decline my silver part.

102
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.850
Oh, then I'm going to use some libraries, but also here because.

103
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.010
To deploy such cases, I need to.

104
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.220
Oh, mention it from.

105
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:18.390
What you can see, and I don't want to create its longest gets stretched, so I'm going to use some

106
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.610
before she use this part here.

107
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.310
So let me add such files.

108
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:34.210
If you are seeing this episode so you can see, I'm currently adding this and what I'm going to do.

109
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:40.510
Let me close this because it will be deployed again and again as a DSP, but it will deploy it again

110
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:40.960
and again.

111
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.060
Let me add one who will also you.

112
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.120
I will tell you what is the full beast?

113
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.030
We will.

114
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.590
It will do the beautiful thing about here.

115
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.800
Do this again.

116
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.170
Nothing what is just any part we can see in our fighting.

117
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:05.850
So let me add a situates then images and label using Excel.

118
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.500
So you can enter directly these images.

119
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.880
These images are nothing but some live images only, as you can see, there are some images we can use

120
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.490
here as my background part.

121
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.660
Some.

122
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:31.160
Against Linkin Park, each and every team, then some Beijing fight with oars and each and everything

123
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.330
will be easier.

124
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:33.890
So let's see.

125
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.830
I'm going to do here.

126
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.190
Once this is done.

127
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.990
You can check these files.

128
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.510
So sometimes there may be a eroding.

129
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.800
These cases.

130
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.980
So what is Iranian?

131
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.980
OK, so I can look definitely.

132
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.810
So there is no you didn't.

133
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:26.150
OK, so this is my just everything here I mention as my CSIS.

134
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:34.490
So this is not me in this part, because I was mentioning what I want to do here.

135
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:57.650
So let me add in the tradition, so this is not just.

136
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:09.170
Tim, here I'm going to add here, so let me show you there is too much of feeling here, I used writing

137
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:17.510
this formatting where disease or WTO oil excuse me page because I'm using your ADX, I will tell you

138
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.940
what is basically asynchronous time.

139
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.350
I'm going to use it.

140
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.240
Then some keywords description and taken as a test I changes to.

141
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:36.970
The globe is doing this, so I will tell you, what is these things, I just added a script here and

142
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.820
are looking at your style uses I.

143
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.270
So let me first deploy this part.

144
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.330
Clean and Bill.

145
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:57.090
Will this successful be clear, this sort of what part?

146
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:31.040
So now, in my opinion, this diplomat, let me show you how this is looking.

147
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.550
So if you are on my part, only you can take.

148
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.350
I created each and everything.

149
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.830
All state was really stood out with each and everything long form.

150
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.530
So these are some different things I use, the other you can usually think.

151
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.740
And I mentioned some things you to do reality channel editing.

152
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.200
You can check here and I'm using this part.

153
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.430
But let me.

154
00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.190
Jake, for this purpose.

155
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:05.390
So you are all about who I am mentioning everything you saw in for the good part.

156
00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.770
What I'm going to do.

157
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:12.820
I'm going to mention some important things you saw on.

158
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.260
It is exploitation it.

159
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.810
So you can take this literally stimulus are loaded.

160
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.790
So this is it.

161
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.830
When we mention, but before this, let me tell you.

162
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.820
What I'm going to do here.

163
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.410
Well, let me go to the PPD part.

164
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.410
So the early visitor dispatcher, as I told you.

165
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.750
What is the team here request dispatcher?

166
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.890
You can check here as.

167
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.480
What is the basic thing?
