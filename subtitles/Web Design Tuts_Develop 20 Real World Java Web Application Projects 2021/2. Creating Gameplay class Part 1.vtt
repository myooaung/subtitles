1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:09.210
In previous things, what we created or we created one gameplay class with experience of Japan and which

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.780
is going to use the same skill is not an actual action listeners.

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.160
So we will create that part.

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.520
But and we are assuming we are, we will create one malfunctions later.

5
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.510
So now this is done, but we didn't in this game play.

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.010
There should be.

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.450
Game is not also so knowledge to basically the keyboard, and it's not, you can say.

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.240
And let me mention this one individual.

9
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:43.530
So this will be used for direct reference of our key listener then said focus will focus.

10
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.430
I will fall.

11
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.430
Focusing the bullying part and which is always true.

12
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.070
We mentioned to focus our lives for and like that these should be fixed.

13
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.020
These are not is changing part.

14
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:08.840
So let me mention this then sit focus traveler wanting travel keys, travel pleas for travel in the

15
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.640
teens and enable these.

16
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.070
I need to mention this anyone can.

17
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.310
And let me mention as false, because I the start of I don't want to clear that part.

18
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.630
And in this, let me mention time world is equal to.

19
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.180
New.

20
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.770
Languid.

21
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.410
Billy.

22
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.850
On Mondays.

23
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.330
So this will incorporate Andy and.

24
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.400
We were injured and stymied.

25
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.520
Not.

26
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.420
Stunned.

27
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.780
So.

28
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.390
OK.

29
00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:00.210
And let me mention, this is not in this time what it is is this should be an export swing, not by

30
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.780
motorbike.

31
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:12.690
Always so now you can check it's not remembering there are two things kind of bad timing when is for

32
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.330
you to publish, which is console?

33
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.270
Another is for you, everybody, which is Java.

34
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.100
So before that are using I'm using Java util because Java directly to that part where, no, I'm using

35
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.380
these.

36
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.740
So this will remove all the parts.

37
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.920
Now I need to create one pentameter to create any wind things here.

38
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:44.910
So let me mention one meter public wide thing with one parameter graphics.

39
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.140
Which is AWG matter graphics.

40
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:58.310
And inside this, it would create method part and oh, I forgot to close the panties.

41
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.900
Now let us mention these things for background.

42
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.820
Looking great.

43
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.750
First background.

44
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.650
Dot Satekla, I'm going to set color here.

45
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.500
Now you can remember always color, but I'm using here directly.

46
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.490
Colored or black?

47
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.140
So that's AWG.

48
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.870
And look unmentioned like these also black.

49
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:33.100
For the giving the club, then, do you don't I need to create and reflect and reacting.

50
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:42.520
So I am going to see a genetically rectangular team one comma, one comma six nine.

51
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.060
Oh, come on.

52
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.270
Let me mention height for you winning duels.

53
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.810
So this is the team which is black, which is I'm going to create then.

54
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.030
Drawing.

55
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.250
Matt Mamta also thinks I'm going to break my door, bro.

56
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.870
I'm going to create and that's a function with another thing, so we will create that little, but.

57
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.820
Which is basically a graphic story, which is a graphic studio with.

58
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.780
And that's it.

59
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.720
We will create my draw little part, so that my teams, my paintings get map and map things we are going

60
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.000
to create later, then borders.

61
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.200
Let's move on border guards, said color.

62
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.790
For the border.

63
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.780
Ladies, let me mention Colorado.

64
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.740
Yellow.

65
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.460
So there are default things you can use or you can use exactly some quotes for your book was also that's

66
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.960
all but I'm using here.

67
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.430
My team, the Yankees, again, simple zero zero comma, three comma for only two.

68
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.030
So these are the border things I'm going to do and.

69
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.240
Let me copy this part again and again.

70
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.770
Let me mention what I'm going to do is I'm just going to change some parts for the law and higher parts,

71
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.960
so I think can were in.

72
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.310
So this will be the side part.

73
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.030
Six, nine, two, while deploying this, you will understand what these these things, I'm going to

74
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:31.650
mention zero, then three and four, OK, so this is the part about but these teams are acting as a

75
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:39.120
lawyer on borders of my circle, which is awaiting to get that ball out of their conscience.

76
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.600
No.

77
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.350
Let me mention scores, farm scoring opposition.

78
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.510
Did not sit in.

79
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:58.610
Color, let me mention here of hate, military age, where you don't know so you can feel like there

80
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.060
are different colors also, so let me mention here, where does it is?

81
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.090
Then let me mention G Dot second because.

82
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:16.810
Format is very important, yet formed in this one, I'm mentioning City, which is very common for an

83
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.640
IT system, and it works on only two.

84
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.540
Work with this form, dog, Will.

85
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.790
And looking mentioned, diseases 20 fatal.

86
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.130
And let me mention one thing here.

87
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:40.670
Oh, I created these things, but I forgot to create new form material.

88
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.650
So OK.

89
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.500
So this will not work as a foreign team.

90
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:54.920
And, OK, I need to mention one thing for 20 Grosjean, which is just not deploying into so.

91
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.110
Instead of graphic school evaluation, Dostum's directly.

92
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:12.630
With three different things, so these things in interior part less cause I'm going to mention you scored

93
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.270
and there's no mention for you.

94
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.000
94, my 30 absolute assets.

95
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.510
So this will act as a store scores.

96
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.760
Now let us create two or three things here.

97
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.780
One is pardon and an underage ball because I created more and everything, but I haven't created independent

98
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.480
commodities, so we will create that.

99
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:42.280
For president by releasing them to create no is basically that basic are.

100
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.740
Stage four jumping the ball.

101
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.590
So that set.

102
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.240
Color for this, I'm going to switch color as.

103
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.530
Dr. Green, so you're going to hear different things on.

104
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.790
So green, I'm going to mention green.

105
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.250
And God.

106
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.100
Again, everything I need to mention.

107
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:21.090
Now what is distinctive politics, which is different things, which is our pleasure, backpedal and

108
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:21.280
move.

109
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.240
So that's a blur.

110
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.760
And now the ball is in and new dimension.

111
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.160
So again, I'm going to mention.

112
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.460
You look at only for ball and get taught.

113
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:45.170
Now that's a rectangle, I need to mention, wilting here, so I mentioned, well, team then position

114
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.560
an intervention ball position, excuse my ball position.

115
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:51.940
Beautician by.

116
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:59.310
Omar going home or doing that, so that's height and weight, height and weight of these things.

117
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:06.810
And then we will create two or three things later, which is when you win game the total breaks and

118
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.220
basic logic behind this.

119
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.130
We will see in the hour the next part.

120
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.600
I hope you understand.

121
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.980
Thank you for this.
