WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.570
So in the previous bar, we have created the Ethereum Classic, which is going to be responsible for

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.850
testing and running off the application.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:17.980
And then we have created this account class, which is going to manage everything about the calculation

4
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.700
thing and that input output management.

5
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:30.490
So we have created some global activities, such as customer, no spin, no checking balance and saving

6
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.910
balance.

7
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:40.720
And like initially setting a value of zero to what that balance is now this can input method is going

8
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:49.780
to scan the input by the user according to which that choice, which is input in the function, will

9
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.830
be performed.

10
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.710
So we have created this account named constructor.

11
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:06.310
So this account object is containing some arguments, such as customer number, pin number, checking

12
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.770
balance and saving values.

13
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:17.410
So all these four are going to be documents off this account constructor and we have access all four

14
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.470
of them with the help of this device.

15
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:29.230
This keyboard is going to assist all the objects, which is declared inside the class to this account

16
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.800
object.

17
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:39.130
So now we have quite like creating the class, creating the constructor, passing the arguments and

18
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.630
then like accessing that object with the help of this Cuba.

19
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:52.900
Now after that, we are going to use Cert and yet the methods for accessing are like us get.

20
00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:01.570
The method is used for accessing all four of them in their classes, and that method is used to update

21
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.340
their values accordingly.

22
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:12.450
So the first thing we are going to like get is going to be the customer number, of course.

23
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.440
So public and trying to get the customer number.

24
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.870
And this customer number is already declared variable.

25
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.820
So get customer number.

26
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:39.460
Is used to like access that private specified body in the event, and this is going to simply return

27
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.680
the customer number, which the like suggestions are showing.

28
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.360
So we have to get that customer number now.

29
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.710
After that, we will be like getting all four of the global body of we have declared.

30
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:09.460
So I will be copying this and pasting for four more times in order to like access all four of the global

31
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.330
variables, which are specified as prizes on for 19 years.

32
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.940
So after the customer number, we are head for the pin number.

33
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.080
And this is going to return the pin.

34
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.370
But of course.

35
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.020
After which we are having double.

36
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.810
No date that time for the chickens balance and savings balance.

37
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.250
So, yes, for the checking balance, we are going to use checking.

38
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.220
Balance.

39
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.600
And this is going to like help us to access the checking balance.

40
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.990
And similarly, the function will be returning this checking balance.

41
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.600
So I am pasting into the sea was small.

42
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.800
Yes.

43
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.950
So similarly, we are going to like use this double turn.

44
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:24.270
For the savings balance, just replacing this checking with savings and also has.

45
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.930
So we are done with her getting all four of the global variables we have declared.

46
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:44.810
Whenever it is needed by any other class off this project, now, our second concern is to like us,

47
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.220
said all four of them we have used get for all four of them.

48
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:59.210
Now the next one is to say, and that segment today is going to help us to update the values of these

49
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.120
four whenever we need it.

50
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.960
So like in the next step.

51
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.180
Public.

52
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.940
In.

53
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.810
Gus said customer number.

54
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.540
And this is going to update the.

55
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:33.170
And we have to pass like arguments inside this as customer, no, as this segment today we are using

56
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.290
to update the value of the customer number.

57
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:48.000
And this keyword will be again used to access the customer number first and then third.

58
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.140
Think this to customer number again?

59
00:05:52.290 --> 00:06:03.110
And the next step, this will return the customer simply like now, get the metal doing so with the

60
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.920
help of suggestions, everything is so convenient saving it.

61
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:17.630
And yes, we have heard the mantra of our customer number and segment word for it also.

62
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.630
Now we are going to use this similar thing for the pin number.

63
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:35.280
So I just changing the customer on the Pinhead and everywhere, just simply replacing.

64
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.670
Buster might've been.

65
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:51.140
Also, the bin is in danger, so nothing is going to throw an exception in any manner stopping again.

66
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.520
And setting it to.

67
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.530
Also, this is going to return the pin number.

68
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:11.800
So replacing so head, we are done with good thing and setting of all the like direct the by lightning

69
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.220
bolts.

70
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:21.460
Now our next concern is to like yes, for calculating the checking of the law.

71
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:28.690
So here we have two types of accounts checking some savings.

72
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:38.890
Now suppose if the U.S. pulls one and he asks you this vicious storage to draw funds from the checking

73
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.580
account.

74
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:48.130
So we have to set our like a mathematical calculator function, which is going to like calculate the

75
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:55.010
amount which will be left in the checking balance after that specificamente.

76
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.760
So public.

77
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:06.320
Double, which is that they started for the balance checking balance.

78
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:16.400
And like we are going to calculate so public numbers, calculate the checking balance.

79
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.390
Yes, replacing this and get out of it and kill it.

80
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:26.920
And territory.

81
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:36.910
This is going to contain a amount as out of human, and this is going to be a double take that I began

82
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.360
inside this calculating function.

83
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.370
We are going to like update this checking balance.

84
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:56.530
So checking balance minus that amount now user and board forward to draw from the checking account,

85
00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.190
of course.

86
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:07.800
So after this, let us enclose this inside of bracket for a better record new presentation.

87
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:14.230
And this is going to read done the checking balance after the successful withdrawal.

88
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:22.240
So yes, this is the method for calculating the chair like the checking the.

89
00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:24.970
Checking withdrawal.

90
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:32.330
Not to balance it and draw this method is for David to draw.

91
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:33.370
So, yes.

92
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:41.440
And how do we have balance so after them is to draw the balance is going to be updated.

93
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.610
So this is a method for calculating the chicken to draw my time.

94
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.780
Now, in this similar way, we are going to calculate thus saving draw.

95
00:09:53.170 --> 00:10:02.740
So I will be copying this same function and pasting in 10 for calculating the saving way to draw.

96
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:09.930
So just replacing that chicken with 10 saving A..

97
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:17.140
So yes, this is for saving the argument of the amount.

98
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.820
No change there.

99
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:28.360
Just the chicken pox will be changed with the saving by and everything will be just mean soon.

100
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:36.000
So yes, this is the function for calculating the saving withdrawal values.

101
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.550
Now we are done with the now withdrawn balance calculation.

102
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:49.750
Our next concern is to calculate the deposit balance for both of that checking account and savings accounts.

103
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.110
So yes, we will be doing that.

104
00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:02.980
OK, so here we are done with her savings deposit and like checking before we we have already covered,

105
00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.550
thus saving withdraw and checking withdrawal function.

106
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.920
Now, a similar way, we have checked their deposit so far, the withdrawal.

107
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:19.900
We have to subtract the checking balance from the amount, which is to be withdrawn and for their deposit.

108
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:24.850
They have to add their checking balance on their savings balance.

109
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:33.430
With that amount, which is going to deposit as deposit is to the bank and Richard is away from the

110
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.730
bank.

111
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.980
So yes, that calculation is performed in that now for calculating the transplant that they need to

112
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.260
be from checking and savings.

113
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.580
So for that, we have to like check those things.

114
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:53.350
We have to subtract checking balance from that amount.

115
00:11:53.710 --> 00:12:01.090
If the transfer is from checking account and if the transfer is from the savings account, we have to

116
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.970
subtract that amount from the savings balance.

117
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:11.430
And the second part of this, I think, is the savings balance will be updated with the amount that

118
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:18.430
is transferred from the savings balance to the SEER, like checking balance to the savings balance and

119
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.270
vice versa.

120
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:27.430
For all these savings transfer, so yes, that subscriptions and issues are going to be performed in

121
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.360
a similar way for both the types of transfers.

122
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:43.480
Now our next concern is to like we have performed everything about the calculation of like withdrawal

123
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.460
of deposits and transfers.

124
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:53.470
Now the next thing we are going to cover is to create a function for getting the mint to draw on input

125
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.650
from the checking and savings accounts.

126
00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.390
So yes.

127
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:10.530
This method is used to get the withdrawal in full from the U.S., and we are like taking exception kind

128
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:17.400
of paying for the import which they use like mean for withdrawing some money from the checking.

129
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.980
And we are going to do similar for the savings upon withdrawal as well.

130
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:32.260
So suppose that you wouldn't put some money like he or she wants to withdraw all thousand rupees or

131
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.280
dollars from the checking account.

132
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.820
So this system is going to dry up.

133
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:44.190
Yes, the current checking account balance will be printed in every STEM.

134
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:53.160
We have already discussed this in the introduction by and the money will be yes, displayed in the form

135
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.090
of money for man undertakings.

136
00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:03.290
Balance of added value scoring system is going to return amount you want to withdraw and this is going

137
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:08.460
to like the kind of scanner it is going to scan the input from the user.

138
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:16.700
So yes, it will be asking for the amount to be withdrawn and it is going to check mark rather than

139
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.080
the.

140
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.770
But that amount is of value and are.

141
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:27.900
So first thing that it is checking that the amount is greater than the balance.

142
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:35.910
So suppose you have 10000 in your account and you are willing to like to draw 20000, then this is not

143
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:36.750
going to happen.

144
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:43.890
The balance is greater than the naked eye withdrawn, while the balance is greater than the account

145
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:44.390
balance.

146
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:51.000
So this is going to be checked inside this try and catch exception handling method.

147
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.060
Also, the balance cannot be negative.

148
00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.570
So yes, that's what I was like on.

149
00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.310
Yes.

150
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:00.600
The said about.

151
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:09.260
So the balance will become negative if they have to draw an amount is and the already present balances

152
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.500
10 pounds.

153
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:17.670
So it is going to like, put that balance, do not be negative and there are valid input so vivid to

154
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:18.090
draw on.

155
00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:25.980
Similarly, for the savings account, we have the same try and catch exception method for the savings

156
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.060
account in the similar way after which to draw input account.

157
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.770
So checking some savings accounts works in a similar manner.

158
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.870
OK, so this is for checking deposits.

159
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:45.750
So yes, it's similar to maybe we were withdrawing the money.

160
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:53.220
We are going to deposit money to the checking account and this is going to ask like the current checking

161
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.140
account balance.

162
00:15:54.150 --> 00:16:00.230
Oh yes, if we display the card into balance, I don't know there it will ask that what is the money

163
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.540
you want deposit to your checking account?
