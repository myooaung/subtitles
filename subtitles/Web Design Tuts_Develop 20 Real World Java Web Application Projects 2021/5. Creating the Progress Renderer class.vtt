WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:08.850
OK, so in the previous five, we have covered about all the functionalities offered up by turns, the

2
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:17.580
text field, the add download button and to verify that you are in, we have like 10 cell level functionalities.

3
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.360
So check that whether that dog download to be downloaded, you are at least valid or not.

4
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.650
The DTP control check, the lower case check and all of the check we have looked up.

5
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.480
Fill in the bar, fight off this download manager to file now.

6
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.170
In this part, we are going to like check.

7
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.370
We have to like update simply the buttons.

8
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.580
You can see that initially we have pause and cancel button enable when we selected are already downloading

9
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.070
files.

10
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.560
Suppose that we have bought the file, then this highlight is going to be deferred.

11
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.040
If a file is paused, then the resume button on the console button will be highlighted.

12
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.400
Only the pause button will not highlight.

13
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.060
So that button here and I think is going to differ in according to this date.

14
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.380
So there are several states where it is downloading.

15
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.100
It is paused, it is error and it is like arrogance and completed.

16
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.370
So basically, we have four sites off status for each download you.

17
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:47.430
So this is performing all that only we have to update the buttons highlight according to what is their

18
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.060
status.

19
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.860
So we have four status.

20
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.820
Yes, we have discussed downloading, paused, edit and complete.

21
00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.150
So complete is going to be set as the default like case of this switch statement.

22
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.480
We are using this switch statement to like switch to the highlight according to the status of the buttons.

23
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.460
So yes, if the selected download is not null, this means that we are not selecting our role.

24
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.980
The selection is made so according to the status of that selected below, the buttons are going to be

25
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.640
enabled.

26
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:35.130
So suppose if we have selected or like a row which is already downloading, then the pause and cancel

27
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:43.440
by then are set to enable and the two are set to false, which means that that assuming here button

28
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.290
are to be set as disabled, so are downloading.

29
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.810
Similarly, for the first state, we have already discussed that the pause button was set to disable

30
00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:03.870
and only resume and cancel button will be enabled for our first date and for that, as did only the

31
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.140
resume and the clear button will bug like like suppose I don't advice.

32
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:18.240
We have discussed it in the working part, so if error arise, then we have to like simply assume that

33
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.820
it is not going to work in any way.

34
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.390
One only once it is going to work, like suppose that that is a break in your network.

35
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.920
The internet is not working correctly, then if it state will ensure you try to like, disconnect and

36
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.180
connect to your network.

37
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.920
Then if you hit on the resume button, then we can assume that yes, the download can again start if

38
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.220
there was an issue, but otherwise it is not going to like, perform anything.

39
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:58.950
The resume button will not work if the link is broken or there is a problem with the file inside the

40
00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:59.220
loop.

41
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:07.230
So yeah, this is for their part and by default, if the download is complete and that everything is

42
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.890
set so forth despite this clear button.

43
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:19.650
So yes, suppose that we have this hundred percent downloaded file, then if we will select this, then

44
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:27.900
only the play button will be set to enable the style of the train will be disabled for a completed state.

45
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.860
OK.

46
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.040
And also for the cancelled stage, so we can like cancer learning download in the windows, which is

47
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.550
going to work in a similar way of a complete download.

48
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:48.510
So only the Tiergarten is going to be nimble as so whatever none of the fall.

49
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.890
So those are selected, then all the writers will be said us like we have in our slides.

50
00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:04.240
We have not selected all the better software to disable this elastic windows doing that only now.

51
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.980
So what if that download is completed?

52
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.320
So we have to update No.

53
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:18.790
10's According to that, we are using this update button's function, which we have declared over.

54
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.020
So we are like, Yes, this is the data button's function.

55
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.740
We are going to call this update button function.

56
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:35.410
If software download selected is not null and we are selecting, that is a file is going to be selected

57
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.740
now.

58
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.350
What is going to be performed?

59
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.050
So this is going to update this is update button's function.

60
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.660
This is update function.

61
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:52.690
So the fire file in the window is going to be updated according to this function.

62
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.960
Now, at last, we are like setting things to the frame.

63
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:06.340
So this is the main file which will be responsible for testing and running of the application.

64
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.450
So to run in order to run this download manager.

65
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.670
We have to add like this to the bar.

66
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.220
We are using this manager object.

67
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.900
This download manager is the name of our class.

68
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.850
This manager is the object.

69
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:33.550
This new download manager is going to be run whenever, whenever we even try to run Java for this class.

70
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:45.370
And so this manager will show once the file will be executable, an image can be displayed on this task

71
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.700
bar.

72
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.320
So we have to like add this image to our folder.

73
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.740
So I am just just simply dragging and dropping used in this folder as well.

74
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.220
All the important file size, though, because instead of inside this folder only.

75
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.300
So I added this download icon button.

76
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.680
You can see this.

77
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.030
I can head also.

78
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.090
So we have added this now whenever this application will run.

79
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:22.690
Then this icon will be displayed on the top of the page and the taskbar.

80
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.680
So yes, we have our image icon.

81
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.900
We have sex like an image.

82
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.200
So this is for hoping that I can manage.

83
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:38.410
It is going to be shown on a window whenever we will run this class.

84
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.730
Download manager.

85
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:49.900
So as far I can see that that we have covered everything inside this download manager class and all

86
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.700
the functionalities and still be attached.

87
00:07:53.050 --> 00:08:00.230
So we have like successfully added everything to the frame, the add functionality to the button.

88
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.440
We have added this progress bar.

89
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:12.250
We have checked the urine and everything like this download within that text field is covered already.

90
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:22.540
Now we have like a second step to be perform is to create a progress renderer class inside this SIRC

91
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.590
folder as well.

92
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:33.460
So progress then there is going to recover the Progress Bar, which is displaying the functionality

93
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:43.720
for like a percentage of tasks on whether it is zero percent or it is completed, then it is showing

94
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.680
100 percent.

95
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:54.720
So yes, so we have imported all the packages which are going to be required inside this problem surrender

96
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:55.270
class.

97
00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:03.220
This progress render classes responsible for this column, this specific column of the table.

98
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:13.120
And we are going to cover the progress renderer in this separate class as it is the most important column

99
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.070
of overall table.

100
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.830
So what like this?

101
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:26.620
Progress ended is continuously increasing, so we have to set everything according to this, this renderer.

102
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:28.630
So inside this?

103
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:40.060
Plus, I am going to show it's like extending it to a day progress by and with the help of this.

104
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.220
Okay, so this day, Progress Bar is a component of the singularity.

105
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.480
We have extended it on.

106
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.490
The swing is already highlighted.

107
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.870
So yes, this is a.

108
00:09:54.850 --> 00:10:01.270
Java swing component that means you really displayed the progress of some tasks.

109
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:07.940
So we have components for everything inside this library, things victims so simple.

110
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.910
With the help of these things, so OK.

111
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.590
So inside this, they are going to implement.

112
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.410
OK, so what?

113
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.530
We are going to implement table surrender.

114
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:30.400
So we're having cells inside their table for progress, and that cell is going to increase whenever

115
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.670
the download is going to be performed.

116
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:42.550
So tables cell renderer is going to be implemented now inside this from Brad class.

117
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:47.500
We are going to go like initialize a constructor for progress.

118
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.570
And so it is going to be done like public progress renderer.

119
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.810
And here it is.

120
00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:03.120
And inside this, we are going to are like initialized two arguments in the mean and mass.

121
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:10.020
So now progress renderer is starting from zero and going up 200.

122
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:21.600
So yes, the progress render object is created now so far is going to be like display the min and max

123
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.170
data.

124
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.990
The progress render object.

125
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.970
So I say I don't move to this constructive thing.

126
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:36.470
Now our next concern is to politely turn this progress as the end of it for a given day.

127
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:44.360
And so we are having separate progress on this for all their downloads, which are taking place.

128
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:51.470
So you can see that here we have like separated from this dangerous for all the files.

129
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:57.950
So we are using the about one issuing 22 percent on the bill and issuing 10 12 percent.

130
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:04.120
So yes, we have to return for every specific hurdle.

131
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.130
So creating a component?

132
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:18.250
Like, if there's going to be a functioning public component and this component is going to get to that

133
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.050
specific stable cell.

134
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.080
Babel said it is.

135
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.310
Everything is to return in Cameron's case, so cable cell components.

136
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.660
It is like a random, terrible cell renderer component.

137
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:40.190
We have gone inside this function.

138
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.480
We are going to add dutiable.

139
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:57.420
Table and object, which is going to be the value of that specific provenance, suppose whatever the

140
00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.440
person is.

141
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.200
And a Boolean which is doing that is selecting.

142
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:10.320
So the highlight is going to be a bit different if that rule is selected.

143
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.540
So it is to be written together.

144
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:21.510
So there are 2D functionalities inside this function.

145
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:32.820
OK, so after this, we have to we have three more like things of focus and column to attach that also.

146
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:40.350
OK, so we have like imported all the functionalities of this good stable surrender component.

147
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.780
So there are stable value, is selected, has focused through and gone.

148
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:55.050
So the progress bar is going to be a unique sell for all the unique downloads taking place for this.

149
00:13:55.050 --> 00:14:03.450
For this, and it is going to have a focus specific role as specific column of the company table.

150
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:08.280
And also, everything is going to be covered in that order.

151
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:16.440
So we are setting up purchasing component for the Progress Bar, which is going to be our float value.

152
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:22.980
So we're taking percentages as float is our healthy practice, so send a value in.

153
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:29.670
So this is for the person 10, which is going to be displayed in the province that are interesting.

154
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:38.010
So by far, we have covered all the things in the download manager class and the progress render class

155
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:38.610
as well.

156
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.810
We have covered our two classes of this project till now.

157
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:54.120
Now there are now two more classes that are need to be covered as well the table model class and the

158
00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:04.230
other functionalities of their table, like the size, the speed, the time and the status bar, and

159
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.020
we are going to call that class simply down.

160
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:13.170
So yes, there are two more classes to be covered after this.

161
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.560
So we will see that in the next part.
