1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:08,640
So after the successful creation of the teacher and the student class, we are heading over to the school

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,240
section.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:20,280
So the school is the main body which is managing the funds in a way of giving the salary to their teachers

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,830
and receiving the fees from the students.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:32,760
So the main system here is the school for which we are creating this project for the management of soirées

6
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,020
in the school.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,640
Similar way of teaching the students.

8
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,020
We will create a class.

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:49,030
School and inside the class, we will see some variables so private.

10
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,150
Feature.

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:53,960
Peter?

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:03,960
We know that the school comprises of teachers and students, so it is the beginning.

13
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:14,260
Collective bargaining for this class by initializing the students and teachers, soirées the students

14
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,870
and teachers now.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:28,100
School consists of teachers and students, but what is the actual purpose of this project like we are

16
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,870
here to manage the funds?

17
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:39,890
So how the funds are consistent of in the funds we have our total money on, our total fund is earned

18
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:49,100
by the school and thus will have to spend it in various ways of giving this salary to certain teachers

19
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,680
and say something as a profit.

20
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,510
So, yes, we have to care about people sort of that thing also.

21
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:08,160
So creating a private a static class for the total money, we will learn about stepping in something

22
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,600
total money on.

23
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,290
Yes.

24
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,960
So the total money earned by the school and in the similar way.

25
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,430
Total money spent.

26
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,470
So I will copied this part and pasted her.

27
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:39,070
Total money spent, so yes, we have successfully created the members of this school class as teachers,

28
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,550
students.

29
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,790
The total money on and the total money spent.

30
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:53,250
Now, you must be wondering, that is student and teacher class, we initialize the ID engine, which

31
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,900
was unique for every teacher and student.

32
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,870
Each teacher has a unique name and each student has a unique name, similar with that IDs.

33
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,990
What does a school contain?

34
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,980
A single teacher?

35
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,210
A single student?

36
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,860
Is it possible?

37
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,980
Like, think about this on yourself.

38
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:21,600
The answer is no, that a school can never be built with single teacher or student.

39
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,350
It will not exist in that.

40
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:33,700
So you must be wondering that how to add multiple teachers and students in this class new school.

41
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:44,020
So I am giving you a second and think about what comes in your mind, how to gain multiple data with

42
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,270
this teacher variable.

43
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:54,100
So a method may arise in your mind of declaring this as an addict.

44
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,570
Right.

45
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,360
So.

46
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,900
Trying it in this way.

47
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,590
Yes, so we went to Canada and they're in this way.

48
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,810
But think about it.

49
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,750
So if we take their teacher and students as an ally.

50
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:21,990
We know the concept of adding it has a limited number of sites like we have the initial line the size

51
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:27,900
of that in the beginning and it is immutable, we cannot change the size of another.

52
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:36,360
So suppose if I didn't want to leave the school or join, our teacher wants to join the school later.

53
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,750
So is it possible to do so with errors?

54
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,690
The answer is no, as it is are immutable, evicted size.

55
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:56,700
Initially, we could not alter networks, so we have to think in a broad database to create a data type

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,540
which is resizable and x, or delete data as off teachers and store names very conveniently without

57
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,940
any restrictions.

58
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,720
So removing this.

59
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,210
I am going to tell you about a very beautiful day that I call Adam.

60
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,560
Yes.

61
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:30,190
Java has this date day at least, which is pretty sizable and has many features in it, which makes

62
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,230
it useful in many movies.

63
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,490
So I am going to show you this in this demo.

64
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:43,210
Dark Java Fi Soirées Head I have already created this demo done Java file.

65
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,910
Yes, so in this.

66
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,530
I have created a demo glass and inside this public static void main string.

67
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,490
So here is a main function inside which the analyst is called.

68
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:13,810
So list in danger number is equal to you, at least this is the way to declare an analyst in Java had

69
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,350
it after writing this like, I even show you writing this again.

70
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,110
If I write, list her.

71
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,270
It is showing that it is from the Utilizzati.

72
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:35,250
And when I write this list, this import library automatically comes here.

73
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,620
So after this?

74
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,500
I have created a list called Numbers, which contains outdated type of integer.

75
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:54,130
So this is our demo function, and I am going to run some integers in the alleys and show you how it

76
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,460
works.

77
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,850
So let me remove this first and start adding it one by one.

78
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,790
So in the list, call the numbers.

79
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,340
I am going to add integer.

80
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,320
Add an integer.

81
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,360
Five Yes.

82
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,860
So yes and.

83
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,320
And another integer called.

84
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,760
Mistakenly typed in numbers, it is no.

85
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,250
Yes, so no more than 15 and.

86
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,050
This is the method to add numbers to the list.

87
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,500
It those numbers.

88
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,250
Yes, so you may copy it multiple number of times.

89
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,730
And this is the beauty of Harold, is that it is.

90
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,620
It is sizable, and it will never say no.

91
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,600
You keep adding no.

92
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,230
The rest of your life and it will never stop.

93
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,070
I am full.

94
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:11,600
There is nothing like a limitation in analyst, so after adding numbers to the list, I am going to

95
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,320
run this.

96
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:21,630
So on running this function, I am getting that test five, fifteen five, fifty fifty five, then seventy

97
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,020
six.

98
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,290
After adding some more numbers.

99
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,350
I can keep doing this multiple number of times.

100
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,890
Any number I can add like.

101
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,610
Yes.

102
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,650
And running it again.

103
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,190
Yes.

104
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:52,110
So perfect, keep adding numbers to that list, and it will keep displaying it in the terminal.

105
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,810
It will keep giving you the output and never see that downfall.

106
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:08,610
So this feature off of Java is very useful for our project as we need this kind of data type only for

107
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,950
managing our teachers and students.

108
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:23,370
So in our student dance, our fight and teacher devil fight, we are going to use the A-list feature

109
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:34,380
in the school function to call the teachers and students multiple number of times, and we can add features

110
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,910
again, again and again and adding students again and again and again.

111
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,580
So let's start begin adding this here as an add on.

112
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,950
Now let us write this teacher inside Alice.

113
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:00,270
As we discussed in that demo, far soirées A-listers created a feature.

114
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,550
Similarly for the student.

115
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,710
We are creating an Arab list for the teachers and the students.

116
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,520
So here you can see that the job you didn't list back, it is importing itself.

117
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:32,020
And as far as I know, this list, as soon as this list is declared, the packages imported itself.

118
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,180
No women, no further.

119
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:47,830
So after creating this school class, we have created our school object or a constructor as we see that.

120
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:55,000
So the school object contains the parameters as an analyst for teacher and student.

121
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:00,910
So we have used this key word for adding features to this object.

122
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,990
And students.

123
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:09,560
The total money on and total money spent is not inside this construct then, so there is no need to

124
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,580
add this giver.

125
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:21,800
So yes, we have created this object school, so romantic that objects school.

126
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,620
Is created.

127
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,540
Now moving further.

128
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:39,360
So the total money earned is zero in the beginning, and the total money spent is as low now as similar

129
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,340
as the teacher and the student.

130
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:48,480
We have said that teachers and students to the school function school class.

131
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:55,750
So we are adding teachers to the class and.

132
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,350
Yes, so setting and getting teachers and students are must to.

133
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,630
There is no restrictions with teachers and students than they are.

134
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,190
They cannot be altered.

135
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,890
So yes, we have said anger.

136
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,660
So this publicness teacher returns their teacher.

137
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:25,210
Let me comment this out through dance the teachers in the school class.

138
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:26,560
Yes.

139
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,630
Sorry.

140
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,110
Does the teacher in the school?

141
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,560
Similarly, this said.

142
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,480
This is a sad matter.

143
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:42,820
And is this a heard of said I have used as teacher for a better understanding of the goal.

144
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:50,740
So this one of the teachers in the school?

145
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:51,820
Yes.

146
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,350
So you can see that we have a certain gentleman turned up for that.

147
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:08,740
And similarly for the students and despite returns, no students in the school class and this part of

148
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,530
the students in the school class.

149
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:18,370
Now, for their total money on Park in this school, we have said the.

150
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,950
This yes, we have said this matter for total money.

151
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:38,160
So this returns the total money earned by the school, total money and so far, yes.

152
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,710
So total money earned is return to this function.

153
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:51,120
And if we need to update, we are using the segmenter and in the business of that, we have always done

154
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,680
up the total money.

155
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,710
So this update?

156
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,320
The total money earned.

157
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:01,750
Yes.

158
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:11,440
So this update, the total money owed by the school, and in this, we have summed up it as a total

159
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,250
money on.

160
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:24,800
This is does somebody in so total money on is a sum of total money earned plus money in the beginning?

161
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,860
Yes, we have lost money on it as a barometer.

162
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,140
So total money initially is zero, so we can write it as.

163
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,180
In a comment, I will show you with me.

164
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:39,950
Yes.

165
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:48,920
So this is something in the beginning of this something as zero is equal to zero plus.

166
00:14:50,080 --> 00:15:00,500
Money on support student submitted our fees like for anti-terrorism, so that total money on will store

167
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,290
of value of twenty thousand.

168
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,340
Yes.
