1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:14.440
So in previous videos or in previous project steps, what we did is we created one class email class.

2
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.580
We created a scanner class, which is public, always remember this Canada's global travel trade.

3
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.430
You're also.

4
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.160
Global, this is global you can use this cannot all in this project.

5
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.870
Then these are private.

6
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.760
These are strings on sort of global.

7
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.900
You can use disincentives in middle class and we are going to using inside these classes.

8
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.810
So all these are about creating class.

9
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.340
We already created this class.

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.170
Now we created one constructor with you, first name and last name.

11
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.660
Now what is the significance of constructor is if I am building here only these parameters I am building

12
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.990
here.

13
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.340
It is not like abstract art or something you can.

14
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.070
You are using that glass and you are not securing.

15
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.960
Anyone can change that part like your private life name or first name or last name.

16
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.630
They can change it.

17
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.620
So the significance of this is creating the structure is to receive a first name and last name and protect

18
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.710
that from the original one, which is private string was name and last name.

19
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.810
So let's move further now in this concept.

20
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.020
What I'm going to do, I'm going to assigning this name to this if you do this.

21
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.940
What we are going to use this given this not if name.

22
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.870
Is equal to ethnic.

23
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.090
Similarly for this, also like this last name, Ali.

24
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.350
Elaine is equal to any.

25
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.920
So what happened is.

26
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.380
You can see this and these are equal.

27
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.000
So it is not just forwarding the value, it's copying that value from here to here when we are going

28
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.930
to run this program.

29
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.670
Now I'm going to bring out system, not out, not Winterland.

30
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.850
In saying this, I'm going to bring new.

31
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.150
Employee.

32
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.480
Let's.

33
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.980
This board, if named.

34
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.220
Let's I'm going to do some small gap here in between and then this is not.

35
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.450
In.

36
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.110
So we are the IT constructor now inside this or we are going to develop more in this one, so I am leaving

37
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.840
some space here.

38
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.550
Now we are going to create some methods.

39
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.690
So from the PPD of our point and that template we are learning on, we want to create some email, generate

40
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.000
email, delete password.

41
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.310
For that, we need to create some methods.

42
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.620
So let's start with creating some methods you.

43
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.860
So let's begin with.

44
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.460
Some department asking the department and then password all.

45
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.760
OK, let's start with generating the email.

46
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.830
Generic.

47
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.670
Me.

48
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.040
OK.

49
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.320
Male, Mr.

50
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.030
Now, remember, this should be private.

51
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.890
So I'm creating private.

52
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.220
It's not really that you have to always created private.

53
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.440
You can create public, but to aduda abstraction.

54
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.190
I'm going to use private and going to return stream or stream generate.

55
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.160
Email.

56
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.830
This is the syntax of creating methods.

57
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.310
Now what it will return, it will be done in this format, is this not its name?

58
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:14.260
So if you are putting first name in capital and email is always in smoldered to convert this to all

59
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.990
small letters, there is a system default method.

60
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.570
Or we can say, use our library to lowercase.

61
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.070
You can see two lowercase.

62
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.500
You can put two lowercase here.

63
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.170
So what it will do if you are putting all the capitals, even if you are putting all the capitals,

64
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.010
it will create two.

65
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.020
That's one case.

66
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.030
Similarly, this dot, we know.

67
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.990
OK, before that, we need to put Dot here plus again, this dot.

68
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.110
And lame duck.

69
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.090
Bullock is.

70
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.880
Now we want to work here, and it's important.

71
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.130
Actress.

72
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.550
Then this dart.

73
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.640
Department DVT, not again to lower case.

74
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.780
This index, as I told you about all this next year.

75
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.970
Let's not symbolism, not company.

76
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.600
Dot com simple remaining.

77
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.980
So what will we do?

78
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.780
It will take first name, last name from use it, and it will put their department.

79
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.350
It's just doing letting them know we will move forward.

80
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.610
So what we did is we created the first method for we.

81
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.710
We are going to move in the second method of asking for department, asking all department.

82
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.060
Again, private string.

83
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.750
Said Department.

84
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.850
Since they began putting in.

85
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.960
Now.

86
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.890
I need to put some user interaction.

87
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.530
I'm not going to send you for the administrator, it will ask which department do we want to put?

88
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.550
So I will put here first system, not 0.3 billion.

89
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.710
The part.

90
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.690
Department goods.

91
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.590
Then what it will be.

92
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.110
It will print department codes, basically make this one.

93
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:35.570
For since new remember, Leshin will be put in the next lane next for new liner for New Zealand, I'm

94
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.440
putting flesh and.

95
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.310
Development.

96
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.830
Development.

97
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.800
Third department I'm going to put is for accounting.

98
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.750
Accounting Department.

99
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.720
And last building zero for.

100
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.520
None.

101
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.030
Nothing, I'm not going to mention here some anything that I'm putting in and.

102
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.110
So.

103
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.650
No.

104
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:25.460
What I want to create some loop or what we consider losing party on that one beauty so you can give

105
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:32.840
it to me and gives us leads to each case and something, but I'm going to use your switch case.

106
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.920
You can use defense.

107
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.700
We're using which case is more efficient here.

108
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.650
So I will create one flag here.

109
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.040
Let me tell you why I'm going to use your flag.

110
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.520
Because I want to execute it again and again, like.

111
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:50.270
If.

112
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:59.740
I'm not going to execute it again and again, it will deliver only first time, all we can say, if

113
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.720
you are anything for simply it, we ask.

114
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.800
I want to put formally evil in place, so I want to create something new.

115
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.910
I'm going to use you to do the loop or I am going to use do.

116
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.550
The Loop is very important here.

117
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:19.090
I want to execute at least one thing and do the loop will execute at least one thing for another.

118
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.350
Looks like for new value, for each loop or enhanced for loop in Java.

119
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.390
There is not like condition.

120
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.640
There is not in any condition.

121
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.980
It will move for one two.

122
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.730
But do they loop will run at least one time.

123
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.110
So I will put do you do if you know this index do?

124
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.660
Then I will put their system.

125
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.700
I'm going to ask Lake.

126
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.710
System.out.println.

127
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:43.990
This.

128
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.350
Interdepartmental.

129
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.060
So this is very simple, but department could.

130
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.460
After that, I will create one or.

131
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.820
Variable choice choice.

132
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.460
I'm what I'm going to do this next.

133
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:10.760
So you will understand what is this is this is this scanner part scanner?

134
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.840
Probably scanner part.

135
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.480
So I'm going to take you there in my switch.

136
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.560
Switching.

137
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:20.800
As.

138
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.460
Also restricts choice.

139
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.460
I will, but then this one.

140
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.300
If you don't get one.

141
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.470
Return since.

142
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.710
It's if it's bullying.

143
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.080
OK, the idea of conditioning or to break it, but there is not any significance for this.

144
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.350
You have to big statement here, but I'm going to do this reading this or it will return on June one.

145
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.130
It will not.

146
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:08.040
Again and again, start looking inside the speeches, so just returning any Brick Lane, here is three.

147
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:10.600
Return.

148
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.410
A return.

149
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:15.880
Upcoming.

150
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.730
And if kids didn't return and.

151
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.220
No.

152
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.160
Yes.

153
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.470
It is not going to.

154
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.310
And OK, guess?

155
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.840
Order pizza, guess case zero.

156
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.620
Return.

157
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.030
No, that's it.

158
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.870
So we are done with this by the WHO.

159
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.060
We are missing something.

160
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:03.410
Like, we did want to exit that loop, and we all want to create some default condition.

161
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.420
So we are done with our logic, but we are not done with our perfect goal.

162
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.260
Let me complete that one by default.

163
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.670
I will print your esteemed dog a dog print, Alan.

164
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.760
In Wellington.

165
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:20.560
Joyce.

166
00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:22.270
These.

167
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:24.430
The.

168
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.100
Again.

169
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:34.110
Now, when we are done with this note, switch gears now I will end up with or do well.

170
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.850
So this is the do part of it.

171
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.890
I will really I'll.

172
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.710
Flag.

173
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.960
So what did you do as flag is always false?

174
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.790
Not means always true.

175
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.980
It will retain the legacy.

176
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.610
Well, what it will do, it will execute at least one thing.

177
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:56.540
Written.

178
00:11:58.650 --> 00:11:59.000
Not.

179
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.690
Some.

180
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.350
Now we are done with this part.

181
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.800
As you can see what we did here.

182
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.410
Let me summarize this.

183
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:19.090
So what we did is we created one constructor public image, string, first name, last name with parameters.

184
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.080
We.

185
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:24.640
In marketing with this name, daughter's name.

186
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.680
So what we are doing, we are going to assign this afternoon to this evening.

187
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.150
This last name, but this last name and I'm going to print this year.

188
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.870
So now constructor part is not done.

189
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:43.640
We are going to create and invoke some other methods on there, but its initial conditions for the constructor.

190
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.120
No, I started with our matrix.

191
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.970
I created the first private string generator mm.

192
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:57.740
So what it will be doing, it will do generating the mail, according to our syntax.

193
00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:04.970
So this is not to lowercase into this dot or these other lines.

194
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.180
So what is the significance this note, if it will do this, if naming a dot, you know what is it will

195
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.960
convert all the strings and do lowercase.

196
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:17.270
So no need to worry about uppercase and lowercase, then dot.

197
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.530
Then again, this for last name and this for department, this for the company.

198
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:28.880
So it will be in the mail according to that, that I want to say department.

199
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.920
But setting the department is all about the process from user or we can say administrator.

200
00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:41.060
So I will wait here one, two, three and zero for the options since development or accounting, respectively.

201
00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.030
Then I will create one Boolean flag to execute that loop.

202
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.650
I'm going to use that to do the loop because it will at least run one time.

203
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:55.690
Again, the Department for Choice, I'm giving, I'm using speech and speech gives me 30 years, which

204
00:13:55.690 --> 00:14:02.250
creates conditions you can use if all conditions also, but it will take too much time to execute back

205
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.200
to reduce time complexity.

206
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.020
Are you switched choice?

207
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.870
This one is false, gets two for development.

208
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:16.050
And according to that default condition, exiting that will do well with the plan and returning.

209
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.100
So I relate to matters, then read to me and said department.

210
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:29.610
So now we are dealing with this, so I will explain the what is the significance of this in part also.

211
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.450
So this will, as I know you understood that.

212
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.040
So let's try it.

213
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:39.720
What is this part?

214
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.620
So let me show you what is this significances?

215
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.210
So this is the this is the reference variable that returns the current object.

216
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.550
It can still tend to be a bit of the object.

217
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.290
It simply leaves global and class variable and the scene.

218
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.450
You want to look at it will assign.

219
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.770
And we just did it.

220
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.800
The global variable is different and class would also seem for that purpose.

221
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.070
We just use this word.

222
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:09.690
If this is not used here, it will return null value.

223
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:15.210
If the local variable and ensigns and variable are different, there is no need to use it.

224
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.850
What difference are like?

225
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.640
Global is different.

226
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.780
Velocity will be different.

227
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.440
What do you want a standard to?

228
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.510
Is equal to, is equal to.

229
00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.700
You can do it, but name should be different.

230
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.520
So avoiding using different names, I used your this keyboard and this is very efficient.

231
00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.360
Also, this can be used to invoke God in classrooms.

232
00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:40.050
What I did in this part to invoke the current class constructed.

233
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.210
So we will move out of there with another matter.

234
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:45.850
So you're.

235
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.910
So let's see what are other methods we are going to see.
