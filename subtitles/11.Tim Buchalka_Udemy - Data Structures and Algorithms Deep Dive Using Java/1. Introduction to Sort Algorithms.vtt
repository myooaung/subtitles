<v ->In this section we're going to cover</v>
4

4

00:00:08.350  -->  00:00:10.380
popular sort algorithms like
5

5

00:00:10.380  -->  00:00:13.490
bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort,
6

6

00:00:13.490  -->  00:00:17.280
counting sort, insertion sort and a few others.
7

7

00:00:17.280  -->  00:00:19.130
We won't cover every sort algorithm
8

8

00:00:19.130  -->  00:00:20.400
that we're gonna cover in the course
9

9

00:00:20.400  -->  00:00:24.610
because a few of them require specific data structures.
10

10

00:00:24.610  -->  00:00:25.640
So, we'll cover those
11

11

00:00:25.640  -->  00:00:28.190
after we've learned about those data structures
12

12

00:00:28.190  -->  00:00:31.460
but the sort algorithms we'll cover in this section
13

13

00:00:31.460  -->  00:00:33.240
can be used to sort arrays.
14

14

00:00:33.240  -->  00:00:35.000
So, now that we know about arrays,
15

15

00:00:35.000  -->  00:00:38.070
we can start learning about some of these popular,
16

16

00:00:38.070  -->  00:00:40.430
or at least well known, sort algorithms.
17

17

00:00:40.430  -->  00:00:42.750
There are a couple that you wouldn't actually want to use
18

18

00:00:42.750  -->  00:00:43.910
'cause they're very slow.
19

19

00:00:43.910  -->  00:00:45.310
Now, just a reminder,
20

20

00:00:45.310  -->  00:00:49.250
that an algorithm can have multiple implementations.
21

21

00:00:49.250  -->  00:00:53.270
I'm going to show you one implementation for each algorithm
22

22

00:00:53.270  -->  00:00:55.770
but that doesn't mean there aren't others.
23

23

00:00:55.770  -->  00:00:58.020
So, with that said, let's get started.
24

24

00:00:58.020  -->  00:00:59.540
We're gonna start with bubble sort.
25

25

00:00:59.540  -->  00:01:01.090
I'll see you in the next video.
