(Intro Music)
2

2

00:00:05.267  -->  00:00:06.642
<v Tim Buchalka>In this video, we're gonna go ahead</v>
3

3

00:00:06.642  -->  00:00:09.572
and download and instal IntelliJ Idea
4

4

00:00:09.572  -->  00:00:11.600
which is the editor/IDE that
5

5

00:00:11.600  -->  00:00:13.613
we're gonna be using in this course
6

6

00:00:13.613  -->  00:00:16.094
and we're gonna be doing it for a Linux platform,
7

7

00:00:16.094  -->  00:00:18.833
specifically Ubuntu Linux 16.04.
8

8

00:00:18.833  -->  00:00:21.943
Now if you're running Windows or a Mac,
9

9

00:00:21.943  -->  00:00:23.576
you'd wanna check out the other videos
10

10

00:00:23.576  -->  00:00:25.308
or the videos that we've set up
11

11

00:00:25.308  -->  00:00:28.468
for both operating systems in this section of the course
12

12

00:00:28.468  -->  00:00:29.457
and that's because the process
13

13

00:00:29.457  -->  00:00:31.392
of installation's slightly different.
14

14

00:00:31.392  -->  00:00:34.248
But if your on Linux this is the correct video.
15

15

00:00:34.248  -->  00:00:36.794
Now the first thing to do is open up Firefox
16

16

00:00:36.794  -->  00:00:38.757
or your browser of choice
17

17

00:00:38.757  -->  00:00:43.424
and we wanna go to the Jetbrains website- jetbrains.com.
18

18

00:00:47.642  -->  00:00:51.263
And once we get there we need to go to the page
19

19

00:00:51.263  -->  00:00:53.846
where we can download IntelliJ.
20

20

00:00:55.167  -->  00:00:56.357
Alright and usually you'll see that option
21

21

00:00:56.357  -->  00:00:57.955
here on the screen because it's
22

22

00:00:57.955  -->  00:00:59.809
one of their most popular products.
23

23

00:00:59.809  -->  00:01:03.131
Jetbrains is the company that have created this product.
24

24

00:01:03.131  -->  00:01:04.542
So you can either select it there or
25

25

00:01:04.542  -->  00:01:05.706
if you don't see that for some reason
26

26

00:01:05.706  -->  00:01:08.273
come up here onto IDEs and IntelliJ will usually
27

27

00:01:08.273  -->  00:01:11.495
be the first option or very close to the first option.
28

28

00:01:11.495  -->  00:01:13.078
So go to that page,
29

29

00:01:14.118  -->  00:01:16.035
then click on download.
30

30

00:01:19.812  -->  00:01:21.585
And what I'm going to do is start the download
31

31

00:01:21.585  -->  00:01:23.214
for the Community Edition
32

32

00:01:23.214  -->  00:01:25.105
and while that's downloading we'll come back to this page
33

33

00:01:25.105  -->  00:01:27.617
and just talk about the Ultimate and Community Editions
34

34

00:01:27.617  -->  00:01:31.359
and what differences there are between the two.
35

35

00:01:31.359  -->  00:01:33.533
Alright what I'm gonna do first is save that though
36

36

00:01:33.533  -->  00:01:35.557
and that will go into my downloads folder.
37

37

00:01:35.557  -->  00:01:37.782
Now I'll just go back here, as I mentioned,
38

38

00:01:37.782  -->  00:01:40.552
just so we can have a bit of a look at the two options.
39

39

00:01:40.552  -->  00:01:42.252
So we've got the Ultimate Edition,
40

40

00:01:42.252  -->  00:01:44.361
as well as the Community Edition.
41

41

00:01:44.361  -->  00:01:46.207
Now the Community Edition which I'm downloading
42

42

00:01:46.207  -->  00:01:48.225
is the free and open source version
43

43

00:01:48.225  -->  00:01:50.084
and you'll never have to pay with that option.
44

44

00:01:50.084  -->  00:01:52.636
So if you wanna go ahead and use that option,
45

45

00:01:52.636  -->  00:01:53.905
it's a good option and it will
46

46

00:01:53.905  -->  00:01:55.712
certainly work well in this course.
47

47

00:01:55.712  -->  00:01:58.400
The Ultimate Edition does come with a trial
48

48

00:01:58.400  -->  00:02:00.270
however if after that trial period,
49

49

00:02:00.270  -->  00:02:03.369
if you still wanna use it you'll need to pay for it.
50

50

00:02:03.369  -->  00:02:05.128
And the difference between the two is that
51

51

00:02:05.128  -->  00:02:07.676
the Ultimate Edition has extra features,
52

52

00:02:07.676  -->  00:02:09.521
it's really good for other things,
53

53

00:02:09.521  -->  00:02:10.779
other than standard languages.
54

54

00:02:10.779  -->  00:02:13.352
So it's good for Java Enterprise Edition
55

55

00:02:13.352  -->  00:02:14.649
and you can see here other frameworks
56

56

00:02:14.649  -->  00:02:16.977
and databases and so on and so forth.
57

57

00:02:16.977  -->  00:02:18.475
So what you can do, is if you decide
58

58

00:02:18.475  -->  00:02:20.302
to try out the Ultimate Edition,
59

59

00:02:20.302  -->  00:02:22.157
you can try that out for 30 days.
60

60

00:02:22.157  -->  00:02:23.186
The Jetbrains people will give you
61

61

00:02:23.186  -->  00:02:25.422
a 30 day trial to try that out
62

62

00:02:25.422  -->  00:02:26.419
and you can always come back and download
63

63

00:02:26.419  -->  00:02:28.160
the Community Edition later.
64

64

00:02:28.160  -->  00:02:29.398
Now the other thing to keep in mind
65

65

00:02:29.398  -->  00:02:33.216
is that I can increase that trial period by another 90 days,
66

66

00:02:33.216  -->  00:02:37.252
giving you a 120 days, by giving you a coupon
67

67

00:02:37.252  -->  00:02:39.886
that will enable that to extend that period of time.
68

68

00:02:39.886  -->  00:02:41.859
Now if you wanna take advantage of that and try out
69

69

00:02:41.859  -->  00:02:44.637
the Ultimate Edition for the full 120 days
70

70

00:02:44.637  -->  00:02:46.124
details of that are in a lecture
71

71

00:02:46.124  -->  00:02:47.441
in this section of the course
72

72

00:02:47.441  -->  00:02:48.816
but again either version will work
73

73

00:02:48.816  -->  00:02:51.909
and if you wanna try out the Ultimate Edition you can
74

74

00:02:51.909  -->  00:02:55.727
but in my case you saw me download the Community Edition.
75

75

00:02:55.727  -->  00:02:56.988
Alright, so let's go ahead now
76

76

00:02:56.988  -->  00:02:59.874
and instal the version that we've downloaded.
77

77

00:02:59.874  -->  00:03:03.086
And over here I can see now that my version's finished,
78

78

00:03:03.086  -->  00:03:05.140
so I'm gonna just open that and go into the folder
79

79

00:03:05.140  -->  00:03:07.273
where it was actually downloaded.
80

80

00:03:07.273  -->  00:03:10.956
Actually what I'll do is I'll just come down here
81

81

00:03:10.956  -->  00:03:13.316
and close this browser down
82

82

00:03:13.316  -->  00:03:15.162
and we can see that it's in the downloads folder
83

83

00:03:15.162  -->  00:03:17.806
and I'm just going to put this software
84

84

00:03:17.806  -->  00:03:19.256
in a folder on my computer.
85

85

00:03:19.256  -->  00:03:23.423
So I'm going to first open it with Archive Manager
86

86

00:03:25.349  -->  00:03:26.527
and then what I'm going to do is
87

87

00:03:26.527  -->  00:03:27.899
come back to my Home folder and I'm going
88

88

00:03:27.899  -->  00:03:30.028
to create a folder for my apps.
89

89

00:03:30.028  -->  00:03:31.994
So I'm gonna click on New Folder
90

90

00:03:31.994  -->  00:03:34.041
and I'm gonna call that dev
91

91

00:03:34.041  -->  00:03:36.884
and it's just gonna be the folder I'm gonna put IntelliJ.
92

92

00:03:36.884  -->  00:03:39.094
Now you are of course free to put this
93

93

00:03:39.094  -->  00:03:40.677
software wherever you like
94

94

00:03:40.677  -->  00:03:43.441
but that's the location where I'm gonna be running it from.
95

95

00:03:43.441  -->  00:03:45.307
Once you've done that, you've selected the folder
96

96

00:03:45.307  -->  00:03:47.417
where you want it to go, you can come back over here
97

97

00:03:47.417  -->  00:03:48.795
and then you can just literally just click on that
98

98

00:03:48.795  -->  00:03:51.298
and drag it over and that will move the files
99

99

00:03:51.298  -->  00:03:53.465
into that location for us.
100

100

00:03:54.873  -->  00:03:56.181
And once that's finished we can close down
101

101

00:03:56.181  -->  00:03:59.870
both of these windows and we now wanna go into terminal.
102

102

00:03:59.870  -->  00:04:01.341
So we're gonna click on terminal,
103

103

00:04:01.341  -->  00:04:03.082
so you go into terminal or command prompt,
104

104

00:04:03.082  -->  00:04:06.351
whatever it's called on your installation of Linux,
105

105

00:04:06.351  -->  00:04:08.756
then you wanna navigate now to that folder.
106

106

00:04:08.756  -->  00:04:11.654
So we're gonna go CD, in my case,
107

107

00:04:11.654  -->  00:04:13.879
have a look at the current folder.
108

108

00:04:13.879  -->  00:04:17.647
I'm in my Home folder and I'm gonna click on cd dev
109

109

00:04:17.647  -->  00:04:19.109
and if we have a look there by typing ls
110

110

00:04:19.109  -->  00:04:21.578
you can see that there's the installation of Idea.
111

111

00:04:21.578  -->  00:04:25.908
So I'm just gonna type in cd space and then the folder name
112

112

00:04:25.908  -->  00:04:30.116
and then I can go into the bin folder, the cd space bin,
113

113

00:04:30.116  -->  00:04:31.484
and have a look at that again and you can see that
114

114

00:04:31.484  -->  00:04:33.260
there's various folders there.
115

115

00:04:33.260  -->  00:04:36.564
The one we want to start is idea.sh.
116

116

00:04:36.564  -->  00:04:41.064
So I'm gonna type dot forward slash idea, to start it.
117

117

00:04:45.032  -->  00:04:48.374
And the first time you load, or you actually start,
118

118

00:04:48.374  -->  00:04:53.084
IntelliJ Idea it gives you a prompt to import settings.
119

119

00:04:53.084  -->  00:04:54.961
So if you've got an existing version of IntelliJ,
120

120

00:04:54.961  -->  00:04:57.320
you can import the settings and particularly
121

121

00:04:57.320  -->  00:04:59.407
if you've customised it and changed,
122

122

00:04:59.407  -->  00:05:02.189
maybe perhaps played around with fonts and other things,
123

123

00:05:02.189  -->  00:05:03.095
can be a good way to stop you
124

124

00:05:03.095  -->  00:05:05.984
having to re-set everything up again from scratch.
125

125

00:05:05.984  -->  00:05:08.484
In my case though I haven't got any settings to import
126

126

00:05:08.484  -->  00:05:10.137
so I'm gonna select this option
127

127

00:05:10.137  -->  00:05:12.189
and that's probably the option you'll choose in most cases
128

128

00:05:12.189  -->  00:05:14.343
because you probably haven't had IntelliJ
129

129

00:05:14.343  -->  00:05:15.992
installed on your computer before.
130

130

00:05:15.992  -->  00:05:20.682
So click on OK and we need to accept the privacy policy,
131

131

00:05:20.682  -->  00:05:23.176
by clicking on Accept.
132

132

00:05:23.176  -->  00:05:24.762
Now you've got some options as to how
133

133

00:05:24.762  -->  00:05:28.044
you want the theme, or what the theme is for IntelliJ and
134

134

00:05:28.044  -->  00:05:31.361
you can see if I select it, we can see different options.
135

135

00:05:31.361  -->  00:05:32.752
I'm gonna choose IntelliJ,
136

136

00:05:32.752  -->  00:05:34.998
the standard option with the white background,
137

137

00:05:34.998  -->  00:05:36.925
but you'll choose whichever one you feel is appropriate,
138

138

00:05:36.925  -->  00:05:39.468 line:15% 
and keep in mind you can always come down here
139

139

00:05:39.468  -->  00:05:43.102 line:15% 
to go back to Settings within IntelliJ:
140

140

00:05:43.102  -->  00:05:44.422 line:15% 
Appearance and Behaviour, Appearance
141

141

00:05:44.422  -->  00:05:47.959
and change set ups at a later time if you feel you need to.
142

142

00:05:47.959  -->  00:05:50.252
Once you've done that click on Next.
143

143

00:05:50.252  -->  00:05:53.238
Now we wanted to automatically create a desktop entry for us
144

144

00:05:53.238  -->  00:05:54.478
so that we don't have to go to
145

145

00:05:54.478  -->  00:05:56.634
terminal or to a command prompt
146

146

00:05:56.634  -->  00:05:59.450
to start IntelliJ each time.
147

147

00:05:59.450  -->  00:06:02.060
So I'm going to leave that ticked and get it to do that
148

148

00:06:02.060  -->  00:06:05.081 line:15% 
and again in settings later on, you can come back to tools,
149

149

00:06:05.081  -->  00:06:07.158 line:15% 
create desktop entry, if you wanna do that in the future
150

150

00:06:07.158  -->  00:06:09.500
and you don't wanna do it now, for some reason.
151

151

00:06:09.500  -->  00:06:11.239
So I'm gonna leave that option selected.
152

152

00:06:11.239  -->  00:06:12.672
I'm not gonna create it for all users.
153

153

00:06:12.672  -->  00:06:13.960
If you wanted to for some reason
154

154

00:06:13.960  -->  00:06:18.066
you can click on that checkbox, click on next.
155

155

00:06:18.066  -->  00:06:20.890
Now you can use IntelliJ from the command line if you want.
156

156

00:06:20.890  -->  00:06:23.761
You can invoke it and that's an option if you want to.
157

157

00:06:23.761  -->  00:06:24.995
I'm gonna click on that even though
158

158

00:06:24.995  -->  00:06:26.447
we probably won't be doing that in the course;
159

159

00:06:26.447  -->  00:06:29.240
It's actually there for you just to do if you want.
160

160

00:06:29.240  -->  00:06:31.114
Click on next.
161

161

00:06:31.114  -->  00:06:33.812
Now we've got a number of plugins that you can configure
162

162

00:06:33.812  -->  00:06:36.019
and some of these are actually configured already.
163

163

00:06:36.019  -->  00:06:38.853
So you can enable them or disable them or customise them.
164

164

00:06:38.853  -->  00:06:41.338
I'd suggest generally you leave everything as is
165

165

00:06:41.338  -->  00:06:43.390
because you can always go back in again later
166

166

00:06:43.390  -->  00:06:45.731
and configure or add plugins at any time.
167

167

00:06:45.731  -->  00:06:48.021
So I'm gonna leave everything as is there.
168

168

00:06:48.021  -->  00:06:49.459
Just one other thing to keep in mind is
169

169

00:06:49.459  -->  00:06:51.837
if you're running the Ultimate Edition,
170

170

00:06:51.837  -->  00:06:54.087
and not the Community Edition that I'm installing,
171

171

00:06:54.087  -->  00:06:56.299
you probably will have extra options there
172

172

00:06:56.299  -->  00:06:57.601
because of the extra functionality
173

173

00:06:57.601  -->  00:07:00.826
that the Ultimate Edition of IntelliJ gives you.
174

174

00:07:00.826  -->  00:07:02.297
But in my case I'm not gonna do anything,
175

175

00:07:02.297  -->  00:07:04.277
I'm just gonna click on next
176

176

00:07:04.277  -->  00:07:05.290
and we've got some other options
177

177

00:07:05.290  -->  00:07:07.422
to download some featured plugins.
178

178

00:07:07.422  -->  00:07:08.967
We're not gonna be using those plugins
179

179

00:07:08.967  -->  00:07:11.280
in this course either, so I'm just gonna click on
180

180

00:07:11.280  -->  00:07:13.447
start using IntelliJ Idea.
181

181

00:07:14.808  -->  00:07:17.475
I need to enter my password now.
182

182

00:07:18.757  -->  00:07:21.077
Now that's to setup the launcher, installer.
183

183

00:07:21.077  -->  00:07:23.604
Click on authenticate and IntelliJ should now start;
184

184

00:07:23.604  -->  00:07:26.626
As you can see it's starting.
185

185

00:07:26.626  -->  00:07:29.077
Okay so now we've installed IntelliJ,
186

186

00:07:29.077  -->  00:07:31.674
there's a few settings we need to configure.
187

187

00:07:31.674  -->  00:07:32.807
So to do that we're gonna come over here
188

188

00:07:32.807  -->  00:07:34.934
and click on configure.
189

189

00:07:34.934  -->  00:07:37.604 line:15% 
Come down here to project defaults
190

190

00:07:37.604  -->  00:07:40.021 line:15% 
and select project structure.
191

191

00:07:41.114  -->  00:07:44.384
Now what we need to is configure a project SDK.
192

192

00:07:44.384  -->  00:07:45.361
Now if you click on that at the moment
193

193

00:07:45.361  -->  00:07:48.603
you can see clearly there's no SDK to find.
194

194

00:07:48.603  -->  00:07:50.036
So what we need to do now is associate
195

195

00:07:50.036  -->  00:07:53.756
the Java Development Kit, that we installed
196

196

00:07:53.756  -->  00:07:56.434
in a previous video, with IntelliJ.
197

197

00:07:56.434  -->  00:07:58.818
So to do that we're gonna click on new,
198

198

00:07:58.818  -->  00:08:01.651
and come over here and select JDK.
199

199

00:08:02.737  -->  00:08:07.500
Now what should happen is that IntelliJ will find
200

200

00:08:07.500  -->  00:08:09.475
the Java Development Kit for us automatically
201

201

00:08:09.475  -->  00:08:11.390
and you can see, in this particular case, it did.
202

202

00:08:11.390  -->  00:08:12.802
If for some reason it doesn't find
203

203

00:08:12.802  -->  00:08:15.246
that for you automatically you may need to go ahead
204

204

00:08:15.246  -->  00:08:17.374
and manually choose the location
205

205

00:08:17.374  -->  00:08:19.001
and choose the home directory
206

206

00:08:19.001  -->  00:08:20.246
but in my case, again, you can see
207

207

00:08:20.246  -->  00:08:21.920
that that's found that okay.
208

208

00:08:21.920  -->  00:08:23.286
So I don't need to do anything else now,
209

209

00:08:23.286  -->  00:08:25.844
other than clicking on OK.
210

210

00:08:25.844  -->  00:08:28.441
And you can see once I've done that this has now changed
211

211

00:08:28.441  -->  00:08:31.507
and we've got the Java version showing now.
212

212

00:08:31.507  -->  00:08:33.312
And if by some reason it still wasn't selected
213

213

00:08:33.312  -->  00:08:36.126
make sure that you have got that selected up there.
214

214

00:08:36.126  -->  00:08:37.151
The other thing here that we wanna
215

215

00:08:37.151  -->  00:08:39.549
have selected is the SDK default.
216

216

00:08:39.549  -->  00:08:40.996
That is selected to the latest
217

217

00:08:40.996  -->  00:08:44.550
or it is choosing the latest version, which is correct,
218

218

00:08:44.550  -->  00:08:46.932
so we don't need to make any changes to that.
219

219

00:08:46.932  -->  00:08:48.416
And incidentally, I did mention earlier,
220

220

00:08:48.416  -->  00:08:49.999
but if by chance you got to the screen
221

221

00:08:49.999  -->  00:08:52.241
and you couldn't see the option that I could see,
222

222

00:08:52.241  -->  00:08:53.805
Project is the option
223

223

00:08:53.805  -->  00:08:56.250
that you'd select to see those on the screen.
224

224

00:08:56.250  -->  00:08:59.043
Alright, so I'm gonna click on OK now.
225

225

00:08:59.043  -->  00:09:00.679
And there's a few other little minor options
226

226

00:09:00.679  -->  00:09:03.285
we now need to configure, so lets go ahead and do those.
227

227

00:09:03.285  -->  00:09:06.702 line:15% 
Click on Configure and click on Settings.
228

228

00:09:07.875  -->  00:09:09.654
Now what we wanna do is open up here,
229

229

00:09:09.654  -->  00:09:12.749
down under Editor, expand that list of options
230

230

00:09:12.749  -->  00:09:16.167
and under General do the same thing, click on that.
231

231

00:09:16.167  -->  00:09:18.256
Firstly, we wanna click on Auto Import
232

232

00:09:18.256  -->  00:09:20.061
and we're gonna click on, or add the checkbox,
233

233

00:09:20.061  -->  00:09:23.544
or click the checkbox for Add unambigous imports on the fly
234

234

00:09:23.544  -->  00:09:25.480
and then the checkbox we should click for
235

235

00:09:25.480  -->  00:09:27.678
Optimise imports on the fly.
236

236

00:09:27.678  -->  00:09:29.758
So click on apply to that and then
237

237

00:09:29.758  -->  00:09:32.560
just come down here to Appearance
238

238

00:09:32.560  -->  00:09:35.135
and we wanna make sure that Show line numbers is checked.
239

239

00:09:35.135  -->  00:09:37.104
And you can see that by default it is checked
240

240

00:09:37.104  -->  00:09:38.596
but if for some reason it's not,
241

241

00:09:38.596  -->  00:09:40.055
make sure you do check it there,
242

242

00:09:40.055  -->  00:09:41.734
but you can see in my case it is,
243

243

00:09:41.734  -->  00:09:43.347
and we're gonna click on OK.
244

244

00:09:43.347  -->  00:09:44.692
Now at that point, we've now finished
245

245

00:09:44.692  -->  00:09:47.894
the configuration for IntelliJ Idea.
246

246

00:09:47.894  -->  00:09:50.944
What I am gonna do now is close this down.
247

247

00:09:50.944  -->  00:09:54.509
And I'm gonna close down the command line, the terminal.
248

248

00:09:54.509  -->  00:09:56.746
And we should be able to now come over here
249

249

00:09:56.746  -->  00:10:00.318
and if we have a look for IntelliJ,
250

250

00:10:00.318  -->  00:10:02.798
you can see that IntelliJ is now appearing there
251

251

00:10:02.798  -->  00:10:06.089
as a desktop shortcut, so I can click on that
252

252

00:10:06.089  -->  00:10:07.875
and that's how I can go ahead and instal,
253

253

00:10:07.875  -->  00:10:11.458
or run rather, IntelliJ Idea in the future.
254

254

00:10:13.135  -->  00:10:15.195
And you can see that it's started fine.
255

255

00:10:15.195  -->  00:10:16.028
Alright so that's it,
256

256

00:10:16.028  -->  00:10:19.297
that's the installation and configuration of IntelliJ Idea,
257

257

00:10:19.297  -->  00:10:22.297
let's now move on to the next video.
