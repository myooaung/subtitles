<v Sarah>Alright, we've reached the end of the course.</v>

00:00:07.780  -->  00:00:10.520
Congratulations if you watched every video.
6

6

00:00:10.520  -->  00:00:12.490
We covered quite a lot in this course,
7

7

00:00:12.490  -->  00:00:15.050
we covered many popular sort algorithms,
8

8

00:00:15.050  -->  00:00:18.590
we covered linear search and binary search,
9

9

00:00:18.590  -->  00:00:21.690
and we covered a bunch of data structures,
10

10

00:00:21.690  -->  00:00:26.010
arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables,
11

11

00:00:26.010  -->  00:00:29.300
trees, heaps, a very brief look at sets.
12

12

00:00:29.300  -->  00:00:31.990
Now of course we didn't cover every data structure,
13

13

00:00:31.990  -->  00:00:34.650
we didn't cover some of the more advanced trees,
14

14

00:00:34.650  -->  00:00:35.900
we didn't cover graphs,
15

15

00:00:35.900  -->  00:00:38.320
graphs could be a course in themselves,
16

16

00:00:38.320  -->  00:00:41.820
but we covered all the basic data structures,
17

17

00:00:41.820  -->  00:00:46.240
and a lot of applications will never need a tree or a graph.
18

18

00:00:46.240  -->  00:00:50.350
They'll use arrays or hash tables or sets
19

19

00:00:50.350  -->  00:00:54.440
or stacks and queues, and maybe a linked list or two.
20

20

00:00:54.440  -->  00:00:56.010
So I hope you enjoyed the course,
21

21

00:00:56.010  -->  00:00:57.760
I hope you have a better understanding
22

22

00:00:57.760  -->  00:01:00.100
of the data structures we covered
23

23

00:01:00.100  -->  00:01:02.000
and their strengths and weaknesses,
24

24

00:01:02.000  -->  00:01:06.960
and I hope that you enjoyed learning the sort algorithms
25

25

00:01:06.960  -->  00:01:10.010
that we implemented, and now when you need
26

26

00:01:10.010  -->  00:01:11.570
to sort some data you'll have
27

27

00:01:11.570  -->  00:01:14.320
a selection of sort algorithms to choose from.
28

28

00:01:14.320  -->  00:01:16.490
So thanks very much for taking the course,
29

29

00:01:16.490  -->  00:01:19.380
good luck with all of your development projects,
30

30

00:01:19.380  -->  00:01:23.000
and go forth and write some good code.
31

31

00:01:23.000  -->  00:01:24.223
I'll see you out there.
