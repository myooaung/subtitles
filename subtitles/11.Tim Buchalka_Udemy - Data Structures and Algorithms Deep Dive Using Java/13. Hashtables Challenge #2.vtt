00:00:05.540  -->  00:00:07.760
<v ->Alright, in this challenge I want you to remove</v>
2

2

00:00:07.760  -->  00:00:09.830
duplicate items from a linked list,
3

3

00:00:09.830  -->  00:00:12.780
and I want your solution to do two things,
4

4

00:00:12.780  -->  00:00:15.920
I want it to use the JDK's LinkedList class
5

5

00:00:15.920  -->  00:00:19.440
and in fact starter project in the resources section
6

6

00:00:19.440  -->  00:00:21.820
has the code for creating the linked list
7

7

00:00:21.820  -->  00:00:24.622
and populating it with some employee instances,
8

8

00:00:24.622  -->  00:00:28.020
and I want your solution to use a HashMap.
9

9

00:00:28.020  -->  00:00:30.940
Now in your solution you shouldn't have to maintain
10

10

00:00:30.940  -->  00:00:35.340
any extra fields pointing at items in the linked list.
11

11

00:00:35.340  -->  00:00:38.010
Okay so you shouldn't have to have any fields
12

12

00:00:38.010  -->  00:00:39.720
and you're trying to track where things
13

13

00:00:39.720  -->  00:00:42.730
are in the linked list as you're removing duplicates.
14

14

00:00:42.730  -->  00:00:45.200
Instead, your solution should use a HashMap
15

15

00:00:45.200  -->  00:00:47.090
and I'll leave it to you to figure out how
16

16

00:00:47.090  -->  00:00:48.870
you should use that HashMap.
17

17

00:00:48.870  -->  00:00:50.959
And so, start with the starter project,
18

18

00:00:50.959  -->  00:00:53.479
you'll notice that the code from the last challenge
19

19

00:00:53.479  -->  00:00:55.745
is still there, I've just commented it out,
20

20

00:00:55.745  -->  00:01:00.745
and one important thing here is that you can assume
21

21

00:01:00.870  -->  00:01:05.700
that if an employee has the same key as another employee
22

22

00:01:05.700  -->  00:01:09.870
then they're duplicates, and so you don't need to check
23

23

00:01:09.870  -->  00:01:10.930
the entire instance.
24

24

00:01:10.930  -->  00:01:13.656
You don't have to say "Are the IDs equal,
25

25

00:01:13.656  -->  00:01:17.290
"are the first names equal, and are the last names equal?"
26

26

00:01:17.290  -->  00:01:18.600
You don't have to do that.
27

27

00:01:18.600  -->  00:01:21.640
For this challenge we're gonna say if two employees
28

28

00:01:21.640  -->  00:01:25.180
have the same ID then they're the same employee
29

29

00:01:25.180  -->  00:01:29.010
because whatever company we work for the IDs are unique.
30

30

00:01:29.010  -->  00:01:32.394
You can't assign the same ID to two different employees.
31

31

00:01:32.394  -->  00:01:34.420
Alright, so with that in mind,
32

32

00:01:34.420  -->  00:01:36.870
good luck and I'll see you in the solution video.
