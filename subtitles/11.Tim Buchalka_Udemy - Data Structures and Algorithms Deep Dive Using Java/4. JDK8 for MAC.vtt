00:00:00.111  -->  00:00:02.656
(bright music)
2

2

00:00:02.656  -->  00:00:05.440
(keyboard clacking)
3

3

00:00:05.440  -->  00:00:07.310
<v Tim>In this video, we're gonna go ahead and download</v>
4

4

00:00:07.310  -->  00:00:10.590
the Java Development Kit, also known as the JDK.
5

5

00:00:10.590  -->  00:00:12.190
We're gonna do that on a Mac computer.
6

6

00:00:12.190  -->  00:00:15.180
Now, if you're running Windows or a Linux machine,
7

7

00:00:15.180  -->  00:00:17.060
you want to check out the separate video
8

8

00:00:17.060  -->  00:00:19.800
that I've created for each of those operating systems,
9

9

00:00:19.800  -->  00:00:20.900
and that's because the process
10

10

00:00:20.900  -->  00:00:23.090
is slightly different for each operating system.
11

11

00:00:23.090  -->  00:00:24.320
So this is the Mac video,
12

12

00:00:24.320  -->  00:00:25.500
so if you're on a,
13

13

00:00:25.500  -->  00:00:27.950
if you're actually on a Mac, you're in the right place.
14

14

00:00:27.950  -->  00:00:30.020
So we're going to start off there by opening a browser
15

15

00:00:30.020  -->  00:00:33.573
and we're going to go to java.oracle.com,
16

16

00:00:34.760  -->  00:00:36.330
and Oracle is the name of the company
17

17

00:00:36.330  -->  00:00:38.220
that own the Java product.
18

18

00:00:38.220  -->  00:00:39.990
Once you get to that page, you can come down here
19

19

00:00:39.990  -->  00:00:42.840
to Technologies, click on Java SE,
20

20

00:00:42.840  -->  00:00:45.490
which stands for Standard Edition.
21

21

00:00:45.490  -->  00:00:47.723
When that pages loads, click on Downloads.
22

22

00:00:49.890  -->  00:00:51.510
That'll bring you to this page.
23

23

00:00:51.510  -->  00:00:53.970
We're going to click on this little image here
24

24

00:00:53.970  -->  00:00:55.383
to download the JDK.
25

25

00:00:56.220  -->  00:00:59.100
Now you'll get a page that opens up and it will say
26

26

00:00:59.100  -->  00:01:01.700
Java SE Development Kit, as you can see here,
27

27

00:01:01.700  -->  00:01:04.600
and you'll choose the version that's showing.
28

28

00:01:04.600  -->  00:01:08.003
So, at the moment, it says Java SE Development Kit 8u144.
29

29

00:01:09.500  -->  00:01:11.750
144 is the release number.
30

30

00:01:11.750  -->  00:01:14.910
Now, Oracle actually update this on a regular basis,
31

31

00:01:14.910  -->  00:01:16.640
so this number will change over time.
32

32

00:01:16.640  -->  00:01:18.340
It will certainty change from the date
33

33

00:01:18.340  -->  00:01:19.890
that I've recorded this video,
34

34

00:01:19.890  -->  00:01:21.190
so long as you're on this page though,
35

35

00:01:21.190  -->  00:01:22.600
you can just grab whatever version
36

36

00:01:22.600  -->  00:01:24.010
that is currently available.
37

37

00:01:24.010  -->  00:01:26.740
Now the other thing that we need to do is to look over here,
38

38

00:01:26.740  -->  00:01:29.030
to the right over where it says Mac OS X,
39

39

00:01:29.030  -->  00:01:31.440
and click on this link here.
40

40

00:01:31.440  -->  00:01:32.530
And unless you come up,
41

41

00:01:32.530  -->  00:01:33.540
if you haven't clicked on already,
42

42

00:01:33.540  -->  00:01:35.110
just accept Licence Agreement.
43

43

00:01:35.110  -->  00:01:36.560
It'll remind you you need to do that,
44

44

00:01:36.560  -->  00:01:40.340
so click that radio button there and come over here again.
45

45

00:01:40.340  -->  00:01:43.030
Click it and this time it should download.
46

46

00:01:43.030  -->  00:01:45.780
Now I'm not going to actually download this on my computer,
47

47

00:01:45.780  -->  00:01:47.590
and you can see that I've already done this in the past,
48

48

00:01:47.590  -->  00:01:49.680
but just for the purposes of doing it again,
49

49

00:01:49.680  -->  00:01:53.200
I'm going to do the same thing and just save it again.
50

50

00:01:53.200  -->  00:01:54.210
And you can see it downloading
51

51

00:01:54.210  -->  00:01:56.390
in the left-hand bottom corner.
52

52

00:01:56.390  -->  00:01:59.634
So I'm gonna pause the video 'til that's finished.
53

53

00:01:59.634  -->  00:02:00.470
Can see it's finished there,
54

54

00:02:00.470  -->  00:02:03.850
I just need to click on here and click on Open,
55

55

00:02:03.850  -->  00:02:05.480
or depending on the browser you're using,
56

56

00:02:05.480  -->  00:02:06.920
you might need to navigate
57

57

00:02:06.920  -->  00:02:09.560
to the folder where you downloaded the product.
58

58

00:02:09.560  -->  00:02:11.860
You'll get this little pop-up,
59

59

00:02:11.860  -->  00:02:15.120
you double-click this now to start the installation.
60

60

00:02:15.120  -->  00:02:18.720
And you click on Continue, click on Instal.
61

61

00:02:18.720  -->  00:02:20.330
It'll come up and ask you for your password,
62

62

00:02:20.330  -->  00:02:21.583
so enter your details.
63

63

00:02:23.970  -->  00:02:26.720
It'll go ahead and actually do the installation for us.
64

64

00:02:28.880  -->  00:02:30.410
Click on Close,
65

65

00:02:30.410  -->  00:02:32.500
and forget that option and click on Move to Trash,
66

66

00:02:32.500  -->  00:02:33.640
'cause we've actually finished with that now.
67

67

00:02:33.640  -->  00:02:35.810
We're gonna close that down.
68

68

00:02:35.810  -->  00:02:37.990
And I can close the browser down and so that's it.
69

69

00:02:37.990  -->  00:02:40.570
We've now installed the Java Development Kit on a Mac.
70

70

00:02:40.570  -->  00:02:42.120
I'll see you in the next video.
