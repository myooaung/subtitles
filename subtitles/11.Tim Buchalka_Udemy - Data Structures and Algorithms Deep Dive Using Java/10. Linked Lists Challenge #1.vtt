00:00:05.520  -->  00:00:08.760
<v Narrator>Okay, the first challenge in this section</v>
2

2

00:00:08.760  -->  00:00:12.180
is to implement the addBefore method
3

3

00:00:12.180  -->  00:00:15.210
for the EmployeeDoublyLinkedList class.
4

4

00:00:15.210  -->  00:00:17.500
This method will take two employees.
5

5

00:00:17.500  -->  00:00:19.940
The first employee will be the employee
6

6

00:00:19.940  -->  00:00:21.630
you want to add to the list
7

7

00:00:21.630  -->  00:00:23.540
and the second employee will be
8

8

00:00:23.540  -->  00:00:25.850
an existing employee in the list
9

9

00:00:25.850  -->  00:00:28.240
and what the addBefore method will do is
10

10

00:00:28.240  -->  00:00:31.120
it will insert the new employee into the list
11

11

00:00:31.120  -->  00:00:33.850
right before the existing employee.
12

12

00:00:33.850  -->  00:00:37.260
So if you call addBefore and you pass
13

13

00:00:37.260  -->  00:00:40.050
James Bond as the new employee,
14

14

00:00:40.050  -->  00:00:43.720
and John Doe as the existing employee
15

15

00:00:43.720  -->  00:00:47.490
then what this method should do is insert James Bond
16

16

00:00:47.490  -->  00:00:50.850
right before John Doe, in the list.
17

17

00:00:50.850  -->  00:00:53.620
Now there's a starter project in the Resources section
18

18

00:00:53.620  -->  00:00:54.840
that you can use.
19

19

00:00:54.840  -->  00:00:57.660
It has all the code you need.
20

20

00:00:57.660  -->  00:01:00.670
So it has the code for the LinkedList,
21

21

00:01:00.670  -->  00:01:03.380
it's the same LinkedList that we implemented
22

22

00:01:03.380  -->  00:01:05.840
when we implemented the DoublyLinkedList
23

23

00:01:05.840  -->  00:01:09.030
and it also has an empty addBefore method
24

24

00:01:09.030  -->  00:01:12.150
inside the EmployeeDoublyLinkedList class.
25

25

00:01:12.150  -->  00:01:14.430
And if you look at the main method
26

26

00:01:14.430  -->  00:01:17.970
in the main.Java file, you'll see that there's code there
27

27

00:01:17.970  -->  00:01:21.650
and that code should work when you're finished.
28

28

00:01:21.650  -->  00:01:24.910
So once you've implemented the addBefore method,
29

29

00:01:24.910  -->  00:01:27.610
run the main method and you should see
30

30

00:01:27.610  -->  00:01:29.600
the new employee added before
31

31

00:01:29.600  -->  00:01:31.760
the employee that you specified.
32

32

00:01:31.760  -->  00:01:33.460
So good luck with this challenge
33

33

00:01:33.460  -->  00:01:35.543
and I'll see you in the solution video.
