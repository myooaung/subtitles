Before we get started talking about LinkedIn specifically,

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.940
I wanted to talk a little bit about where LinkedIn fits into

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.075
the overall plethora of professional services websites out there.

4
00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:14.430
Of course, one website that we've already discussed in depth on this Skillshare channel,

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.035
is upwork.com, the world's largest freelance marketplace.

6
00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:23.880
Up until recently, upwork.com was my go-to website for finding freelance clients.

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.035
But once I started to learn which companies would benefit most from my services,

8
00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:31.620
I decided to reach out to them directly via LinkedIn.

9
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.400
Whilst upwork.com and linkedIn.com can both be used to find freelance work,

10
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.330
the nature of each platform is quite different.

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.975
As mentioned, upwork.com is a freelance marketplace,

12
00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:47.045
and linkedIn.com is a professional networking site.

13
00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.970
The Upwork marketplace is centered around jobs with

14
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.650
two different types of accounts: clients, and freelancer.

15
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.640
On Upwork, only the freelancers have a profile,

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.390
and there's a set process to beginning any engagement,

17
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.140
with Upwork taking a cut of each job as their business model.

18
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.760
LinkedIn on the other hand,

19
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.895
is more like a social media platform.

20
00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:11.750
Everyone on LinkedIn has a profile and the ability to create content.

21
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.050
That content is then delivered through the LinkedIn news feed,

22
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.075
just like you'd see on Facebook,

23
00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:19.705
or other social media platforms.

24
00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:24.875
Why would we use LinkedIn over upwork.com for finding freelance work?

25
00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:27.440
I see there being two main benefits to using

26
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.655
LinkedIn over freelance marketplace websites.

27
00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:33.285
Number 1, you can reach out to clients directly.

28
00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:36.305
You don't have to wait for a position to be advertised, instead,

29
00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:39.230
once you have a clear understanding of who you want to reach out to,

30
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.630
you can contact them directly rather than wait for a gig to become available.

31
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.000
Two, you can reach a much larger audience with your profile.

32
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.325
You can create contents to draw on your views,

33
00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:53.405
increase your network, and create more chances for referral business.

34
00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:56.060
The way I see it, having a presence on LinkedIn,

35
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.520
should be a long-term goal for anyone trying to build

36
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.420
their reputation in most professional services industries.
