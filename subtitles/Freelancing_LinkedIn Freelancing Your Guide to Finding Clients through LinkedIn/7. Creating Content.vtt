00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.090
Back in 2014, LinkedIn announced the launch of its publishing platform, LinkedIn Pulse.

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.355
Previously it was only LinkedIn influences who are allowed to write articles on LinkedIn,

3
00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:16.170
but Pulse open the door for all LinkedIn users to create content on the platform.

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.870
In 2017, Pulse stop being a separate feature and merged into the homepage of LinkedIn.

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.865
Now when you login to LinkedIn,

6
00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:26.625
you'll see the News Feed on your homepage

7
00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:30.165
just as you would on other social media platforms like Facebook.

8
00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:32.025
Also similar to Facebook,

9
00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:36.750
you might be notified of new content through your notifications tab and

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.820
any articles you post could be shown on

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.530
your profile depending on whether the user is logged in or not.

12
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.230
This presents an opportunity for us to mock at

13
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.160
our profile and extend our network through creating content.

14
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.245
When you create a post on LinkedIn,

15
00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:54.380
other members will see the post on their LinkedIn News Feeds,

16
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.520
which may cause them to engage with the post forever increasing its reach.

17
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.570
Or they might click directly on your profile to learn more about you.

18
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.865
Depending on how appealing your content is,

19
00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:08.210
it could go viral and attract lots of use to your profile.

20
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.250
But even if it's not a huge hit,

21
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.560
you're still setting yourself apart from the majority of

22
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.515
LinkedIn users who aren't creating anything.

23
00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:18.994
In my mind, whether you're creating content on LinkedIn directly,

24
00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:22.975
doing it on your own website or publishing on other platforms,

25
00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:25.205
creating content is one of the best,

26
00:01:25.205 --> 00:01:28.550
if not the best inbound marketing strategy that you can employ for

27
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.585
yourself as a freelancer or professional services business.

28
00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:35.135
I like to quote popular programmer and blogger,

29
00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:38.605
John Sonmez here, who on this topic has said,.

30
00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:41.640
But if you can commit to writing one blog cause of the week ,

31
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.800
even if it's crap, trust me,

32
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.180
if you do this after here,

33
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.360
you won't be a crap writer anymore.

34
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.545
You might start out as one,

35
00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:50.090
but you'll get better.

36
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.455
But if you can commit to that,

37
00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:52.730
you're going to be in the top,

38
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.520
definitely the top 0.1 percent of

39
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.790
the rest of the freelancers out there as far as building a brand and market

40
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.880
yourself like you're going to have be doing that

41
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.970
much more than the majority of people ever do.

42
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.380
Now, that we've established what LinkedIn content can do to promote your profile,

43
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.160
let's look at the ways you can actually go about creating content on LinkedIn.

44
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.670
So content is a little bit weird on LinkedIn.

45
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.670
It shows up in a few different places.

46
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.910
For instance, if we go to profiles we've seen before,

47
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.130
we can't see all the content that we've

48
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.860
shared and posted on LinkedIn, which is interesting.

49
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.565
If we open up an Incognito window and I go to the same profile.

50
00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:37.460
You can see when we scroll down,

51
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.105
articles that I have posted directly on LinkedIn show up here.

52
00:02:41.105 --> 00:02:44.090
So not when I'm logged in,

53
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.770
but when somebody is looking at my profile when they're not signed in,

54
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.190
they'll see the articles that I've posted up here.

55
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.820
I've also created some native video content for LinkedIn,

56
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.365
which I'll show you in just a second.

57
00:02:57.365 --> 00:03:03.035
Which strangely enough does not show up on either this version of my profile,

58
00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:06.365
or if we click back to the logged in version,

59
00:03:06.365 --> 00:03:08.240
this version of my profile.

60
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.690
So it's not exactly like Facebook in the sense that anything you

61
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.470
post would go on your own page as well.

62
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.780
But what we can do is click over here,

63
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.690
go to posts and activity under Manage,

64
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.530
and you can see all of my posts here.

65
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.475
So I've created a video which I'll talk about in just a second.

66
00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:33.575
But it also is showing me the posts on LinkedIn that I've engaged with as well.

67
00:03:33.575 --> 00:03:36.530
It's showing this video multiple times for the times

68
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.770
that I have replied to people's comments on the video.

69
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.810
So it's not a very efficient system,

70
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.490
but this is where you can see the activity on your posts and also

71
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.545
see your activity liking other people's posts like I have done here.

72
00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:53.825
Okay, if I scroll down,

73
00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:59.705
I'll show you some content that I've created previously on my own professional blog.

74
00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:01.400
As you can see down here,

75
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.445
I decided to create content on my own blog and then share it

76
00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:07.880
on LinkedIn rather than publish on LinkedIn itself.

77
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.020
Still testing that out whether it's better to create it on LinkedIn.

78
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.250
As you saw before, I did used to create articles directly on LinkedIn.

79
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.345
But the problem with that is they're only on

80
00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:21.155
LinkedIn and you would have to share the article

81
00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:26.390
from LinkedIn to anyone who may want to view it in a different context.

82
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.775
If you have the article on your own website,

83
00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:31.235
then you own that content.

84
00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:33.785
Not to say that you don't earn your work,

85
00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:35.165
that you post on LinkedIn.

86
00:04:35.165 --> 00:04:37.310
But if we click on this link,

87
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.145
you can see it goes to my actual website,

88
00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:46.090
and you can read the article and then click on other areas that are off LinkedIn.

89
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.460
So is pros and cons to publishing content off of LinkedIn itself and linking to it.

90
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.590
Then there's of course, pros and cons to creating content directly on LinkedIn.

91
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.225
For these articles that I've created,

92
00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:03.950
I've decided to put them all on a central website so that when I send people my website,

93
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.300
they can read them.

94
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.500
But as I said,

95
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.975
I recently created a native video just for LinkedIn.

96
00:05:10.975 --> 00:05:13.505
If we scroll back up to the top,

97
00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:16.220
you can see I created this video,

98
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.130
discussing what it is I actually do.

99
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.370
As it says here, some of my clients I've found

100
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.720
can be a bit confused by the term Shopify theme development.

101
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.510
I break it down a little and take a look at how it works.

102
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.030
Not that people didn't know what I provided,

103
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.500
but there's different areas of

104
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.675
Shopify development and different parts of the Shopify ecosystem.

105
00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:42.995
I thought it was a good bit of content to create to explain how themes

106
00:05:42.995 --> 00:05:47.570
fit into the overall structure and experience of your Shopify store.

107
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.255
That has received pretty good engagement.

108
00:05:50.255 --> 00:05:53.690
As you can see, I've gotten some views, some comments,

109
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.085
and one of the tips my friend and colleague Ian and gave me

110
00:05:58.085 --> 00:06:03.335
was to tag people that I thought would find it relevant in a comment,

111
00:06:03.335 --> 00:06:07.610
and that has invited them to comment on the post,

112
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.005
forever increasing its engagement so that can reach more people.

113
00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:13.685
I did find, after I posted it,

114
00:06:13.685 --> 00:06:18.890
that I was getting a few more connection requests from relevant people in my industry.

115
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.340
It at the very least will help you connect with people that

116
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.210
also do what you do or something similar who are in that industry.

117
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.670
But I definitely got some relevant connection requests after posting this video.

118
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.220
Definitely I recommend experimenting with creating content.

119
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.395
If you want the best bang for your buck,

120
00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:41.360
I would definitely recommend doing video because not a lot of people at doing video on

121
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.090
LinkedIn and it's the most engaging type of content that you can post on LinkedIn,

122
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.540
as is the case on other social media platforms as well.

123
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.505
So of course, if you create a video,

124
00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:59.930
it's going to stand a pot more than just linking a article or writing a text post.

125
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.455
But I would recommend to get the best results on LinkedIn,

126
00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:06.140
you want to create native content.

127
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.090
Either writing a post with a bunch of text that's just on LinkedIn,

128
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.595
or creating a video that's just on LinkedIn

129
00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:16.250
doesn't mean you can't have it on other places as well.

130
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.310
But I think that LinkedIn is going to favor that content and it's

131
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.880
going to be more appealing in people's News Feeds.

132
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.485
Like this from my friend Danielle.

133
00:07:25.485 --> 00:07:29.025
This really stands out on the News Feed

134
00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:33.320
compared to just a little bit of texts or even an image.

135
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.910
So speaking of the news feed,

136
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.090
let's actually move out of this view now.

137
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.080
Click on ''Home'' and this will take us to the News Feed.

138
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.700
As you can see, this is where the content that you create will be posted.

139
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.980
You can also see some ads here.

140
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.235
But the more rich the content that you can post,

141
00:07:52.235 --> 00:07:54.050
the more reach it's likely to get,

142
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.830
and the more engagement and just overall benefit

143
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.729
to you of growing your network and finding your clients you'll receive.

144
00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:03.050
So you want to,

145
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.200
if it makes sense to put in photos, put in photos.

146
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.570
If you can do a video like I've done,

147
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.160
definitely do a video.

148
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.275
But creating content is definitely a way to increase your network,

149
00:08:15.275 --> 00:08:21.125
promote yourself, and hopefully get a few new leads in the process.

150
00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:24.860
The way you actually create content is by scrolling up to the News Feed,

151
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.120
and as you can see here,

152
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.835
we can write a text post or we can add photos here,

153
00:08:31.835 --> 00:08:34.835
just like we would on the other social media platforms.

154
00:08:34.835 --> 00:08:38.075
Or we can do what I did for my video.

155
00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:40.055
Share a video here.

156
00:08:40.055 --> 00:08:43.415
You can also join a Event and write a native article here.

157
00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:46.490
But if you click ''Right article'' then you'll be taken to

158
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.660
the publishing platform to create your article.

159
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.470
All right, so content is king as they say,

160
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.500
it's a new, relatively new thing to LinkedIn.

161
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.720
LinkedIn didn't start out with everyone having the ability to create content.

162
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.120
But as a lot of people are doing it,

163
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.380
it's a competitive advantage and it's not too saturated.

164
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:14.390
So you can stand out and set yourself apart by creating

165
00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:19.450
lots of content and drawing people into your profile increasing your leads,

166
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.955
increasing your connections and resulting in more work.

167
00:09:22.955 --> 00:09:26.000
The final thing about content that I'll share is something I

168
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.240
showed you before in the last video is on my profile.

169
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.465
You can see here that I have featured content.

170
00:09:32.465 --> 00:09:35.030
So these bits of content, if I click on this,

171
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.545
it's going to go to YouTube,

172
00:09:36.545 --> 00:09:38.590
and that's just an ad there.

173
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.625
But if we get past the ad,

174
00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:44.060
you can start to watch my video on Shopify liquid,

175
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.105
which should be one of the top videos when you search,

176
00:09:47.105 --> 00:09:48.845
Shopify liquid at present.

177
00:09:48.845 --> 00:09:51.385
So it's good authority building.

178
00:09:51.385 --> 00:09:53.855
You can see it's gotten a good number of views.

179
00:09:53.855 --> 00:09:58.475
Over here, I've got my Shopify theme development class,

180
00:09:58.475 --> 00:10:01.910
which has gotten some good reviews on it.

181
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.690
So again, authority building in my particular niche,

182
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.285
in my particular field of work.

183
00:10:08.285 --> 00:10:11.060
If you have content from other places,

184
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.710
you can post them or feature them here and you can also

185
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:20.690
feature articles and media that you already have on LinkedIn up here too.

186
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.305
I wonder if I could share.

187
00:10:23.305 --> 00:10:27.995
No. Fortunately, I can't share a video, or maybe I can.

188
00:10:27.995 --> 00:10:31.205
Here we go. Let's go back here.

189
00:10:31.205 --> 00:10:36.235
Click on ''Feature'' and look at that.

190
00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:38.540
I can feature the video as well.

191
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.550
I'm going to take that off because it just doesn't look

192
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.740
consistent with the other two items.

193
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.245
But yeah, you can actually feature that content,

194
00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:47.555
that video content on your profile.

195
00:10:47.555 --> 00:10:48.830
As we saw before,

196
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.210
it doesn't come up by default.

197
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.675
So that might be something you want to do if you are creating videos.

198
00:10:53.675 --> 00:10:56.780
But the principle here is create content,

199
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.300
increase your reach, set yourself apart,

200
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:07.200
and position yourself more as a leader in what it is you do for your particular niche.
