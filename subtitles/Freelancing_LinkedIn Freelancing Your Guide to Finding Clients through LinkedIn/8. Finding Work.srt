1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
In this lesson, let's talk about outreach.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,740
At this stage, we should know exactly what service we

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,795
provide and to whom we provide it to.

4
00:00:08,795 --> 00:00:11,740
We've set up a targeted profile that clearly communicates

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,340
this message and maybe we've created some content as well.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,610
Given that you now know exactly who you serve,

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,065
you can reach out to these clients directly.

8
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:23,020
Now there's a few ways you can do this,

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,630
and it's going to depend on what your service is,

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,885
if you're selling high ticket consulting services, for instance,

11
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:31,840
you're going to take a different approach to say me,

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,030
who's offering web development support to agencies.

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,740
Having never sold high ticket consulting via LinkedIn before I'm

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,590
going to divert to industry expert Natasha Vilaseca here.

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,630
Natasha's E triple C method starts by;

16
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,390
One, engaging with the prospects content.

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,775
Two, sending a connection requests with a personalized note.

18
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:53,710
Three, starting a conversation with

19
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,275
the prospects when they accept your connection request,

20
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,960
explaining to them what it is you do and

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,925
see if your services would be a good fit for them.

22
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:05,530
Then getting a prospect on the call to discuss further if it

23
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,160
seems a good match or if not asking for a referral.

24
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,500
Finally, once you get the client on the phone,

25
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,930
running them through your sales script and closing the deal.

26
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,230
This is an example of an approach you might

27
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,260
take for selling a consulting package or any kind of

28
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,825
logic to deal with a prospective client needs to make a significant upfront commitment.

29
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:29,360
For me, I take a much simpler approach instead of going

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,230
through a process of warming up the client by engaging with their content,

31
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,755
waiting until day aware of me before making a connection,

32
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:41,605
I often just reach out to them directly with a simple message like this.

33
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:44,060
In the bonus lesson, I'll show you how

34
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,810
this one message landed me over 200 hours of freelance work.

35
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,340
But for now I want to stress a few key elements of this outreach message.

36
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,839
Number 1, this message is not at all salesy,

37
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:58,680
that's not to say you shouldn't ever be salesy,

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,960
but in this case there's really no need to be.

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,050
Notice how I'm simply putting it out there in

40
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,885
this message and then I'm not pushing for the sale.

41
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:10,505
Number 2, it's clear why I'm messaging this person specifically.

42
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,890
If the prospective client reads the message and

43
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,530
doesn't see how this message is relevant to them,

44
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,860
then you're going to look like a spammer.

45
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,525
Instead, notice how I make the connection

46
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:23,420
between what I do and what they do by referring to

47
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,860
the fact that the agency has

48
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,200
a Shopify Plus partner agency having done the exact same service for a different company,

49
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm confident that my service is going to be

50
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,615
highly relevant to what they do in their business.

51
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:37,520
Now, I'm not saying that my message is

52
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,250
perfect and that we should all copy it word for word.

53
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,470
But I do want to stress that you definitely don't want to spam people on LinkedIn.

54
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,210
If you ignore my advice here and just start direct messaging prospects at random,

55
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,050
this can actually hurt your reputation and reflects badly on your profile.

56
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,045
So please always be targeted with your approach,

57
00:02:57,045 --> 00:03:01,310
don't be pushy and makes sure to message only those prospects who are

58
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,790
clearly an ideal fit for the service you provide, agreed?

59
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,160
All right. Now that we've established some principles for outreach on LinkedIn,

60
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,585
let's look at the mechanics of messaging on LinkedIn.

61
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:18,140
Now, messaging on LinkedIn is a little bit of a weird thing as well.

62
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,400
There's a few things that can happen when you click message and the message button is in

63
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,770
a different place depending on how connected you

64
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,650
are with the person's profile you're looking at.

65
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,325
For instance, if I go to my friend Kathleen profile here,

66
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:35,090
she's a first connection and if I click "Message" is just going

67
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,780
to open up the chat box directly and I can send her a message,

68
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,595
there's no issues there.

69
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,930
But say for instance,

70
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,510
I looked at somebody who's outside my network,

71
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,535
maybe their second connection here,

72
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:48,530
the button for message is not going to be there.

73
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,200
Instead there's gonna be a button for connect and then I

74
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,085
can move over here to more and click "Message."

75
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:57,545
Notice that when I click ''Message'' though,

76
00:03:57,545 --> 00:04:00,245
I'm taken over to sales Navigator,

77
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:05,905
where I have 60 credits for which to contact somebody.

78
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:09,890
On LinkedIn, they don't just let you message anyone and everyone,

79
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,980
you often will have to use up credits or jump through some hoops.

80
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:22,130
In my case, I had to sign up to Sales Navigator in order to message some people.

81
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,250
Sales Navigator is a subscription per month,

82
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,475
I think for me it's a $100 Australian a month,

83
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:31,320
so that's in my currency, not very cheap.

84
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,320
But the idea of this sales navigated tool is it helps you to

85
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,750
generate sales using LinkedIn's extensive database of connections.

86
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,414
From a business perspective,

87
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,430
it makes sense a $100 a month,

88
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,090
but for a lot of you guys out there,

89
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,045
I know that's probably going to be a bit too expensive.

90
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:54,615
I'm sure that there's some people on LinkedIn that you can message,

91
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:57,240
it's not everyone I hit the ''Message'' button

92
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,145
for on LinkedIn that force me to use Sales Navigator.

93
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:06,590
Not sure if I could find some other examples here of other people that I can click on,

94
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,065
for instance, if I click on this girl here,

95
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:10,985
she's a third connection.

96
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,510
If I click ''Message''.

97
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,915
Yeah, it's just going to take me to sales Navigator.

98
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:20,920
Sales Navigator good tool in order to be able to message anyone,

99
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,504
you can also create lead lists and manage your sales process.

100
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:29,990
A lot of sales people and I think recruiters use Sales Navigator,

101
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,550
I'm using it to contact people that are outside my network.

102
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,630
But I think one hack you can use to get around sales Navigator is to

103
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,070
try and connect with them first and then once you've connected with them,

104
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,560
you can probably messaged them without Sales Navigator,

105
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,270
so that's one thing you might do,

106
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,555
you might want to click here to connect.

107
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:52,610
Just make sure if you're trying to connect with them,

108
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,740
that you send them a personalized message,

109
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,005
if you don't know them,

110
00:05:57,005 --> 00:05:59,360
telling them why you want to connect with them.

111
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,730
I get so many people try and connect with me,

112
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,790
but they don't write a note with it and so I just see

113
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,720
a random person that I've never seen before trying to connect with me,

114
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,370
it's not clear what they want.

115
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:17,480
I definitely recommend if you can send them a connection request with a message,

116
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,965
if you're going to connect with them first.

117
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:25,925
That's pretty much the way you message people on LinkedIn,

118
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:27,455
you find that profile,

119
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:30,335
you click even the message button here, or click more,

120
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:32,830
and then find it in this menu here,

121
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,970
then if you want to connect with them,

122
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,320
you can do that as well.

123
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,735
In my approach, which you'll see a little bit later,

124
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:43,250
I just skipped the How connection request altogether and just contact them directly.

125
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,230
But I do have Sales Navigator,

126
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,680
so that is a consideration there,

127
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,900
but that's about it guys,

128
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,750
that's how you message somebody on LinkedIn.

129
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,700
Now that you've sent your message, what's next?

130
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,095
Well, it's quite simple,

131
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:58,970
we just wait for a response.

132
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,710
In the bonus lesson, I'll share some of

133
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,475
the actual responses that I've gotten to my outreach messages.

134
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:07,645
But in general, one of three things will happen.

135
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:10,250
One, you won't receive any response,

136
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,020
that's fine, don't worry about it,

137
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,905
as long as your strategy is working on at least some prospects,

138
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:18,925
you don't need every prospect to respond.

139
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:24,125
Number 2, you'll receive a response that acknowledges your message and essentially says,

140
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:28,205
We'll get back to you if we need your help or if they have any specific questions,

141
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,520
they might ask you that here as well.

142
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,230
Then, of course, the ideal scenario,

143
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,860
number 3, the prospect might need your service right away,

144
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,185
in which case you move the conversation forward,

145
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:43,390
getting them on a phone call or moving the conversation over to email.

146
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,940
Either way, as long as your message is neither pushy or irrelevant,

147
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,340
then you should be fine to repeat this process with

148
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,005
as many prospects as you find within your target audience.

149
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,275
All right, that's it for this section of the class.

150
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,145
In the next bonus video,

151
00:07:57,145 --> 00:08:00,620
I'll be sharing actual examples of how creating content and

152
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,145
doing outreach on LinkedIn has helped me to promote my service,

153
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:07,300
extend my network, and attract new leads.

154
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,150
I'll see you on the next video.
