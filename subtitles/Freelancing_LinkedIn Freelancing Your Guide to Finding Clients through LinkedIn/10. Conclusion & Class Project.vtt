00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
In this class we've covered an the approach to LinkedIn that freelancers

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.705
can use to promote their services and gain new clients.

3
00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:08.715
Remember, as I've said throughout this class,

4
00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.920
it starts with a clear idea of the service you

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.330
provide and to whom you provide that service to.

6
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.205
If you're not quite there yet when it comes to finding your niche,

7
00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:19.670
feel free to revisit this class at a later date.

8
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.170
For those of you who have your niche in mind,

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.600
I want you to update your LinkedIn profile to become

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.850
a targeted profile for your particular niche as this classes' class project.

11
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.380
After you've updated your profile,

12
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.800
make sure to post your profile in the projects section of the class for feedback.

13
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.045
As always, if you need any help or guidance,

14
00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:41.330
leave your comments in the discussion section below.

15
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.475
Best of luck with your journey on LinkedIn.

16
00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:49.020
Thanks as always for watching and I hope to see you again on some of my other classes.
