1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Now that you're clear on the service you provide and the

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,735
targeted audience to which you think would benefit most from your service,

3
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:11,070
we need to update your profile to align with your target audience.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,385
I call this creating a targeted profile.

5
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:19,080
The idea here is not to max out your profile with tons of portfolio items,

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,150
experience, and education, instead,

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,210
we want to create a profile which will position us as

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,355
the ideal person to provide our specialized service to our targeted audience.

9
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:30,705
In this part of the video,

10
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:36,225
I want to take you through a few examples of targeted profiles on LinkedIn.

11
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:38,430
Let's start with my own profile here,

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,960
and by no means am I saying that I have the perfect profile on LinkedIn,

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,190
probably far from it,

14
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,530
not a copywriter by trade,

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,175
so I'm sure I could word some things on his profile better.

16
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:55,234
But the main thing I feel like I'm doing well at is having a clear headline,

17
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:57,804
and my headline is targeted;

18
00:00:57,804 --> 00:01:04,895
it tells the person looking at my profile what I do and the exact clients I serve.

19
00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:08,300
If a digital agency were to look at this profile,

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:14,900
they would see them listed and they would see that this is what I help with.

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,759
If they want more clarification,

22
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:19,940
they can go down here and learn a bit more about me.

23
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,930
I think the main thing with your LinkedIn profile that you want to get

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,570
right is your profile photo and your headline here,

25
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:34,610
everything else should be aligned with what you do and who you provide that service to,

26
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,960
as I keep harping on in this class about,

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,375
but that's really the core principle that's going to follow us through this whole class.

28
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,810
Obviously, the profile photo looks pretty good,

29
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,480
it's a professional photo that I did pay a photographer to do,

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,370
but you don't necessarily have to have

31
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,175
a professional photographer take a headshot of you,

32
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:53,910
you just want to make sure that the lighting is good,

33
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,755
you're smiling, you look approachable but professional,

34
00:01:57,755 --> 00:02:01,010
and that you're centered well in the photo.

35
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,210
I'm sure there's a lot of information you can learn online about taking a good photo,

36
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,385
I'm not going to spend too long on that,

37
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:09,140
but use your common sense here,

38
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,189
you want a photo that presents you as a professional.

39
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:17,015
Up here, you can see the space for the cover image,

40
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:20,930
and I have this cool image of me presenting on stage.

41
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,779
This is a good one to show some authority,

42
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:27,550
but it's not particularly relevant to what I'm providing services about now.

43
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,825
I actually did a speech on how I got started on YouTube, but of course,

44
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:35,400
the person looking at this profile doesn't necessarily know that,

45
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,680
so I think it's a nice touch or maybe adds a bit of authority to my profile.

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,520
Of course, there's other areas of your profile that you'll want to do well at.

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,940
Your bio obviously, you just want to make sure that it's

48
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,705
communicating exactly what you do and who you serve,

49
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:54,225
and possibly, the story of how you came upon that,

50
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:58,680
or going into more detail about what you do for clients.

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,740
Definitely, I could probably do better than this,

52
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,205
but it's ticking all the boxes I feel for now and

53
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:08,500
it makes sense as to how I got into Shopify theme development.

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,040
Here you can see I've featured some of the content I've created,

55
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,610
and this content has done quite well on YouTube and Skillshare,

56
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,260
so I made sure to note that here,

57
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,230
it's one of the top Skillshare classes on

58
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:27,255
Shopify theme development definitely in the last year or so that anyone has created.

59
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:29,825
Also on YouTube, I've created a bunch of

60
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:33,275
Shopify theme development content that ranks pretty well.

61
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:37,625
This is authority building if you have any good content,

62
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,365
maybe it's an article on your website,

63
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:41,360
even so, that when people click on it,

64
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,575
they go to your website,

65
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:45,820
if you have anything that feature here, definitely do so.

66
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,325
Obviously, you're going to want to list your experience here.

67
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:53,915
I wouldn't get too caught up on listing tons and tons of experience,

68
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:55,670
just anything that's relevant.

69
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,575
It doesn't have to be a lot of entries as we'll soon see in a different example,

70
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:03,860
but just make sure anything that's relevant like, for instance,

71
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,400
this job where I first got into Shopify theme development,

72
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,690
definitely relevant, definitely want to include it,

73
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,480
so anything that's particularly relevant,

74
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,025
I could even get rid of this one here,

75
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:17,265
but again, don't try and fill up.

76
00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:20,150
I used to have a lot more experience listed here,

77
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:24,830
I should probably even remove this one because it's irrelevant to what I do now,

78
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,300
I used to have all sorts of internships in accounting and finance in here,

79
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,985
just remove them if they're not relevant to the service that you're providing.

80
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:37,625
Also here you got an opportunity to list education,

81
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,725
depending on what your service is,

82
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:41,480
you might require education.

83
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,840
I'm sure if you were providing legal services, for instance,

84
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,210
you would want to list your law degree obviously, but any certifications,

85
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,480
trainings you've done that are relevant to what you do,

86
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,635
I think with the exception of a university degree,

87
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:00,680
you'll probably want to remove anything that's irrelevant.

88
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,800
Again, here I can probably remove some

89
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,354
of my school experience here and my study abroad experience,

90
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:09,845
I'll probably clean that up in future.

91
00:05:09,845 --> 00:05:14,750
I need to follow my own advice here and cut out some of this profile but again,

92
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,975
I don't think it's hurting me too much and if we go down here,

93
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,910
you can see skills and endorsements.

94
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,060
If you can get endorsements for the service you provide,

95
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,665
great, definitely not going to hurt your profile either.

96
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:30,365
If you can get recommendations for what you do,

97
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:33,290
that is probably more powerful than having some

98
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,180
on click and say that you have skills in a particular area.

99
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,845
Down here, accomplishments, interests, yeah,

100
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:44,780
not very important, the rest of the stuff down the bottom of the profile.

101
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,860
You want make sure that you're optimizing from top to bottom.

102
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,210
The main thing you want to get right on your profile is the first impression where

103
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,570
you're communicating what it is you do and who you serve,

104
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,150
anything else is just authority building,

105
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,405
so everything that I put here in terms of experience or featured content,

106
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:08,720
it's just adding authority to this core message,

107
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,880
but the core message is important,

108
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,500
you want to know who you serve and what you do for them so that when

109
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,900
the person who's in your target market or target audience looks at your profile,

110
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,695
they know that you are the ideal person to help them with their needs.

111
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:31,160
Let's look at some other profiles quickly and then we'll move on to the next lesson.

112
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,790
I want to show you a friend of mine who does content removal,

113
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,250
I was recently on his podcast.

114
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,260
What I like about his profile is he's using the cover photo here for

115
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,230
a banner and he is clearly communicating what he does and the benefits of what he does.

116
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,730
He does content removal,

117
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,260
so it's clear what he does here.

118
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,015
Brands is a little bit broad,

119
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:57,830
but I think content removal is so niche that he doesn't really have to

120
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:03,315
go and niche any further because what he does is already quite niche.

121
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:08,779
I guess I would improve the head-shot by not having shadow on one side of the face,

122
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,535
but it's definitely a clear shot,

123
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:12,410
well-aligned with a smile,

124
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,280
he looks approachable, so not a bad top part here.

125
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,665
Here you can see in his bio,

126
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:22,010
he's got some sales points here

127
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,000
and some testimonials that might be something you would want to do as well.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,485
As you can see here,

129
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:29,645
not much listed in experience,

130
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:32,840
education, and licenses, and certifications,

131
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,300
so only the things that are relevant,

132
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,440
and in this case,

133
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,335
he started his content removal business seven years ago,

134
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:43,365
and he has only that experience listed on his profile.

135
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:48,635
You might have all this experience from an unrelated field,

136
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,000
you can simply remove it,

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,355
you don't necessarily need it on your profile.

138
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:56,030
Skills and endorsements, he could do better at that but I

139
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,885
see here he's had three recommendations received,

140
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,160
so that's pretty good,

141
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,120
that's probably above average.

142
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,375
But yeah, the main thing is this part up here,

143
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,420
it's clear what he does and who he serves.

144
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,850
Another person, final example,

145
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,290
I'll leave you guys on, my friend Kathleen.

146
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,740
She does international tax advisory.

147
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,595
She probably doesn't need to put this in her title,

148
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:24,125
but it's clear who she helps,

149
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,940
digital nomads, global startups,

150
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,365
and what she does for them is deal with international tax and corporate issues.

151
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:33,860
Definitely, I think there's a lot she can improve with this profile in terms of having

152
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,690
a cover photo here and maybe fleshing out her bio a little bit.

153
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:43,190
Yeah, she's got some good experience from a local university here,

154
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,180
but the main thing I want to get across about her profile is that

155
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,275
she's clear on who she serves and what she does for them.

156
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:54,260
She could probably be a bit more clearer on

157
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,410
how she helps with international tax and corporate issues,

158
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,940
but I'm sure what she does is quite broad within that and I'm

159
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,190
sure international tax is quite a niche subject within itself.

160
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:14,490
You want to use your own knowledge of your industry to figure out how niche you are.

161
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,530
In my own example,

162
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,775
if I was just a web developer helping people build websites,

163
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,550
I know for sure that that is just too broad,

164
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,355
so knowing what I know about my industry,

165
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:30,650
I know I've niched down to the right level or to a good level.

166
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:36,770
You need to use your own discretion here and figure out whether you're niched enough,

167
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,545
it's going to be different from industry to industry,

168
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,260
but I hope these examples have shared what I'm talking

169
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,140
about when I say a targeted profile.

170
