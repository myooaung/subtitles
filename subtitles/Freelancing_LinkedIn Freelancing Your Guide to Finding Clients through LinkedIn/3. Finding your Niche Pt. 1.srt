00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
Before you can really do well on LinkedIn,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,700
you need to have a clear idea of what service you provide

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,240
and the type of clients that would benefit most from that service.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,875
To use myself as an example,

5
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:15,195
I'm a front-end web developer who specializes in Shopify theme development.

6
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:18,900
The audience I serve are mostly busy agency owners who need

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,600
a reliable and efficient freelancer to whom they can

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,960
outsource their Shopify front-end web development work to.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,100
See how I know exactly what I do and who I serve.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,270
This is the kind of clarity required to be able to reach out to companies

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,940
directly and also it's going to help with

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,090
marketing your services and getting referrals as well.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,360
On LinkedIn, it's very important to be seen as a specialist.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,010
Not only is it easier to position yourself as an expert when you have a singular focus,

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,715
it also adds legitimacy to any outreach you do to connect with and attract new clients.

16
00:00:54,715 --> 00:00:56,270
Later in this class, we will look at

17
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,360
just how simple outreach on LinkedIn can be when you have

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,120
a clear idea of the service you provide and the exact audience you serve.

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,620
But for now, I want to talk about how you can

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,380
actually go about finding your niche and for that,

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,320
I'm going to share my own story of how I landed on

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,730
my current niche of doing a Shopify theme development for agencies.
