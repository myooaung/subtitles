00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
In 2015, I got my start working in web development.

2
00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:07.680
After just a few months of studying the backend framework, Ruby on Rails,

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.955
I got my first job working with Ruby on Rails full-time.

4
00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:15.240
Back then I was quite directionless when it came to where I wanted to take

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.925
my career and I took the first job that was offered to me.

6
00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:22.350
Long story short, the job didn't work out and I ended up

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.415
pivoting into the popular blogging platform in CMS WordPress.

8
00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:30.375
While WordPress was a good platform to learn in order to gain freelance work,

9
00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:33.300
it was still quite a broad niche and I didn't

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.450
have a clear idea of the audience I served within it.

11
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.160
Then in 2019, I was offered the opportunity to work with

12
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.695
an agency that specialized in Shopify as a front end web developer.

13
00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:46.535
While working for this agency,

14
00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:50.285
I learned as much as I could about this specialized area of web development,

15
00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:54.355
while also learning about how it is to work in a digital agency.

16
00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:57.065
When I left that agency at the end of the year,

17
00:00:57.065 --> 00:00:59.150
I had found a new niche;

18
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.550
providing specialist Shopify web development services to agencies.

19
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.620
Now, obviously, I've made a long story short here,

20
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.500
but the key lessons I feel are as follows.

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.970
Number one, it might take some time before you find your niche.

22
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.335
Notice how I'm using the word finding rather than deciding on your niche.

23
00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:21.590
As oftentimes, you need to build out experience and try

24
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.150
a few things before you find a niche that works for you.

25
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.655
Number two, following on from that idea of building experience,

26
00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.870
you might want to take up an opportunity to grow into your niche.

27
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.490
For me that meant taking a job where I would automatically gain the skills and

28
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.340
experience that I could then directly channel

29
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.465
into working with businesses on a freelance basis.

30
00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:47.600
For you, you might want to sign up for a specialized training program or intern with

31
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.195
an individual or small business where you'll get real industry experience.

32
00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.900
Now, of course, if you're

33
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.240
a particularly confident person and you already

34
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.940
have a clear idea of the niche you want to get into,

35
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.110
then you can always disregard these lessons.

36
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.370
These are not prerequisites for getting started in a niche.

37
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.630
You don't necessarily need to take your time with this,

38
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.620
but I think for the majority of us,

39
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.270
finding a niche is typically more of an organic process.

40
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.950
You might have to try out a bunch of different niches

41
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.200
before settling on something that works for you long-term.

42
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.320
Of course, you don't have to stick to any single niche for the entirety of your career,

43
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.560
just like I might switch niches over the course of my career as well.

44
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.810
Something else I want to make clear here is that

45
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.890
finding your niche doesn't have to be an accidental thing.

46
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.040
In my own journey,

47
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.620
I did take steps to move in the direction of

48
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.575
what I determined would be a good niche to get into.

49
00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:42.860
I had a plan upfront to build experience in that area

50
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.575
first before having the confidence and skills to go into freelance full time.

51
00:02:47.575 --> 00:02:50.010
With your own career you might want to do the same.

52
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.380
You might want to create a plan for gaining experience in a particular field which you

53
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.365
think has an audience of clients to whom you can serve on a freelance basis.

54
00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:01.880
Your niche is not set in stone,

55
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.955
but I do recommend that you have a particular niche in mind

56
00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:08.120
before continuing with the lessons in this class.

57
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.330
Everything else we'll learn in the following lessons is going to be about

58
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.295
taking this niche and applying it specifically to LinkedIn.

59
00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.700
Please don't skip this step.

60
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.810
Make sure you have a clear idea of the service you provide and

61
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.290
the specific audience you provide it to and when you're ready,

62
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.270
I'll see you in the next video.
