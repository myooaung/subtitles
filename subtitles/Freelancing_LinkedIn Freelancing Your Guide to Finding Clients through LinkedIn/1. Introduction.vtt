00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.320
I'm Christopher Dodd, I'm a freelance web developer and

In today's short class,

7
00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:18.795
I'm going to share my experience using LinkedIn to find freelance work.

8
00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:23.025
We'll talk about the important mindsets required in order to succeed on LinkedIn,

9
00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:25.410
as well as some of the practicalities around crafting

10
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.145
your ideal profile and setting yourself up for success.

11
00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:32.385
LinkedIn, of course, is the largest professional network in the world,

12
00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:35.270
hosting the profiles of thousands of local professionals,

13
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.250
all the way up to CEOs of the world's biggest companies.

14
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.940
Regardless of whether you're looking for

15
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.640
your next big consulting contract and opportunity

16
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.035
to just work part time from home or find your next full time job,

17
00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:52.750
LinkedIn is the premier location to market your professional services online.

18
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.310
In this class, we'll go over some of the core lessons I've

19
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.640
learned from marketing my own freelance services on LinkedIn,

20
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.100
and how you can unlock opportunities to work with

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.450
your ideal clients through the world's premier professional social network.
