00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
In this bonus video,

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.845
I'm going to share some of the results I've gotten by using LinkedIn.

3
00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:08.580
Of course, I wouldn't create a class on LinkedIn if I hadn't used

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.930
these strategies to actually gain work and grow my network.

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.520
I want to show you guys what you can actually achieve using LinkedIn.

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.105
By no means am I saying I am the ultimate master when it comes to LinkedIn,

7
00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:25.680
but the principles and the lessons that I've shared with you in this class have been

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.450
proven to work as evidenced by the opportunities that have been presented to me,

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.050
and I just wanted to share some of that with you now.

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.660
If I go into my messaging tab here,

11
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.840
you can see some of the conversations I've had.

12
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.100
I might be blurring out some of this because these

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.745
aren't all conversations I want to have as public,

14
00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:50.270
but there's some opportunities that have come through in

15
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.285
my inbox by doing all of the stuff I've talked about in this class with LinkedIn.

16
00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:59.915
Another place where I'm getting messages is my Sales Navigator inbox.

17
00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:04.475
Again, we talked about Sales Navigator briefly in a earlier video.

18
00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:10.130
I have used Sales Navigator to reach out to people outside my network to gain work,

19
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.800
and that has been successful as well.

20
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.190
I want to show you some examples of what I've

21
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.245
done and how it has resulted in me finding work.

22
00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:23.475
If I go back to my messaging tab here,

23
00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:28.010
and actually, I'm going to go to Sales Navigator first.

24
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.350
I believe I messaged somebody named Alistair at a company, I'm going to search it here.

25
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.190
I sent him the message that I shared in a previous video here.

26
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.870
Here it is again, a simple message as I broke down in an earlier video.

27
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.960
I just want to get in touch with you and just putting it out

28
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.470
there if you ever need support when it comes to Shopify theme development,

29
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.940
don't hesitate to get in touch.

30
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.305
I've listed my number down here which I've blurred out for you guys.

31
00:01:57.305 --> 00:02:02.240
What happened from that was I got a message directly on LinkedIn.

32
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.190
I got to go back to this other inbox,

33
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.865
which is again LinkedIn's weird with how it does messages,

34
00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:11.570
and I got a message from somebody at their firm,

35
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.220
the founder and CEO.

36
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.230
It says, "Hi Chris,

37
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.120
Alistair passed on your details and mentioned you

38
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.145
were looking for freelance Shopify plus work.

39
00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:21.660
We actually have quite a bit going on at the moment,

40
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.680
so send me an email at this to start the discussion.

41
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.700
Cheers." That simple message that was sent January 6.

42
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.945
I got a message back from the founder of that agency two days later.

43
00:02:35.945 --> 00:02:37.340
About two days later,

44
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.140
I started working with that client.

45
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.400
I worked with them for a few months and did over 200 hours of work.

46
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.785
Obviously, my little message here,

47
00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:49.309
putting it out there worked and there was quite a quick turnaround.

48
00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.980
Now, not saying that there's always going to be a quick turnaround,

49
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.970
that was hit the nail on the head there in terms of timing,

50
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.265
but some of my outreach, obviously,

51
00:02:58.265 --> 00:02:59.960
I don't get a response back from,

52
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.240
some of my outreach they say,

53
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.915
"Thanks, we'll keep you in mind."

54
00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:07.040
Some of them, I actually get a response back later on.

55
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.660
See how here I say,

56
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.195
"If you're ever in need of support when it comes to Shopify,

57
00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:12.750
don't hesitate to get in touch."

58
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.255
Some of them actually do get in touch months down the track.

59
00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:22.585
That happened recently with this particular client here.

60
00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:25.790
I have a slightly different message here that I'm sending to them,

61
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.320
but it's the same structure.

62
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.630
"I just wanted to get in touch with you because

63
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.790
your firm offers Shopify development as one of their services."

64
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.800
Starting straight away with why this message is

65
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.890
relevant and why I'm messaging this person specifically.

66
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.765
Then of course ending with,

67
00:03:41.765 --> 00:03:44.000
"If you ever need, let me know."

68
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.925
He accepted it. He said,

69
00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:48.965
"Always good to have some extra contract as handy."

70
00:03:48.965 --> 00:03:53.465
He asked me a question about my experience with headless Shopify using Gatsby.

71
00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:55.520
I said I haven't done Gatsby before,

72
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.805
but I have created a headless e-commerce app project before,

73
00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:03.920
sent him the link, and then I followed up because there was no response.

74
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.005
We didn't end up working together for,

75
00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:08.180
as you can see here, that was in July,

76
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.165
and we didn't end up working with each other until

77
00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:15.290
September when he had a few Shopify sites coming up.

78
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.640
The point is here that they might not always have work for you straight away,

79
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.170
but you're just building that connection.

80
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.430
You just putting it out there.

81
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.620
This is why you don't want to be pushy.

82
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.230
Maybe they don't have the work right then and there,

83
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.805
but they will have in future.

84
00:04:28.805 --> 00:04:31.250
The way I see it is by doing this outreach,

85
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.485
I'm just saying, "Look, I'm here,

86
00:04:33.485 --> 00:04:36.530
I'm the ideal person to help you with this need

87
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.965
once it comes up," and if they really need help with something,

88
00:04:39.965 --> 00:04:41.645
they'll keep me in mind.

89
00:04:41.645 --> 00:04:44.305
In this case, it did. It came through.

90
00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:47.405
Now, those are two examples of

91
00:04:47.405 --> 00:04:50.990
times where it's come through for freelance work on LinkedIn.

92
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.705
Sometimes I've spoken with a few people and actually connected with them on the phone,

93
00:04:56.705 --> 00:04:58.850
but for whatever reason,

94
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.895
it wasn't working out or they didn't like my rates.

95
00:05:01.895 --> 00:05:04.640
These aren't the only two examples of it working.

96
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.895
But oftentimes, there's other factors involved

97
00:05:07.895 --> 00:05:11.585
and sometimes they want somebody to come on full time,

98
00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:13.895
or it's just not the right fit.

99
00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:17.105
You're going to get a whole lot of different responses back.

100
00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:19.205
One of them being no response at all,

101
00:05:19.205 --> 00:05:20.990
so be prepared for that.

102
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.120
But I think this approach of just giving them a soft little promotion of what

103
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.340
you do and putting you in front of them is

104
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.340
a nice little strategy to get you some possible work.

105
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.220
I will mention here that the message is optimized for the service I provide.

106
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.590
I know that these agencies continually provide this thing that I help with,

107
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.080
but they might not always need it.

108
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.615
It works for my industry.

109
00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:51.245
Make sure you use your own common sense here and you are an industry knowledge.

110
00:05:51.245 --> 00:05:53.720
For your industry, you might not want to say,

111
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.830
"Hey, I do this.

112
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.675
If you ever need help, reach out."

113
00:05:56.675 --> 00:06:00.010
Maybe you are aware that they need something right now,

114
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.650
so maybe you do want to be a bit more, let's say, salesy.

115
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.965
Again, it all depends on your industry.

116
00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:08.795
The main principle I want to get across here is that,

117
00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:10.760
if you do have a targeted profile,

118
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.235
it's clear what you do and who you serve,

119
00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:16.820
and you reach out to those people who you serve directly,

120
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.900
then there's not much bad that can happen from that and you might

121
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.390
just end up getting some work or some referrals through it.

122
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.840
As is the case for me,

123
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.115
I definitely got some work through LinkedIn.

124
00:06:30.115 --> 00:06:33.845
I want to show you something else that's not related to outreach.

125
00:06:33.845 --> 00:06:36.100
Through doing all that I've done with my profile,

126
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.085
I've have gotten companies outreaching to me specifically.

127
00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:46.890
I had an interesting opportunity come up with a fashion brand nearby called LSKD.

128
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.420
As you can see here, I had Keith reach out here,

129
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.745
and he was interested in my experience,

130
00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:57.410
and he's looking for a developer to work on the Shopify store,

131
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.275
and they were looking for somebody on a consultancy basis.

132
00:07:00.275 --> 00:07:03.450
Obviously, recruiters use LinkedIn.

133
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.305
It's a primary tool they use to find talent.

134
00:07:06.305 --> 00:07:11.930
You can use a lot of what I've said here to find a job if you're interested in,

135
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.180
and maybe an interesting opportunity comes across

136
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.685
your profile and you want to take it up,

137
00:07:16.685 --> 00:07:19.940
and maybe you pursue that rather than a freelance job.

138
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.150
But also sometimes you might get a recruiter reach out

139
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.600
and want to work with you on a consultancy basis as well.

140
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.840
I ended up having a core with these guys,

141
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.810
ended up going into the office.

142
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.340
In the end, it didn't end up coming to fruition.

143
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.220
I think in the end they hired somebody full time.

144
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.014
But it just goes to show that if your profile is targeted,

145
00:07:41.014 --> 00:07:44.225
that opportunities can find you as well.

146
00:07:44.225 --> 00:07:48.110
This is not the only opportunity that's come my way.

147
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.855
I'll sometimes have referrals come through.

148
00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:54.650
For instance, if I just roll down here,

149
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.030
I had this person who's part of another group that I'm involved in,

150
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:03.695
wanted me to work with one of their clients on Shopify store development.

151
00:08:03.695 --> 00:08:08.525
Unfortunately, I was at capacity at the time.

152
00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:11.425
Let me have a look at what else we've got here.

153
00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:13.370
I also had this guy reached out to me.

154
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.825
He says, "We would like to enhance and customize a purchased Shopify theme.

155
00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:20.135
We have our own designer who'll provide the artwork.

156
00:08:20.135 --> 00:08:23.165
Once you reply all share the full brief where for discussion."

157
00:08:23.165 --> 00:08:29.050
Again, opportunities can find you as well as you seeking opportunities for LinkedIn.

158
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.575
I definitely like that about LinkedIn,

159
00:08:32.575 --> 00:08:34.695
that it's a larger audience.

160
00:08:34.695 --> 00:08:37.335
Professionals use it, It's the premier network.

161
00:08:37.335 --> 00:08:39.990
Not everyone is on app work obviously,

162
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.340
and a big deterrent of using Upwork is all

163
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.760
the business that you generate on Upwork has to go through Upwork,

164
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.305
and go through their system,

165
00:08:48.305 --> 00:08:50.690
which a lot of people aren't going to want to do.

166
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.325
I'm liking LinkedIn at the moment.

167
00:08:52.325 --> 00:08:55.010
But the reason why this all works,

168
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.610
and the point that I've been stressing throughout the whole video,

169
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.890
which you'll hear me say one last time here,

170
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.340
is that if you know exactly who you

171
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.105
serve and the service you provide to that target audience,

172
00:09:08.105 --> 00:09:12.965
then you can reach out directly to them on LinkedIn and start promoting yourself

173
00:09:12.965 --> 00:09:18.640
to a wider audience by positioning yourself as an expert in that particular niche.

174
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.655
Those are a few examples of opportunities I've gotten through LinkedIn.

175
00:09:22.655 --> 00:09:25.690
Again, wouldn't teach you stuff that hasn't worked for me,

176
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:30.995
so rest assured that the information in this class is coming from personal experience.

177
00:09:30.995 --> 00:09:32.615
If you have any questions on this,

178
00:09:32.615 --> 00:09:35.120
obviously you can leave it in the discussion box below.

179
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.100
If you have anything to contribute,

180
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.550
definitely leave that in the discussion box below.

181
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.350
We're all here on Skillshare to learn and grow.

182
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.395
It's not about one person having all the answers.

183
00:09:45.395 --> 00:09:50.435
If you want to share your knowledge on this class as well, I'd appreciate that.

184
00:09:50.435 --> 00:09:53.570
But otherwise, that's the end of the class.

185
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.110
I will see you in the conclusion where I will tell

186
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.845
you that what I am looking forward for your class project.

187
00:10:00.845 --> 00:10:02.330
Thank you for watching,

188
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.100
and I'll see you in the next video.
