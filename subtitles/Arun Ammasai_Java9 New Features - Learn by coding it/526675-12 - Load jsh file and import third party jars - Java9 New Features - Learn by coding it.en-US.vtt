00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.565
Hello, welcome back.

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:04.320
So in this particular tutorial,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.940
what we're going to discuss,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.420
we're going to talk about how to load a existing JSON file,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.275
how to save a shell file.

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:18.360
Okay, so let's do that.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.605
So first thing I'm going to open up a shell or the first thing which we need to do.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:27.600
And after opened JCL,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.350
I'm going to do some declaring a variable of trying something else.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.890
Okay? So I have an int x is equal to ten,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.210
and I have int y is equal to 20.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.725
And I have another variable called string x.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:50.070
Thing yes is equal to hello world.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.405
So I wanted to keep them with a separate file.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:00.395
So whenever I need I can load them and I can use them. How to do that?

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:02.315
So in order to save that,

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:05.390
what we need to do, we need to know the shortcut for that.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.965
I mean, we just nothing but the same add-on sale.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:12.170
And what are the file that you're going to I'm

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.240
going to save all of them. Okay, let's try.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.400
And the filename, for example,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.040
sample don't tear such.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.635
See now the file has been saved.

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:30.425
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to exit now.

00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:32.450
So clean the screen.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.610
So I'm going to open this particular file.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.615
Okay?

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:42.530
First, I'm going to open that J shall first,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.645
because we know that I have an x and a y and our tunnel variable called s.

00:01:47.645 --> 00:01:50.330
Okay, I'm trying to access them.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.090
See, i'm, I'm getting any other that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.970
means I don't have the reference for the existing file,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.175
so I need to open the file.

00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:03.400
So what are the filename? Sample, sample.txt edge.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.365
Now you can try the same X known.

00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:08.020
Know we got the data, right.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.980
So this is how you need to save a data or retrieve the data, right?

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.910
But even the Save it said that a lot of functionality is available.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.485
Okay, Let's do the help.

00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:24.610
Save to stay the first one,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.200
sale and the filename,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.675
save all the source.

00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:31.360
Okay, so whatever is the current lack, even the snippet,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.790
it will store everything, save all,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.560
which will do everything from the session,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.075
from the beginning to end.

00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:39.430
One many open the gestural and when you end

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.130
the additional everything will be stored and history,

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.190
which will make them I know you're doing history rate and those will be

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.170
stored and start start with nothing but when you open the shell,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.325
what are the things loaded that will be available in this file?

00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:59.390
And save and a specific ID or a filename.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:07.715
So you can only save a specific ID or file ID and the filename. Okay?

00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:09.050
So let, let me try.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.520
I will try to save and file limit.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.335
Let's try save and start.

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:17.825
So I don't want to do is save IF and start.

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:22.805
And the name is start dot js edge.

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:25.745
Okay, let's try to open it.

00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:32.040
Open TSH.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.970
So it's not printing here.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.405
Save that shot.

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:44.390
So think of it the location,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.850
so it will be in users.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.995
This is the location where we do everything.

00:03:54.995 --> 00:04:02.480
So can you see a file called sample that JSON H plus dot-dot-dot ASH.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.430
Just open it.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.680
Start program. I'm going to open it.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:24.665
And so just take a look at the score where everything is there, right?

00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:26.615
But I'm not able to see it here.

00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:29.190
But I'm not able to see it here.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.715
Okay, let me see.

00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:40.310
I just opened startup.js edge, right?

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.170
I just opened it. I didn't do anything.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.730
So if you want to see them, what do you need to do?

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.415
Just try list.

00:04:49.415 --> 00:04:53.705
Now we've got the data, say index is 0 is this ring is also there,

00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:55.070
and X is there.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.020
And they start classes.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.645
I will matter in it and everything.

00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:00.710
Right?

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.220
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do something history or history.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.540
History.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.670
So now I got some I did something and I referred I I did history here

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.665
and I'm able to see open the DSH and help save and save that or something.

00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:20.900
Okay, so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to do

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.560
the same operation again, hyphen history.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.780
And now the name is history.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.165
Dot there such value.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.520
File has been stored.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.685
So now what we can do is we can

00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:45.150
open history NodeJS edge,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.349
everything.

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.725
History means the entire thing which we covered so far.

00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:54.635
Send a file has opened here.

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:58.010
And we did the hell pride help HIV and save.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.385
So that's all this particular information.

00:06:01.385 --> 00:06:08.600
And then we created a variable and then made it another history here.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.420
So some based on the keyword,

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.535
it will be, for example, help Save.

00:06:16.535 --> 00:06:21.590
So you can try based on the current session or you can save everything.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.315
You can say one liter history,

00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:24.860
or you can say one LEA,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.620
what are the startup elements when you start the shell?

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.420
What are the things loader, you can

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.040
specifically load them into a separate file and based on the ID.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.990
For example, if you have a 48, right,

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.570
you can only do like Save and just

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:48.350
provide the 48 and into some test file dot js edge.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:56.130
Okay, now try to open a test message.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.650
So go to the location and you can

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:10.535
find under the tree we have one of the test month,

00:07:10.535 --> 00:07:12.380
that's a subphylum, right?

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.545
So here is a test.js, I just double-click.

00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:16.835
See.

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:20.705
This is 48. Here. The 48.

00:07:20.705 --> 00:07:22.650
Okay.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.975
If it's a man terminal lighting the Cantwell walk,

00:07:26.975 --> 00:07:32.300
but I don't know whether it's with the local run.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.050
Welcome.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.085
Okay.

00:07:37.085 --> 00:07:43.075
So Okay, We tried how to save a file and how to load a file,

00:07:43.075 --> 00:07:46.540
for example, let me clear everything,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.980
okay, Let me exit first.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.160
For example, I have some phyla,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.835
I have some excellent JAR file where I need to load something,

00:07:54.835 --> 00:07:56.260
I guess so for example,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.305
I know I have a Java extract.

00:07:58.305 --> 00:08:03.700
Okay, let, let me open up location and I'll show you what a JAR files which I have.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.735
So under uses, I don't really have a folder called jar.

00:08:07.735 --> 00:08:10.675
Instead of data, I have tau x sin x.

00:08:10.675 --> 00:08:15.235
I have a class called Intranet address i1 to use the Internet address.

00:08:15.235 --> 00:08:17.125
Okay, so how we are going to do that?

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:21.650
Let me open a session fast.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:28.230
Okay, once opened, the next thing which we need to do,

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:36.425
trying to access the Internet address.

00:08:36.425 --> 00:08:38.360
Intranet address is equal to

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:44.730
new Internet address.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.355
So now what happen?

00:08:52.355 --> 00:08:54.350
Because intranet address it is coming from

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.400
the third party JAR file and we don't have access here.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.330
So the first thing we need to set the class but for the JAR file.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:07.190
And then we can input and then we can use it.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.320
Okay, So how to do that?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.165
Use envy.

00:09:11.165 --> 00:09:14.750
Envy. And I've in-class part.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:20.730
And here you need to provide the proper data path.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:30.800
My system, I have had time for awhile discriminant for that location where we have a JAR

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:38.945
file uses and we have a folder collar job somewhere here.

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:43.190
Okay. This is a JAR file I'm trying to access, right?

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.960
So let's copy the entire part and pasted here.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.640
So now I have a class,

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.130
but I'm setting my jar file into my class,

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.910
but cold now it is done.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.035
So now what I need to do,

00:09:57.035 --> 00:09:59.090
I need to import it first.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:09:59.660
Okay?

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:08.820
I'll kind of data inter internet into the address.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:15.185
Input it manually. Input and

00:10:15.185 --> 00:10:25.610
x dot mail dot Internet Internet address.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.910
So this is the class which I'm going to use it.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.865
So I'm importing a class alone, right?

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:33.200
So now what I'm gonna do,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.730
I'm going to do the same here.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.060
So the same thing I'm trying here.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.190
See now with the lock.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.300
Okay?

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.570
So this is how we entertain butter jar file, okay?

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.835
But in case if you have a multiple JAR files,

00:10:46.835 --> 00:10:48.590
you can simply provide star.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:53.720
Or if you under specific any JAR files like this,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.955
you can provide this colon,

00:10:55.955 --> 00:10:59.945
colon and you can provide either JAR files.

00:10:59.945 --> 00:11:02.360
Okay, so let's see. So the next video.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.870
Thank you.
