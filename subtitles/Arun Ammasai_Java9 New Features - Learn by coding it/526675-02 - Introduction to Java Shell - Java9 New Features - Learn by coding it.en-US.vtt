00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Hello, developers will come back.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.035
So we know what are the new features comes as a part of Java nine.

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:10.050
So these are the listed out for the new features.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.405
Let's talk about each and everything.

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:14.890
Let's start with Java sharing.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.650
Okay, so what's the fall in Java Shell?

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.105
So what is it a ripple?

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:30.170
Ripple is it stands for read, evaluate, print, loop.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.585
That particular concept called a ripple.

00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:34.850
But it is new to in Java.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.745
But in other languages like Python,

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:41.375
that Apple cards have done has been introduced real long time back.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.930
Okay, So we are new to Java Shell and Java

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.925
shall be never realize how powerful this tool is going to be,

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:54.920
okay if a new person comes to platform and they wanted to learn Java,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.550
and the first place which they need to go is a Java Shell.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.430
Okay, so let's talk about lot in functionality of what the ripple.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.410
But before that, under the Java Shell,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.995
what are the things which we are going to discuss in this?

00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:11.000
Okay?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.070
The first one is the introduction to Java Shell and getting started,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.920
how we need to start work on the Java J shell,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.635
okay, it's not a Java JCL, it's JCL,

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:32.000
which is nothing but Java Shell programming and getting help on chill.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.135
Okay, So if you want to know some comments,

00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:38.645
you don't have to go and look for the Google or somewhere else

00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:43.925
because the shell comes with its one help documentation.

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:47.135
Because the shell is working in a command prompt.

00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:50.615
Okay, so we're going to discuss about that.

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:52.595
And the snippets.

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:54.700
We all know that what is the snippet, right?

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.105
It's a piece of code.

00:01:56.105 --> 00:01:57.410
So what is there in the snippet,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.930
snippet in JSON, we'll talk about that.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.500
And then how we're going to edit the code and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.460
how we're going to navigate to the next method or previous method or next variable,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.695
that previous variable, something like that.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:12.410
And then how we are going to define a variable.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.235
All we are going to make use of the variables and how to create a methods,

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:18.155
and how to create a class.

00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:22.815
And because shale comes with its own editor, right?

00:02:22.815 --> 00:02:26.530
I found it a little shell comes with its own editor.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.590
But it's up to us whether we can use it or we can map it to

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.920
the external editor like notepad or Notepad Plus,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.390
Plus, even, MapReduce, Eclipse also, right?

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.310
And then shortcuts and load snippets.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.495
Okay, so what does that mean?

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:47.290
So when you're using some major Rochelle,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.700
we need to have some shortcuts.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.900
If you want to exit the program,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.195
you can use Control Z or Control Z or something like that.

00:02:52.195 --> 00:02:53.725
And what is load snippet?

00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:56.320
Okay, So I have a snippet which I already worked.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.465
Snippet is nothing but a piece of code.

00:02:58.465 --> 00:02:58.945
Okay?

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:01.615
So I work some code and they keep it in somewhere.

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:04.465
So I can load it here and I can continue working on it.

00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:05.220
Okay.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.215
And what next?

00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:08.285
The last thing is JAR files.

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:09.965
Okay, i'm, I'm working on a command prompt,

00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:15.485
how I'm going to use something which is there a part of a third party JAR file, right?

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:17.240
So we're going to talk about everything.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.870
So we are going to jump into introduction to

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.670
Java Shell and we're going to see how we're going to

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.725
open up a shell and how we do work on it.

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:26.340
Thank you.
