00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.310
So we discussed about the process,

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.130
the process ID and, and other things.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.350
All right, First we we just know what is the process.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.990
So whatever you are seeing in the screen,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.000
whatever it's running behind the process,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.870
behind the PC, begin the machine or any computer.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.880
Everything is part of a simple,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.350
simple, simple, simple process.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.890
Okay? So let me show you what this exactly process in,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.360
for example, in this computer.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.560
So what you need to do, just go to task manager.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.400
And there you can find applications.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.130
These are the currently running application and these are the processes.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.060
Here.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.445
You should be able to find that the process ID.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:50.075
But now I can only see image name, username.

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:52.355
Sometimes it won't display to here.

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:57.574
You need to go to View and select columns and enter to select the process identifier.

00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:00.990
So now we should be able to see the process ID.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:10.910
So each and every process it associated with the process ID, right?

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.240
So these are all the existing processes.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.500
So we can kill them.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.455
Or we can get the information from them.

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:25.280
Or we can create AR 1 process.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.580
Let me show you how to create a simple No, no.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.560
Let's talk about the process handled first.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.960
Okay, so how do we retrieve the current process

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.005
and from the current process and how we are going to be the information.

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:40.550
Let's talk about that.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.800
So I'm going to close this one.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.585
So, so the first step, step one.

00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:52.080
So the first step is you need to know about process.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.880
So the process and listen, I think,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.185
but it will help us to get there current running process.

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:04.820
So how are we gonna do that?

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.860
It's a simple command. It's, it's, it's, it's just simple comment.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.240
Okay? Just use a process handle and predominate name hamlet is equal

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.710
to handle dot, get, sorry, current.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.920
So this will give you the current process, right?

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.085
For example, I have what we can say.

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:35.075
I have a process, right?

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:38.660
So I want to get the process handle.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.720
Okay, so now in this particular line,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.055
we don't have a process,

00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:44.330
but that has scenarios.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.650
We'll have that we know the process,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.020
but I want to get the process handled.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.845
So from the process handler we can get all the information, right?

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:53.345
So what we can do that.

00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:55.895
So now step 2.

00:02:55.895 --> 00:03:01.220
So process, in the process.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.560
So how we can do that?

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.640
So we're going to use again the process handle.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.690
Right? So, so here we need to pass

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.540
the process and the process we need to get done. So far.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.240
Now, I'm going to create a simple process here,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.690
PRO, called the new process.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.410
So how we are going to create a process?

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.840
We're going to use the process.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.495
Create.

00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:44.225
Just assume that I'm grading a process here.

00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:46.190
So with this particular process,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.905
we can get done to handle,

00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:55.190
which will provide you the process handled.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.200
Once we got the process handle,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.975
you can retrieve the additional information from the process handler.

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:03.380
Okay.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.230
So now I know how to get the process and law

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.880
firm current process and I have an existing process.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.475
I can pass the products and they can get the process handled.

00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:19.190
So what is the next thing, step 3, PID.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.675
Okay, that is a scenario.

00:04:20.675 --> 00:04:24.260
I have process ID with me.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.220
So I can pause the process ID and I can get the process handled.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.400
So the first thing we always need to get the process handler.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.920
Okay, let me copy this.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.050
So I'm going to get the handle.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.440
But here, what we're going to do pretty much similar like how we

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.925
are getting the current process handled dark.

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:50.315
We're gonna use of matter.

00:04:50.315 --> 00:04:54.080
And we need to pass the 1234 any process ID.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.540
But one important thing it will not return.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.360
Just think about a scenario or passing some process ID that is a possibility,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.070
the product that is not existing.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.050
By the time you're running the code,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.960
the process might be destroyed already,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.595
made my dog closed.

00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:13.955
So it will not directly at it and a process handle.

00:05:13.955 --> 00:05:17.780
So it will return optional,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.820
optional off process handler.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.660
So once they got the option hand,

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.115
I mean a process handle.

00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:31.030
So it's going to return now optional. So you want to.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.595
If you want to retrieve something from the optional simple thing,

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:39.710
you can use the handle dot get matter.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.970
So the GET method is a method where we can provide the exact process handled.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.150
Right?

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.010
Okay. Now I have a process handle.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.025
So once you have the process handle,

00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:58.025
we can retrieve the information,

00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:02.000
but not directly using the process ended in say the process handle,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.610
we have another interface called info.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.620
Using that we're going to get the information.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.020
Let me open up, let me go to the Oracle docs here.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.760
Process handling. So this is the process handled, right?

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.280
So process handle that info.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.525
So this is interface which is under process handle.

00:06:25.525 --> 00:06:29.200
Okay, So if you want to know what is there inside the process handle,

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.995
just click the process handle, dot info link.

00:06:32.995 --> 00:06:35.380
It will give you what are the methods available?

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.180
So these are the things, I mean,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:44.035
these are the methods which will help us to give us the information about the process.

00:06:44.035 --> 00:06:47.920
Arguments depends RAF a string.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.405
The process, when we are looking at a simple example,

00:06:52.405 --> 00:06:55.860
will understand that how it is going to walk and command.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.090
So executable path name for the process.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.415
We know the process and what is the path of art

00:07:01.415 --> 00:07:04.520
and come online and start instant when it is.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.900
The process has been shocked at the time of starting the process and the CPU duration,

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.460
how long the process has been running,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.595
and who's the user for that.

00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:16.310
We're going to do all of them.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.795
Right?

00:07:17.795 --> 00:07:21.695
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to be 4. We're moving forward.

00:07:21.695 --> 00:07:24.680
We need to know how I I do have a process handle with me,

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.975
so how I'm going to repeat the process handled info.

00:07:29.975 --> 00:07:31.970
So that is the important questions, right?

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.275
So how we are going to get that?

00:07:33.275 --> 00:07:34.610
That is simple.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:42.415
So process and del dot info.

00:07:42.415 --> 00:07:44.515
So I'm going to create agents for that.

00:07:44.515 --> 00:07:49.510
So the way we are going to create the process and dilute the help of the process

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:54.595
handled supplies and analyte instance handle dot info,

00:07:54.595 --> 00:07:59.540
which will return the process handler.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.450
Got it.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.625
So what we're going to do in the next video,

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:10.570
we're going to use the process handler and the handler the info to using them.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.020
And we're going to retrieve the information from any process,

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.000
like our, for example,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.520
our JVM or any note, but it is running.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.725
Or what we can do is we can go to the process,

00:08:20.725 --> 00:08:22.640
like go to task manager.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.350
And you can find any process like we have a different kind of Prosite is right.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.960
So we can pass any process ID and we can get the information.
