00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
Hello developers, welcome back.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.500
Now we know how to create a method.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.300
I'm trying to modify some method,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.815
but it is not creating a,

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:09.060
it's not updating a matter.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.815
It is creating as a new method.

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:13.125
So now what you're going to do,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:14.820
we're going to update the Matata,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.430
Okay, so we have a format and say hi,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.695
say hello, and can't get pauses.

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:21.750
And with the two parameters,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.010
the end on elementary,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.675
which has a three parameters,

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:26.985
I want to edit the concat process.

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.305
So how we can do that?

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:34.545
We can do that with the help of eight edit space on which matter you want to,

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:39.290
um, data concat process. Just enter.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.190
It will show you both methods can be used.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.320
Both contains the concat pulsars, right?

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.730
So you can make the chain, it is nothing but it's just our Java Swing application.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.100
So you can make changes here.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.030
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to print something here like before printing the data,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.910
I'm going to bring some, some,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.990
some, some line here to see the difference and conquer process.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.730
I don't want to overburden anything here,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.470
just accept it now.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.300
The matter has been modified it before it was created as a numerator.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.380
Now it is modified metadata Sub and exit.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.960
Now. Now let's call the concat method,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.775
which will pass two parameters,

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:29.490
hello and the second, honest.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.910
Now you can see that I'm later result.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.395
Right?

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:39.590
So again, I'm going for editing,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.645
I'm going dated concat process again.

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:45.320
Now I want to update the concat pastors,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.055
which contains three elements I'm in inputs.

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:51.155
I'm going to do the same thing.

00:01:51.155 --> 00:01:53.255
Just accept.

00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:58.235
Here you can see the method modified notification and exit.

00:01:58.235 --> 00:02:01.020
And now we can call them a term,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.320
Hello World and run a parameter test.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.960
So now we got the mountain has been updated properly.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:21.665
But then I'm trying to update something through this Swing application, that swing panel.

00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:23.870
It is not comfortable for me,

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.090
so I want to use my own X and eta.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.140
Eta, you have Notepad Plus, Plus or Notepad.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.970
So which you feel comfortable.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.630
Okay.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.980
So we can modify or J shell to tell.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.540
Whenever I'm doing editing,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.150
do not open the string Bannon.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.725
This open my extra return.

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:44.840
Okay, Let's do that.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.715
So how are we going to do that?

00:02:46.715 --> 00:02:51.005
Again, we're going to use the hell parameters set C,

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:52.910
if you want to know, use help.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.610
And that you can find something called the set data here,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.800
C, set it there.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.235
And the part of the editor.

00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:03.380
For now what we're going to do,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.435
I'm going to use the notepad.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.085
So the way I need to do it,

00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:11.225
set editor and I need to provide that part.

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:14.675
So what I'm going to use Notepad.

00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:17.870
So just right-click go to Properties.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.440
Just try to find which location it is trying to hit.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.209
Just copy the path and paste parade Notepad application.

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.190
Here you can make changes.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.845
Here that you can conquer process.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.705
You can modify the method name,

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:37.630
or you can delete something,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.889
or you can add something also for the application.

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.350
Here you can make changes, okay,

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.200
that you can concat passes are you can modify

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.325
the method name or you can delete something,

00:03:51.325 --> 00:03:53.500
or you can add something also.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.090
For example, string, say my name.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.410
String S. Which will it done?

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.140
Yes.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.415
Save it. Once you save it,

00:04:13.415 --> 00:04:17.869
you will have the notification here, method creator.

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:20.360
And if your update something here,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.079
when you save it, you will see them at unmodified.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:25.550
And I want to remove this.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.660
I'm in, I'm in, I'm again,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.700
I'm doing something in other Madonna.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.445
I'm saving it Now. See I created a new Math.random littered the existing two methods.

00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:37.820
So yeah, now you can close them better and then you can call

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.580
them say my name and say Ming.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.090
My name, and the name is John.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.520
So this is how we need to make use of the letter,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:04.460
but do not engage with some big IDEs like Eclipse or NetBeans or IntelliJ.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.605
Because those are heavy loaded component.

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:09.680
We have this trying for some snippet of coding, right?

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.150
We don't need those ideas.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.245
Just make guitar node parent or even Notepad Plus, Plus much better already.

00:05:16.245 --> 00:05:21.650
Okay? So in the next session we are going to

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.109
discuss about how we are going to use the autocomplete.

00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:29.210
Autocomplete, which we already discussed to

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.035
hear nothing but when you're trying to use that tab,

00:05:33.035 --> 00:05:35.225
automatically try to fill it out.

00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:37.100
Okay. We'll discuss in the next video.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.610
Thank you.
