00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.150
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.355
So before we are moving into the module graph,

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:11.040
let's talk about something else.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.725
So the jar model becomes the modular model right now.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:21.329
Okay, So what happened to our JRE, our Java JDK?

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.655
Because our JDK itself, it's,

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:26.790
it's dependent, it depends on lot of JAR files, right?

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.250
When you go back to your Java in submission folder,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.900
you will have the bin folder in itemset,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.450
the mean, you'll have lot of JAR files in it.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.510
So how come that is part of Java itself,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.325
it is not modularized.

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:42.280
Then how I'm going to follow the module, because they are 19.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.390
Java itself, it's changed as a modular programming.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.990
So let's take a look at the, the IEP document.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:59.630
I mean, Java 9 module, API doc.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.530
So that you'll have a clear idea. So what happened?

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.885
But before that, let me open up

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:09.500
my installation directory and I'll show you

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.860
how the Java's place right now in a yellow line.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.950
So here's my nine.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.430
And see here, normally we have been inside,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.730
we have a lib folder where you can see all the Java files,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.725
but now nothing's here.

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:28.940
And normally you will find something called RD, RD,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.770
that JAR file data runtime dot jar file,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.470
which contains our own 64 MB or 44 MB.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.710
It is not there because I don't have any jar here because

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.175
everything has been changed into modular modules.

00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:41.315
So how would it happen?

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.135
So that is a new folder called j modes here.

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:51.545
See every jars, each and every jar dependency has been changed into a module version.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:53.525
All right, So everything has been,

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:56.540
here's a module and here are our biggest.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.340
By default, Java gives you a lot of default classes, right?

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.345
And default classes, those are converted into modules here.

00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:08.720
And by default it's 98 packages here. I'm in modules here.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.090
And there are some excellent well so that we'll talk about it.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.880
And this is the article document.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.315
I mean now Java nine API document.

00:02:17.315 --> 00:02:20.195
And here there is something called module.

00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:22.820
So this is introduced in Java.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.170
Let's go back.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.510
Let's go down here and we'll see there are different clips.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.250
Click the model and see what is there in the module.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.030
Okay, here.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.995
So the model graph,

00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:44.150
and here is the packages Java that I will, java.lang.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.285
These are traditional default packages.

00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:50.900
These are our default classes, okay?

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.609
These are all now comes under Java that base.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.905
So if you want to access the hour at Iowa java.lang,

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:05.495
you need to require shower and base since it is a default one,

00:03:05.495 --> 00:03:07.235
you don't have to explicitly

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:10.220
requires our AT base because by default it is available to you

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.800
by JP MS. Let's see what is the different theorem.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.600
Okay, so he says and he uses,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.750
Let's go back to Overview and see what are the packages and how it is Canada.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.645
So the entire the default classes

00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:41.440
and everything has been converted into three different models.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.805
One is Java SE and JDK and Java effects again.

00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:47.980
So let's go and take over Java.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.150
These are the Java SE is

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.605
a standard JAR file which you will use on a day-to-day basis programs.

00:03:53.605 --> 00:03:55.750
And let Chicago Wanda,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.890
one commonly used Java day C Standard Edition.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.860
Okay, so let's open the API and we'll see

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.830
the Java compiler desktop the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.725
hour at logging everything that they say eat and everything,

00:04:09.725 --> 00:04:14.135
it's a package are inside the packet.

00:04:14.135 --> 00:04:16.654
You'll have a different kind of classes

00:04:16.654 --> 00:04:19.790
because packet is nothing but as a collection of classes, right?

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.490
So Zhao day school and everything is,

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.010
comes under Java dot MSC.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.135
But you can see something here, modular graph.

00:04:32.135 --> 00:04:37.235
So which will tell you how the model has been defined.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:40.535
So Java that AC is the parent level.

00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:42.710
And at the parent level we have Java SQL,

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.439
LOTRO sit, and our XML.

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.295
And this is the way how it has been defined.

00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:53.870
Okay, The way how maybe while you're looking at the diagram at the first time,

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.615
it might be like, what the hell is that?

00:04:56.615 --> 00:04:59.270
But when you keep understanding the concept,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.410
you'll realize that, okay,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.970
this is how the packet is looks like.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.765
So everything is segregated into a separate, separate modules.

00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:09.320
So the default things will be loaded into

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.420
a submodule and some SQL stuff has been modelled into something else.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.895
And everything comes at the hour at AC.

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:22.925
And there are some additional packages also which Zhao FXS and Java JDK.

00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:26.270
So the basically the one thing that you need to keep in mind that

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.960
Java itself it becomes the modular programming model.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.065
Verdi did not want to use the traditional way of char dependency center.

00:05:36.065 --> 00:05:40.865
Okay, so let's start off with a simple example.

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:43.610
I'm, let me create a simple example of do which will show you,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.185
which will create a 2 module.

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:50.760
And we'll try to access both of them with the help of model.py in for a Java file.
