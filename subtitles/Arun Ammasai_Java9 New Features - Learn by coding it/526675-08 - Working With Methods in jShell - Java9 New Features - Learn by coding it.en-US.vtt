00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Hello developers, welcome back.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.770
In this session we're going to talk about the metaphors we tried once.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.550
Let's try something. Let's talk about something briefly.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.210
Okay?

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.555
So how they're going to write a method interior shell,

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:19.050
it is pretty much same thing how we are doing in a shower also wide.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.180
So Madison say hi.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.140
And which will tell you,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.520
it's just printing the system dot out, dot print line.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.590
And this says hi.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.750
Okay, so the method is creator.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.110
Now.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.770
We know how to call them at that just simply calling the high metallic,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.970
just type say and try to click Tab it automatically out of the lead.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.925
So the output is high.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:03.150
So let's try this keyword methods.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.230
This is the method which will show you what are the methods we created so far.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.315
Okay, let me try the same one.

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:13.700
Interrupt, say hi.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.450
I'm going to say Hello.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.900
So here I'm going to modify the data.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.260
Hello, Crater, the metallic say hello, let's try them.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.980
Attach no, no. It will show you two methods,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.705
but I want to know the number also.

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:37.385
So what we can do just to list the one,

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:40.880
number one is creating the first method and the second

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.350
is calling the same method and thoroughness creating another Matata.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.210
Okay, now what I can do is just to call it again,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.165
it is just considered as a normal variable.

00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:58.805
So it will print the data and it's stored into another variable.

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:00.140
So basically what I'm trying to do,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.890
I'm trying to call the step number two.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.805
All right, so what we can do list space,

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:10.565
and now you need to provide the second.

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:13.340
Now it will call the say hi method.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.465
I mean, it'll show you the what is list number two,

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:19.400
which is to say hi method.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.650
So now we created us, honor them at all.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.515
So let's try to call this, say hello Madonna.

00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:26.360
So when you click the tab,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.740
it will show you what are the suggestions.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.380
We have a say hello matter and we have a say hi matter.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.630
I'm going to say hello matter.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.220
So we got it.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.200
Let's try something else here.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.185
Because so far what the method which I have written,

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:43.670
which contains only one and a number,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.755
what will happen if I have multiple numbers?

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:48.035
I cannot write everything in a single lane, right?

00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:50.030
Because the shell is intelligent enough to

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.360
identify what is a line ending and what is the method ending?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.935
What is the class ending? Okay?

00:02:54.935 --> 00:03:02.825
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to call another method, concat.

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:06.260
Concat to data.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.940
I mean two variables.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.570
Okay?

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.435
So string a, Come on.

00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:20.480
And B, and open the curly brackets, just press Enter.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.440
See now it is not started executing because when he opened the curly braces,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.785
the shell knows that it is not finished yet.

00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:29.165
It is going to be continued.

00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:29.870
Okay?

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.265
So what I'm gonna do just providing system,

00:03:34.265 --> 00:03:40.835
dot out, dot, print, print LN.

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:44.550
And let's provide some output here.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:54.755
Is gonna be a plus b.

00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:56.810
And now the colon,

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.700
if you enter again still,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.795
your shell knows that program note ends.

00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:06.530
But when you close the curly braces, now utilize, okay,

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.260
I gotta metonym and I got the parameters and I also have

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.620
a open and close parentheses curly braces.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.470
So that means the method is finished.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.945
Now let's call them and talk.

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:22.175
When you see and click down,

00:04:22.175 --> 00:04:26.510
you'll get them concurred passes.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.660
And now we have to provide them inputs.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.880
So I'm going to do hello.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.090
And second parameter is going to be watered.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.670
So now we've got that Excel does Hello world.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.310
Okay? So this is pretty simple.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.860
Okay, so I can create a method in a single line.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.180
Now I need to know,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.650
now I know how to create a method in jail with a multiple lengths.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.445
Okay?

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:57.440
But if you want to edit something,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.080
for example, we have a concat classes, right?

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.430
So I want to edit.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.230
This isn't an order print l and r.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.820
I want to add some more,

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.550
or I want to add one more input in it.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.150
Okay?

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.335
So what I needed to, I need to use the navigation scheme to narrow down.

00:05:12.335 --> 00:05:16.895
I'm pressing keyboard Up Arrow,

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:18.935
keep moving forward and backward.

00:05:18.935 --> 00:05:20.570
So now this is a metonym.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.960
I'm 10 ADA under that string here,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.790
string C, I want to add shading.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.560
See also, right, so now what we can do,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.720
it's called up and guard.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.985
And here I'm still using the upper good I mean the upkeep.

00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:41.150
And then close brackets.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.960
Now, the matter is greater than, okay.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.000
So now what will happen?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.950
Let us see the methods.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.935
Now it's considered as a another matter.

00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:58.380
Right? What I want to edit it.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.070
So how we can do that?

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.880
Okay, so how I can edit a method and also how I

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.055
can edit the same code in an external editor, right?

00:06:13.055 --> 00:06:16.560
That is what we are going to discuss in the next video. Thank you.
