00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.020
We're going to talk about another important concept, religion,

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.190
Java 9, which is nothing but the factory methods.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.890
So what is faculty mentors and why do we need them?

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.735
So in Java and the,

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:19.140
one other major important thing that isn't the factor method introduced to

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.115
create an unmodified able collections.

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:24.450
So what is unmodified?

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.425
Like?

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.405
We all know that right?

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:30.300
Immutable. Immutable pink.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.930
So how to create a mutable collection with a hairball factory methods.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.655
So that is a measure important reason it was added in Java name.

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:40.975
So creating on multifamily collection.

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:46.445
And then, so what is the advantage when I'm creating a non-modifiable or collections.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.559
The first thing, the memory utilization.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.360
So we don't have to keep on creating a new,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.880
new objects for each and every time.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.130
And when you're decreasing creating object,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.055
obviously at performance will get improved.

00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:06.125
And then reusability of the existing objects or existing collections.

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:09.890
In order to create a new collection or create new objects,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.645
we could use them and we can continue our coding.

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:23.450
And three major collections we are going to talk about list, set and map.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.140
So before we are jumping into what exactly the faculty mentors

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.350
and now let's talk about what is list and what is it and what is mapped.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.790
Let me open a notepad here.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.765
Okay, Let's talk about something here.

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:37.430
So first thing, list.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.300
So I'm assuming everyone knows what is a list.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:49.910
List is a collection of collection of data or you can call them as the object,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.310
are some items, so whatever it is called,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.630
so some group of data or objects or items is called as a collection.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.755
Right?

00:01:57.755 --> 00:01:59.975
So what is there in the collection?

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:01.250
So when you are creating collection,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.620
for example, if you're creating a list collection.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.340
So the one important thing, duplicates are allowed.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.190
If you're creating an ArrayList,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.905
we are able to create a duplicate values.

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:19.830
And on another important thing, the insertion order.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.870
Insertion order, sorry, preserved.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.530
So these are the three important things which you know about list

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.595
before we are jumping into how non-modifiable is going to work.

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:41.315
And another thing, it is pretty much like an ArrayList, but what?

00:02:41.315 --> 00:02:42.890
It does differ.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.220
The first thing you do with the opposite do collection.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.435
I mean collection.

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:51.620
So duplicates are not

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.625
allowed and doesn't military in certain order.

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:06.425
Not preserved here. Right?

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:08.600
So what is the next thing?

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:17.410
So what does map? Map is key and value pair.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.030
So this is all we need to know.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.780
Basically, even if you don't have any idea what list to collections and right,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.700
so before jumping into the exact concept,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.795
just have an overview idea about what is list and what is said,

00:03:28.795 --> 00:03:30.835
and what is mapping, how would this looks like?

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:35.260
And now we're going to go back to our slides and then we'll talk

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.710
about what is the important need of an modifiable collection.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.330
Let me give you a simple example.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.990
Let's assume I have a license registration system.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.570
Okay, so I have a state of Virginia.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.980
So in Virginia, for example,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.335
we have a 1 million applicants.

00:03:53.335 --> 00:03:54.595
Right?

00:03:54.595 --> 00:03:57.010
So I have an application 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.645
and Abdul, 1 million applicants.

00:03:59.645 --> 00:04:04.130
All of them are using Virginia object or Virginia collection.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.175
So Virginia is a state that people are used to are 1 million people.

00:04:09.175 --> 00:04:11.060
1 million people are using the Virginia.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.450
Okay.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.240
What happened if I'm following the applicant for so he is he wants

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.940
to update his state to

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.255
Virginia to or reach model something are some of the different state.

00:04:23.255 --> 00:04:27.320
So when he tries to update the Virginia into another state,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.325
what happened there instead of 1 million applicant will be impacted.

00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:33.665
That is a huge problem, right?

00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:38.630
So if we allow them to modify a collection or an object,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.415
it's going to be a problem.

00:04:40.415 --> 00:04:42.500
So just to motivate one obligation,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.395
I had to impact the 1 million applicants,

00:04:45.395 --> 00:04:47.615
which is not a right way, do it.

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:50.180
So what is the right approach here?

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.485
Is applicant for anyone to want some different state,

00:04:54.485 --> 00:04:57.290
he has to use the different object,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.430
not the Virginia one.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.020
So similarly, we will have the another object which holds the number of people,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.510
number of applicants, enrichment,

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.025
or some other different states.

00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:13.820
So he has to go and adapt that particular object, right?

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.500
So just keep that in mind.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.530
And let, let me open up

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.650
Eclipse and I'll show you some sample programs are which is going to work.
