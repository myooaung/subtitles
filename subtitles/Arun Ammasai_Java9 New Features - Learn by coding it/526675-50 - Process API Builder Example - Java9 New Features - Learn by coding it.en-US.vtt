00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.165
Let's try another example.

00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:06.340
So we are going to get into Java files,

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.170
one for compelled to other Java file.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.965
Okay?

00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:14.740
So I'm going to create a new Java file here.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:25.430
Then process compel example.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.980
Okay, So this is what I'm going to use to compel the another Java file.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.875
So I want to cut down on the devil fail,

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:36.955
where I can write something.

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:40.585
Gets to file this class, this class.

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:42.435
So let me have a main method in it.

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:45.080
I want to put some content in it, okay,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.380
so I can now say that outcome, right?

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.305
So what I wanted, I'm, I'm, I'm just going to use some AWT frames here.

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:56.490
Frame.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.080
And it's going to be a new frame.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.030
You and I'm not familiar with the frames,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.980
but just creating a simple one.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.195
Frame. Dot add.

00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:10.160
And what we can add in settings,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.330
they're going to allocate.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.650
Let's create a new label inside it,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.490
a label, and just pass some data.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.915
Okay, welcome to process API.

00:01:24.915 --> 00:01:25.975
Okay.

00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:29.140
And then let's, whenever you create a frames,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.865
we need to set the size also.

00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:38.199
It's been a while I worked on sorry, an inability.

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:41.575
I'm going to use four hundred and four hundred pixels frame

00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:46.550
and make sure the recipient is true.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.785
Okay, so now I have done the glossary.

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:52.690
So I'm not going to run this particular class.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.070
So what I'm going to do,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.920
I'm going to use the process builder compiler example

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.315
class to compile this class and execute this.

00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:05.840
Okay, let's try that. So let me write a main method here.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.390
So let's see. Let's copy the process builder from here so it can be easy.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:25.250
The process builder. And then so what is a comment which we use to compile a Java file?

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.475
It is nothing but it's a Java C, Java compiler.

00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:30.860
And then what are the file I'm going to use?

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.050
It is going to test class that Java class that.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:44.100
But before that, let me run that Aeschylus Java and show you what is the outcome of it.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.070
It is taking a while.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.670
Yeah.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.765
Got it.

00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:53.990
See, this SAW simple frame.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.300
So it won't close it in a desktop, done compiling.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.365
Okay, so now we know that how this matter I'm going to walk.

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:05.975
So it will simply create a frame.

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:08.975
It'll show some ticks in it.

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:12.050
Okay, so now let's do that here.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.330
So what I'm gonna do, Baylor,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:27.035
builder dot, sorry, start right.

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:32.430
So now when, when your exception.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.470
So now we know when we're underscore what happened.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.035
Obviously, the code will be compiled.

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:43.925
So the another thing we need to execute also,

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:47.345
right, let's copy the entire thing.

00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:50.780
So here I'm going to rename it I sub b,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.780
r1, r1, that start.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.030
And here I'm going to use Java and you're not going to use that gallery.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.200
It's just a class village.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.495
So test class.

00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:08.195
When an unlimited we should be expecting AWT,

00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:10.670
I mean, simple frame, right?

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.220
That's right leg and run it.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.930
Hopefully it'll work.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.450
Okay, so something is wrong, it is not working.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.130
So we need to check what is wrong.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.500
This is pretty simple, it is working,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.715
but here is the process builder disclosure Java, which has to work.

00:04:36.715 --> 00:04:42.050
So when I run the score that aren't getting any error also.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.640
So when you wrote me the AWT, what will happen?

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.095
You need to close it properly.

00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:48.640
But the way our closed,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.905
I just opened the frame and directly close the compiler.

00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:57.795
The compiler. So obviously the AW has been closed.

00:04:57.795 --> 00:05:00.410
So I was thinking that is causing that issue for now

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:10.650
what I'm going to give me a minute.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.760
Okay.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:36.210
So again, just right-click.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.520
And some things are going on in the background.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.050
Redness. Obligation.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.665
That is summation, which is not opening till now.

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:08.620
Let me run the test class again.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:17.560
I click S, the one which was four.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.585
Okay, it is working here.

00:06:19.585 --> 00:06:21.145
Okay.

00:06:21.145 --> 00:06:24.045
So for some reason it is not to initiate.

00:06:24.045 --> 00:06:26.930
She now I'm not able to close it because it will not work because you need

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:34.400
to stop the dominate the process.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.825
Okay, So now let me then the method again.

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:41.820
Let's see what that is running.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.030
Okay, So there's no issues.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.650
We can stop it, no issues at all. So what is wrong here?

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:59.310
So everything looks pretty much like Java application or it may take some more time.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.185
Okay.

00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:09.395
It's eight, it started but it was behind my Eclipse.

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:11.180
So that is why we're not able to see it here,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.475
but an to all tap I can see it here.

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:14.660
Right?

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:23.210
So this is a way how we can create a one process with the help of process builder.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.185
So whatever you're doing in any operating system or any missions,

00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:30.755
now, we don't have a VD chunk of code.

00:07:30.755 --> 00:07:35.945
We can use a simple builder to create your own process with the help of person builder.

00:07:35.945 --> 00:07:41.075
So now we created a simple AWT appart frame.

00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:43.190
So you can try something else also,

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.610
you can pass some list of elements and we can do different, different operations.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.340
Create your own process lake,

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.480
create the junk of a Java files and create another file which

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.935
will compare all the Java files in a particular folder locations.

00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:02.095
We can do that, right?

00:08:02.095 --> 00:08:06.415
Just try with some different example and let me know.

00:08:06.415 --> 00:08:08.634
But most of the scenario,

00:08:08.634 --> 00:08:11.500
we will never end up with working with the process builder because it's,

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.195
it's pretty much working with machines are different platforms.

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:20.560
But getting, getting to know how the process is going to work on how

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.090
we can make use of it when we really needed.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.690
Okay.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.000
Just try and let me know if you have any clarification. Thank you.
