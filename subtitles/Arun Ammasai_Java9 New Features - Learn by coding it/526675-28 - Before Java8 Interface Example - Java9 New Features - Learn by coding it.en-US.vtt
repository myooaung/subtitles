00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.690
So let me clear the code.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.260
Let's start coding.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.135
So what I'm gonna do,

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:12.045
I'm gonna normally interface.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:21.630
Interface. Interface. I'm going

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.070
to create a matter here.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:34.270
Welcome. And I'll have another method called say hi.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.040
They should accept that.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.615
Okay, so now I have my interface which I'm going to,

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:52.640
I'm going to create a new class files which implements this particular interfaces, right?

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.545
So I'm going to create a new class here.

00:00:54.545 --> 00:01:04.820
So interface example,

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.510
one,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.574
finish and create two more classes.

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:16.200
Interface, java.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.675
Create a new analytic lands.

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:23.825
And let's have it as an imidazole interface three.

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:28.565
So now I have one simple interface and I have three different classes.

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:31.550
So I am going to implement in all the classes.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:40.220
So in example one implements interface one, right?

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.930
So obviously what happened when you are implementing some interface,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.930
we have to provide the explanations, write our implementations.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.465
So just while we're at the methods,

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:52.910
you don't have property and implementations here.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.205
So we can do it later.

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:57.785
And I'm gonna do the same thing here.

00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:01.940
Implements phase 1.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.340
So again, we are going to provide

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.300
the implementation and I'm going to do the same thing here.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.430
So the reason why I'm telling you here,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.850
what is the problem with earlier versions of interface,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.480
interface 1 and poverty implementation?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.260
Now we are good.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.045
So now we have our interface which,

00:02:20.045 --> 00:02:22.700
which implemented by three other classes.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.440
So we're good to go.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.385
So I can create an object and I can use the methods like ME create a main method here.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:34.250
So I'm going to call anyone whether I'm going to use a interferes example,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.615
one interface example.

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:44.480
And I1 is equal to mu Example 1.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.950
So just to print something,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.150
I'm going to add something here

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.790
and here.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:14.100
And so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to call them a welcome.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.270
Oh sorry. I1. I1 dot welcome.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.650
And I'm going to call the next material.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.870
So I1 dot say,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.140
hi, and I'm going to pass them into John.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.270
Okay, so now I can learn the class,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.970
just run it and which we're able to see the outcome here.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.405
So we got welcome matter and also we got done.

00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:49.265
Will come Mr. John.

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:54.110
Okay, So this is how our interface will walk, right?

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.870
So why we moved into Zhao it and we add our default and static methods.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.895
Okay, let's take a simple example.

00:04:01.895 --> 00:04:04.700
I'm going to have some changes in my interface.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.530
For example, I might need to add one more matter like wide,

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.710
our string method in our example.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.655
The Discharge employee or whatever it is, automatic.

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:23.880
I don't have any name right now, so I'm just keeping it as a matatu.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.830
Okay, So now what is happening?

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.950
So you added a method in your interface.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.835
But those changes will only required by the interface example one class,

00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:39.365
for example, you have a gyro,

00:04:39.365 --> 00:04:44.255
you have an interface which you provided two different kinds of clients.

00:04:44.255 --> 00:04:49.070
But only one claim need one numerator needs to be added in the interface.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.390
But when you add it,

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.180
it's going to impact all the implementations.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.795
Even though they needed or not.

00:04:56.795 --> 00:04:59.495
They how to implement the new,

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:01.400
newly added my dot.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.920
So that is going to be a huge issue, right?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.860
When you're, when you're talking about you have an interface.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.310
It has a thousands or millions of people who he implemented the class.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.450
If you make one change, millions of people have to make a change so that it's a huge.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.025
So that is the reason why it comes up with the default and static modality,

00:05:19.025 --> 00:05:22.410
which we will discuss in the next session.
