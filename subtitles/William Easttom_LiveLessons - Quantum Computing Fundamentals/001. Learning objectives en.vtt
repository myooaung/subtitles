00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.010
- Welcome to lesson one.

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.240
Now, this is very important

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.090
because this is going
to create the foundation

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.070
for the rest of what we do.

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.920
Many of you may have never
had a linear algebra course,

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.710
some of you have, but it's
been so long you forgot.

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.080
Don't worry, we're not
gonna overwhelm you,

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.940
you won't have to do mathematical proofs,

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.860
and we won't be giving you homework.

10
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.930
The idea is to give you fundamental,

11
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.030
basic linear algebra skills

12
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.593
so that later when we talk about things

13
00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:36.300
like quantum gates, quantum
algorithms, quantum programming,

14
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.330
that you have the mathematical
skills to do that.

15
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.090
Now, don't be shy going
through this lesson.

16
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.090
You may need to pause, repeat, rewind,

17
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.350
and go over some things a few
times to really get them down,

18
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.140
but it's certainly something
all of you can learn.

19
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.450
It's relatively simple mathematics,

20
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.210
but it's essential for
understanding quantum computing.

21
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.683
So let's get started.
