00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.510
- Hello, my name is Dr. Chuck Easttom.

2
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.180
Welcome to my quantum computing class.

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.790
Let me start with a
little bit about myself.

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.070
First of all, I've been
obsessed with education.

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.260
I have three doctoral degrees

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.730
in cybersecurity, computer
science, and nanotechnology.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.940
I also have three master's
degrees including education,

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.390
applied computer science,
and systems engineering.

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.450
I've written several books,
37 as of this recording,

10
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.260
and I'm an adjunct teaching
cryptography for Georgetown,

11
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.963
and quantum computing for Vanderbilt.

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.050
What's the goal of this course?

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.660
Well, obviously, quantum
computing is a huge topic,

14
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.360
that's why there are hundreds
of books on the topic.

15
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.690
Not all of it could be
covered in any single course,

16
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.660
but what I've found out in the
real world, in the industry,

17
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.880
there are lots of
people, technical people,

18
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.470
sometimes programmers, managers,
network administrators,

19
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.130
that want to get that
foundational, general understanding

20
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.020
of quantum computing.

21
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.790
That's what this course is for.

22
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.654
If you're seeking that general foundation,

23
00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:12.750
this course will do it for you.

24
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.010
Now, if you want to go deeper,

25
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.540
this course will give you the basics

26
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.790
so that you can go deeper.

27
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.100
Furthermore, we don't really
assume any prior knowledge

28
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.330
on your part.

29
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.040
We're going to start with lesson one,

30
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.650
going over basic
mathematics you will need,

31
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.070
things like basic linear
algebra, complex numbers,

32
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.333
and related topics.

33
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.520
Then in lesson two,

34
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.610
we're going to talk
about the basic physics

35
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.293
behind quantum computing.

36
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.600
Lesson three will take us into
physical and logical qubits,

37
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.753
how they're done, how they're
manipulated, how they work.

38
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.090
Lesson four will take us
into circuits, algorithms,

39
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.350
things of that nature.

40
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.320
We'll look at four specific
quantum algorithms.

41
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.080
Lesson five, we're going to
talk about the relationship

42
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.830
between cryptography
and quantum computing.

43
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.570
Finally, in lesson six,

44
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.020
you're going to learn some
very basic quantum programming.

45
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.990
The idea is that when you
finished all six lessons,

46
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.540
you have that foundational
quantum computing knowledge,

47
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.880
which again, may be
sufficient for some of you,

48
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.400
and it may be just the
beginning for others.

49
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.420
Also understand that any topic
we cover in these six lessons

50
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.620
could obviously be covered in
deeper and broader fashion.

51
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.170
Our goal is to not make you
the world's leading expert

52
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.400
in quantum computing,

53
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.587
but to make you competent
so you understand

54
00:02:31.587 --> 00:02:34.890
and you can at least ask good questions.

55
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.823
Let's get started.
