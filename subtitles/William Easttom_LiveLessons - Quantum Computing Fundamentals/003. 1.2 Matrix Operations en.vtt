00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.930
- Now that we've covered
some basics of matrices,

2
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.790
we're going to get to
some more interesting

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.000
and unfortunately more
complicated operations.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.650
Let me give you a little piece of advice

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.840
when going through this entire course.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.670
Do not rush through it.

7
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.020
It's not a race.

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.530
So if you're not totally
comfortable with lesson 1.1,

9
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.190
maybe you review it
before you move into 1.2.

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.930
And that should hold for all the lessons

11
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.070
throughout this course.

12
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.440
Get really comfortable with one thing,

13
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.620
and then the next thing is
going to be a lot easier.

14
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
Now, this is an interesting topic,

15
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.470
the determinant of a matrix.

16
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.930
Frankly, when I teach this to students,

17
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.090
at universities and other settings,

18
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.870
most people master the
process relatively easy.

19
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.667
But what gets you is you wonder why,

20
00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:57.540
"Okay, I did all this.
What can I do with it?"

21
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.060
Unfortunately, we're going
to have to set the why

22
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.080
to one side.

23
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.420
We're going to see uses of determinants

24
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.070
quite frequently later on.

25
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.683
For now, let's just
understand how to get it.

26
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.370
The determinant of a matrix is denoted

27
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.690
by the two vertical lines

28
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.120
around whatever letter is
representing the matrix,

29
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.053
in this case A.

30
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.090
So if I have a two by
two matrix, A, B, C, D,

31
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.590
the determinant is found by
simply multiplying A times D

32
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.270
minus B times C.

33
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.330
And here at the bottom we have
a concrete example of that.

34
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.660
So the determinant of the
matrix of the bottom is one.

35
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.420
Now, I'm certain all of
you easily grasp that

36
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.550
and could calculate that fairly easy

37
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.890
for any two by two matrix.

38
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.360
But you may be wondering why.

39
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.930
Again, keep that to one
side for just a moment.

40
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.630
It gets a bit more complex
when we start talking

41
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.640
about three by three matrices.

42
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.230
There are lots of formulas out there,

43
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.310
the Laplace formula,

44
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.680
the Leibniz formula, the Sarrus' scheme,

45
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.300
all of them operate in a different way,

46
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.300
but end up getting the same determinant.

47
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.983
So what are determinants used for?

48
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.340
First of all, they're used to calculate

49
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.470
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

50
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.560
Now, that might bring up more
questions than it answered.

51
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.870
We're going to use
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

52
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.190
throughout this course,

53
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.320
so you're going to get
very comfortable with them.

54
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.810
So don't worry about that just yet.

55
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.270
It can also be used to determine

56
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.340
if the matrix has an inverse.

57
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.610
Determinants can also
be used in ascertaining

58
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.220
whether or not a system of n equations

59
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.770
in n unknowns has a solution.

60
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.970
Put another way,

61
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.100
when you use matrices in linear algebra

62
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.110
for their original purpose,

63
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.390
solving systems of linear equations,

64
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.810
it can be a bit of a task to solve that.

65
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.980
Well, let's first find out

66
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.600
if there is a solution of
n equations and n unknowns

67
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.940
before we waste time trying to find it.

68
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.950
It may be that there is no solution.

69
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.800
Now, as I said, there are
lots of different methods

70
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.740
for calculating the determinant
of a three by three matrix.

71
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.780
We're going to use just one.

72
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.910
Now, for those of you
who have had exposure

73
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.110
to linear algebra,

74
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.480
you might have used a
different method than this.

75
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.540
But I would suggest when we
get to a concrete example,

76
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.570
you compare our method to the
method you previously learned,

77
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.840
and I believe you'll find they
both give the same answer.

78
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.710
What we basically do is we
divide the three by three matrix

79
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.470
into three different two by two matrices.

80
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.320
We take the lower right hand corner,

81
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.940
you see that on the left,

82
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.250
the lower left hand corner
you see on the far right,

83
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.390
and in the middle we take
basically the far left bottom two

84
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.010
and the far right bottom two,

85
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.253
and we make those into
two by two matrices.

86
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.400
And then we go through them

87
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.920
calculating the determinant of each one

88
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.940
and using a little addition,
subtraction to combine those.

89
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.850
Now, later you'll see
some concrete examples.

90
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.160
Before we get to that, another topic

91
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.000
you're going to see a lot, a dot product.

92
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.710
Now, we've used the term vector a lot

93
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.820
and I think you know what it means,

94
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.650
but let's make sure you do.

95
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.050
A vector is basically a
matrix that's a single row

96
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.103
or single column.

97
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.530
Now, there's some interesting properties

98
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.240
of these vectors.

99
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.190
Like the determinant of a square matrix

100
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.330
that gives us information,

101
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.170
the dot product of two vectors
gives us some information.

102
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.500
Basically, the dot product is taking

103
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.380
the elements of the two vectors,

104
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.750
multiplying them together,
and adding up those sums.

105
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.270
As you see here, I first
multiply one times three

106
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.940
then two times two, then one times one

107
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.850
and I calculate the final
answer, which is eight.

108
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.200
So the dot product of
these two vectors is eight.

109
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.320
Now, if two vectors are orthogonal,

110
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.180
that means they're
perpendicular to each other,

111
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.400
they come together like this,

112
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.240
and the unit length is one,

113
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.160
we call those orthonormal.

114
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.460
That's going to show up a lot
in quantum-based algorithms.

115
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.560
Now, the dot product is
essentially giving you

116
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.343
a single number from two vectors.

117
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.670
Basically, we look at two matrices,

118
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.260
and produce a single number

119
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.630
and there's a lot of
practical uses for that.

120
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.280
I'll give you one right now.

121
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.220
If I take vectors X and
Y, and we're called,

122
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.600
we're looking at them as vectors,

123
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.730
but we could have plotted them out

124
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.860
on a Cartesian coordinate system.

125
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.980
Well, it turns out that
the cosine of the angle

126
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.310
between those two vectors
is the dot product

127
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.250
divided by the length of
X times the length of Y.

128
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.980
If the two dot product is zero,

129
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.440
then the two vectors are
actually perpendicular.

130
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.450
Remember I said a moment ago,

131
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.580
we're looking sometimes for vectors

132
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.070
that are orthogonal or perpendicular.

133
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.930
Well, if their dot product is zero

134
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.350
I already know that they're
perpendicular or orthogonal

135
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.150
and I don't have to
plot it out on a graph.

136
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.450
I know it immediately
based on the dot product.

137
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.810
Now, tensor product is
a little more complex.

138
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.760
We're not going to get a
single number out of it,

139
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.200
we're going going to get a vector.

140
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.810
But what we do is we essentially multiply

141
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.390
every single element in the first vector

142
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.913
times every single element
in the second vector.

143
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.490
So it looks something like this.

144
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.950
We end up with a new
vector that's actually

145
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.560
a length equal to the
two separate vectors.

146
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.483
This is called a tensor product.
