00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.470
- Hello.

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.200
You're all here to learn
about quantum computing,

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.570
but before we can dive into that topic

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.970
we have to start with
some preliminary subjects,

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.943
for example, linear algebra
for quantum computing.

6
00:00:17.943 --> 00:00:19.500
Now, don't panic.

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.890
We're not gonna require you
to do mathematical proofs

8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.260
and we're not going to give you homework.

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.860
The goal is to give you
just enough linear algebra

10
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.720
so that later when we're applying this

11
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.270
in quantum physics and quantum computing,

12
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.890
you can follow along.

13
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.123
So let's jump right in.

14
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.290
We'll start with some
basics of linear algebra,

15
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.450
what it is, what it was developed for,

16
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.870
and how we're going to
use it in this course.

17
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.940
The first thing about linear algebra

18
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.270
is it was actually developed,
as the name suggests,

19
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.480
to solve systems of linear equations,

20
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.250
but people discovered
there were other things

21
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.690
you could do with it.

22
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.330
In fact, what we're
going to be doing with it

23
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.950
really has nothing to do with solving

24
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.930
linear sets of equations.

25
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.480
What we're going to do is basically

26
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.850
represent things as a matrix.

27
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.470
It's basically a set of elements

28
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.270
organized into rows and columns.

29
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.940
And we can treat these matrices

30
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.550
like numbers, like operators,

31
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.260
all sorts of things we can do with them

32
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.270
that you're going to see
throughout this course.

33
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.340
Now, there are some
special types of matrices

34
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.080
you should be familiar with.

35
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.540
There's the column matrix
and the row matrix.

36
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.300
Those are fairly self-explanatory.

37
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.300
A square matrix, the same
number of rows and columns.

38
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.190
Two matrices are considered equal

39
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.910
only if they have the same
number of rows and columns

40
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.270
and the same elements in
those rows and columns.

41
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.110
A zero matrix may seem trivial,
but it is used occasionally.

42
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.290
It basically is a matrix
that contains all zeros.

43
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.060
Now there's some basic operations.

44
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.620
Some of these are easy,

45
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.320
for example addition and subtraction.

46
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.420
You do it just the way you did

47
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.633
addition and subtraction
back in elementary school.

48
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.350
You simply add or subtract
each of the elements.

49
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.260
So you start with the top left
element in the first matrix

50
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.750
and add or subtract it

51
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.770
to the top left element in the second.

52
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.270
And you continue through them all,

53
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.520
as you can see on the screen.

54
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.310
Multiplying gets a little bit different.

55
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.940
We're going to first
multiply the first element,

56
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.480
first top left-hand corner
of each of the matrices.

57
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.710
Then we're going to get the
second element in the first row

58
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.040
of the first matrix and multiply it

59
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.640
times the second element
in the first column

60
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.173
of the second matrix.

61
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.260
We're going to continue this process.

62
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.270
We'll take the first element

63
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.490
in the first row of the first matrix

64
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.660
and then multiply it
times the first element

65
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.240
in the second column of the second matrix.

66
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.180
Then we're going to
take the second element

67
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.027
in the first row of the first matrix

68
00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:59.820
and multiply it times the second element

69
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.880
in the second column of the second matrix.

70
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.660
Now rather than try to
memorize all this stuff,

71
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.100
if you think about it for a moment

72
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.040
and you'll reflect on
what we see on the screen,

73
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.730
what you're actually doing
is multiplying the rows

74
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.350
in the first column by the
columns in the second matrix.

75
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.240
So rows in the first matrix times

76
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.370
columns in the second matrix

77
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.673
is how we go about multiplying
one matrix time another.

78
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.700
Think that through for just a moment.

79
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.183
We're trying to treat each of
these matrices as a number,

80
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.050
but it's a compound number,
it has several elements.

81
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.090
So to multiply it we need to make sure

82
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.470
we've appropriately multiplied

83
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.300
all the various elements together,

84
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.180
and the method you see on
the screen is how we do that.

85
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.440
Now, if two matrices are of the same size,

86
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.350
they can be added together by
simply adding each element.

87
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.510
We talked briefly about
that on the last screen,

88
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.330
and you're seeing an
example here on this screen.

89
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.250
Throughout this, you're
going to see examples

90
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.380
that are both generic, like the first one,

91
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.820
and then a concrete example

92
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.280
where we put actual numbers in there.

93
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.680
That allows you to work it out on your own

94
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.660
and see if you came up
with the same number,

95
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.423
and thus ensure that you've
mastered that technique.

96
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.190
Multiplication.

97
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.400
Well, first you can multiply
by what we call a scalar.

98
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.600
Now let's pause for a moment

99
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.500
and give you a little extra
on why we use the word scalar.

100
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.680
Mathematics can be represented
in many different ways.

101
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.350
We're looking at a matrix
representation right now.

102
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.300
Matrices can be graphed out

103
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.550
in a Cartesian coordinate system,

104
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.210
an X and Y axes with specific points

105
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.190
in the Cartesian coordinate system.

106
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.130
Well, if you were to represent
any matrix in that manner

107
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.920
and multiply at times some constant,

108
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.940
some whole number or even a
real number for that matter,

109
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.560
but a single number,

110
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.220
all you would've done is change the scale

111
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.680
of the graph on the matrix.

112
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.900
Put another way, let's
say we graph this out

113
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.930
and it turns into an arrow
going a certain direction

114
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.660
off the Cartesian coordinate system.

115
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.310
If we multiply it by any real number,

116
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.800
let's just pick a number, 7.2.

117
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.260
The only thing we will
have changed on that arrow

118
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.360
is its scale, how far it goes.

119
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.560
That's why we call multiplying
by a single number a scalar.

120
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.930
Now, here's a concrete
example at the bottom

121
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.500
where we multiply a
particular matrix times two.

122
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.560
And all we've done is change
the scale of the matrix.

123
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.190
Now, multiplying two matrices
gets more complicated.

124
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.400
First of all, the number of
columns in the first matrix

125
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.100
has to be the same as the number of rows

126
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.550
in the second matrix.

127
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.000
Now this is because, as I
was explaining a bit earlier,

128
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.750
what we're really doing is
multiplying columns in one

129
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.250
times rows in the other.

130
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.200
That's why the columns in
one have to be the same

131
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.180
as the number of rows in the other.

132
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.210
Now here we see a very generic example

133
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.610
where we take the elements
of the first matrix,

134
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.080
A, B, C, and D,

135
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.920
and the elements of the
second matrix, E, G, F and H,

136
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.380
only instead of adding them,
we're gonna multiply them.

137
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.420
So what happens is you see this

138
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.690
rather convoluted
multiplication at the beginning,

139
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.550
but it's precise what we said before,

140
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.500
and I will say it again.

141
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.590
We take A, which is the first element

142
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.290
in the first row of the first matrix.

143
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.910
And we multiply it times E.

144
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.070
Now, you can look at E a
couple of different ways.

145
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.040
You could say E is also the first element

146
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.210
in the first row of the second matrix,

147
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.250
or you could say it's the first element

148
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.640
in the first column of the second matrix.

149
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.940
We'll look at it that way.

150
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.720
Then the next thing we do is we take B,

151
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.970
which is the second element

152
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.160
in the first row of the first matrix.

153
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.450
Now multiply it times G,

154
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.230
which is the second element
in the second column

155
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.700
of the second matrix.

156
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.590
Then we add those two values together.

157
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.660
And you continue throughout that

158
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.950
getting all four combinations
of rows and columns.

159
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.430
What you'll end up with is a new matrix.

160
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.773
You will have computed new values for it.

161
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.170
Algebra's an interesting topic.

162
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.000
Many of us take algebra

163
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.850
in part of high school
or secondary school,

164
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.640
and it doesn't seem that
exciting at that point.

165
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.160
But in reality, algebra
is much broader than that.

166
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.770
In fact, there are graduate
mathematics courses

167
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.650
studying various specific
types of algebra.

168
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.890
Well, there's an algebra of matrices

169
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.870
and there are some specific rules.

170
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.900
You may have had some of
these rules presented to you

171
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.900
in high school or maybe
even primary school.

172
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.000
Associativity of addition.

173
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.640
It doesn't matter how I group the numbers,

174
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.040
the addition comes out the same.

175
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.570
Commutativity of addition.

176
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.820
It doesn't matter if I reverse the order,

177
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.533
addition is still the same.

178
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.010
The same holds true with associativity

179
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.383
and commutativity of multiplication.

180
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.030
Then the distributivity
of scalar multiplication,

181
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.310
in other words a scalar, a single number,

182
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.540
times some element, and
here we have U plus V.

183
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.353
I can distribute that to make
it A times U plus A times V.

184
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.250
A similar thing happens
with the distributivity

185
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.050
of scalar multiplication.

186
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.330
Now again, our goal
here is just to make you

187
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.920
familiar with these things.

188
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.930
When we use them later on,

189
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.510
I will make comments
to refresh your memory

190
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.860
of what we had done.

191
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.140
So don't feel like you
have to pause the course

192
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.730
and memorize all these.

193
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.740
And for some of you I'm quite certain,

194
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.440
some of this at least
is a bit of a review.

195
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.060
Now remember, matrix
multiplication is not commutative.

196
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.550
Now, that's something I
do want you to remember.

197
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.140
When we get to talking about

198
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.070
the physics of quantum
behavior, quantum physics,

199
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.770
this non-commutativity was an element

200
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.440
of a major breakthrough
that led to quantum physics

201
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.330
and then to quantum computing.

202
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.960
So, put another way, with
traditional real numbers

203
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.730
you and I are accustomed
to, 7.4 times 3.6,

204
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.013
I reverse that, I get the the same answer.

205
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.570
But with matrices, if I reverse the order,

206
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.190
I may or may not get the same answer.

207
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.610
If I do, it's just
incidental, it's not built in.

208
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.450
So we do not have commutativity
when multiplying matrices,

209
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.160
the order matters.

210
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.340
Now, the transposition
operation is much easier.

211
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.790
I literally transpose the
order of the rows and columns,

212
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.380
as you can see here on the screen.

213
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.380
I take the first row and I
turn it into the first column.

214
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.270
This is a terribly easy process to do,

215
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.240
and you'll see us do it a
little later in this course.

216
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.800
A submatrix.

217
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.800
This is one of the simplest
concepts we'll cover.

218
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.440
It's any portion of a matrix that remains

219
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.190
after we've deleted any
number of rows or columns.

220
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.600
Now, at this point with both submatrix

221
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.200
and the previous topic,

222
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.940
you're probably understanding it,

223
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.340
but you're wondering, "Why?"

224
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.160
Well, at this point, let's
set the why to one side.

225
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.530
What we're doing now is
just getting the skills,

226
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.560
and later when we use them
the why will become clear.

227
00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.670
The identity matrix.

228
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.770
Now, let's pause and take a step back.

229
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.900
In addition you have an identity element.

230
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.413
Any number plus zero equals itself.

231
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.100
In multiplication, you
have an identity element.

232
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.970
Any number times one equals itself.

233
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.550
Well, we have the same
thing in matrix algebra.

234
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.430
If we take a matrix that's all zeros

235
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.920
except for the main diagonal.

236
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.200
That's the one that comes from upper left

237
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.990
down to lower right, that is all ones.

238
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.960
Then what you have is an identity matrix.

239
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.830
Any matrix times its identity
matrix equals itself.

240
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.810
It just accomplishes the same thing

241
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.110
that zero does with real number addition

242
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.320
and one does with real
number multiplication.

243
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.080
Now, this is going to be a
really important topic later,

244
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.420
so please pay close attention.

245
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.580
The length of a vector.

246
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.410
Now remember, we're looking at these

247
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.050
just as numbers on a
screen or in a matrix,

248
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.080
or in this case as a row vector,

249
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.390
but they could be put on a graph.

250
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.850
And if you thought about them that way,

251
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.240
it kind of makes sense to
use the Pythagorean theorem.

252
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.250
Remember that from long, long ago

253
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.500
in you're early days of schooling?

254
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.290
A squared plus B squared equal C squared,

255
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.490
it's basically how you compute
one side of a right triangle

256
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.650
when you don't know that side,

257
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.180
but you do know the other two.

258
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.020
The hypotonus is equal to
the other two sides squared.

259
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.060
Well, the same thing works here.

260
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:32.060
If I take a matrix, a column
or row matrix, a vector,

261
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.220
and I take each element and I square them,

262
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.860
add them together and
take the square root,

263
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.280
that is called the length of the vector.

264
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.540
Now, any non-negative link is
called the norm of the vector.

265
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.520
If that norm happens to be one,

266
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.530
then it's called a unit vector.

267
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.170
Again, these are going to
be important topics later,

268
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.380
both in quantum physics,
quantum computing,

269
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.720
and also in quantum algorithms.

270
00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.400
Now, this is simply a summary

271
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.560
of some of the things we've talked about

272
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.380
in regards to transpositions.

273
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.680
And some of them should
be intuitively obvious.

274
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.280
If I take A and I make
a transposition of it,

275
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.490
and then I do a transposition
of that transposition,

276
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:15.810
I get back to A.

277
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:20.810
If I take a constant times A
and give that transposition,

278
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.520
it would be the same thing
as if I did the constant

279
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.620
times the transposition of A.

280
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.010
A times B transposed is the same thing

281
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.890
as B transposed times A transposed.

282
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.690
Now, pause right there.

283
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:37.590
Remember, that matrix
multiplication is not commutative.

284
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.470
So that order, B transposed
times A transposed,

285
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.370
is important.

286
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.830
If you flip it around, you
won't get the same answer.

287
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.390
A plus B transposed

288
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.500
is the same as A transposed
plus B transposed.

289
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.400
And of course there are
cases where a square matrix

290
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.650
may be actually equal to its transpose.

291
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.560
You transpose it and
you get the same thing.

292
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.803
If that happens, we call
that a symmetric matrix.
