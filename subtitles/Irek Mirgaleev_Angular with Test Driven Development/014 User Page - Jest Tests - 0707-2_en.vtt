00:03.260 --> 00:07.510
Now let's add the just tests in the just console.

00:07.520 --> 00:11.450
You will see the warnings like this one.

00:11.930 --> 00:18.020
This is because now we are sending a new request to different end point.

00:18.260 --> 00:28.160
And in the let's open the app component just we are not handling that that request.

00:28.190 --> 00:37.280
So in the app component, we are rendering the user page and just like we did for the others, like

00:37.280 --> 00:46.610
the token token activation, we need to add the rest handler for it, get users as well.

00:46.610 --> 00:49.820
So I'm just adding a rest handler here.

00:50.030 --> 01:08.920
Get this is for API one zero users and the ID request response context and we are going to return 200.

01:08.970 --> 01:09.490
Okay.

01:09.740 --> 01:13.880
But also we need to return a payload context.

01:13.880 --> 01:25.010
JSON and the payload can be dynamic like the ID can be the ID we are taking from the the params.

01:25.670 --> 01:28.430
So like from the request params, we can get the ID.

01:29.030 --> 01:29.750
Well let's do that.

01:29.750 --> 01:38.210
Like let's say this is the ID and let's pass it to number params ID.

01:39.620 --> 01:48.860
So we are taking the id and in this json we will return the id username and it is going to be like this

01:48.860 --> 01:49.760
user.

01:51.550 --> 02:03.640
I'd use it one user two and for email it's going to be user ID at gmail.com.

02:05.480 --> 02:11.120
So this is the user get end point and this is for the app component.

02:11.120 --> 02:19.220
We are not really caring about the the different cases, so we are just returning success and returning

02:20.480 --> 02:21.530
the user object back.

02:21.530 --> 02:22.790
So saving this one.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.920
Now those warnings are gone.

02:27.070 --> 02:31.180
So let's add the test for the user component.

02:32.020 --> 02:37.090
So far, we didn't create the file for the user component.

02:37.180 --> 02:38.620
We only have the spec test.

02:38.650 --> 02:40.360
We don't have the gestures test.

02:40.480 --> 02:45.580
Again, we will repeat the steps we did in the Activate component.

02:45.580 --> 02:55.000
So I'm just going to copy the Activate component just and I will paste it here and I will rename it

02:55.000 --> 03:03.960
to user component just so this is failing because of the relative importing.

03:04.120 --> 03:13.210
So this is going to be let's replace all the activate component part with we can select multiple lines

03:13.210 --> 03:14.500
by command shift.

03:14.500 --> 03:20.050
L So this is selecting all the occurrence of this activate component and I'm just going to type user

03:20.530 --> 03:25.150
component here and we are importing that one from here.

03:25.990 --> 03:28.240
So we have the user component.

03:29.520 --> 03:39.530
We are rendering it like and in this one we have the those as well and we have a server and it is again

03:39.540 --> 03:46.680
going to be like this ID token and let's have an implementation like this.

03:47.700 --> 03:55.050
We will have we will take the ID and if it is true, we are going to return 404 not found.

03:55.050 --> 04:04.710
And if it is not true, if the ID is not true, then we will return OC with the object of user like

04:04.710 --> 04:17.670
ID is let's go with one user name is user one and email is user one at gmail.com.

04:19.070 --> 04:22.220
So this is for user page.

04:22.850 --> 04:31.490
So it sends get let's have that same naming for the tests.

04:31.520 --> 04:35.390
So in this one, we were saying it sends a request to get user data.

04:35.390 --> 04:40.940
So that's copying it and pasting to this one.

04:42.840 --> 04:46.950
So for the user ID, we will go with one.

04:46.950 --> 04:58.710
This is the success case and the second one is in the space user name on page when user is found.

05:00.110 --> 05:03.380
So like this.

05:04.280 --> 05:09.020
So again, we are setting the ideas one.

05:10.170 --> 05:14.520
But this time we are not going to check the alert or anything.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.760
We are just going to check for the username.

05:17.760 --> 05:21.840
So we will look for user one to appear.

05:22.380 --> 05:35.220
So let's say user name and instead of just querying a text, we can fine tune this one because in a

05:35.220 --> 05:39.390
profile card the user name is in this header.

05:40.050 --> 05:54.030
So we can do something like this find by role and the role is heading and the text will be a name user

05:54.030 --> 05:58.830
one So this is the, let's say header.

06:00.370 --> 06:08.110
And there will be in the document and in the next test, let's copy the test description again.

06:10.150 --> 06:15.190
So in this one, it displays activation failure.

06:15.220 --> 06:18.220
Not this one, but it displays error one user not found.

06:18.430 --> 06:27.670
And let's go with the user two, because in the rest handler here we are returning 404 for the user

06:27.670 --> 06:28.180
two.

06:28.570 --> 06:35.080
So we are looking for user not found message to be visible.

06:35.980 --> 06:40.750
And the last one is it displays spinner.

06:42.480 --> 06:44.850
During user get request.

06:45.330 --> 06:57.120
So during get request again, let's go with user one and checking the visibility of the spinner.

06:57.450 --> 07:02.520
Then we are waiting until a user one to appear.

07:02.850 --> 07:08.190
So that means the API returned the response and that user is now visible.

07:08.190 --> 07:10.800
So the spinner should not be there.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.140
So let's save this one.

07:15.740 --> 07:23.870
So our test is failing because one of the issues is we we are seeing this warning.

07:25.160 --> 07:29.470
It is complaining about there is no there is no handler.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.880
So this is for the gate request.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.910
But we just copied the activation and it is post.

07:34.910 --> 07:37.010
So let's change this.

07:37.370 --> 07:38.270
Saving it.

07:40.920 --> 07:46.770
So we still have failure and that's because we are using the profile card to display a user.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.210
But we didn't declare that.

07:48.210 --> 07:52.470
So let's get that one profile card component.

07:52.860 --> 07:54.420
And so you can get.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.740
And now all tests are passing.

07:59.980 --> 08:06.640
So we have completed the implementation for the user page in the just test as well.
