00:03.560 --> 00:07.820
Now we are going to add the test for the jazz part.

00:07.880 --> 00:14.360
We have added the test for the spinner visibility and let's add the same test to the just as well.

00:14.600 --> 00:24.190
So opening the user list just to us and the test is it plays spinner.

00:24.270 --> 00:37.280
During API call, during the API call and this is async calling setup.

00:38.690 --> 00:49.460
And before seeing the user one, let's query the visibility of the the spinner and we will get it by,

00:49.910 --> 00:54.740
get by, roll through all these status.

00:56.510 --> 00:58.400
And this is Spinner.

00:59.510 --> 01:05.420
Again, I would like to remind that this is returning the element if it finds it.

01:05.600 --> 01:09.590
Otherwise it throws an exception which which fails to test.

01:09.590 --> 01:12.440
So we don't need to assert this one.

01:12.770 --> 01:16.370
We don't need to have any expect for this line.

01:16.790 --> 01:22.970
So if this is returning a response, then it's basically implicitly doing the assertion for us.

01:23.390 --> 01:27.680
But after we see the user one, that means the API request is completed.

01:27.680 --> 01:35.240
So we can say we are expecting the spinner not to be in the document.

01:35.840 --> 01:40.730
So the the element we have reference is gone now.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.350
So saving this.

01:44.610 --> 01:46.440
And the tests are passing.
