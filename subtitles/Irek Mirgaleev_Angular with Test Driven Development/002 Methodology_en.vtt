WEBVTT

00:02.230 --> 00:05.740
We will follow test driven development methodology in this course.

00:06.040 --> 00:10.810
This means we will write our test code before implementing the requirement.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.360
Test Urban Development.

00:13.370 --> 00:20.120
The TDD will be guiding us to clarify what we are implementing and how we are implementing it.

00:21.090 --> 00:24.900
It is cycle of red green refactor phases.

00:25.770 --> 00:30.420
In the red phase, we will be laying out the requirements with the test code we are writing.

00:30.960 --> 00:34.470
There is no implementation for passing that test at that moment.

00:35.370 --> 00:38.580
Then we implement the code that does the requirement.

00:38.790 --> 00:43.710
We run the tests and see if our implementation is passing the test or not.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.190
If we are passing, then we complete green phase.

00:48.090 --> 00:55.200
Then for refactor phase, we can change our implementation until we satisfy without breaking existing

00:55.200 --> 00:56.070
functionality.

00:56.100 --> 01:03.660
These three steps are letting us to be aware what we are implementing to make sure that our new implementation

01:03.660 --> 01:09.540
will not break our previous test and to write clean and reusable code.
