00:03.250 --> 00:05.350
We are almost done with the sign up.

00:05.500 --> 00:11.740
We have one issue left when the validation fails at pic and we are displaying Springer to user.

00:11.770 --> 00:13.750
Let's let's show the issue first.

00:13.750 --> 00:23.050
So filling the form and if you remember this user wanted gmail.com is basically exist in the back end.

00:23.050 --> 00:28.780
But for this specific email address, I'm intentionally returning success response back.

00:28.780 --> 00:31.240
So there is no validation error visible at this point.

00:31.240 --> 00:37.060
But when we post the sign up, it's going to be failing and filling the form.

00:38.560 --> 00:43.840
So hitting enter now the back end is rejecting the request with the validation error.

00:43.840 --> 00:50.170
And here we are seeing the spinner on the button and the button is disabled.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.360
Now let's fix this issue.

00:52.450 --> 01:02.200
So adding a test to the interactions part again after the last test, it displays validation error coming

01:02.200 --> 01:12.760
from back and adding a new one here so it hides spinner after sign up request.

01:14.090 --> 01:15.050
Fails.

01:18.810 --> 01:21.030
So we are going to.

01:22.370 --> 01:23.510
Fill the form.

01:24.730 --> 01:29.560
Click the button and it's going to be returning this validation error.

01:29.740 --> 01:34.000
So just copying these lines from previous test pasting here.

01:34.510 --> 01:39.340
But this time we will check the the spinner again.

01:39.340 --> 01:44.620
We can find the spinner thing in the previous test like this one.

01:44.830 --> 01:49.810
So here we are checking the spinner visibility.

01:49.810 --> 01:53.010
And in this one we are checking spinner not to be there.

01:53.020 --> 01:55.360
So just copying that line here.

01:55.930 --> 02:04.720
And in this test pasting right here, so filling the form, clicking the button, sending request back

02:04.720 --> 02:11.320
and and back and returns this error back 400 with the validation errors.

02:11.410 --> 02:19.360
Then we are querying this spinner, which is having this roll status to be false, which means it's

02:19.360 --> 02:22.250
not going to be in the document.

02:22.270 --> 02:26.470
So just switching to the karma window and saving this one.

02:28.550 --> 02:30.380
And here we see the test is failing.

02:30.380 --> 02:31.900
The test is this one.

02:31.910 --> 02:34.730
It hides spanner after sign up request fails.

02:35.210 --> 02:36.950
Now we are going to fix this.

02:38.160 --> 02:44.250
And we will fix it here in the sign up component here in the quick sign up.

02:44.790 --> 02:53.490
When we are receiving the error here, we are handling the error case right here and the spinner visibility

02:53.490 --> 02:56.340
is based on the this API progress thing.

02:56.610 --> 03:05.580
So we can update the API progress at this point and we can set it to false.

03:06.180 --> 03:14.330
So in the error case, when we receive an error from backend, we are saying the API progress is completed

03:14.820 --> 03:19.200
and that's going to be updating the buttons spinner visibility.

03:19.650 --> 03:26.820
We didn't need to do this in the success case because in the success case the form layout is totally

03:26.820 --> 03:27.480
changed.

03:27.480 --> 03:32.490
We are just hiding the input elements and we are just displaying a success message to user.

03:32.490 --> 03:34.830
So we don't need that in the success case.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.330
So saving this one.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.620
And here we see the test is passing.

03:41.650 --> 03:45.610
Now let's just this once again on browser filling the form.

03:45.730 --> 03:46.600
Is there one?

03:46.630 --> 03:48.910
Is there one at home?

03:49.880 --> 03:50.840
Password.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.640
Password, I think.

03:53.680 --> 03:54.460
Enter.

03:54.940 --> 03:55.780
And here we see.

03:55.780 --> 03:56.890
The spinner is gone.

03:57.070 --> 04:02.800
Now, after we receive the validation error from back end, the spinner is gone.

04:03.070 --> 04:08.620
But the button is still disabled because we have the validation error for the email input.

04:09.250 --> 04:16.240
As soon as we fix the validation error, now we can see the button is enabled.
