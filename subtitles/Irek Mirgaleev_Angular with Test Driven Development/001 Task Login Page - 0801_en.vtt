00:03.440 --> 00:05.900
Now it is time for you to practice.

00:05.930 --> 00:06.880
In this task.

00:06.890 --> 00:12.190
You will be building this login form so the layout will be like this.

00:12.200 --> 00:18.320
It is almost identical with the sign up, but the difference is we only have the email and password

00:18.320 --> 00:24.320
inputs and we have this header and we have the button and just like we do in the signup form, it is

00:24.320 --> 00:27.260
initially the button is initially disabled.

00:27.920 --> 00:38.390
After you fill the form like adding values for the email and password, the button will be enabled and

00:38.390 --> 00:42.920
when you click the login it's going to be making API across the back end.

00:42.920 --> 00:49.010
And here we see the spinner and the button is disabled at the moment and after failed response like

00:49.010 --> 00:56.870
these are not valid credentials and is returning a4001 response and that response you are receiving

00:56.870 --> 01:01.430
from the account will be visible in the search box right here.

01:01.640 --> 01:07.250
For your reference, I would like to show the request right here.

01:07.610 --> 01:16.190
The request is going to this end point API one zero ODE and the response is like this there is object

01:16.220 --> 01:20.060
having a message field and having this text in it.

01:20.300 --> 01:28.820
We are just taking this text and showing right here so you don't have to handle the success case.

01:28.820 --> 01:36.110
You just handle the error case and show the error message right here and just make sure there is this

01:36.110 --> 01:40.430
spinner visibility and the button is disabled during the API call.

01:41.330 --> 01:42.830
So this is the task.

01:43.430 --> 01:50.630
Again, you can use the sign up component as a reference both in terms of having the template or the

01:50.630 --> 01:56.360
component implementation, but also you can use it as a reference for the test codes.

01:57.240 --> 02:04.560
In the next part, I will be showing how to do this and we will be using different approach in the sign

02:04.560 --> 02:05.100
up component.

02:05.100 --> 02:12.780
We were using the reactive form, but in logging we will use the template driven form so that we have

02:12.780 --> 02:14.730
more practice on that area.
