Now we are displaying the validation error for username, but the template is becoming harder to read.

00:09.720 --> 00:18.960
Right here we are checking if the form control has the error and if it is touched or if it is dirty

00:18.960 --> 00:21.720
or what type of error it has.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.180
And we display error accordingly.

00:24.570 --> 00:30.030
So this is making it harder to read the template, but also we are going to repeat similar things for

00:30.030 --> 00:31.170
the other inputs.

00:31.170 --> 00:39.180
So before the template gets messy, let's move this presentation logic into clause.

00:39.510 --> 00:46.650
So what we are going to do is here in the sign up component, yes, I'm going to add a new get function

00:46.650 --> 00:47.190
here.

00:47.190 --> 00:58.020
Get let's say this is username error and basically we will do the the control in this one.

00:58.020 --> 01:05.910
So let's get the field first, getting it from the form.

01:06.360 --> 01:17.640
We are getting this username first, then we check if this field has errors and.

01:19.290 --> 01:28.170
Basically I'm doing this thing, so checking the errors then will check if it is touched or dirty.

01:28.470 --> 01:30.630
So failed.

01:31.410 --> 01:36.960
Touched or failed dirty.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.210
Then we will check the error type here.

01:42.210 --> 01:51.660
So if a failed error is having this required

01:54.750 --> 01:57.390
down, I'm going to return the message.

01:57.810 --> 02:00.660
Username is required.

02:03.010 --> 02:03.760
Else.

02:04.240 --> 02:15.160
This is the case where the error can be only a mean length, so returning the error of username must

02:15.160 --> 02:18.460
be four characters long.

02:20.410 --> 02:25.900
So this is going to be returning the error and this is complaining about not all the parts are returning

02:25.900 --> 02:30.040
value, so let's make sure we return here as well.

02:30.040 --> 02:35.830
So just saving this one and we are going to use this username error in the template this time.

02:35.830 --> 02:41.830
So instead of having this check here, I will be just checking.

02:41.830 --> 02:52.180
If username is username error is returning a value then if it is, we are going to display the value

02:52.210 --> 02:53.200
in this div.

02:53.860 --> 02:55.270
So saving this one.

02:55.950 --> 03:01.590
Now the template is easier to read and the tests are passing.
