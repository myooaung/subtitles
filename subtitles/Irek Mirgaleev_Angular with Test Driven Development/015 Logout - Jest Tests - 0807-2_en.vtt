00:03.270 --> 00:11.850
Now let's add this same test for just so opening the app component just as now.

00:12.920 --> 00:19.430
We are going to start with the visibility of the logout link and right here in the log in, describe

00:19.430 --> 00:24.980
look, we are checking the visibility of my profiling, so it's going to be something similar to this

00:24.980 --> 00:25.490
one.

00:26.030 --> 00:31.970
So we are going to check for the look out.

00:32.690 --> 00:34.880
So this is filling the form for login.

00:35.150 --> 00:41.840
Then before clicking the summit, it is checking the visibility of the the link on number.

00:42.140 --> 00:43.400
Initially it won't be visible.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.300
Then after a successful login it will be visible.

00:47.630 --> 00:51.170
So this time we are going to check the log out.

00:51.530 --> 00:56.510
But this is not a link, this is a span.

00:56.900 --> 01:06.800
So for querying that thing, we can use query by text and the text is logout.

01:07.820 --> 01:10.370
So initially it won't be visible.

01:10.580 --> 01:20.660
Then let's wait for it to be visible find by text and the text is logout.

01:20.870 --> 01:25.070
So this is going to be logout link.

01:25.430 --> 01:29.180
So this is the test that's saved this one.

01:34.370 --> 01:35.990
And it has our blessing.

01:36.020 --> 01:39.440
Now let's add the the logout interactions test.

01:39.440 --> 01:49.970
So adding right here, it displays login and sign up after clicking logout.

01:52.790 --> 01:55.070
So we are going to.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.860
Do similar steps.

01:58.890 --> 02:03.000
Again, just copying the things from lookout visibility test.

02:03.450 --> 02:04.800
Just copying these.

02:06.950 --> 02:12.050
So we are calling setup form, but now we are just going to click the button.

02:12.050 --> 02:19.340
So this is going to be making the login request and in the end it's going to be successful.

02:20.810 --> 02:25.520
So we can wait until this lockout link to appear.

02:25.550 --> 02:31.820
Then we are going to click to this one user event, click lockout link.

02:32.810 --> 02:37.100
Now this is going to be updating the layout.

02:37.100 --> 02:47.860
So this time we will see the login and sign up links and we can use this one, this query.

02:48.440 --> 02:55.730
And this is going to be, let's say login link and we are creating a link element and the text will

02:55.730 --> 03:01.700
be login and we can do the same thing for sign up as well.

03:02.150 --> 03:08.360
Let's say this is sign up, link, sign up.

03:09.410 --> 03:11.060
So saving this one.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.600
And this is also passing.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.420
But we we have a warning here.

03:21.480 --> 03:30.000
It is saying the more service worker we have here, this one is has captured a request and there is

03:30.000 --> 03:31.260
no measure for that.

03:31.260 --> 03:35.480
And this request is for API one zero logout.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.760
So we are going to add it here.

03:38.970 --> 03:40.290
So let's define it.

03:40.290 --> 03:46.770
At the moment, we didn't have the test for checking the request, but we already have the implementation.

03:46.770 --> 03:53.250
So whenever we click to the logout, it is making that request and the the mock service worker implementation

03:53.250 --> 03:54.930
is catching that one here.

03:55.950 --> 04:06.900
So let's add the the handler here raised post and request is going to API one zero logout

04:09.690 --> 04:15.570
and basically we will just return a success response from this one return response.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.720
Context Status 200.

04:20.490 --> 04:22.590
So this is the success response.

04:22.770 --> 04:24.330
Let's save it.

04:29.230 --> 04:32.200
And those are pressing and that warning is gone.

04:32.230 --> 04:37.300
Now, let's add our next test, which is a clearing the storage.

04:37.570 --> 04:45.340
So if we check the component spec test here, we were checking the visibility of the log in and sign

04:45.340 --> 04:50.950
up and then we are checking the storage after clicking log out.

04:51.160 --> 05:00.520
So adding the same test, it clears storage of the user logs out.

05:03.460 --> 05:08.830
So again, copying the steps here and this is.

05:09.880 --> 05:19.340
And here clicking log out and let's wait until a visual reference like logging log in link to be visible.

05:19.360 --> 05:29.590
Then we can check the state local storage state get item, let's get the old and we expect this state

05:29.590 --> 05:33.100
to be null saving this one.

05:38.350 --> 05:39.460
And the tests are passing.

05:39.460 --> 05:42.070
Let's add the last test.

05:42.250 --> 05:46.180
And this is for checking the request, log out request going to backend.

05:46.180 --> 05:52.420
So this one it sends logout request to back.

05:52.420 --> 05:52.900
And

05:56.770 --> 06:00.520
so here clicking the logout link.

06:01.120 --> 06:08.140
Now we have the server right here so we can use this one for checking the request.

06:08.590 --> 06:11.410
Previously we have used sign up component.

06:11.410 --> 06:13.660
Let's check that signup component test.

06:14.020 --> 06:20.770
We have used this one to count the request coming to this one, or we use the same approach in the activation

06:22.540 --> 06:23.470
right here.

06:23.470 --> 06:28.630
We were counting the request and we were checking the counts in the test as well.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.870
And so we can do the same here.

06:32.140 --> 06:34.030
So let's have a counter here.

06:34.030 --> 06:34.390
Let's go.

06:34.400 --> 06:43.360
This one is look out counter initially zero and we will increase it when we receive a request to this

06:43.360 --> 06:51.130
endpoint, increase it by one and let's make sure we set it back to zero before each test.

06:51.520 --> 06:56.710
And in this test, in this sense, log out, request the back end.

06:56.710 --> 07:01.600
Now we can check the count like after clicking the logout.

07:01.600 --> 07:07.030
Let's again wait for login link to be visible.

07:07.840 --> 07:18.970
Then we can check check the counter, look out counter to be one saving this one.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.900
And the tests are passing.
