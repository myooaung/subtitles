WEBVTT

00:03.300 --> 00:10.050
Now let's add the just version of the tests, but before that, here we are seeing a failure in the

00:10.050 --> 00:11.190
gist console.

00:11.190 --> 00:19.660
And that's because now in the tests we are dependent on the forms module but in app.

00:20.940 --> 00:25.080
Component, just as we didn't import the forms module yet.

00:25.080 --> 00:29.220
And that's the that's why we are seeing this error.

00:29.340 --> 00:32.100
So let's import the firm's module.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.700
And saving it.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.390
We need to import this one because we are rendering the login page and the login page is dependent on

00:42.390 --> 00:43.380
the forums module.

00:43.380 --> 00:46.340
So that's why we need to import it.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.660
Now we see all tests are passing.

00:48.690 --> 00:54.300
Now I'm going to add the just version of tests to the login component.

00:54.300 --> 01:03.460
So here, creating a new file login component just as.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.790
Since there is no test in it, it's going to fail.

01:12.470 --> 01:14.840
And here we see it as it failed to run.

01:16.160 --> 01:22.400
Again, we are going to use this kind of component as a reference kind of component, just as and I'm

01:22.400 --> 01:26.570
just going to copy the test.

01:27.360 --> 01:28.510
And the.

01:29.950 --> 01:31.120
To lay out.

01:32.310 --> 01:34.050
And interactions.

01:35.050 --> 01:42.140
I'm not going to copy the validation tests, so just copy goal, but clear them after.

01:42.160 --> 01:46.870
So this is the test first that's removed the validation.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.640
Describe here.

01:49.570 --> 01:51.310
So this is gone.

01:51.730 --> 01:54.670
And let's also update the imports.

01:54.820 --> 02:01.930
We are going to test and just selecting all the occurrences of the sign up component and replacing it

02:01.930 --> 02:05.830
with login component and component.

02:05.830 --> 02:07.960
That is this one.

02:09.370 --> 02:16.990
Now we are not going to use the reactive form module and we don't need this one as well.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.880
This was for the validation.

02:21.050 --> 02:27.530
So we have the server here and the request will go to the endpoint.

02:28.130 --> 02:33.080
We don't need this email endpoint as well as for any check for the email.

02:33.740 --> 02:39.260
And we have success or failure responses for the authentication and.

02:41.110 --> 02:42.700
Let's say when.

02:43.900 --> 02:48.880
The email is going to be, let's say failing user at.

02:49.880 --> 02:50.480
Emile.

02:50.480 --> 03:00.920
We are going to return for a one and the response will be like this message and the text will be incorrect.

03:01.610 --> 03:03.260
Credentials.

03:03.560 --> 03:09.470
So this is the server and here we are rendering the logging component.

03:09.710 --> 03:14.720
And in logging component we are having template form.

03:14.720 --> 03:17.810
So importing forms module.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.710
So this is the test for the lobbying component.

03:21.730 --> 03:25.980
The first one is layout and let's rename this as well.

03:25.990 --> 03:30.160
So command shift L, this is going to be a log in.

03:30.490 --> 03:32.950
So it has log in header.

03:33.220 --> 03:36.070
We don't need username input.

03:36.460 --> 03:41.350
We are checking email input password input type for password input.

03:42.220 --> 03:45.010
Removing the password repeat test.

03:45.840 --> 03:51.840
Looking for login button and the button will be disabled.

03:53.190 --> 04:01.170
And in the interactions test we are going to just fill the email and password and let's remove this

04:01.170 --> 04:02.010
one as well.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.760
And the first one it enables the button.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.650
The second one it sends email and password to back end.

04:10.650 --> 04:14.400
So let's remove the user from this one.

04:15.880 --> 04:21.460
And the next one is the disabled button when there is an ongoing API call and we were checking the count

04:21.460 --> 04:26.440
on the server side in the just test and we are doing the same thing here.

04:28.270 --> 04:31.060
And the next one is for spinner visibility.

04:31.870 --> 04:34.360
And we don't have the success case.

04:34.360 --> 04:39.400
So just removing this base account activation notification after successful case.

04:40.260 --> 04:48.750
And again, this is a successful case and this is the the error case, and we are displaying the error.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.300
So let's make sure.

04:52.900 --> 04:57.980
Like we are filling the form with a failing user.

04:58.000 --> 04:58.810
This one.

04:59.550 --> 05:04.830
So we are calling the set up form with this email.

05:04.830 --> 05:07.290
So the form will be filled with this email.

05:07.290 --> 05:14.670
And when we click the button, the server will be sending 401 with this message incorrect credentials.

05:14.670 --> 05:21.270
So here we are going to check for this message visibility.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.750
And also we will do the same thing for the spinner.

05:27.770 --> 05:30.440
Visibility hides spinner after logging request fail.

05:30.440 --> 05:40.370
So again, we are going to fill the form with this user and we will check for and we will wait for this

05:40.370 --> 05:42.110
message to appear.

05:43.070 --> 05:45.620
Then we check if the status is there.

05:45.680 --> 05:46.820
Let's say this.

05:50.110 --> 05:51.890
So the tests are pressing.

05:51.910 --> 05:56.970
It's not always easy to like add multiple tests at once.

05:56.980 --> 05:58.930
It is easy to make mistakes.

05:58.930 --> 06:05.840
So keep in mind you can always focus to the test and run them one by one.

06:05.860 --> 06:13.830
So like at the moment the tests are running for all modules, but it is running on a single test in

06:14.330 --> 06:16.150
in the the logging component.

06:16.150 --> 06:22.180
But if you would like to filter the test to run on the logging component, you can just hit P in the

06:22.300 --> 06:24.910
test console and type the component.

06:24.940 --> 06:26.620
Test, test, component.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.160
Name.

06:28.390 --> 06:29.720
I made a typo.

06:29.740 --> 06:31.070
It's going to be looking.

06:31.210 --> 06:32.440
Component.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.750
So running logging component test.

06:34.750 --> 06:38.110
And at the moment we are focusing only to this test.

06:38.110 --> 06:42.630
And here in the output we are seeing only this one is running.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.160
The other 11 have been skipped.

06:45.730 --> 06:54.490
So if you have if you see any problem, you can just focus to the test like this and to run all the

06:54.490 --> 06:59.050
tests, you can just hit a so it runs all the tests.
