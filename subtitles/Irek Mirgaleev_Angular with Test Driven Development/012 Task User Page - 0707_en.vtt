00:03.100 --> 00:05.590
Now it is time for a task.

00:05.890 --> 00:08.550
We are going to build a user page.

00:08.560 --> 00:14.980
So when we click to these links, we are displaying the user page, but we are going to display the

00:14.980 --> 00:18.820
user data and we will get that user data from back end.

00:18.820 --> 00:30.310
And for loading the data, we need to go to localhost, 80, 80 and we are going to specify the ID here,

00:30.310 --> 00:33.480
API one zero users and user ID like this.

00:33.490 --> 00:37.030
This is returning user one and user two.

00:37.030 --> 00:41.200
And if there is no user, it is returning an error message.

00:41.200 --> 00:46.960
This is having the status quo code of 404 and it is also returning this message.

00:46.960 --> 00:56.320
So here you will be displaying the user when you receive the user's data and also you will be displaying

00:56.320 --> 01:00.250
a spinner when that user data is loaded.

01:00.730 --> 01:07.270
And if there is no user like this, you will be displaying the error.

01:07.510 --> 01:13.150
So the implementation is almost identical with the activation page.

01:13.810 --> 01:17.320
So you can take that as a reference.

01:17.320 --> 01:22.360
And for the this component I name, it is a profile card.

01:22.930 --> 01:27.370
This is again like something similar to the user list item here.

01:27.370 --> 01:31.450
And there is this image default profile, image and username.

01:31.450 --> 01:35.050
So the only difference is the style we have here.

01:35.740 --> 01:39.730
So it is time for you to do this.

01:39.910 --> 01:44.260
Then we will implement the user page for our course project.
