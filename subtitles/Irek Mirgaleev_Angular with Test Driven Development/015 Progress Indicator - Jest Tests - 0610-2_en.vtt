00:03.330 --> 00:07.920
Now let's add the same test for the just version.

00:07.920 --> 00:15.330
So opening activate component just as so we will have it as the writer.

00:15.330 --> 00:17.280
Just copying the last test.

00:17.940 --> 00:24.570
It's for the activation failure, but we are not going to care about the result, but we are going to

00:24.570 --> 00:31.980
just check the spinner visibility so it displays spinner during activation API call.

00:32.370 --> 00:35.670
So running setup.

00:36.390 --> 00:39.000
And navigating to this page.

00:39.000 --> 00:48.510
Now we are going to get the spinner and we are going to wait for it to be appear screen find by row

00:48.900 --> 00:49.920
status.

00:51.180 --> 00:53.790
So the spinner will be there.

00:54.090 --> 00:59.400
But then we are going to wait until this failed message to appear.

00:59.580 --> 01:05.070
And if that message is there, then we are sure the spinner is gone.

01:05.070 --> 01:12.780
By the way, I didn't that assertion here because it's not necessary, because if that that element

01:12.780 --> 01:15.390
is not found, this is proving error in this line.

01:15.390 --> 01:19.890
So the test fails if this is not going to find the element.

01:19.890 --> 01:25.380
But after the activation failure, we can do the assertion like this.

01:25.380 --> 01:32.100
We are expecting the spinner not to be in the document, so let's save this one.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.890
And tests are passing.
