00:03.100 --> 00:06.860
In the course resources, you will find a profile PNG file.

00:06.880 --> 00:15.220
I've added that file to the asset folder here and now let's display this profile PNG with the user in

00:15.220 --> 00:16.030
the user list.

00:16.930 --> 00:21.400
But before doing that, let's extract this user list as a separate component.

00:22.110 --> 00:30.210
So here in the the terminal, I'm just going to create a new component, angular class and g generate

00:30.210 --> 00:31.110
component.

00:31.110 --> 00:37.680
And again, this is going to be under home directory just like the user list, but this component name

00:37.680 --> 00:40.530
will be user list item.

00:40.650 --> 00:43.140
And for this one we don't need test.

00:43.140 --> 00:46.440
So running skip tests.

00:49.470 --> 00:51.150
So the component is generated.

00:51.300 --> 00:58.680
Now let's extract the content of this list item to the user list component, but we will also display

00:58.680 --> 00:59.190
an image.

00:59.190 --> 01:07.140
So what we are going to do is here just commenting out, we will display app, user list item.

01:07.140 --> 01:09.660
This is the new component we created.

01:09.660 --> 01:13.950
So let's open that one user list item.

01:13.950 --> 01:19.440
This is the HTML of it and user list item.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.510
This is the component.

01:21.510 --> 01:22.020
Yes.

01:22.200 --> 01:30.690
So we are going to display the user name and also the image of that user, which is going to be the

01:30.690 --> 01:33.210
default profile image in this component.

01:33.210 --> 01:42.360
So we are going to pass the user information because we need this user username and to to this component.

01:42.360 --> 01:46.080
So, so we do it by property binding.

01:46.080 --> 01:54.150
So we will pass a property user and basically it's going to be this user at the moment this component

01:54.150 --> 01:55.710
does not have this property.

01:55.710 --> 01:57.270
So let's define that.

01:57.270 --> 02:00.810
So we are going to take an input.

02:03.300 --> 02:11.640
And this is going to be a user and the type of this one is going to be Yusor as well.

02:12.030 --> 02:17.940
But let's say this is never going to be a null or undefined.

02:17.940 --> 02:23.360
So we add exclamation mark here and in the user list component.

02:23.370 --> 02:25.350
Now we can do like this.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.120
We no longer need this part.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.560
So we will have.

02:31.230 --> 02:33.540
User username.

02:35.310 --> 02:37.230
So if I save at this point.

02:38.670 --> 02:40.200
Nothing is broken.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.330
We are asking the users.

02:42.540 --> 02:45.060
Let's also add the image to this one as well.

02:45.060 --> 02:53.490
So let's have an image here and the source is under assets.

02:53.490 --> 02:58.770
There is profile PNG, let's say this one.

02:58.950 --> 03:00.360
Now the size is too big.

03:00.360 --> 03:05.400
So let's set the size as width of it as 30.

03:06.620 --> 03:15.770
Like this, and that's at all as you can go with profile or we can use the user's name in this one.

03:16.400 --> 03:23.690
And let's also set some styles again using bootstrap styles, a rounded circle.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.320
And let's also add shadow.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.770
Let's go with a small shadow like this.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.780
So the user list is like this.

03:36.930 --> 03:38.550
It's not a fancy component.

03:38.560 --> 03:39.870
It doesn't do much thing.

03:40.080 --> 03:44.530
Consider this one is just a practice to extract the things from components.

03:44.550 --> 03:47.460
So from a browser point of view, everything is fine.

03:47.460 --> 03:55.500
But if we check the karma console, we have lots of errors which are basically related to the app user

03:55.500 --> 03:57.540
list item, this new component.

03:57.750 --> 04:10.890
And that's because in test modules we didn't import those and we need to import it in user list tests.

04:12.330 --> 04:14.700
So here we need to.

04:15.470 --> 04:19.970
Declare a user list item component.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.270
Let's save this one.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.660
And let's check the console once again.

04:29.080 --> 04:35.440
We still have this error because the user is also rendered in the home page, which is rendered in the

04:35.440 --> 04:36.440
app component.

04:36.460 --> 04:40.930
So let's declare this in app component spec as well.

04:45.370 --> 04:53.200
So we have user list item component saving it.

04:56.960 --> 05:02.330
And checking the console now it is clear the errors are gone.

05:03.750 --> 05:10.530
So we fixed the errors in the karma part, but let's also fix them in the just as well because we are

05:10.560 --> 05:19.650
using same things in the just so opening the app component spec and opening a component just yes.

05:19.650 --> 05:26.000
And let's declare user list item component.

05:26.010 --> 05:27.480
Let's save this one.

05:31.960 --> 05:36.730
So the one in the component, the failures in the app component is gone.

05:36.730 --> 05:38.410
But we still have one more failure.

05:38.410 --> 05:46.990
It is in user list component just so we need to.

05:49.150 --> 05:50.410
And the declare.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.950
User list item component saving it.

06:00.370 --> 06:03.010
And here we see all tests are passing.
