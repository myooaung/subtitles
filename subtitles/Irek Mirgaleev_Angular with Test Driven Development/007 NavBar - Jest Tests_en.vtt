00:03.120 --> 00:16.620
Now let's add the same set of tests for the just module so we will have another it each here and we

00:16.620 --> 00:18.600
are going to have

00:21.960 --> 00:25.200
this check to the karma test.

00:25.200 --> 00:31.740
So we have the pet and title and we have this description like this.

00:32.460 --> 00:48.630
So we have the VAT and title and the first part is root and the title is home and the test description

00:48.630 --> 00:53.070
is this one it has a link with.

00:54.810 --> 00:56.880
Title two.

00:58.150 --> 01:12.520
Pet and test is going to be async and we have pat and title parameters in this test.

01:14.880 --> 01:21.180
And implementation is we are going to call the setup with the pad.

01:23.940 --> 01:31.740
It doesn't really matter which page is rendered at this point, but the pad is the setup is taking the

01:31.740 --> 01:32.330
pad attributes.

01:32.340 --> 01:43.530
So we are just passing one and we are going to get the link and we can query the link based on the role.

01:43.530 --> 01:55.770
So screen query by role and we can use the role type of query and the type is link.

01:56.040 --> 02:01.890
And the text we are looking for is the the title here.

02:03.090 --> 02:11.460
So we have the link and we are expecting this link to be in the document.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.980
So let's save this one.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.500
So this is working.

02:18.530 --> 02:25.060
And let's add the test for the other URL so we will have a link for this sign up.

02:25.070 --> 02:27.620
Having this sign up.

02:28.770 --> 02:37.170
Title and looking for the login formatting the the file here saving it.

02:39.970 --> 02:41.460
And these are passing.

02:41.470 --> 02:48.730
And the next test was for the navigation and we have the initial pad clicking to visible page.

02:48.730 --> 02:55.150
So I'm just going to copy the title to the test description here.

02:55.330 --> 03:05.200
So we will have another it each and it's going to be calling this

03:07.480 --> 03:08.350
function.

03:09.370 --> 03:14.650
So we have this test and we have.

03:15.910 --> 03:25.270
Initial visual pad clicking to and visible page.

03:25.840 --> 03:32.170
So initial path is going to be homepage and we are going to click to the

03:34.360 --> 03:45.100
sign up link and we expect the sign up page to be visible.

03:45.100 --> 03:55.540
And when the page is sign up and when we click to home, we are going to see the home page.

03:55.540 --> 04:02.800
And when we are in the home page and we click to the log in and we are going to see the login page.

04:02.800 --> 04:11.050
So it displays visible page after clicking, clicking to link.

04:11.500 --> 04:20.620
And let's take all these variables, initial pad clicking to and visible page.

04:24.060 --> 04:31.620
And in the test again, we are going to call sit up, sit up with the initial pad.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.280
Then we will get to the link.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.390
And we will get it by the clicking.

04:43.270 --> 04:52.300
Then we are going to click to this link and for the events we are using, it's important that it's user

04:52.330 --> 04:58.390
event from testing library user event.

04:59.410 --> 05:01.090
So we are going to.

05:02.610 --> 05:10.140
Click through this link element and we are going to await user event, click to the link.

05:10.860 --> 05:17.850
We have an error here because this query by role is either returning the element or returns null.

05:18.060 --> 05:25.620
And previously we have seen let's open the sign up component just tests.

05:25.620 --> 05:34.410
So we were using this get by version of it and the get by is basically returning the the element there

05:34.410 --> 05:36.810
is no option like it's returned to null.

05:36.810 --> 05:39.750
If that element is not there, it's throwing exception.

05:39.750 --> 05:44.460
So for these links, we can go with the get by role.

05:45.900 --> 05:50.160
So this is returning the element and we are clicking to the element.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.320
Then the page will be navigated.

05:52.320 --> 05:56.640
So we are going to wait for that page to be visible.

05:56.640 --> 06:07.140
And for that part we have another query which is find by and we are going to create the test ID and

06:07.140 --> 06:12.810
the test ID is this visible page and this is async.

06:12.810 --> 06:24.630
So we are going to wait here and let's say this is the page and we expect page to be in the document.

06:24.630 --> 06:30.870
Actually, we don't need to do this because if the page is not there, like if this is not visible,

06:30.900 --> 06:33.840
this is also throwing exception.

06:34.110 --> 06:39.660
So it is making the test fail if we don't have the the matching element.

06:39.870 --> 06:44.040
But for like this is a final assertion.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.950
So let's be a bit verbose here.

06:47.460 --> 06:49.500
So let's save this one.

06:51.890 --> 06:54.410
And the tests are passing.
