00:03.260 --> 00:06.590
Now let's add these tests for the gist part.

00:07.190 --> 00:10.670
So I'm just going to copy these two tests.

00:12.310 --> 00:19.750
And opening sign up just tears and pasting right after.

00:20.350 --> 00:27.100
It's not going to be working here, but I will just get it one by one.

00:27.430 --> 00:32.490
So in this one it displays account activation notification after successful sign up.

00:32.500 --> 00:38.320
So this is going to be async test we call setup form.

00:38.530 --> 00:44.410
Now we are going to check the nonexistence of this text.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.160
Now, we don't really depend on the elements.

00:48.310 --> 00:52.420
We don't care about the, the, the class names.

00:52.960 --> 00:59.650
So we can use the functionalities coming with the testing library to look for this specific text.

00:59.830 --> 01:05.200
So at this moment before clicking the button, we know that it's not going to be there.

01:05.200 --> 01:12.940
So we are going to use screen query by text so we can query this text.

01:13.860 --> 01:14.760
Directly.

01:17.660 --> 01:24.410
So we expect this screen created by text and not.

01:25.420 --> 01:32.860
To be in the document, then we are going to click the button.

01:36.760 --> 01:43.770
For the the API part, the server is already returning 200 with empty object.

01:44.910 --> 01:51.240
So we are fine with it and we don't need to do anything about UI changes.

01:51.360 --> 01:58.110
Then we are going to wait for this text to appear and this time we are going to use another functionality

01:58.110 --> 02:00.660
of testing library.

02:00.750 --> 02:02.670
And that one is.

02:02.790 --> 02:09.390
So when when something is going to be visible after some time for querying those type of things, we

02:09.390 --> 02:13.740
can use screen find by queries.

02:13.740 --> 02:21.840
So like query by, find by and get by are the three main query functionalities.

02:22.140 --> 02:31.380
So find buys find by queries are basically waiting for this query to end up with the result.

02:31.380 --> 02:35.940
So we are going to find by text and this is async.

02:35.940 --> 02:41.190
So we await here and let's assign it to a variable.

02:41.190 --> 02:44.070
Let's call this text and in the end we expect.

02:44.910 --> 02:45.690
This.

02:47.600 --> 02:53.180
Text to be in the document to be in the document.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.550
So this is the first test.

02:57.860 --> 03:01.700
And the next one is for hiding the sign up.

03:02.060 --> 03:03.440
Hiding the sign up form.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.420
Again, we call.

03:06.310 --> 03:08.050
Make sure this is async.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.290
We call setup form.

03:11.560 --> 03:17.290
Then we get the the form sign up.

03:17.890 --> 03:22.090
And at this moment we know the sign up form is there.

03:22.210 --> 03:25.270
We can get screen.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.190
We can either use query by test id.

03:30.220 --> 03:33.730
We are using the star ID for this one test ID.

03:36.230 --> 03:40.040
Or we can go with get pi tested because the element is there.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.900
It's not going to be causing any trouble.

03:41.900 --> 03:48.980
So we will be just receiving the elements we are looking for and the test it is form sign up.

03:49.100 --> 03:53.660
So this is basically looking for exactly this attribute.

03:54.110 --> 04:02.750
So in when when we are doing this test, I specifically set the attribute like this so that we wouldn't

04:02.750 --> 04:07.580
be doing anything on the just test part as well.

04:08.420 --> 04:11.030
So this is returning the element.

04:11.030 --> 04:12.650
Let's assign it to a variable.

04:12.650 --> 04:17.750
At this point, we don't need to do any assertion because we are using this get by.

04:17.780 --> 04:23.240
If it wouldn't be finding the element and it would be drawing error and this test would be failing at

04:23.240 --> 04:24.050
this line.

04:24.050 --> 04:30.830
So we don't need to run like expect form to be in the document at this point because it is already doing

04:30.830 --> 04:32.690
the assertion implicitly.

04:33.230 --> 04:39.290
So we have this variable which is referring to the element we are looking for.

04:39.320 --> 04:48.040
Then we can click the button and again we can use this one find by text for it.

04:48.290 --> 04:50.420
Waiting for this text to appear.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.340
So just copying it.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.310
So at this moment we received the response.

04:57.310 --> 04:58.730
The UI is updated.

04:58.750 --> 05:07.780
Then basically we will check, check the expect form not to be in the document.

05:07.780 --> 05:19.600
So here we got a reference to the form element and we know that after after successful signup, it's

05:19.600 --> 05:20.710
not going to be in the document.

05:20.710 --> 05:29.320
So the test is a bit simpler like this, like in the just form saving this one.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.150
And all tests are passing.
