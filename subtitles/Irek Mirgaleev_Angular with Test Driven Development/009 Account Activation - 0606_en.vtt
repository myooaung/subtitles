00:04.100 --> 00:06.790
Now we are going to need one more page.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.110
So let's send a sign up request.

00:09.110 --> 00:16.510
So sending a sign up for, let's say a user, 200 or 200 at Malcolm.

00:17.960 --> 00:21.680
Password and password.

00:22.280 --> 00:28.760
Now clicking the sign up and here we are seeing this success message saying, please check your email

00:28.760 --> 00:30.530
to activate your account.

00:31.250 --> 00:37.310
The account you will find in the resources of this course is not really sending an email, but it is

00:37.310 --> 00:41.210
printing the link for the account activation.

00:41.990 --> 00:48.110
So if you check the console of the the back end, you will see a message, something like this.

00:48.110 --> 00:52.970
So it is saying open this URL to activate your account.

00:53.090 --> 00:56.600
So we will need a page.

00:56.630 --> 01:04.400
Activate page on the client and similar to the user page, it will have this dynamic part which is the

01:04.400 --> 01:06.170
token for the account activation.

01:06.170 --> 01:11.360
So we will have this activate page with this activation token.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.590
So let's create that one first.

01:15.590 --> 01:20.420
Let's add the test for it and I'm going to add the test right here.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.710
Let's give a descriptive name for the array right here.

01:24.710 --> 01:28.490
This is for, let's say, routing tests.

01:29.360 --> 01:41.420
So we have these pads and corresponding pages and let's copy the user page objects here pasting after

01:41.420 --> 01:41.930
those.

01:41.930 --> 01:48.830
So we will have activate URL and basically the activation path will be dynamic.

01:48.830 --> 01:54.950
So it's going to be something like this one, two, three, four and we are going to see activation

01:54.950 --> 01:55.520
page.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.820
This is the test ID we are going to use in the component.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.150
And let's say we will have another URL like this, four, five, six.

02:05.150 --> 02:08.600
And again, we are going to see the activation page.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.220
So moving karma to the front.

02:10.220 --> 02:11.450
Let's save this one.

02:15.030 --> 02:17.760
And the these tests are failing.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.410
Displaced Activation page.

02:20.200 --> 02:24.270
So both activation pages are failing because we don't have the component yet.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.110
So let's create that one.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.160
And for creating again using G g.

02:31.230 --> 02:39.780
Component and name of the component is actuate and we will need test files because we will add the functionality

02:39.780 --> 02:42.740
to it, but we don't need CCIS.

02:43.110 --> 02:44.760
So going with the nine style.

02:47.360 --> 02:53.050
And here we see the components are created and the module is updated going back to the code.

02:53.060 --> 03:03.680
Now let's update the the activation activate component and let's open the home component as well.

03:03.680 --> 03:07.310
I'm just going to copy this template and paste the error.

03:07.310 --> 03:09.380
This is for activate.

03:10.470 --> 03:16.380
Activation Activation page and let's name it activation page.

03:17.070 --> 03:22.350
The account activation page is ready, but it's not added to the router module yet.

03:22.590 --> 03:36.720
So we will have another definition here that's for activate and we will have this dynamic ID and for

03:36.840 --> 03:40.200
the component, we are going to use the ACTIVATE component.

03:41.460 --> 03:43.860
So let's save this one.

03:46.280 --> 03:55.910
Again, the tests are passing, but let's make sure we declare this in component spec as well right

03:55.910 --> 03:56.540
here.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.720
Adding Activate component.

04:01.610 --> 04:02.750
Saving it.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.140
And it has our passing.

04:06.140 --> 04:07.730
So if we.

04:09.830 --> 04:10.970
Open this link.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.350
Just copying this one.

04:13.880 --> 04:17.080
And test it on bigger windows like this.

04:17.090 --> 04:22.670
So if I just paste this thing here, the activation page is open at the moment.

04:22.670 --> 04:26.720
This is not doing anything, but the navigation is working.

04:28.020 --> 04:33.870
And since the tests are pretty straightforward, I'm just going to add the gist version of the test

04:33.870 --> 04:34.430
as well.

04:34.440 --> 04:40.500
So opening the app component just as and we are going to have.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.120
Activate.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.130
One, two, three.

04:49.040 --> 04:53.210
Activate four, five, six.

04:53.210 --> 05:03.160
So this is for activation page and we need to add the components to the declarations right here.

05:03.170 --> 05:06.920
By the way, I forget to add the user page or login page here.

05:06.920 --> 05:15.500
So just adding those user page, these are component logging component and activate component.

05:16.690 --> 05:20.200
And I just want to check this one here.

05:20.860 --> 05:30.160
So I also forget that one in the user component is also missing in the karma test user component.

05:31.120 --> 05:36.460
Just formatting this document now it is visible and doing the same thing here.

05:37.030 --> 05:39.430
So just saving these changes.

05:41.160 --> 05:46.950
The justices are pressing and the committees are pressing as well.
