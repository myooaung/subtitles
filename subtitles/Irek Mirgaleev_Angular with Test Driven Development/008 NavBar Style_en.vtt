00:03.690 --> 00:06.240
Now let's steal the navigation bar.

00:06.960 --> 00:15.660
And for styling again, I'm going to use the bootstrap styles and we have the number right here and

00:15.660 --> 00:20.190
the classes I'm going to use, you can find those in the documents.

00:20.670 --> 00:26.730
So the first thing is let's change the style to now.

00:26.730 --> 00:33.650
So there's this now element and let's wrap it with the now and this.

00:33.660 --> 00:36.600
This is going to be the root of the navigation bar.

00:36.780 --> 00:45.330
And let's add the classes of the bootstrap and the first one is the now bar and the second one is the

00:45.570 --> 00:48.240
bar is always going to be expanded.

00:48.390 --> 01:00.480
Then let's set the bar light color and also set the BG background light and also setting a shadow here

01:01.140 --> 01:03.270
shadow as let's save this one.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.240
We have this style here.

01:09.510 --> 01:17.520
The the main content is right here and it is having this container which is adding spaces to the left

01:17.520 --> 01:19.230
and the right hand side of the main content.

01:19.240 --> 01:23.040
So let's do the same thing for the navigation bar as well.

01:23.040 --> 01:28.950
So the text right here would be aligned with the, the main content text.

01:28.950 --> 01:36.630
So let's have another div here and let's move the anchors into that div.

01:37.110 --> 01:42.240
And this is going to be having the class container saving it.

01:43.050 --> 01:48.330
Now we have the space on the left hand side and also we have the space on the right hand side.

01:48.330 --> 01:55.380
So basically the navigation bar and the main content has the same spacing on the sides.

01:56.160 --> 02:03.990
The styling will be changed for the length we are going to for the anchor we are going to use.

02:05.070 --> 02:06.300
This is for the home.

02:06.420 --> 02:11.460
We are going to use the class of now bar dash brand.

02:12.920 --> 02:21.620
And for the signup and login, let's move them into an unordered list like this.

02:22.880 --> 02:28.880
And this list is going to be having the number dash now.

02:28.910 --> 02:30.500
Now, let's say this one.

02:31.720 --> 02:37.030
Now the home link is on the left hand side and sign up and login is on the right hand side.

02:37.780 --> 02:44.150
And let's also fix the style here as well for the signup and login.

02:44.170 --> 02:54.010
Let's set the class of these are not just the link, but this is for now link and same for the.

02:55.140 --> 02:57.840
Looking as well so you can get.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.640
Now the links are visible like this.

03:00.680 --> 03:06.610
So if I click those, the navigation is still working.

03:06.970 --> 03:10.600
Now let's also extract this one as a separate component.

03:10.630 --> 03:14.020
Let's not clutter the app component with the navigation bar.

03:14.560 --> 03:25.150
So switching to the terminal and again using the English CLI and G generate component C, now we have

03:25.150 --> 03:29.860
the shared module and this number is going to be under that shared module.

03:29.860 --> 03:34.720
So the naming is like this shared forward slash number.

03:34.900 --> 03:38.380
So it's going to be creating the number under shared folder.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.530
And for the navigation bar, we are not going to have the test.

03:41.530 --> 03:47.200
So skipping tests and also skipping the CSS creation part.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.080
So we are going with the inline style.

03:51.130 --> 03:53.740
So let's hit enter.

03:55.230 --> 03:59.440
Now just created the number under the shared folder.

03:59.580 --> 04:02.380
Our component is HTML and number components.

04:02.400 --> 04:08.880
There is no CSS or test file and here it is also updating the module.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.130
But it's not updating the module.

04:11.490 --> 04:13.590
It is updating the shared module.

04:14.490 --> 04:21.510
So this angular CLI is automatically adding the new component declaration to the closest module.

04:21.720 --> 04:27.600
So for this case, since the number is under shared directory and there's shared module in it, it is

04:27.600 --> 04:30.420
just updating the shared module with this component.

04:30.900 --> 04:34.470
So let's go back to the code and let's open the shared module here.

04:35.070 --> 04:42.600
And right here we have the number component, but the component is not exported from this module yet.

04:42.600 --> 04:50.040
So this means we are not able to to use the component anywhere else.

04:50.040 --> 04:56.490
So just like exporting the alert end button, we have to export the number component as well.

04:58.430 --> 05:10.220
And let's do this just cutting this thing, cutting the now from EP and opening the now bar HTML and

05:10.220 --> 05:13.370
pasting that one here and now.

05:13.400 --> 05:23.720
Now our component has the is its own template and in a component since app module is importing the shared

05:23.720 --> 05:34.490
module which is exporting the component number component, then we are able to use EBP now bar here.

05:35.450 --> 05:37.040
So saving all these.

05:37.820 --> 05:38.720
Changes.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.230
So we don't see any changes on the UI part.

05:42.230 --> 05:46.430
But if it tried to click to to these links, they are not working.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.280
And if you also check the test console here.

05:50.490 --> 05:53.460
And if you just see the spec list.

05:54.370 --> 05:58.000
The link and the navigation tests are failing.

05:59.430 --> 06:08.910
And that is because now in the bar right here, we are using the the router link directive, which is

06:08.910 --> 06:11.040
part of the router module.

06:11.490 --> 06:15.690
But in shared module we are not importing the router module.

06:16.140 --> 06:20.070
The directives we are using right here is not actually working.

06:20.070 --> 06:22.380
So that's why the links are not working.

06:22.710 --> 06:29.520
So to fix this, since we are now dependent on the router modules directive, we have to import the

06:30.030 --> 06:35.160
router module right here in the shared module router module.

06:35.610 --> 06:37.860
So let's save this one.

06:41.420 --> 06:48.440
And here we see the tests are passing and if we test it on browser, the links are working.

06:49.720 --> 06:53.320
Finally, let's add an image for our application.

06:53.410 --> 07:03.100
You will find it as it's in the resources of this course and it is added to the folder right here under.

07:03.940 --> 07:04.860
S RC.

07:04.870 --> 07:11.440
We have the assets folder and in this asset folder we have this file PNG So I'm just going to use this

07:11.440 --> 07:13.210
one in the navigation bar.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.060
Let's open the now bar component.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.790
For the brand part.

07:21.030 --> 07:24.300
Other than this text, let's have the image here.

07:24.570 --> 07:37.140
And the image is the source is going to be said, falsify PNG and closing the image deck.

07:37.260 --> 07:38.460
Let's say this one.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.580
Now we are seeing the image, but the size is too big.

07:42.580 --> 07:45.010
Let's set the size for it.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.870
And the size, let's say, with of the image will be 60.

07:50.890 --> 07:55.360
And also, let's set out for the the image.

07:55.540 --> 08:01.960
This is necessary for the accessibility and it's also good for the search engine optimization things.

08:02.380 --> 08:08.410
So the art will be like, let's say, saving it.

08:09.350 --> 08:18.770
Now we have the image here and basically the navigation is working even weakly to the image since it

08:18.770 --> 08:20.540
is child of the anchor.

08:20.810 --> 08:23.510
The navigation is working.

08:23.510 --> 08:24.980
Even we click to the image.
