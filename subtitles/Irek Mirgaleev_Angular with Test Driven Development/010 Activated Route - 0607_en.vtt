00:03.360 --> 00:04.470
Account Activation page.

00:04.470 --> 00:10.770
We will have a unique token in the URL and we will use that token to activate the user.

00:10.920 --> 00:18.750
Now let's open the account activation page and here I'm typing activate and just random number like

00:18.750 --> 00:19.490
five.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.990
So the activation page is visible.

00:21.990 --> 00:25.770
So as soon as the page is opened, we will use this.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.490
Token, for instance, five here.

00:30.090 --> 00:33.420
And we are going to take this token and send it to back end.

00:34.230 --> 00:39.330
So we will see how we are going to take that token from the URL in the section.

00:39.330 --> 00:48.360
But to make the testing a bit easier, let's add additional links right here in this app component.

00:48.630 --> 00:51.000
I'm not going to add to the navigation bar.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.780
I'm just going to add the app component right here.

00:54.780 --> 00:57.570
So let's have another link here.

00:57.690 --> 01:07.680
And this is going to be a router link and this is, let's say, going to activate, activate one, activate

01:07.680 --> 01:10.050
one and another one.

01:10.050 --> 01:14.520
This is going to activate to saving it.

01:14.670 --> 01:20.460
So we have the links, but to see the URL, let's make the browser bigger.

01:21.330 --> 01:27.720
So if I click to the activate one, it goes to the activate one URL and if I click to activate two,

01:27.750 --> 01:29.460
it goes to the activate two.

01:29.790 --> 01:34.500
So this is the links we are going to use in testing now.

01:34.950 --> 01:40.980
We are going to access to this information like we will just take the ID from the URL.

01:41.460 --> 01:48.890
We are going to take that value in activate component and to take that ID, we will use another angular

01:48.900 --> 01:56.970
router functionality and it is we are going to inject it to this activate component and it is it's called

01:56.970 --> 02:04.080
this one is root and the type of this object is activate that root activated drought coming from the

02:04.080 --> 02:05.010
angular router.

02:05.490 --> 02:14.730
So this is the object contains the ID in the URL and right here in the IMG in it.

02:14.850 --> 02:22.920
So when this component is initialized, this lifecycle function is called so we can do something like

02:22.920 --> 02:28.050
this, we can access to this root and it has params.

02:28.980 --> 02:39.510
And this params is like the typical I think it is observable here we see it is observable so we can

02:39.510 --> 02:40.650
subscribe to it.

02:42.540 --> 02:48.240
Basically, whenever root is changed, this subscription will work and we will receive, let's say,

02:48.240 --> 02:54.240
the params and we can just lock the params here.

02:55.170 --> 03:03.630
So saving this one and let's open the developer tools switching to the console so we see the ID too.

03:03.630 --> 03:05.610
But let's go to homepage first.

03:05.700 --> 03:09.900
Let's clear this console and let's click to the activate one.

03:09.990 --> 03:17.710
Now we are seeing this object, having the ID and the one this this one is coming from the URL and if

03:17.710 --> 03:21.690
we click to the activate two, we are seeing the ID two.

03:21.690 --> 03:26.520
So that's how we are able to get the ID in this activate component.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.720
So we have this dependency in the actuate component.

03:30.740 --> 03:37.730
Now, at the moment, we are not going to add the test for this one because I would like to show you

03:37.730 --> 03:39.440
the the observable.

03:39.950 --> 03:45.830
Like this one, we are going to use this one and previously we have used another observable is typical

03:45.840 --> 03:46.240
length.

03:46.280 --> 03:54.410
And in the next lecture I will show the basics of the observable and then we are going to use that in

03:54.410 --> 03:55.340
the test.

03:55.910 --> 04:03.320
But at the moment we added a new dependency to the Activate component and the Activate component test

04:03.320 --> 04:05.120
is failing.

04:05.510 --> 04:09.500
This is the default test activate component spec.

04:09.620 --> 04:10.220
Yes.

04:10.370 --> 04:13.130
So this is the default test at the moment.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.160
Let's not focus into this one.

04:16.910 --> 04:18.620
We are going to fix it.

04:18.860 --> 04:26.300
But first we will see how the observable is working in the next lecture.

04:26.480 --> 04:34.760
Then we will fix our tests and add our new tests for taking the token from the pad and making the API

04:34.760 --> 04:36.080
request to the backend.
