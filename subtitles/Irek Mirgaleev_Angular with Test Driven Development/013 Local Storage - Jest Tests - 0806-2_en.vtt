00:03.360 --> 00:06.030
Now let's add the same test for the gist.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.640
When we check the justice console.

00:08.640 --> 00:15.600
We are seeing failures in the EV component and the failures are triggered because of the local storage

00:15.600 --> 00:16.110
usage.

00:16.110 --> 00:19.290
So let's open the app component.

00:19.290 --> 00:26.760
Just as now we are storing data in local storage and we are not clearing in each test.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.900
We did that in the the karma test, but we didn't do that here.

00:30.900 --> 00:41.640
So here like in the lifecycle functions, let's add after each here and we are going to call local storage

00:41.940 --> 00:42.780
clear.

00:43.260 --> 00:47.010
So this is clearing the local storage content after each test.

00:47.010 --> 00:48.210
Let's save this.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.040
Now that error is gone and all tests are passing.

00:55.060 --> 00:59.010
Let's add the test for the the storage usages.

00:59.020 --> 01:02.650
So this is the described log for the login.

01:02.830 --> 01:13.210
So we will use it here, adding the test it stores logged in state in local storage.

01:17.530 --> 01:30.400
So this is a thing we are calling setup form clicking button and we can wait for home page to be visible

01:31.900 --> 01:32.920
on page.

01:33.790 --> 01:38.200
And then we can check the local storage for the assertion.

01:38.290 --> 01:42.010
Can let's use the the query here.

01:42.220 --> 01:43.540
So let's get the.

01:45.950 --> 01:50.460
They expect parts from karma taste based in here.

01:50.460 --> 01:58.500
So we are taking the local storage out and passing it to this object logged in user that's imported

01:58.500 --> 01:59.190
one as well.

01:59.880 --> 02:03.150
Then we are checking if it's logged in is true.

02:03.150 --> 02:04.560
Let's save it.

02:08.330 --> 02:09.720
So this is passing.

02:09.740 --> 02:17.930
Let's add the next test and that one is for layout in the logged in user.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.310
So let's add that.

02:23.030 --> 02:28.880
It displays layout of logged in user async.

02:31.840 --> 02:42.910
Now we are going to initialize the local storage with the data with this data and let's paste it here.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.870
And then we are going to run the setup.

02:47.870 --> 02:50.840
Setup is right here, this one.

02:52.060 --> 02:58.300
So it is just initializing the application and navigating to the path we are going to pass.

02:58.300 --> 03:04.660
So let's call set up and initialize the path as route.

03:04.930 --> 03:10.780
Now we are going to check the visibility of the, the, the link, my profile link.

03:15.090 --> 03:23.310
So this will make sure that the local storage is working for the state initialization.

03:23.320 --> 03:29.310
So my profiling to be in the document saving it.

03:34.220 --> 03:36.260
And all those are passing.
