00:03.420 --> 00:07.020
Now let's add the same test for the gist.

00:07.020 --> 00:17.370
So opening the sign up component, just as and just like we have in the karma test, we can wrap this

00:17.370 --> 00:18.750
one with this gripe.

00:20.300 --> 00:24.140
And the first describe is for the component signup component.

00:27.120 --> 00:38.730
And in this one we will have second describe and this is for layout and just moving this it says sign

00:38.730 --> 00:42.060
up Heather test into this one saving it.

00:42.860 --> 00:45.950
Now in the output, we can see the sign up.

00:45.950 --> 00:47.330
This is the first describe look.

00:47.330 --> 00:50.570
Then we have the layout and under layout we have this.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.880
It has sign up header test.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.790
So let's add the other tests.

00:55.790 --> 00:56.600
So.

00:58.310 --> 01:06.740
First thing we have this, it has username input and this is going to be passing because we already

01:06.740 --> 01:08.210
have the implementation.

01:09.290 --> 01:14.540
But this was more about demonstration of how we can do the test in this one.

01:14.540 --> 01:22.910
So we are going to render the sign up, then we are going to get the elements by the label.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.910
We did that in the.

01:26.940 --> 01:30.570
The other tests like this, we query the label.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.370
We query the input.

01:32.370 --> 01:35.400
Then we query the content of that label.

01:35.730 --> 01:44.040
But with the testing library, we have the query function we are looking for, and that one is screen

01:44.430 --> 01:47.580
get by label text.

01:48.090 --> 01:56.220
So basically this is looking for the text, the label text on the page and we are looking for this username

01:56.400 --> 02:01.350
and this is returning the the associated elements with this label.

02:01.980 --> 02:10.410
So this is finding the label and returning back to the associated element with this label.

02:10.410 --> 02:21.360
So we are receiving the input we are looking for and basically we can say we expect this to be in the

02:21.780 --> 02:22.650
document.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.050
Saving it.

02:27.760 --> 02:43.000
So this one is pressing and adding test for email and we are looking for e mail and adding test for.

02:43.770 --> 02:44.940
Password.

02:46.110 --> 02:48.190
And password.

02:48.210 --> 02:48.870
So.

02:49.410 --> 02:51.960
So these are also passing.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.980
Now we are going to check the password type.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.460
Right here.

02:58.640 --> 03:03.590
We were checking the type attribute of this input.

03:03.890 --> 03:05.990
Now we will do the same thing.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.070
So.

03:07.830 --> 03:14.010
It has password type for password input.

03:19.450 --> 03:31.450
And we are entering the component, we are getting the input element so we can assign it to a variable

03:31.450 --> 03:32.380
right here.

03:32.890 --> 03:38.200
And again, we have a matcher like this to be in the document.

03:38.200 --> 03:42.670
We have another measure for checking the attributes of an element.

03:42.670 --> 03:55.540
And it's like this we expect this input to have attribute and the attribute we are looking for is type

03:55.540 --> 04:00.880
and we are looking for that type value to be password.

04:01.210 --> 04:05.430
So saving this so this one is also passing.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.270
Then let's continue with the.

04:08.870 --> 04:10.880
Password repeat.

04:12.430 --> 04:14.430
So we are looking for password.

04:14.440 --> 04:15.310
Repeat.

04:15.980 --> 04:20.330
And it has password type for password repeat input.

04:20.990 --> 04:24.510
Again, we are getting the password repeat input.

04:24.510 --> 04:26.060
Then check the type of it.

04:27.790 --> 04:29.910
So these are passing, too.

04:30.040 --> 04:35.680
And finally, we will check the button again, copying the first test.

04:37.240 --> 04:44.790
Now we are looking for sign up button and this time we are looking for button roll.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.870
But the text is same.

04:47.470 --> 04:50.070
So let's change the variable name.

04:50.080 --> 04:53.800
So this is going to be button and button to be in the document.

04:55.860 --> 04:59.630
And our last test was this one.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.250
It disables the button initially.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.000
Just.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.750
Just copying this test description.

05:08.110 --> 05:14.080
So in this one, it disables button initially.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.730
And we are rendering the component.

05:19.730 --> 05:21.740
We are getting the button.

05:22.460 --> 05:27.400
Then again, we are going to use just don't matter here.

05:27.410 --> 05:34.010
We are expecting this button to be disabled.

05:36.030 --> 05:38.370
So let's save this one.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.660
And all the tests are passing.
