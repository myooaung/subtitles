00:03.520 --> 00:06.880
Now let's say the validation tests for the test part.

00:08.080 --> 00:12.760
Again, I'm going to copy the test from sign up component.

00:13.030 --> 00:24.610
Just so just copying this described section here and opening looking component gest pasting right here.

00:25.660 --> 00:29.260
Now we are going to have the test for the email.

00:29.350 --> 00:38.350
This is the case required case then from format and the password for the required case and removing

00:38.350 --> 00:39.220
the others.

00:41.240 --> 00:47.570
In this one we are calling the setup and this is rendering the component.

00:47.840 --> 00:51.380
We are checking this message not to be visible at first.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.750
Then we are filling the form.

00:55.320 --> 01:00.120
Then we are checking the same message to be visible.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.460
Saving this one.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.430
So the tests are passing.

01:09.360 --> 01:16.620
We also have one more test in the logging component, which is for the button enable case.

01:16.710 --> 01:21.600
So I'm just going to add the same test to the just as well.

01:22.540 --> 01:31.420
So here look in components again adding it to the the interactions described look so it does not enable

01:31.420 --> 01:34.990
button when fields are invalid async.

01:37.800 --> 01:38.610
Here.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.080
Now we are filling the form and we already have the the functionality in this one to fill the form with

01:46.080 --> 01:48.330
the values we are passing for the email.

01:48.690 --> 01:51.660
So calling this one.

01:53.630 --> 01:56.360
That's fill it with an invalid value like this one.

01:57.350 --> 02:00.530
And we are expecting the button to be disabled.

02:00.860 --> 02:02.690
I'm just copying it from.

02:03.410 --> 02:10.610
But the enabled test is going to be disabled saving this.

02:15.150 --> 02:17.070
And the old tests are passing.
