00:03.170 --> 00:14.690
Now let's add the routing test for the just so opening up component just as so adding a new describe

00:14.690 --> 00:31.670
block here and this is for login and the test is it redirects to home page after successful login.

00:36.750 --> 00:44.520
So again, I will have the setup copied from the login component.

00:45.540 --> 00:48.930
Right here we have the setup.

00:48.930 --> 00:53.460
Just copying this one pasting here.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.660
And this is calling a setup.

00:57.660 --> 01:01.110
But the setup we have here is.

01:02.360 --> 01:12.320
Right here it is taking apart and the page will be uh initially opening the login page.

01:12.320 --> 01:18.770
So we are opening the login page in the setup, querying the email and password fields, filling those

01:18.770 --> 01:21.710
and having a reference to the button.

01:21.710 --> 01:26.150
Now in this test we will call setup form.

01:27.020 --> 01:35.000
Then we are going to click to the button user event, click button.

01:35.450 --> 01:39.020
Then this is going to be handling the navigation.

01:39.320 --> 01:51.050
So we are going to wait for home page to be visible and we get it by find by a test ID and it is home

01:51.050 --> 01:58.400
page and we expect this home page to be in the document.

01:58.730 --> 02:06.380
But before saving this test, let's make sure we have corresponding handler here for the authentication.

02:06.380 --> 02:13.970
So in app component, we didn't handle the the logging cases so far, so there is no rest handler.

02:14.420 --> 02:18.210
Let's add that one rest post.

02:18.210 --> 02:29.870
The request will go to the API one zero ODE and let's just return a success response from this one.

02:31.890 --> 02:45.450
Response context status is 200 and let's return a JSON and return the ID as one and username as a user

02:45.600 --> 02:46.320
one.

02:47.380 --> 02:53.410
So this is the end point and is returning this data for the success case.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.200
And let's save this.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.640
And it as our passing.
