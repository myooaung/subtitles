00:03.260 --> 00:11.000
Now let's add the same test for the just setup so we will have a new test after this.

00:11.000 --> 00:11.960
Failing one.

00:12.530 --> 00:17.540
Just copying the test description from the karma.

00:19.370 --> 00:23.810
It's hide spinner after sign up request fails

00:26.990 --> 00:32.270
so we will repeat the steps we see in the previous test.

00:32.720 --> 00:41.990
So we are going to call the setup form, click the button, wait for the error message to appear and

00:43.370 --> 00:46.610
we are not going to do anything with this error message variable.

00:46.610 --> 00:53.300
We just use it as a reference to UI is at the state after the API request.

00:53.450 --> 01:06.410
Now we are going to check the the status, the spinner and we are expecting that spinner not to be in

01:06.410 --> 01:08.960
the document saving this one.

01:10.620 --> 01:13.800
And here we can see the test is passing.
