00:03.650 --> 00:08.450
Now let's add the same test for the just opening the logging component.

00:08.450 --> 00:08.810
Just.

00:08.810 --> 00:09.380
Yes.

00:09.740 --> 00:17.500
And again, we are going to add the test to the interactions here, and I'm just going to copy it.

00:17.510 --> 00:20.540
This test, it displays validation coming from back end.

00:21.800 --> 00:38.990
So copying this one pasting here in this one, it just clearing its clears authentication fail message

00:38.990 --> 00:43.640
when the email field is changed.

00:44.240 --> 00:48.050
So this is the failing conditions.

00:48.050 --> 00:51.590
So we are waiting for this error message to be visible.

00:51.650 --> 00:56.270
Then we can update the email input.

00:56.270 --> 01:07.070
So we will use user event type and we are going to fill the email input with a new value like let's

01:07.070 --> 01:09.820
say new at mail.

01:09.830 --> 01:10.320
Com.

01:10.400 --> 01:19.430
But we need to define this as a variable here instead of form we are querying.

01:19.430 --> 01:22.160
So let's have email input.

01:23.240 --> 01:29.720
It is the input element and we have password input.

01:32.030 --> 01:38.600
So our input and we will assign them here.

01:41.350 --> 01:43.900
And this is for the password.

01:46.440 --> 01:55.260
So in this test, after we receive the error, we are updating the email input and we are expecting

01:55.260 --> 01:58.830
this error message not to be in the document.

01:59.430 --> 02:06.390
We have a reference to it, but after the the email value is changed, the error must be gone.

02:06.810 --> 02:07.950
Saving this one.

02:12.770 --> 02:13.970
This is working.

02:13.970 --> 02:15.260
And let's add the.

02:16.350 --> 02:17.580
That's for the password.

02:17.580 --> 02:23.760
So it clears authentication fail message when password field is changed.

02:24.390 --> 02:33.000
So again, we are displaying the error message, but this time we will update the password input with.

02:34.350 --> 02:36.430
Pass word to.

02:37.860 --> 02:40.470
And the message will be gone.

02:40.470 --> 02:41.670
Saving this.

02:45.860 --> 02:47.810
And the tests are passing.
