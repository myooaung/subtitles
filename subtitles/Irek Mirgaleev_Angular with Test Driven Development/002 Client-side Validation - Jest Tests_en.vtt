00:03.240 --> 00:07.170
Now let's add the same set of tests for the chest pass.

00:07.170 --> 00:17.070
So opening the sign up component just as and just like having the new described look for.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.440
The validations in the karma.

00:20.540 --> 00:27.110
I will do the same thing here, having the validation and

00:30.200 --> 00:35.900
I'm just going to copy the tests from the karma part.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.210
I don't want to make a typo here.

00:40.140 --> 00:51.720
So just commenting about this one and the next one in this one, we are having this set up right here,

00:51.720 --> 00:53.250
which is rendering the component.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.960
So we will do that.

00:55.110 --> 01:03.570
We will use that we are going set up and let's make sure that this are async here.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.390
Same in the next one as well.

01:07.170 --> 01:13.620
Now we are going to look for a message and in testing library we are able to query the elements based

01:13.620 --> 01:16.170
on the text content we are looking for.

01:16.260 --> 01:23.640
So let's make sure we have this message as a variable here and let's just copy the message.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.720
Username is required before we do anything.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.340
We are going to create this text.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.680
It's not going to be in the page.

01:31.680 --> 01:42.000
So we are expecting a screen query by text and the text is this message right here.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.010
It's not going to be to be in the document.

01:47.520 --> 01:52.110
Then we are going to let's get the username input.

01:52.110 --> 01:56.460
We are going to focus to that one and blur from it.

01:56.460 --> 02:09.770
And let's get the element by label text and the label is username and we are using user events for the

02:10.140 --> 02:17.640
the user events like clicking to the username input here.

02:18.480 --> 02:27.180
Then we are going to blur it and for that one we can use user events tab functionality like hitting

02:27.180 --> 02:33.990
the tab or keyword to focus to the next element in that page so we can use this one.

02:34.590 --> 02:38.460
And then we are going to check this one once again.

02:38.460 --> 02:42.150
But this time the message will be visible.

02:44.590 --> 02:49.180
And for the next test, we will repeat the steps once again.

02:50.500 --> 02:54.970
Just copying these four lines.

02:56.920 --> 03:03.790
And in this one the message will be username must be at least four characters long.

03:07.480 --> 03:16.690
Now we are going to enter value to this user inputs and we are going to do it by user event type to

03:16.690 --> 03:20.710
this user name input and the value will be 1 to 3.

03:21.880 --> 03:29.740
And then again, we can use this tab to focus somewhere else and also copying the aspect part.

03:31.390 --> 03:33.220
And that's it.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.190
Let's save this one.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.740
And here is the artists are passing.
