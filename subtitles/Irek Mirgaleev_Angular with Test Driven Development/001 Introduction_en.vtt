00:03.380 --> 00:08.360
Hello and welcome to this course about angler with taste and development.

00:08.780 --> 00:10.630
My name is Bashar Karaman.

00:11.650 --> 00:15.460
In this course, we will be building a web application with Angular.

00:15.490 --> 00:18.460
One of the most used framework in front end world.

00:19.240 --> 00:26.080
Compared to other popular component libraries, Angular is full blown front and framework, but this

00:26.080 --> 00:27.910
course is not just about Angular.

00:28.030 --> 00:34.120
It is also about how to apply test driven development in a project from the very first requirement.

00:35.270 --> 00:39.650
We won't be doing any implementation before adding a test for that requirement.

00:40.710 --> 00:43.050
Bangalore has its own test setup.

00:43.140 --> 00:50.910
We will use it, but also we will practice an alternative set up by using the most popular test tools

00:50.910 --> 00:52.410
in JavaScript world.

00:53.010 --> 00:59.550
And that is set up can easily be applied to projects for view, react or Swelled.

01:01.350 --> 01:05.820
This course is built on top of an actual application from beginning to the end.

01:06.180 --> 01:13.500
And instead of showing the building blocks of Angular in an unrelated context, we see all of the pieces

01:13.500 --> 01:15.510
together in this application.

01:15.720 --> 01:21.630
So this project is creating a context and bringing the requirements for a web application.

01:21.870 --> 01:27.280
So in this way, first, we understand what are the common expectations from an application?

01:27.300 --> 01:32.010
Then we practice how to satisfy those expectations with Angular.

01:32.810 --> 01:38.360
Other than angular discourse has a second major topic, and that is test driven development.

01:38.450 --> 01:45.560
We will be having lots of test cases during development and we will do a lot of refactoring and we are

01:45.560 --> 01:52.100
going to feel how the test driven development is liberating us about the way we implement our solution.

01:52.980 --> 01:56.370
I hope you are as excited as I am to start this course.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.950
Let's start building this application.
