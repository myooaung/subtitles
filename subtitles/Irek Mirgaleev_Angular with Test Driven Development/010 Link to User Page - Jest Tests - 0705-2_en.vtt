00:03.200 --> 00:10.150
Now we have this navigation test for the spec and let's add the same test for the chest parts.

00:10.310 --> 00:14.630
Just copying the test description and opening up component.

00:15.350 --> 00:24.200
Just as in the component, we had the implementation for the server rest handler for getting the users

00:24.200 --> 00:26.870
and this is returning to the user one.

00:26.870 --> 00:30.740
So for the API request part, we don't need to do anything.

00:31.250 --> 00:33.530
All we will do is just add the test here.

00:33.530 --> 00:43.370
So just adding the test to the bottom so it navigates to user page by clicking the username on the user

00:43.370 --> 00:43.550
list.

00:43.550 --> 00:46.130
So this is async.

00:47.450 --> 00:52.310
So we are calling setup, we are going to the home page.

00:53.150 --> 01:00.620
Then we are waiting for user one to appear because in home page we will make the API call to this end

01:00.620 --> 01:04.580
point and it's going to be returning this user back.

01:04.850 --> 01:11.570
So we are going to get the user and we will wait for that user to appear.

01:11.570 --> 01:16.820
Find by text user one.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.810
Then we are going to click to the element having this user which is list item.

01:24.020 --> 01:30.320
So we call user event, click to user.

01:30.530 --> 01:34.790
Let's change it to user list item.

01:37.260 --> 01:45.600
So we are clicking the list item, then this will trigger the navigation and just copying this one.

01:45.900 --> 01:49.740
This is going to be opening the user page.

01:49.740 --> 01:57.330
So we are waiting for user page to be visible and we are doing that search and saving this.

02:00.130 --> 02:02.410
And tests are passing.
