00:03.140 --> 00:06.290
Now let's update this style of this form.

00:07.240 --> 00:07.840
For this one.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.430
I'm going to use bootstrap.

00:09.430 --> 00:21.760
And what I will do is just here in this CSS link, I will just copy this CD URL, just this ref.

00:22.420 --> 00:24.490
Then going back to the project.

00:25.960 --> 00:32.950
In the project, we apply the global styles into the styles CSS it's under.

00:34.380 --> 00:36.180
This I see right here.

00:37.560 --> 00:44.130
And we are going to import a URL and that URL is the one.

00:44.130 --> 00:46.080
I just copied this one.

00:46.970 --> 00:49.070
And let's save this one.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.320
Now we see its effect.

00:52.340 --> 00:54.830
We see the the text is changed.

00:54.830 --> 00:57.020
Also, the button style is changed.

00:57.260 --> 01:02.780
Now we are going to use the styles to bootstrap styles in the application.

01:02.780 --> 01:05.780
And the first thing is in the app component.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.310
App component is HTML.

01:08.330 --> 01:10.430
I'm just going to wrap this up.

01:10.430 --> 01:12.680
Sign up with a div.

01:14.330 --> 01:19.160
And indicative I will set the style container.

01:19.490 --> 01:24.110
This is adding spacing around the the main content.

01:24.140 --> 01:28.610
In this one it's not that easy to see but if you go full screen.

01:29.500 --> 01:33.220
Here we see the form is having space around it.

01:33.400 --> 01:42.040
And I'll also I will be adding spacing to the top of this container and I'm going to use the utility

01:42.040 --> 01:51.820
classes of bootstrap and it is p t padding top and the number is three.

01:52.150 --> 02:00.610
So like if you open the bootstrap and if you go to the utilities for spacing.

02:02.560 --> 02:06.040
We have the margin or padding.

02:07.530 --> 02:14.850
And also it has the directions like the top button and start and.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.580
And these are the other options.

02:18.790 --> 02:22.900
And we have the size value added to it.

02:23.020 --> 02:26.680
And the size are like this from 0 to 5.

02:26.680 --> 02:31.270
And there is this auto bootstrap has this spacer value.

02:31.270 --> 02:39.070
And basically the, the number we are setting is used as a multiplier for that one.

02:39.070 --> 02:43.860
So if it's at one, then we get the quarter of that spacer.

02:43.870 --> 02:52.990
If we set two, then we get half of the spacer and if we set the three we get, we get the full spacer

02:53.500 --> 02:59.770
and as we increase, the space is increased like this.

03:00.010 --> 03:02.950
So I've added padding to top.

03:04.080 --> 03:10.920
And here we have spacing between top of the page and the top of the content.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.550
Now I'm going to.

03:15.300 --> 03:20.820
Use the bootstrap cart for this form.

03:20.820 --> 03:30.060
So having another div rapping all the content and it has this cart and moving all content into this

03:30.300 --> 03:30.860
div.

03:30.870 --> 03:34.140
So if I save at this point, it's not going to show too much.

03:34.140 --> 03:38.220
But now we are seeing a border around the the form.

03:38.670 --> 03:51.270
Then we can use other cards of styles like we can set this h one to be in the class card.

03:51.390 --> 03:52.320
Heather.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.810
And moving this one into that card header.

03:56.810 --> 04:03.410
Now the card header has the style and the header sign up text is in it.

04:03.800 --> 04:10.100
By the way, let's move the text to the center and we can do it by the text center.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.420
Class of bootstrap.

04:12.370 --> 04:13.180
Like this.

04:14.130 --> 04:19.170
And then we have this form so the form can have the.

04:21.140 --> 04:24.560
Class of card, buddy.

04:26.110 --> 04:35.500
And let's have the form style for each of the label and input bootstrap as the classes for the label,

04:35.500 --> 04:45.460
class, form, label and for the input class is form control.

04:45.760 --> 04:51.700
So if I save like this now the label is here and the input is below that.

04:51.700 --> 04:58.870
And when I focus to the input, I get this blue focus color around that input.

05:00.980 --> 05:08.330
Let's also add spacing between this these two label inputs pair with the others.

05:08.510 --> 05:16.730
So having another div here and moving this one for this one, we can add spacing again, we can add

05:17.060 --> 05:22.580
margin to the bottom like this and B and again, we can go with three.

05:23.030 --> 05:31.520
So we have full spacing again and we are going to repeat same thing for the others as well.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.430
So for this label.

05:35.600 --> 05:42.860
Just copying this class form label from the username and pasting to the label.

05:42.860 --> 05:47.580
Email label password and label password.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.260
Repeat.

05:50.740 --> 05:57.610
And copying the form control class from input and pasting to email input.

05:59.140 --> 06:02.890
Password input and password repeat input.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.040
Now it looks better.

06:05.050 --> 06:09.400
Let's also wrap all of them with this div.

06:11.250 --> 06:15.600
All label input pairs like this or having another.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.410
They're right here.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.970
And the next one for the password.

06:24.970 --> 06:28.630
And the last one is for the password.

06:29.290 --> 06:30.250
Repeat.

06:32.670 --> 06:34.650
So this looks better.

06:34.650 --> 06:45.300
So if I just click to the inputs, the the focus is more obvious or if I just click to the label again,

06:45.300 --> 06:48.510
we see which input is focused.

06:49.560 --> 06:54.060
And for the button, let's move the button to the center as well.

06:54.060 --> 06:56.460
So just wrapping it with another div.

06:57.540 --> 07:04.710
And moving this button into the state and setting the class as text center.

07:06.940 --> 07:13.270
And also let's at the colossus of the bootstrap for the button BTN and BTN primary.

07:13.270 --> 07:15.340
So it's going to have the primary color.

07:16.350 --> 07:17.190
Like this.

07:17.760 --> 07:25.500
At the moment the button is disabled, so we have this a bit fade out version of the primary colour.

07:25.500 --> 07:32.010
But as soon as the password and password repeat are same, now we get the the primary colour.

07:33.060 --> 07:37.710
Bootstrap also has the styling for the different screen sizes.

07:37.710 --> 07:45.090
So if I go full screen right here now the form is spreading to the whole page.

07:45.090 --> 07:51.360
But let's make sure it's fitting to the centre like we fit it to the centre of the page.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.570
And to do that we can again.

07:54.570 --> 07:57.990
Let's wrap whole thing with another div.

07:59.330 --> 08:03.200
And just moving this into that new div.

08:04.190 --> 08:08.420
Now we are going to use the columns of the bootstrap.

08:08.450 --> 08:20.660
The page is split into 12 columns and we can make our form to to contain a couple of those columns based

08:20.660 --> 08:22.460
on the screen sizes.

08:22.460 --> 08:26.570
The screen size has options like the large, medium, small.

08:26.570 --> 08:28.370
So we are going to use them as well.

08:28.370 --> 08:33.800
So for this one, we want this form to be having.

08:34.760 --> 08:39.980
Like in large screen, it's going to be taking six columns.

08:40.160 --> 08:46.070
So this call log six means it's going to take six columns of it in a large screen.

08:46.640 --> 08:50.060
And if I save it.

08:51.270 --> 08:53.190
In this screen, we don't see difference.

08:53.190 --> 09:00.180
But if I go to the full screen window now, we have this layout.

09:00.180 --> 09:04.050
So the form is taking half of the screen.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.890
But let's make sure it's it's more in the center.

09:07.890 --> 09:16.080
There are six more columns in this page, so we can set an offset for this one.

09:16.080 --> 09:24.240
So like we can say, let's have three columns on the left, then add the six columns of this content,

09:24.240 --> 09:27.180
then the remaining will be three columns as well.

09:27.180 --> 09:29.100
So it's going to be in the center.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.130
So like here we can say.

09:33.250 --> 09:34.120
Offset.

09:34.630 --> 09:39.280
LG So in large screen the offset will be three saving it.

09:40.330 --> 09:46.600
And if I check once again now we have offset of three like here.

09:49.800 --> 09:54.690
And here we can highlight this part like this called LLG.

09:54.720 --> 10:03.570
So this is the the blue part is the main content and the the offset is the orange part.

10:03.570 --> 10:07.380
So we have equal spacing around the form at the moment.

10:08.490 --> 10:12.750
And just like I said, there is different screen size versions.

10:12.750 --> 10:18.150
So like if the screen is smaller, then let's say call.

10:18.300 --> 10:24.180
And so if the screen size is medium, then let's make sure we take eight of 12 columns.

10:24.300 --> 10:31.080
And then for that case, the offset of medium will be two saving it.

10:33.290 --> 10:41.960
So for checking this one, we can use the responsive layout functionality and we can change the screen

10:41.960 --> 10:48.620
size right here to see how it is looking for different screen resolutions.

10:51.190 --> 10:54.390
We are not going to go into too much about the bootstrap.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.650
This is the style I'm going to apply.

10:56.680 --> 10:59.840
If you want to learn more about Bootstrap.

10:59.860 --> 11:07.480
Just check the documentation of it and go with the way you want to implement your form style.
