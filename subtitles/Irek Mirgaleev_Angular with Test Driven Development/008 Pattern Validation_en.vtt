00:03.190 --> 00:06.700
Now let's add additional validations for these fields.

00:06.820 --> 00:14.590
So far we are checking only the required validation for the email and password, but Engler has the

00:14.590 --> 00:21.880
validators for the email type, or we can use the pattern for the password, so let's do that.

00:22.390 --> 00:32.530
So adding a new test and this is for email and this time we will validate this to be entry in email

00:32.530 --> 00:32.950
format.

00:32.950 --> 00:36.760
So I'm just typing something not in email format.

00:36.760 --> 00:46.630
So this is wrong format and this is going to be displaying the message invalid email address.

00:46.930 --> 00:51.880
So basically this validation will require something matching to the email pattern.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.040
So let's say this one.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.160
So it is failing.

00:59.210 --> 01:00.680
Let's fix it.

01:01.250 --> 01:09.440
So for the email, other than the required, we will add the second validator and that is for the data's

01:09.470 --> 01:10.280
email.

01:11.600 --> 01:22.230
So this is going to be serving email error when it is not matching to the the email pattern.

01:22.250 --> 01:27.260
So here in this block, we can check else if.

01:28.390 --> 01:29.230
Fields.

01:31.410 --> 01:33.600
As field errors.

01:35.040 --> 01:40.260
If there is anything about email, then we can return this message.

01:40.770 --> 01:44.940
Invalid email address.

01:46.180 --> 01:49.900
So let's save this one.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.000
And the test is passing.

01:54.570 --> 02:00.080
Let's test this on browser here in the email input.

02:00.090 --> 02:10.230
I'm just typing in a value a, b, c, it's showing this invalid email address heading sign mail dot

02:10.230 --> 02:10.740
com.

02:10.740 --> 02:14.160
And here we see that validation is passing.

02:14.250 --> 02:18.570
Now for the password, let's add the validation for the pattern.

02:19.260 --> 02:22.380
So let's add a new test here.

02:22.530 --> 02:27.120
Just copying the, the one for the password paste in here.

02:27.120 --> 02:33.450
So as a value just typing password, it's all letters in lowercase.

02:33.540 --> 02:45.600
And the error message we are going to see is password must have at least one uppercase, one lowercase

02:45.600 --> 02:48.900
letter and one number.

02:49.230 --> 02:53.790
So this is the message we are looking for saving this one.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.170
So it is failing.

02:58.020 --> 03:02.130
And we will add a validator for password.

03:02.460 --> 03:07.020
And for this one, we are going to use a regex for this pattern.

03:07.140 --> 03:15.630
So we have this validators pattern and this is looking for pattern here.

03:15.810 --> 03:19.680
And I'm pasting the pattern right here.

03:19.680 --> 03:27.330
So basically, this is a regex looking for lowercase letters, uppercase letters and number.

03:27.330 --> 03:32.040
So it is looking for these to be existing in the value.

03:32.550 --> 03:39.570
So after that validation fails, we can check it right here.

03:39.570 --> 03:40.770
So right here.

03:41.160 --> 03:45.120
Else if failed errors.

03:46.470 --> 03:47.280
Pattern.

03:47.280 --> 03:52.500
If it is failing with the pattern, then we can return the message.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.980
Just going to copy the message from the test.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.020
Right here.

03:58.030 --> 03:58.750
This one.

04:01.050 --> 04:03.230
It's earning this message.

04:04.070 --> 04:06.920
So saving these changes.

04:08.930 --> 04:11.720
And the tests are passing.

04:11.720 --> 04:19.910
So this one is passing and we can add other variations for this one like here, copying it, pasting

04:20.240 --> 04:20.900
right here.

04:20.900 --> 04:33.860
The value is like, let's say lowercase and uppercase letters or just lowercase and number.

04:33.950 --> 04:42.590
So this is a failure case and all also like all uppercase and just number.

04:42.590 --> 04:45.080
So these are all failing cases.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.040
Let's save this.

04:47.770 --> 04:57.100
And here we see all of them are failing because we need to have at least one lowercase, one uppercase

04:57.100 --> 04:58.750
and one number.

04:59.170 --> 05:00.970
So the tests are passing.

05:00.970 --> 05:05.650
And let's also add the same test for the just part.

05:05.980 --> 05:10.300
So here, just copying the email pasting.

05:10.300 --> 05:17.260
Here, the value is like this wrong format and the message will be.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.850
Invalid email address.

05:25.850 --> 05:30.710
And adding the test for the password pattern.

05:31.410 --> 05:34.800
So this is password.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.210
And this is the message.

05:42.750 --> 05:50.550
And also just adding to other variations like.

05:53.180 --> 05:54.440
Only letters.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.660
That's a lowercase letter and number.

05:59.900 --> 06:10.820
Uppercase letter N number and just console is open here is formatting the table here saving it.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.530
And the tests are passing.
