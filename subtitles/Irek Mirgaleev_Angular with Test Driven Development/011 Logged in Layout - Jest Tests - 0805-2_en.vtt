WEBVTT

00:03.500 --> 00:09.650
Now let's add the same test for the chest opening up component.

00:09.650 --> 00:10.080
Just.

00:10.080 --> 00:10.660
Yes.

00:11.960 --> 00:13.550
Let's refactor this.

00:13.940 --> 00:20.600
The setup part we have refactored the one in the component spec as well.

00:20.900 --> 00:27.740
We are not going to use the email input or password input in this one and we can simplify it by just

00:27.740 --> 00:29.900
moving it here.

00:30.050 --> 00:40.140
And we are not going to take an overriding value for email and just doing this for password.

00:40.910 --> 00:46.220
So removing the param, so the setup form is like this.

00:46.220 --> 00:51.110
Then we are checking the home page visibility after clicking the login.

00:51.350 --> 01:00.950
Now let's add the next test and we can just copy the test name from EBP spec.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.020
So it hides.

01:03.810 --> 01:05.400
Sign up and login.

01:08.010 --> 01:12.660
So adding that test it hides login and sign up.

01:13.290 --> 01:14.550
And

01:17.190 --> 01:19.950
now we are going to call setup form.

01:19.950 --> 01:24.150
But before clicking button, let's let's do the test like this.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.280
Let's query the the links first.

01:26.280 --> 01:35.520
So we we get login link and it is screen get by roll.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.840
And this is Link.

01:38.860 --> 01:41.800
And name is Logan.

01:42.130 --> 01:44.080
And let's also get the.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.760
Sign up link.

01:47.790 --> 01:51.300
So we have the reference to the visible elements.

01:51.300 --> 01:55.230
They are visible at the moment and we are clicking to the button.

01:55.740 --> 02:01.380
Then let's wait for this homepage to be visible.

02:03.160 --> 02:07.030
Now we can assert the these links to be.

02:07.600 --> 02:16.630
So we expect this looking link not to be in the document.

02:16.930 --> 02:26.470
And also we expect this sign up sign up uplink not to be in the document as well.

02:26.620 --> 02:28.240
So let's save this one.

02:32.580 --> 02:41.850
Now the test is failing here because it is seeing the element is there.

02:42.990 --> 02:51.510
And when testing in in the just in the testing library, instead of like relying on the visibility of

02:51.510 --> 02:57.270
home page, like at the moment the homepage like we are searching this thing as soon as the homepage

02:57.270 --> 02:57.810
is visible.

02:57.810 --> 03:04.860
But in fact if we check to look in component so we are triggering the navigation, then we are setting

03:04.860 --> 03:06.180
the logged in user.

03:06.180 --> 03:13.260
So that doesn't necessarily mean the navigation completion make the UI to be having logged in layout

03:13.260 --> 03:13.860
in the end.

03:13.860 --> 03:21.600
So for this case, let's open up component just as now.

03:21.600 --> 03:30.060
We don't need to wait for this homepage visibility, but we can wait for like this login link to be

03:30.060 --> 03:30.630
gone.

03:31.200 --> 03:42.030
And the testing library Angular has a function wait for element to be removed so we can use this one

03:42.210 --> 03:42.870
right here.

03:42.870 --> 03:49.080
We can say we are going to wait, wait for element to be removed and we are going to wait for this login

03:49.080 --> 03:50.640
link to be gone.

03:52.330 --> 03:55.270
Then we can do the sovereign part.

03:55.420 --> 03:57.010
We don't need this line anymore.

03:57.010 --> 04:02.740
Expecting this login link not to be in the document because this one is already making sure it is happening.

04:03.310 --> 04:08.110
And then we can check sign up link not to be in the document here.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.040
Let's save it.

04:13.290 --> 04:15.360
And tests are passing.

04:15.390 --> 04:17.070
Let's add the next test.

04:18.140 --> 04:19.400
The component.

04:20.160 --> 04:24.150
Spike this now we are going to display my profile link.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.940
So here it

04:32.610 --> 04:36.300
displays my profile link after successful login.

04:41.130 --> 04:47.280
Again, we are filling the form in the setup form now this time.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.380
We are going to see this link.

04:49.380 --> 04:53.160
But before we click to the button, let's make sure it is not there.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.140
So let's do this.

04:55.140 --> 04:59.790
Expect screen query by role.

04:59.790 --> 05:02.400
We are creating an element which is not there.

05:02.400 --> 05:14.250
So if we are using query by functionality and element I role is link and the text is my profile.

05:14.250 --> 05:19.170
So we are expecting this not to be in the document.

05:20.280 --> 05:32.220
Then we are going to click to the button and this is going to be triggering all the the changes.

05:32.250 --> 05:40.560
Then we can query the visibility of this my profile link, but there are async operations here so we

05:40.560 --> 05:44.310
can use screen find by role.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.600
We can wait here.

05:45.810 --> 05:58.650
Let's say this is my profile link and we expect my profile link to be in the document saving this one.

06:02.150 --> 06:03.890
And this is also passing.

06:04.010 --> 06:07.970
And let's add the last test components back.

06:08.210 --> 06:12.350
This is for the routing of the my profile link.

06:14.420 --> 06:17.840
So EP just.

06:20.060 --> 06:25.160
It's this place user page

06:28.220 --> 06:36.410
again filling the form and we are going to click to the button.

06:38.420 --> 06:40.550
So this is handling the.

06:41.700 --> 06:42.390
Logan.

06:42.390 --> 06:48.330
So we will get the high profile link and we are going to click to this my profile link.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.240
The weight is relevant.

06:52.270 --> 06:55.540
Click my profile link.

06:56.440 --> 07:01.000
Now this is going to be triggering the navigation.

07:01.330 --> 07:05.110
So we are going to wait for a page to be visible.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.940
So this is the page.

07:08.410 --> 07:09.730
This is user page.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.230
User page will be visible.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.750
Let's wait until that page is shown.

07:14.170 --> 07:20.890
But also we will see the user name because that page will be loading user information from back end

07:20.890 --> 07:22.510
and it will be displaying that username.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.240
So let's query the visibility of the header.

07:26.870 --> 07:31.040
And we will wait for find by Roe.

07:31.520 --> 07:38.450
We are looking for a heading to be visible, which will be having the name of that user, which is user

07:38.450 --> 07:39.170
one.

07:39.560 --> 07:47.600
And we expect this header to be in the document, by the way.

07:47.720 --> 07:53.000
Before saving this one, I'm going to check the the the rest handler here.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.850
So this is the old end point.

07:55.850 --> 08:03.890
And in the success response it is returning back to ID, which we need and the username as well.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.390
We need this one because we are using it in the my profiling.

08:08.390 --> 08:13.460
And when we click to the my profile, it's going to be opening the user page and that user page will

08:13.460 --> 08:16.550
be making a get request to this end point.

08:16.820 --> 08:25.130
And basically this is going to be returning the the ID and that username and user email in the response.

08:25.130 --> 08:32.720
So we will be taking that username from this one and display it on the UI, saving this one.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.640
Now we have a failure.

08:39.030 --> 08:45.130
That's because now we are querying the visibility of this username.

08:45.150 --> 08:50.310
User one But it is visible in the in the profile card.

08:50.320 --> 08:59.880
So if we open the user component here like the user information is in this app profile card, but in

08:59.880 --> 09:03.510
the app component test, component, just test.

09:03.690 --> 09:07.050
We didn't declare the component.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.780
We didn't need that one until now.

09:09.780 --> 09:13.380
So we are going to use profile card component here.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.000
Let's save this.

09:19.410 --> 09:21.300
And the tests are passing now.
