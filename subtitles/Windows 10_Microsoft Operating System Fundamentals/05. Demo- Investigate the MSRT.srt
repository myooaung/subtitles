1
00:00:01,845 --> 00:00:04,535
Now let's look at the Malicious Software Removal Tool.

2
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:07,405
Again, you'll probably notice that if you run an update,

3
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:11,407
let me go into Start Settings, and we go to Update and Security,

4
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:14,541
and it looks like I haven't done updates for a while here,

5
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:17,899
so if I click this to start a search, and if we're patient,

6
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:21,825
I don't know if I have the patience to have us sit here and wait,

7
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:27,519
but you may see flash by Malicious Software Removal Tool for the current month.

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,626
Guess I ran out of patience sooner than I thought.

9
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:36,190
I'll right click my PowerShell icon, choose Run as Administrator.

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,529
You always want to start PowerShell as an administrator,

11
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:41,328
so it can do what you want it to do,

12
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:44,370
and if you type mrt that will launch the current,

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,382
whatever the most current MSRT tool is on your system.

14
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,861
I'm recording this video in January 2018,

15
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:53,341
so this looks like the current version.

16
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:55,479
There's a link to the documentation.

17
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:59,555
There's a link to the specific threats that it seeks to destroy.

18
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:03,310
Now these are going to be Zero-Day or previously Zero-Day

19
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,297
threats that Microsoft now has a remedy for.

20
00:01:07,297 --> 00:01:12,043
So this is only going to look for machines that are already infected

21
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:16,050
with one or more of these malicious software packages.

22
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,636
If we click Next we can do a quick scan, full scan, or a customized scan.

23
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:22,208
I'm going to choose quick scan,

24
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:25,450
and I'm hoping that we're not going to have any infection.

25
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,155
Good news.

26
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:27,861
No malicious software was detected,

27
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:31,131
and there's a link to view detailed results of the scan.

28
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:34,436
This is just a graphical little window as I'm scrolling through,

29
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:38,560
but if you want a more permanent log you can actually get to that.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,806
Let me open up my PowerShell prompt, and do notepad,

31
00:01:41,806 --> 00:01:45,368
and I'm going to path out to C:\Windows\debug\mrt.

32
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:45,934
log.

33
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:53,105
Let me bring this down so you can see that path again.

34
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:53,746
C:\Windows\debug\mrt.

35
00:01:53,746 --> 00:02:00,000
log. Any time you or Windows runs the tool you'll see those results.
