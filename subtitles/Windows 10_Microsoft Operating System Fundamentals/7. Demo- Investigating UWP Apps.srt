1
00:00:01,714 --> 00:00:06,240
In this demonstration we'll spend some time with more of the UWP

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,017
apps than desktop apps because I trust you're pretty good with

3
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:12,337
traditional desktop applications.

4
00:00:12,337 --> 00:00:14,665
In the Start menu, as I mentioned before,

5
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:18,728
any application that you install, like I've installed Auslogics Disk Defrag,

6
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:21,095
this is a traditional desktop app.

7
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:25,310
Now apps can be written to work under standard user

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,743
permission or administrative permission.

9
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:29,912
If you see User Account Control pop-up,

10
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:33,797
then this is indicative that Disk Defrag needs a higher level

11
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:36,102
of privilege than other applications do,

12
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:39,679
but it's still not the robust security that you get

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,229
with the Universal Windows Apps.

14
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:42,898
Now again, we'll open up Start,

15
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:47,363
and then if we scroll down we can see some of the UWP apps.

16
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:51,112
The one that I tend to go to just habitually is weather.

17
00:00:51,112 --> 00:00:54,362
So let me right-click this, pin it to Start,

18
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:57,163
and then click it to open the application,

19
00:00:57,163 --> 00:01:01,529
and it doesn't open full screen like the old Windows 8 apps run.

20
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,551
Looks like I've got, yet again, some internet problems,

21
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:08,035
so I'm going to pause the video to fix that problem.

22
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:11,092
Okay, we're back in business, and so as I was saying,

23
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:14,376
you can maximize, minimize, and restore this.

24
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:17,002
It doesn't occupy the entire screen.

25
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:21,517
We have various controls that if you hover over them they're a tool tip.

26
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:25,661
All of this stuff is marked in the Universal Windows Platform

27
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:27,899
specification that Microsoft publishes,

28
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:32,105
and the Application Programming Interface or API.

29
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:34,729
As I said, from a security context,

30
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,102
these run in a much more secure sandboxed way.

31
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:43,267
They're much more self-contained than the traditional desktop applications are.

32
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:45,756
Then we close and come back to the start menu.

33
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:47,684
We right-click and resize this.

34
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:49,227
I'll make it large.

35
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:52,107
I'll right-click it again, and go to More,

36
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:55,977
and Turn Live Tile on to make this widget actually come alive.

37
00:01:55,977 --> 00:02:00,743
So this is what I meant by the fact that the Universal Windows

38
00:02:00,743 --> 00:02:04,705
Applications are actually more than just a static icon.

39
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:08,003
Normally an icon for an application doesn't do anything,

40
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:11,802
but with the advent of the iPhone and mobile devices where

41
00:02:11,802 --> 00:02:14,236
the icons actually reflect real stuff,

42
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:17,844
like the clock icon on iPhone will actually display

43
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:20,192
the honest to goodness correct time.

44
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:23,534
If you go under Cortana or Start and type Start settings

45
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:27,418
we can go under System settings here, and Use Start full screen,

46
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:32,275
if we turn that to On let's take a look at the ramification there.

47
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:34,477
Well, we don't have much to see here,

48
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:38,695
but if we had more live tiles on the screen it would fill out the

49
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:41,646
screen much more like what we see in Windows 8.

50
00:02:41,646 --> 00:02:43,221
1 and old Windows 8.

51
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:47,905
Let me come back to System settings, turn off Use Start full screen.

52
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:50,586
Now as far as controlling application behavior,

53
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:51,957
like we said before,

54
00:02:51,957 --> 00:02:56,696
we can right-click an empty area of the taskbar and open up Task Manager,

55
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:59,692
and there there's Startup, and there's also Services.

56
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:04,790
Often times you can improve the security and performance of a system by

57
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,015
stopping services that are not necessary for your use case.

58
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:12,311
This is, again, a case where you want to do due diligence and research.

59
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:16,922
Just because a service looks unfamiliar to you does not mean that it is.

60
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:18,669
Like BITS, for instance, you might think,

61
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:21,372
well I don't want Background Intelligent Transfer Service running,

62
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:23,556
so I'm going to disable it.

63
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:26,808
Right-click, you can open up the Services console.

64
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:30,834
Unfortunately it didn't go right to BITS, but anyway, here it is.

65
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,404
If I open it up I could set it to be disabled.

66
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:33,704
Well,

67
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:37,099
you're going to have problems with Windows Update because many of

68
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,890
these services are needed directly by Windows.

69
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:40,964
On the other hand,

70
00:03:40,964 --> 00:03:43,379
as you install software sometimes they will put a

71
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,449
service in here that's set to auto-start,

72
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,956
and you may get away setting it to manual,

73
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:49,909
and only starting it when you need it,

74
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:53,797
or if it's something with much more potential blast radius,

75
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:59,171
so to speak, a service like Remote Registry for instance is fine in a business,

76
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,586
but on a stand-alone computer,

77
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:03,693
especially one that you take out to airports and cafes,

78
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:07,448
you don't want to even have the door available for

79
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,355
remote registry access on your system,

80
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:12,128
so you'd want to set that service to disabled.

81
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:15,695
Coming back to Startup, this gives us a list of auto-start programs,

82
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:20,227
as well as their startup impact, and if you right click you can disable,

83
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:23,446
you can go to the file location, which is pretty nice,

84
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:27,052
especially if you see a program listed that's unfamiliar to you.

85
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:29,135
It's nice, but like I said,

86
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:32,454
you want to go to sysinternals and download the tools.

87
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:34,828
Here's a nice site for you, live.

88
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:35,301
sysinternals.

89
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:35,773
com.

90
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:38,610
If you're not familiar with sysinternals,

91
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,457
these are all freeware system utilities designed and developed

92
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:45,024
originally by a guy name Mark Russinovich.

93
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:47,261
Mark is the CTO of Azure right now.

94
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:49,228
He's been with Microsoft for a while,

95
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:53,539
but before he was with Microsoft he and a guy named Bryce Cogswell developed

96
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:57,681
this whole suite of utilities that do very useful things.

97
00:04:57,681 --> 00:05:02,114
Microsoft bought the tools from Mark and eventually hired him.

98
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:04,213
The one that we want to look at is AutoRuns,

99
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:08,187
and there's a 32 bit version and a 64 bit version.

100
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:11,514
I'm going to right-click Autorun64, Save target as,

101
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:14,479
and I'm going to bring it down to my desktop.

102
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,611
I want to start this as an administrator,

103
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:20,775
so I'm going to right click the icon and choose Run as administrator.

104
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:25,163
I will consent that I do want to run that as an administrator, and here we go.

105
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:27,066
You'll see a lot more as an administrator,

106
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:30,105
as opposed to opening the tool as a standard user.

107
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:34,298
AutoRuns shows you everything on the system that is set to

108
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:37,081
run either on a schedule or automatically,

109
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:40,977
every time the system starts, or in the case of Internet Explorer,

110
00:05:40,977 --> 00:05:42,852
every time you start that app up.

111
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:44,970
Now notice that this is not Edge.

112
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,509
This is the Internet Explorer 11 browser that's included in

113
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:50,663
Windows 10 for backward compatibility.

114
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:53,027
I would suggest you go to the Logon page.

115
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:56,082
Now you might remember in Task Manager it only had

116
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:57,823
I think three elements listed.

117
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:02,392
Notice that we go much deeper in AutoRuns where we can see that my

118
00:06:02,392 --> 00:06:05,637
Google Chrome browser has an auto-start entry,

119
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:07,538
Windows Media Player had one,

120
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:10,607
and sometimes it can be alarming when you look at the path,

121
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:13,389
and you see that it says file not found.

122
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:14,625
What could that mean?

123
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,175
Is it nefarious?

124
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,814
Not necessarily, but it's again, potentially worth looking into.

125
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:23,286
If you right-click there's a whole bunch of stuff you can do.

126
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:27,544
Do an online search, you can look at specific properties of the executable.

127
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:29,628
You can browse to its location.

128
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:32,204
You can check its virus total scores.

129
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:36,204
All things considered, this is a tool that you want to learn to master,

130
00:06:36,204 --> 00:06:38,319
and my colleague at Pluralsight, Sami Laiho,

131
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,258
has a whole series of Pluralsight courses that dive into not only AutoRuns,

132
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:46,751
but many of the other key sysinternals utilities.

133
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:49,032
This is fantastic for malware identification,

134
00:06:49,032 --> 00:06:56,000
as well as troubleshooting, performance tuning, and optimization.
