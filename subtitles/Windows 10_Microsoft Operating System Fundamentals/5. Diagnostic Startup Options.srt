1
00:00:00,452 --> 00:00:04,424
Diagnostic Startup Options.

2
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:07,575
Now we're getting into the real meat and potatoes of

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:08,884
troubleshooting a Windows system.

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,867
We looked in the previous module at backup methods,

5
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:15,808
where you could do a System Image backup or a Recovery Drive backup,

6
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:20,106
and then if your system becomes unstable and you suspect that your Windows

7
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:23,852
installation has become hopelessly damaged or corrupt,

8
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:29,165
you have options for reinstalling Windows with the idea of fixing the problem.

9
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:31,770
This screenshot shows in the Settings application,

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,051
Update & Security, the Recovery area.

11
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:37,542
I mentioned the Reset possibility in the previous module,

12
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:41,734
notice that you can also go back to a previous version of Windows 10.

13
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:46,111
What that means is you may have the ability within a certain

14
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:49,291
timeframe to roll back out of a major update.

15
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:54,430
You know how twice a year we have a major update released by Microsoft,

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,980
it's a twice-yearly cycle,

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,600
but depending upon how Microsoft service level agreements,

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,424
or SLAs, work, that may or may not be available.

19
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:04,726
And notice down at the bottom, that Advanced startup,

20
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:08,211
that's an important control to be able to know about,

21
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:11,429
because historically in Windows if you wanted to start using

22
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:13,349
what's called the advanced startup options,

23
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:16,661
where you're booting into a recovery environment to do

24
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:19,503
troubleshooting that requires more work than just,

25
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:21,948
say, rolling back a system restore point,

26
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:26,197
you would normally have to restart the system and very early in the process,

27
00:01:26,197 --> 00:01:30,086
right between the boot, the system motherboard boot,

28
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:34,466
and when Windows takes over you would press F8 to invoke that menu.

29
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:38,119
Well, with UEFI systems in particular that's never going to work,

30
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,870
UEFI is not going to allow that, and it goes by too quickly anyway.

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,455
So I want to show you in the next demo convenient ways to

32
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:47,756
restart the system in a diagnostic mode.

33
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:51,423
The diagnostic mode in Windows 10 is called the Windows

34
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:53,454
Recovery Environment or Windows RE.

35
00:01:53,454 --> 00:01:56,777
You know that System Reserved partition that you have at the front of

36
00:01:56,777 --> 00:01:59,240
your System Drive that doesn't have a drive letter,

37
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,164
you can't interact with it directly,

38
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:03,076
that contains the Windows Recovery Environment.

39
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:07,559
You can also boot your computer off your Windows 10 DVD if you have that.

40
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:08,120
Of course,

41
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,229
you may have to adjust your UEFI or BIOS boot order to accommodate that.

42
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:16,442
If you have a Recovery Drive set up on a USB stick,

43
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:18,454
you can boot off of the USB stick.

44
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:21,813
There are a number of ways to go to get into that Windows

45
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:24,484
RE or Windows Recovery Environment.

46
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:27,454
Another way is using the System Configuration utility.

47
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:30,617
This is what you get if you type msconfig from a

48
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,342
command prompt or the Start menu.

49
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:34,854
You notice that on the boot page here you can choose if you're

50
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,685
dual botting or tri-booting your system,

51
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:39,459
you can choose a different OS to boot into,

52
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,287
and you can also customize how the boot occurs.

53
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,321
We'll talk more about Safe Mode in just a moment.

54
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:47,055
Before we get into the demo,

55
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:50,395
I want to walk you through the screens in Windows Recovery

56
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:53,182
Environment just so you're familiar with the workflow,

57
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:57,051
and then in the demo it'll become hopefully more intuitive.

58
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,294
When you reboot your system into a recovery mode,

59
00:03:00,294 --> 00:03:04,057
you have mouse support, you have the potential for network support,

60
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:09,386
the days of the old blue screen text-only interface are long gone fortunately,

61
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:11,830
you're presented with some options that you see here.

62
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,481
To continue,

63
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:15,085
which comes out of Windows Recovery Environment and

64
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:17,341
boots boots back into Windows 10, Troubleshoot,

65
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:21,086
which is what we're going to choose, or Turn off your PC.

66
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:23,775
Turn off your PC can be handy, for instance,

67
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:27,530
if the machine is suspected to be riddled with malware.

68
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,475
You want to turn it off, disconnect it from the network,

69
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:33,919
and then, again, do a diagnostic startup to get troubleshooting.

70
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,385
When you go to Troubleshoot, you see an option to reset this PC.

71
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:40,170
If you're booting from a Recovery Drive USB stick,

72
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,698
you'll see an option to recover from the Recovery Drive.

73
00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:46,404
Reset is, as I said in the previous module,

74
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:49,872
gives you a flexible option to either remove all your

75
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:53,845
personal files and reinstall Windows, or just to reinstall Windows,

76
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:55,930
what's called a refresh scenario.

77
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,498
Now from a troubleshooting perspective,

78
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:00,320
does that clear up the ghosts in the machine?

79
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,037
It really depends, quite honestly.

80
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:04,497
A lot of times big businesses, enterprises,

81
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:08,892
if a user is suspected of having an operating system problem,

82
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:12,098
their entire hard drive will just be re-imaged from scratch,

83
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:14,538
which is really a true reset operation,

84
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:19,357
but in a smaller shop you might want to think a little bit more carefully before

85
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:22,366
doing something invasive like that in the interest of time.

86
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:23,956
If you click Reset this PC,

87
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:27,109
this is where you get the choice to either keep your

88
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:30,182
files and just reinstall Windows, or remove everything,

89
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:32,591
which is what you'd do if you're going to destroy your computer,

90
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:35,067
or pass it on or sell it to someone else.

91
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,576
If you choose Advanced options,

92
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:40,373
you get a separate menu that allows you to hit System Restore.

93
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:44,243
This is good for doing restore points in an outside

94
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,258
the operating system context.

95
00:04:46,258 --> 00:04:47,734
You have System Image Recovery.

96
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:51,420
If you used the Windows 7 Backup tool to create a system image,

97
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,009
you can bring it back here.

98
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:53,747
Startup Repair,

99
00:04:53,747 --> 00:04:58,260
which looks at your boot files and will replace them with fresh

100
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,560
pristine copies form your Windows 10 installation media.

101
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,013
You can get a command prompt,

102
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:06,303
which you can get into PowerShell with and do scripting automation,

103
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:10,745
or you could do Startup Settings to change Windows startup behavior.

104
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:11,155
Again,

105
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:15,613
depending upon how long it's been since you last applied a bi-annual update,

106
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:18,137
you may have go back to the previous version,

107
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:21,099
or you may not, but if you choose Startup Settings,

108
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:24,489
you're then given a prompt to restart again,

109
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:28,771
and that is the so-called Advanced options menu that we used to,

110
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:30,229
in previous versions of Windows,

111
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,382
boot into if you held down or pressed F8 repeatedly,

112
00:05:33,382 --> 00:05:38,751
and the Startup Settings dialog looks a lot better than it used to back in,

113
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:40,813
say, Windows 98, Windows 2000 days.

114
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:43,049
But the options are largely the same.

115
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:47,581
You can do debugging mode, which is pretty much an edge case; boot logging,

116
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:52,003
where you want Windows to record a file of every boot file that it

117
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:54,514
loads into memory; low-resolution video; Safe Mode,

118
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:57,829
notice that there's three different varieties of Safe Mode.

119
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:01,630
Safe Mode is where in all likelihood you've installed a bad device

120
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,431
driver and you either have no video once you get into Windows or

121
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:09,660
it's just all wonky and messed up, or you've enabled another driver,

122
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,060
like a network driver, and it breaks connectivity.

123
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,288
Safe Mode is a really low overhead way to boot into Windows,

124
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:20,414
and you can take care of your registry and drive problems,

125
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:24,671
and then hopefully be able to start a second time into normal mode.

126
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:28,508
This is a screenshot of Windows 10 in Safe Mode.

127
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:30,663
It's quite apparent you still have to authenticate

128
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:32,239
using a local or domain account,

129
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:34,727
but it's quite apparent that you are in Safe Mode.

130
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,760
You see the build information up on the top center,

131
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,460
you see Safe Mode markers, the desktop wallpaper is black,

132
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:49,000
and most notably, the screen resolution is super-duper low, 640 x 480.
