1
00:00:01,657 --> 00:00:02,345
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:02,345 --> 00:00:05,577
I'm going to show you how the library system works in Windows 10.

3
00:00:05,577 --> 00:00:07,908
The user interface has changed a little bit,

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:11,121
but the core functionality is still the same all the

5
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:13,049
way from Windows 7 on forward.

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,468
Let's open File Explorer, and as we're working through here,

7
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:20,286
I want to show some tips and tricks here that I may not have discussed before.

8
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,799
Now when you navigate,

9
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:25,583
you notice that the File Explorer path is actually clickable.

10
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:29,782
So I'm in this path, Pluralsight, tim-warner,

11
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:30,382
microsoft-operating-system-fundamentals,

12
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:33,971
and as I go further in, you'll notice that it expands.

13
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:37,039
You can work back and forth through that directory

14
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,232
path just by clicking back and forth.

15
00:00:39,232 --> 00:00:41,807
Another thing you can do is open this chevron,

16
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:44,169
and it takes you back as far as you want,

17
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,262
all the way to the root of that local or remote volume.

18
00:00:47,262 --> 00:00:48,628
You see what I mean?

19
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:52,354
If you know where you're going, let's say I want to go to my D drive,

20
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:55,362
I can just come into this, click to the right of it,

21
00:00:55,362 --> 00:00:57,486
and that shows the actual full path.

22
00:00:57,486 --> 00:01:01,453
I might need to right-click and copy that to paste it into

23
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:03,506
a script or something else I'm doing.

24
00:01:03,506 --> 00:01:07,194
But alternatively, I can come in just like you can use a web browser,

25
00:01:07,194 --> 00:01:10,304
the address bar, to type a path, you can do that here.

26
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,666
So I'll go d:\,

27
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:17,466
and then I can just pick from the list or start to type and use tab

28
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:21,319
completion and Enter to go to a new location.

29
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,539
I want you to be aware of these as really useful power-user tricks.

30
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:28,736
The View tab is where you can get to the libraries,

31
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:32,806
and also it brings us to a discussion of this left Navigation

32
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:36,804
Pane area that you can turn on or off if you want to use it

33
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:38,419
or if you don't want to use it.

34
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:41,507
As you see, I'm opening the Navigation Pane drop-down,

35
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:43,222
and you notice Show libraries.

36
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:48,153
This is how you can show or hide the libraries in that Navigation Pane.

37
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:49,938
As you're working, frequently used folders,

38
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:53,212
you can pin them to Quick access by dragging them

39
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:55,815
over here and go under Quick access.

40
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,187
Make sure you're getting a horizontal black line,

41
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:01,958
and you're not putting it inside of an entry that's there.

42
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,450
But when you let go, it becomes pinned,

43
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,448
and you can relocate that just by dragging and dropping.

44
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:11,858
And I use that feature all the time for my current projects that I'm working on.

45
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:15,186
When you want to remove an item from Quick Access,

46
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:20,582
right-click it and choose Unpin from Quick access in the shortcut menu,

47
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:21,681
and it's gone.

48
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:23,145
So that's Quick Access.

49
00:02:23,145 --> 00:02:25,994
You also have a node for This PC,

50
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:28,831
which shows common folders in your user profile,

51
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:33,289
and then fixed drives and ones that have been mapped across the network.

52
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:36,797
Each of those drives also shows up as a separate node.

53
00:02:36,797 --> 00:02:39,222
All of this can be expanded or contracted,

54
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:42,071
and then there's a Network tab as well.

55
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:46,073
This ties into the network discovery protocols in Windows.

56
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:47,216
In the real world,

57
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:49,938
you'll find that many systems administrators do not like

58
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:52,553
those discovery protocols because number one,

59
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:53,861
they're fairly chatty.

60
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:58,319
They put out what many consider to be unnecessary network traffic,

61
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,277
and they can have security issues and unintentionally

62
00:03:01,277 --> 00:03:03,459
expose resources that users shouldn't see.

63
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:09,376
But anyway, all that is to serve the function of describing the library system.

64
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:13,191
So we have these default, or built-in libraries, as we see.

65
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:16,420
You can hide them by right-clicking and choosing Don't show

66
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,658
in navigation pane on a one-by-one basis.

67
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:23,913
If you want to hide all the libraries, I already told you about the navigation.

68
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:27,049
If we right-click a built-in library and come down to Properties,

69
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,355
it brings up a browser, really, where if we want to,

70
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:33,391
we can add additional resources to this list.

71
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:38,070
So if we use our desktop folder as a document repository,

72
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,286
we can browse to that location and choose Include folder.

73
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:45,830
The Optimize the library for allows you to choose

74
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,590
what's called a folder template, Documents,

75
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,135
Music Pictures, and Videos, and then General items are the defaults.

76
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:57,380
And the document template is what determines what view you see by

77
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,717
default and also what kind of columns you see.

78
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:03,897
Document templates are a pretty useful feature themselves.

79
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:07,872
Check the exercise files for some more information on that.

80
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,287
And actually, to that point,

81
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:14,037
I often will use this View menu here to go between the different views.

82
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:16,550
Oftentimes, when you're looking at documents,

83
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,645
it may show a view that you're not interested in,

84
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:21,210
like maybe the Content view.

85
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,462
And I'll go Details,

86
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:26,444
that happens to be my favorite view because I like being able to

87
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:29,210
quick sort on column properties like Date modified,

88
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:29,598
etc.

89
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:31,926
As far as the columns go,

90
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:35,173
you can right-click any column to turn columns on or off,

91
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:38,385
you can size the columns to fit, and if you go to More,

92
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:43,103
you can bring out additional columns and then add them to a current template.

93
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:47,206
That's in the exercise files because that goes beyond our scope for today.

94
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:49,945
Now I want to show you how to create you own library,

95
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:51,910
so let's right-click the Libraries node,

96
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,043
come down to New, Library.

97
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,165
Let's say we're performing a new research assignment,

98
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:58,470
so we've got a research project here.

99
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,129
I'll call it Research.

100
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:00,782
Once again,

101
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:04,046
we can right-click and go to Properties to optimize the

102
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:06,277
library for a specific media type.

103
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:09,320
This will largely be document files, so that's fine.

104
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,279
We can change the library icon if we want to.

105
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,057
Not sure if I want to do this.

106
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:16,893
Oh, what the heck, why don't I choose the magnifying glass.

107
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:20,774
And then we can add assets to include in the library.

108
00:05:20,774 --> 00:05:24,648
Let me come to the right here and browse to my, I think I have a G drive.

109
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:27,660
No, I have a D drive, anyway, so let's go to D drive,

110
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,508
and I have a folder called docs.

111
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:31,659
I will select to include that folder,

112
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:35,444
and I have an F drive that uses the Resilient File System,

113
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:38,752
ReFS, so let me come up, type F:, Enter,

114
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:43,044
and I have a folder called projdata that's useful there.

115
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:47,636
So if I click OK, I know can browse into Research.

116
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:51,272
And you'll notice that the view here shows us file

117
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:53,090
lists based on those locations.

118
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:53,910
Isn't that cool?

119
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,283
So if we're searching, we can now search across multiple locations on our system.

120
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:02,081
Like if I'm looking for any content that involves Linux,

121
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:07,923
I can type Linux, and the Windows Search service not only searches on file names,

122
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:15,000
but also searches on file contents, which is really nice. I love that.
