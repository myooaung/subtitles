1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,856
And what we can do there is I'll open Start and type Computer Management,

2
00:00:05,856 --> 00:00:07,800
and hover over that guy.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,967
Start it up.

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,341
Computer Management is a really nice rollup console that has a

5
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:15,387
lot of neat stuff in it for troubleshooting,

6
00:00:15,387 --> 00:00:17,415
and performance optimization, and device management,

7
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:20,660
but what we want to look at is Local Users and Groups,

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,122
and here we can see I haven't yet renamed my local administrator account,

9
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:25,926
so I'm going to do that now.

10
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:30,074
I'm going to right-click, and I'm going to call it thc1038.

11
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:32,743
Does that Id ring a bell with you at all?

12
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:36,105
Maybe it doesn't because it's not 1038 it's actually 1138.

13
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:40,326
I'll leave that to you to research the significance of this Id.

14
00:00:40,326 --> 00:00:44,470
You can change the password for a local account by choosing Set Password,

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,141
as you can see here.

16
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:49,360
I do have a Guest account on this system, surprisingly.

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,188
I think I might have upgraded this from an earlier version of Windows.

18
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:56,753
If you go to the Properties of any account you can adjust things

19
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:59,155
like whether the account's enabled or disabled,

20
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:03,771
whether it's been locked out due to too many authentication attempts,

21
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:06,511
which groups the account belongs to.

22
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:07,853
I'm logged on as Tim.

23
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:12,146
You're wondering on a Windows 10 box how you can figure out who's logged on.

24
00:01:12,146 --> 00:01:16,686
You can open up a PowerShell prompt, let me cls to clear the screen,

25
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:21,708
and type whoami, and that'll tell you either a computer name or a domain name.

26
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:25,516
I happen to know that devbox is the name of my computer,

27
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:28,794
backslash, and then the user who's currently logged on,

28
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:31,683
so devbox\tim is my full identity.

29
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:32,664
Hostname, by the way,

30
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:37,528
is another one I use a lot when I need a sanity check on the machine name,

31
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:37,912
okay?

32
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:42,395
So there's groups which provide a way to manage users in bulk,

33
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:45,658
and really not too necessary on a client system.

34
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:50,560
Systems administrators manipulate the membership of these groups all day long.

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,020
Now there's a number of special purpose groups,

36
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,697
depending upon which optional features you've enabled.

37
00:01:55,697 --> 00:02:00,770
If you enable client-side Hyper-V notice that you get Hyper-V Administrators.

38
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,574
If you have the IIS web server installed on your

39
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:06,411
Windows 10 box you'll have an IIS group,

40
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:09,842
but the main ones are Users, and Administrators,

41
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:12,091
and then to a much lesser degree, Guests.

42
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:15,897
Those are the three that have been around in Windows the longest.

43
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:18,462
Final thing I want to show is domain join.

44
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:20,753
This is a Windows Server 2016 machine.

45
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:24,605
I'm going to open the Run box and type dsa.

46
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:29,812
msc to open the Active Directory Users and Computers console.

47
00:02:29,812 --> 00:02:34,944
This is, like the local users and groups we saw on the Windows 10 box,

48
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:38,078
but this is a central console that can be spread

49
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:39,645
across an entire business network.

50
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:41,248
You see what I mean?

51
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:43,814
Now I've created a domain identity called trainer.

52
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:48,002
I don't remember what the password was, so I'm going to reset it right now.

53
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:52,681
Okay, that's been changed, and notice that there's a Computers folder,

54
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:55,852
and I haven't joined any workstations to the domain yet,

55
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:57,995
but that's actually going to change.

56
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:00,496
The name of the domain is company.

57
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:00,853
pri.

58
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:03,674
Back in Windows 10 what we can do, open up Cortana,

59
00:03:03,674 --> 00:03:06,026
and let's see if it recognizes join domain.

60
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:08,014
Nope, it doesn't really like that.

61
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:11,812
How about if I open the Start menu and do join domain.

62
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:13,329
No, it doesn't like that either.

63
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:14,087
Well that's unfortunate.

64
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:16,741
How do you join a domain from Windows 10?

65
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:18,201
You might be thinking,

66
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:21,850
well why don't you fire up PowerShell and run add-computer?

67
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,701
That's actually very valid,

68
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:26,059
but I want to show you how to do it through the graphical interface.

69
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:28,565
We do that through the System Control panel,

70
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:32,581
so let me type System, press Enter to select the best match,

71
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:35,924
and under system we can come under computer name,

72
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,371
domain, and workgroup settings.

73
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:38,088
Change settings.

74
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:39,522
Look at that shield.

75
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:42,691
That shield denotes that this is an administrative activity

76
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:44,648
that requires user account control elevation.

77
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:49,296
I'm kind of surprised that I didn't get prompted for consent there, hmm.

78
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,883
In the System Properties old school control panel we'll come

79
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:56,528
down to Change for to rename this computer or change its

80
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,951
domain or workgroup click Change, and I'm going to say,

81
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:00,807
I want to be part of the company.

82
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:06,039
pri domain, and it says, okay, well you need administrator credentials for that.

83
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,706
I have an administrative account called tim.

84
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:12,616
I'll provide my creds, and a hand shaking is going on.

85
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:14,288
Oh, it didn't like the password.

86
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,682
Let me try that again.

87
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:18,413
Click OK, or maybe it was trainer, come to think of it.

88
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:21,556
Company is the name of the domain, in this case.

89
00:04:21,556 --> 00:04:24,145
Trainer, put in my password, let me retype that,

90
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:27,165
okay, and as I was saying, some handshaking is going on.

91
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:29,272
I'm going to have to reset the credentials.

92
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:30,773
I'm going to pause the video.

93
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:32,023
Hang on just a second.

94
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:34,918
It turns out that I can use that trainer account

95
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:36,671
because it is an administrative account,

96
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:41,036
and I actually, so I think I have the password correct this time around.

97
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:42,078
There we go.

98
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:43,467
Welcome to the company.

99
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:44,161
pri domain.

100
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:47,125
If I click OK it tells us that we have to restart in

101
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,850
order for this to go into effect.

102
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,802
Now while that's restarting I'm going to come back to my

103
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:54,470
server because if we go under Computers now it looks like

104
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,223
it's not showing up quite yet.

105
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:57,809
Let me right-click and refresh.

106
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:58,707
There we go.

107
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:02,396
We have a computer account now because we're managing that DEVBOX computer,

108
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:05,378
and we're going to log on to that computer,

109
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:07,491
not as the Tim account that I've been using so far,

110
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:08,534
as a matter of fact,

111
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:12,567
if I try those credentials they're going to fail because I don't have an

112
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,902
identity on the domain under that name and password,

113
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:19,485
so I'm going to need to choose an Active Directory user account name.

114
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,192
I'm going to choose trainer.

115
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:24,264
Okay, so I'm being prompted to log on here.

116
00:05:24,264 --> 00:05:28,016
It wants to log me on as Tim, and you know I can supply a password here,

117
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:31,430
and I'll be authenticated just fine because this is assuming

118
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,571
that I want to log on to the local computer,

119
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:37,486
but I don't want to do that, so I'm going to come over to Other user,

120
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:39,537
and notice it says, Sign in to: COMPANY.

121
00:05:39,537 --> 00:05:43,099
Just for grins let me try to submit my credentials, my Tim credentials.

122
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:46,052
It says, the user name or password is incorrect.

123
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:46,648
Try again.

124
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:46,946
Alright,

125
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:51,403
but if I do trainer and put in the correct password it should recognize me,

126
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:55,797
there we go, and it's giving us the little welcome to Windows 10 business,

127
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:58,843
and then it should give us our desktop momentarily.

128
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:02,664
So here we are logged on as a domain user named trainer,

129
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:04,256
and we're off and running.

130
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:07,041
If we want to log out we can open Start,

131
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,900
expand the left side, come down to the currently logged on user,

132
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,243
trainer.

133
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:14,450
We can change account settings, lock the system,

134
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,610
sign out, or switch the account,

135
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,592
which allows multiple users to be logged on at the same time.

136
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:22,138
I would choose sign out.

137
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:26,703
If, for instance, I wanted to sign in as the local Tim identity it asks us here,

138
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:28,177
are you sure you want to sign out?

139
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:30,601
This Task Host is still running in the background.

140
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:31,174
That's fine.

141
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:34,898
I'll sign out anyway, and this time I'll come back to Other user.

142
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:37,290
Now this is a good tip I'm going to show you.

143
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,376
You saw that if I just use tim it's going to fail

144
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:42,234
because it says Sign in to: COMPANY.

145
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:47,615
If I want to do a local identity I need to know the name of the box,

146
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,861
which I think is devbox\ then the user account name.

147
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:54,374
It has to be a backslash, not a forward slash,

148
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:59,031
and notice it says Sign in to: DEVBOX, so now I can put in the password,

149
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:04,000
and away we go. Here's our original environment.
