1
00:00:02,306 --> 00:00:05,178
Windows Defender.

2
00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:07,466
First, a history lesson.

3
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,755
Microsoft and Antimalware Antivirus.

4
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:11,783
There's a lot of good history here,

5
00:00:11,783 --> 00:00:15,644
and if you're relatively new to IT you'll want to pay attention.

6
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:18,794
Microsoft bought a company in 2004 called GIANT Antispyware,

7
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:24,023
and I was pleased with that because at that time I was using GIANT Antispyware,

8
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,883
and I thought it was a fantastic tool.

9
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:29,384
Around that time, in the early 2000's,

10
00:00:29,384 --> 00:00:32,459
there was a proliferation of adware and spyware,

11
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:37,020
just people trying to get paid by tricking you into visiting

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,141
websites where you'd see a cascade of pop-up windows,

13
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:43,456
and each pop-up advertisement is going to wind up ca-ching,

14
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:45,028
ca-ching, giving somebody a few pennies.

15
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:46,270
You see what I mean?

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,041
And the idea that software could be hijacked with

17
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,341
components that phone home from your system,

18
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:54,753
in other words, they silently in the background,

19
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:58,972
sometimes using a service, a Windows service like we talked about earlier,

20
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:01,794
to go out from your computer without your consent.

21
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:05,224
You see, that's the big problem with malware, with malicious software.

22
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:08,897
It's code that executes without your explicit consent.

23
00:01:08,897 --> 00:01:10,763
So anyway, Microsoft bought GIANT,

24
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:13,839
and initially they rebranded it as Microsoft Antispyware,

25
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:17,593
then it became for a while Microsoft Security Essentials,

26
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:21,298
and now we know it as Microsoft Windows Defender,

27
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:24,681
and it used to be that you'd have to install it yourself.

28
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:28,834
I remember a standard part of my builds when I worked in industry around

29
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:32,936
the time that Security Essentials were released we'd want to make sure as

30
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:35,532
part of our preparation process to install that.

31
00:01:35,532 --> 00:01:36,488
You might ask, well,

32
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:38,401
is there an advantage to using a Microsoft

33
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:40,055
antimalware as opposed to a third-party?

34
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:45,130
All I can say is that in my professional experience I haven't had to use

35
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,018
another antimalware on the systems that I've managed over time.

36
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:50,916
The Microsoft one is fantastic.

37
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,822
So now, as I said, we have Windows Defender,

38
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:54,469
and it's actually built-in to Windows 10.

39
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:56,492
You don't have to do anything about it.

40
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:57,659
It's already there.

41
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,437
Endpoint Protection.

42
00:01:58,437 --> 00:02:01,160
That is a potential point of confusion.

43
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,762
We've referenced the Microsoft System Center line of datacenter management

44
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:09,070
products a few times over the course of this course.

45
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,688
In there you have System Center Configuration Manager,

46
00:02:11,688 --> 00:02:15,643
and one of the many things that the System Center Tools

47
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:17,569
can do is centralize antimalware,

48
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,298
and the client that you can deploy through System

49
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:25,467
Center is called Endpoint Protection, but it's essentially just Windows Defender,

50
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:26,867
and as I said,

51
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:30,970
nowadays in Windows 10 you already have the bits installed on the machine,

52
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,434
so you really don't need to do a separate

53
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:35,704
installation unless you really want to.

54
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:36,533
Going further,

55
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:42,037
Windows 10 Defender bits can function just fine on their own on a one-by-one,

56
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,952
each computer is an island unto itself basis,

57
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:49,656
or you can centralize using Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection or ATP.

58
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:53,694
Now this is a cloud service that's part of Microsoft's Office 365 portfolio,

59
00:02:53,694 --> 00:02:57,623
and what happens is you onboard your Windows 10 clients

60
00:02:57,623 --> 00:03:00,271
and point them to your ATP instance,

61
00:03:00,271 --> 00:03:04,374
and the ATP is able to generate a lot of behavioral analysis based

62
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:06,928
on what your users are doing on their systems,

63
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:13,507
and you can get a much more tailored, personalized antimalware strategy going.

64
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:14,852
Windows Defender Features.

65
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:17,541
Well, you have the antivirus component.

66
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:21,223
I like to use the term antimalware because you may know that a virus

67
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:25,014
is just one of several types of malicious software.

68
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:29,460
Adware, spyware, junkware, crapware, all of those are synonymous terms.

69
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,895
There's viruses, worms, Trojan horses.

70
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:35,833
The antivirus engine in Defender hits all of those

71
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,074
pieces with real-time protection, so yes,

72
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:40,994
we're working with a service running in the background.

73
00:03:40,994 --> 00:03:44,936
You can control Windows Defender through the Security Center,

74
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:47,333
and I'll show you that in the next demo actually.

75
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:52,455
The Windows Defender Security Center was added in the Windows 10 1703 update,

76
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:59,120
and remember, 1703 means March of 2017, and it was expanded in the 1709 update,

77
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,585
that's September 2017,

78
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:04,926
such that the Security Center will actually work with

79
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:07,323
third-party antivirus and firewall apps.

80
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:09,946
You can control the Defender with PowerShell,

81
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:13,091
Group Policy, or Microsoft Intune, and of course,

82
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,107
there's ATP, Advanced Threat Protection.

83
00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:19,634
There's System Center Endpoint Protection, as I mentioned in a previous slide.

84
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,959
The Security Center is a roll up.

85
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,616
It used to be the Windows Security Center.

86
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:26,202
If you remember in 8.

87
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:29,056
1 and Windows 7 there was the Action Center,

88
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:30,287
and the Security Center,

89
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:33,469
and now we have the Windows Defender Security Center that's

90
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:35,631
a conflation of those different tools.

91
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:38,764
Windows Defender was the name of the antimalware.

92
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:42,662
Security Center was meant to be a one-stop shop for

93
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:46,818
firewall settings and so forth, and then Action Center is a notification hub.

94
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:49,632
You have all of that stuff build in to this GUI called

95
00:04:49,632 --> 00:04:55,000
the Windows Defender Security Center. It's a pretty nifty tool actually.
