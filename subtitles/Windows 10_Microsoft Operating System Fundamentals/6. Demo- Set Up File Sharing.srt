1
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:06,189
Okay, in this demonstration, let's work with SMB file sharing.

2
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:10,371
File sharing in SMB is exposed through a couple services,

3
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:12,354
and I'm going to right-click the Start menu,

4
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:15,393
or the Start button, I should say, on my Windows 10 box.

5
00:00:15,393 --> 00:00:16,161
Go to Run.

6
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:21,804
This is an Enterprise edition system, so I have all the business controls here.

7
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:23,814
I'm going to type services.

8
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:26,629
msc to open the Microsoft Management Console.

9
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:29,956
Because I'm logged onto this system as a standard user,

10
00:00:29,956 --> 00:00:34,372
I'm going to need to actually authenticate as a domain administrator.

11
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:38,572
By the way, this system belongs to an Active Directory domain.

12
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:41,470
So I've launched services as an administrator.

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,829
I will sort by name, and if I go to s, I'll find a service called Server.

14
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:49,443
The service name is LanmanServer.

15
00:00:49,443 --> 00:00:54,020
And this service needs to be running on a system in order for it to

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,035
share resources using the Server Message Block protocol.

17
00:00:57,035 --> 00:01:01,639
If I go to w, I'll see a LanmanWorkstation service.

18
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:05,048
The formal name, or the short name, is Workstation.

19
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:09,409
And this is the SMB client service that's required.

20
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,520
You'll also want to look at the network interface card level.

21
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,438
Again, I'll right-click Start, go to Run, and type ncpa.

22
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:17,930
cpl.

23
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,322
That's the short name for the network connections dialog.

24
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:25,582
And if right-click my Internal Lan, the one that's connected to the domain,

25
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:28,273
again, I'm being prompted for credentials.

26
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:30,462
This is user account control in action,

27
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:32,963
saying that I do not have sufficient privileges.

28
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:33,270
Yikes.

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,031
Well, let's try that one more time with feeling.

30
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:40,799
I'll do Properties, and I'll supply credentials that I know are powerful enough.

31
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,782
And there we see the File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks component,

32
00:01:44,782 --> 00:01:48,293
and that is enabled on this network card.

33
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:51,644
Now technically, we can share resources here on the workstation,

34
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,124
but in business, that's really not how it's done.

35
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:55,446
It's done on the server,

36
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:58,293
so let's switch our focus over to the Windows Server

37
00:01:58,293 --> 00:02:01,094
2016 machine here and this fileserver.

38
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:04,956
And I have a folder here called reports that contains a number of documents.

39
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:07,585
If we right-click that folder and go to Properties,

40
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,553
we have two tabs that are important for our purposes.

41
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:13,794
There's Sharing, and you can see I've already shared this folder,

42
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:17,802
but the way that works, you can go the simple method or the advanced method.

43
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:22,281
I'm not even going to show you the simple method because it's too simplified.

44
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:26,090
I want you to have full control and know exactly what's going on here.

45
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,920
So you go to Advanced Sharing,

46
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,503
and you can toggle Share this folder from off to on.

47
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:35,850
You advertise the folder under the share name of the folder itself.

48
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,358
That's what happens by default.

49
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:40,667
But let's say you're sharing a folder that has a

50
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,263
really wacky non-intuitive name.

51
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:45,451
You can actually add an additional share name to make it

52
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:48,482
easier for your users to file that, to find,

53
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:50,232
I should say, that resource.

54
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:52,489
Permissions is where you can set those permissions,

55
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,624
and this is what's called a discretionary access control list,

56
00:02:56,624 --> 00:02:59,129
or DACL, for short, D-A-C-L.

57
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:02,366
And you know the general best practice is to set

58
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:03,985
the share permissions wide open.

59
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:08,348
And the Everyone identity is about as wide open as you can possibly get.

60
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:11,540
Do you see the logic of setting the shared folder

61
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,249
permissions to Everyone Full Control?

62
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:16,824
Notice that when you choose a lower-level permission like Read,

63
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:19,336
these are standard permissions, by the way,

64
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:20,824
the other are cleared.

65
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:25,628
The permissions are only going to dictate which identity has which permission.

66
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:29,165
Change gives you read plus the ability to write.

67
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:32,568
Full Control gives you change and read and also the ability

68
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:35,433
to edit the actual access control list.

69
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:39,900
Any explicit deny will override any corresponding allowance.

70
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,785
There's a logic to this, but it takes a while for it to become intuitive.

71
00:03:43,785 --> 00:03:46,961
I don't expect that you're come away from this single demo

72
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,499
being a master of shared and NTFS permissions,

73
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:52,967
so don't have that expectation.

74
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,652
You'll want to search for this, NTFS permissions,

75
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,880
shared folder permissions, Windows, SMB,

76
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,476
in the Pluralsight library to get some remedial advice.

77
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:04,555
Now if you really want to be more secure,

78
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:08,797
we can look for another identity, and I use the term identity advisedly.

79
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:11,138
Everyone is not an account, a group account,

80
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:15,628
that's going to show up in the Active Directory users and groups tool.

81
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:19,867
It's an identity that's used that you can add to access control

82
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,197
lists or remove from access control lists,

83
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:25,359
but you can't interact with it more than that.

84
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:28,127
There's an identity called Authenticated Users that

85
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:30,298
some administrators prefer to use.

86
00:04:30,298 --> 00:04:34,418
Let me do that for Allow, and let me remove Everyone.

87
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:37,346
And this identity is only those who have been

88
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,859
successfully authenticated to the domain.

89
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:44,429
Everyone really represents a security hazard because it

90
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:46,143
involves non-authenticated users.

91
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:47,657
You see what I mean?

92
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:51,369
So some contractor could come into your business who doesn't have a

93
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:53,625
domain account and potentially see these resources.

94
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,695
So if we do Authenticated Users, Full Control,

95
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,559
Allow, that's wide open at the share level.

96
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:03,600
Now the share is what actually makes the folder available on the network.

97
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,997
You have to do the sharing step in order for your users to see the resource,

98
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:11,867
and then the Security tab is where you have the access

99
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:14,626
control list for NTFS file system.

100
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:19,265
And here we have the SYSTEM identity, which is the local operating system.

101
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,301
You want to leave that one alone.

102
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:24,185
Administrators, which are your systems administrators, that's fine.

103
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:27,851
And then this DACL has Domain Users with modify,

104
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:33,326
so anybody who's at least a user in this domain will be able to read and write.

105
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:37,399
Well, if we were to cut that down to Read & execute instead,

106
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:40,774
let's go to edit, I'll choose Domain Users,

107
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,039
Read & execute.

108
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:44,871
We've got List folder contents, Read & execute.

109
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:47,414
You can read about these different standard permissions

110
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,201
by investigating the exercise files.

111
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:58,000
That's going to cut down on the shared full control permissions that we set at the share level.
