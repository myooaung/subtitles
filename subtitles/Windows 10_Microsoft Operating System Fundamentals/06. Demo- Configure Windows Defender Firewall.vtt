00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.543
Before we end this demo I also want to cover firewall,

2
00:00:04.543 --> 00:00:07.137
and we come over to Cortana and type firewall,

3
00:00:07.137 --> 00:00:10.387
and it defaults to allow an app through Windows Firewall.

4
00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:13.832
Well I'm going to come down to Windows Defender Firewall.

5
00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:17.662
Instead of just Windows Firewall it's now called Windows Defender Firewall,

6
00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:21.367
and note while this user interface has been around for years,

7
00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:24.373
we're in the classic Control Panel here.

8
00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:27.579
Firewall hasn't been migrated to the Settings app yet.

9
00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.112
Now there's a lot we can talk about with Firewall,

10
00:00:30.112 --> 00:00:33.790
the different profiles, but that gets beyond our scope right now,

11
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.781
so what I will say is that you want to be absolutely

12
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:40.902
sure that Defender is enabled, and you'll notice this is a UAC protected link.

13
00:00:40.902 --> 00:00:42.933
Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off.

14
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:46.792
You want to make sure it's on for all of your profiles.

15
00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:48.911
Essentially, just to quickly say this,

16
00:00:48.911 --> 00:00:53.893
the location profiles determine collections of firewall rules.

17
00:00:53.893 --> 00:00:54.576
First of all,

18
00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:57.861
if you're not exactly sure what a firewall is it's a piece of

19
00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:01.377
software or potentially a piece of hardware that inspects

20
00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:03.111
traffic coming into your machine,

21
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:06.310
and potentially even going out of your machine bidirectional,

22
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.724
and will screen it against rules to allow or deny those traffic flows.

23
00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:14.818
If you belong to an Active Directory domain you have the domain profile,

24
00:01:14.818 --> 00:01:18.736
and then the first time you light up a network connection,

25
00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:22.061
Wi-Fi or wired, you can go private or public.

26
00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:26.644
Private would be for a home network that has less restrictive rules.

27
00:01:26.644 --> 00:01:29.519
Public would be certainly when you're in an airport,

28
00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:35.113
or a coffee shop, or some public area where you want maximum protection,

29
00:01:35.113 --> 00:01:35.593
okay?

30
00:01:35.593 --> 00:01:38.170
So that's turning the firewall on or off.

31
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.382
That bit about allowing an app or feature allows you to choose,

32
00:01:42.382 --> 00:01:45.176
this is an alphabetized list of different

33
00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:47.590
applications installed on your machines,

34
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.098
different Windows services,

35
00:01:49.098 --> 00:01:52.949
and you can selectively enable or disable the

36
00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:54.603
communication based on your profiles.

37
00:01:54.603 --> 00:01:59.028
A little bit of a clunky interface, so what you do in the enterprise,

38
00:01:59.028 --> 00:02:02.171
when you're managing Windows Firewall globally is that

39
00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:04.844
you want the Advanced Firewall console.

40
00:02:04.844 --> 00:02:08.691
If you type advanced fire let's see if that helps.

41
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.516
I'm not getting the auto-complete to hit what I want.

42
00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:13.107
Let me go into Start.

43
00:02:13.107 --> 00:02:13.744
Okay, finally.

44
00:02:13.744 --> 00:02:16.847
I typed advanced in the start, and it says,

45
00:02:16.847 --> 00:02:19.236
Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.

46
00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:22.736
Now you'll want to search the Pluralsight library to get training on

47
00:02:22.736 --> 00:02:25.821
this because it's a learning curve unto itself.

48
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:30.226
You can create rules for inbound traffic, as well as outbound traffic.

49
00:02:30.226 --> 00:02:33.073
There's a whole bunch of predefined rules to make it easier.

50
00:02:33.073 --> 00:02:36.666
If you know you need to be able to ping a machine to test it's

51
00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:39.339
connectivity there's a pre-built rule for that.

52
00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:43.279
You can actually apply these policies in Group Policy to make

53
00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:47.303
it easier to set Windows Defender Firewall policies globally

54
00:02:47.303 --> 00:02:49.785
across a bigger group of computers.

55
00:02:49.785 --> 00:02:51.743
Please don't just decide, well,

56
00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:55.314
I'm going to disable Windows Defender Firewall on all my endpoints

57
00:02:55.314 --> 00:02:58.005
because it makes administration more difficult.

58
00:02:58.005 --> 00:02:59.641
Please don't make that mistake.

59
00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:02.748
In my professional experience it's much better to spend the

60
00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:05.115
time figuring out what your traffic flows are,

61
00:03:05.115 --> 00:03:09.070
and what traffic should be allowed, and deploy those rules via group policy,

62
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.623
or if you're working with individual machines you can

63
00:03:11.623 --> 00:03:19.000
use the advanced security console. You don't want to turn off something so important as a firewall.
