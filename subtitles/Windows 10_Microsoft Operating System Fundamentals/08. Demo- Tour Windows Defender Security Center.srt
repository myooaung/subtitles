1
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:05,498
In this demo we're going to take a look at the Windows Defender Security Center,

2
00:00:05,498 --> 00:00:09,858
which is really a roll up of a whole lot of Defender antimalware features,

3
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:14,524
and because I didn't show you the SmartScreen filter in the previous module,

4
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:16,674
or it might have been the module before,

5
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:20,844
I thought that it was more appropriate to place that demo here,

6
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:21,192
okay?

7
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:23,184
So what we have in the notification area,

8
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:26,987
if we hover over the shield it has a little x on my system,

9
00:00:26,987 --> 00:00:28,430
and it says, Actions needed.

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,867
As I said, I clicked that by the way,

11
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:33,006
that opens the Windows Defender Security Center,

12
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:39,098
and so this consolidates the functions of the old Action Center and the old

13
00:00:39,098 --> 00:00:43,189
Security Center interfaces into a single unified interface.

14
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:44,851
We have Your device is being protected.

15
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:48,010
Now if you were to disable or if you had malware

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,629
infecting your system that turned off, say,

17
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:54,195
virus and threat protection, this would turn into a warning.

18
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:59,156
We also see metadata on the last time a definition update took place,

19
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:03,677
when a last threat scan or health scan took place on this machine.

20
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:07,787
Just like we say in systems administration that a good backup is only

21
00:01:07,787 --> 00:01:11,001
as good as its ability to be successfully restored,

22
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:15,906
Antimalware Scanner is only as good as the recency that it's been updated,

23
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:19,752
so make sure that you have your system configured to update,

24
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:23,782
and I'm going to expand the left hand menu that allows us to go through

25
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:27,049
the five components of the Defender Security Center.

26
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:28,551
There's virus and threat protection,

27
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:31,735
from which you can start a quick or advanced scan,

28
00:01:31,735 --> 00:01:33,900
and then there's some additional metadata.

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,141
Device performance and health.

30
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:38,914
This is going to give us issues related to Windows Update,

31
00:01:38,914 --> 00:01:43,760
okay, it looks like we must have updates that need application,

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,503
Storage capacity, and Device drivers.

33
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:49,015
So that's what Device performance and health is.

34
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:52,631
Firewall and network protection gives you some metadata on your

35
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:54,440
firewall based on your location profiles,

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,550
as well as which one is active.

37
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,858
I am joined to an Active Directory domain,

38
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:01,477
which is why the domain profile takes precedence,

39
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:04,615
and you have some additional links down here.

40
00:02:04,615 --> 00:02:07,637
App and browser control is where you can turn on or

41
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:09,134
turn off the SmartScreen filter.

42
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:11,152
You see Check apps and files,

43
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:14,820
Windows Defender SmartScreen helps protect your device by checking

44
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,682
for unrecognized apps and files from the web.

45
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:20,658
Remember that this SmartScreen filter does a hash

46
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:22,969
calculation on your apps and files,

47
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:27,668
compares them to online copies in its threat intelligence database,

48
00:02:27,668 --> 00:02:29,401
and let's you know if there's a disparity.

49
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:33,574
SmartScreen, whether you want it --- how you want it to behave in Edge to Block,

50
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:34,564
Warn, or Off.

51
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:36,213
Warn is the default setting.

52
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:38,324
SmartScreen is also integrated in the Windows Store,

53
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,919
and it could be set to Warn or Off,

54
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,692
and then there's a whole lot of exploit protections.

55
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:45,967
Now if you already have experience in Windows,

56
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:50,299
if you're already a power user, you might remember the EMET tool,

57
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:50,698
E-M-E-T.

58
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:54,101
This was a tool that Microsoft made, free tool,

59
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:56,920
free download, that contained remediations for specific,

60
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,415
I'm not going to say Edge case vulnerabilities,

61
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:02,965
but problems with certain applications,

62
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:06,971
like Adobe Acrobat that could present security problems,

63
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:07,973
Adobe Flash.

64
00:03:07,973 --> 00:03:12,226
Here we have a lot of that stuff build in to the Exploit protection.

65
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:15,186
There's System settings and Program settings.

66
00:03:15,186 --> 00:03:17,661
It really gets beyond our scope because that gets more

67
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:22,683
into the enterprise control stuff, and then we have some information,

68
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:24,583
some options regarding family settings.

69
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,813
We're working with business in this course,

70
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:28,471
so we won't work with that either,

71
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:32,611
but you'll notice that it's not obvious how to turn off virus

72
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:34,771
and threat protection through this interface.

73
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:38,250
There is a hyperlink for virus and threat protection settings,

74
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,486
and here you can, in fact, toggle from on to off,

75
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:44,511
but you want to be very careful with that.

76
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:46,601
You may think, well I'm a private person,

77
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,183
and I don't want sample files sent to Microsoft,

78
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:51,097
even though that will help them.

79
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,035
Notice that that's a User Account Control protected action.

80
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:57,061
I'm going to choose No here and leave that on.

81
00:03:57,061 --> 00:04:01,446
You could add exclusions files that you don't want to be included in a scan.

82
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:04,688
That's all typical bread and butter stuff that you

83
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:06,630
see in any antimalware scanner,

84
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,997
and then what kind of notification robustness you want to see.

85
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:14,056
A lot of those notifications will be pop-ups in the

86
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:17,769
notification area or we have the notifications panel,

87
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,090
which is really quite helpful.

88
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,887
If you remember Windows 8, for instance,

89
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,467
they had what was called the charms bar that was somewhat similar to

90
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:29,252
this in terms of you could get to your settings and,

91
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:32,307
you know, some other utility type commands,

92
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:33,928
but it was difficult to invoke.

93
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:36,550
It involved hovering over a certain part of the screen.

94
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,551
It was quite awful.

95
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:40,295
Now you have this notifications balloon that you can bring back,

96
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:42,058
and do a lot of cool things,

97
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:48,000
not the least of which get to your Settings and Network Preferences very conveniently.
