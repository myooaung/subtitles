00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:05.502
Client Hyper-V.

2
00:00:05.502 --> 00:00:05.803
Alright,

3
00:00:05.803 --> 00:00:10.281
so the historical perspective here is that what we know now is Hyper-V in

4
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:13.787
Windows 10 and Windows Server started as an acquisition.

5
00:00:13.787 --> 00:00:16.925
Microsoft bought a company called Connectix.

6
00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:23.117
Connectix was known back in the 90s as a way to create a virtual machine.

7
00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:23.472
Specifically,

8
00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:27.626
Connectix made software for Mac users and they wanted to help the

9
00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:30.364
market sector who ran Macs most of the time,

10
00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:33.245
but they still needed access to Windows applications.

11
00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:37.850
So Connectix figured out a way how to virtualize a PC,

12
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.645
a computer running Windows.

13
00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:43.402
A virtual machine is simply an actual honest to goodness computer

14
00:00:43.402 --> 00:00:45.795
that runs an operating system and applications,

15
00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.537
but it shares its resources with the host.

16
00:00:48.537 --> 00:00:52.679
So on a Mac, you might be physically on a Mac computer,

17
00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:54.450
you start up virtual PC,

18
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.783
and you can create a virtual computer and install

19
00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:01.408
Windows on it and it borrows RAM, disk space,

20
00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:04.432
and network from, in this case, your Mac.

21
00:01:04.432 --> 00:01:07.078
So that was the original use case.

22
00:01:07.078 --> 00:01:10.395
Microsoft bought Connectix, turned it into Virtual PC,

23
00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:14.325
that's meant for a consumer basically or a light business user.

24
00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:18.987
The business version became Hyper-V and that's a very big product.

25
00:01:18.987 --> 00:01:19.734
In fact,

26
00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:23.468
I know many people who make their living doing virtualization

27
00:01:23.468 --> 00:01:28.269
with Hyper-V so it's a very big platform.

28
00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:31.310
Now what do we need to know about Hyper-V in Windows 10?

29
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.221
Why do we care that there is a Hyper-V for Windows 10?

30
00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:36.140
I thought this is a business thing.

31
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.236
Well actually it is.

32
00:01:37.236 --> 00:01:39.420
I mean, normally the way a business will work,

33
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.922
if they want to use Hyper-V to save money,

34
00:01:41.922 --> 00:01:45.165
instead of having a physical rack filled with physical servers,

35
00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:49.566
they can have the rack but with fewer physical servers and just

36
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:53.575
install Hyper-V and create virtual machines for the virtual

37
00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:55.168
servers that they want to deploy.

38
00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:57.825
It winds up being a big virtualization that is,

39
00:01:57.825 --> 00:02:01.018
winds up being a big money saver for businesses.

40
00:02:01.018 --> 00:02:02.415
And so, therefore,

41
00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:06.804
Windows Server versions have historically had Hyper-V onboard by default.

42
00:02:06.804 --> 00:02:10.415
Now Windows 10 is a client or desktop operating system

43
00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:12.966
and you might think well are you going to host virtual

44
00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.237
servers from a desktop Windows?

45
00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:20.600
No, generally you're not going to, but Client Hyper-V does have a valid use case.

46
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.380
First of all, the requirements.

47
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.755
Client Hyper-V is available only on 64-bit versions of Windows 10 Pro,

48
00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:30.720
Enterprise, or Education, those stock keeping units.

49
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.829
You're not going to get Client Hyper-V with the Home sku.

50
00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.778
The use cases are officially compatibility with legacy applications.

51
00:02:38.778 --> 00:02:43.324
Let's say at business your company has a web-based line of

52
00:02:43.324 --> 00:02:46.746
business app that just will not run well with Edge.

53
00:02:46.746 --> 00:02:49.298
Everybody has been upgraded to Windows 10 and they're

54
00:02:49.298 --> 00:02:51.275
not able to access this application.

55
00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:55.708
It could be that IT will deploy a virtual machine to each

56
00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:59.482
user and they can start the virtual machine that runs an

57
00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:01.583
older version of Windows in it, and therefore,

58
00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:04.747
has an earlier version of Internet Explorer and you

59
00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:06.728
can access that legacy application.

60
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:10.126
Admittedly, that's kind of a cumbersome, clumsy solution.

61
00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:12.964
We have much better ones nowadays, but it's possible.

62
00:03:12.964 --> 00:03:16.542
Development and testing is a bigger deal because your programmers are going

63
00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:20.129
to be working with Windows 10 on their desktop and it's convenient for them

64
00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.174
to have Hyper-V because they generally will need servers or virtual servers

65
00:03:24.174 --> 00:03:28.335
available for their work and they don't want to use your production servers

66
00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:32.782
and your data center because it's never a good idea to practice on

67
00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:33.526
production environments.

68
00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:36.359
Learning, this is another perfectly valid use case,

69
00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.094
especially those of my students who are studying for Microsoft certifications.

70
00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:44.405
Using Client Hyper-V in Windows 10 can be a great platform

71
00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:46.457
for learning the ropes with virtualization.

72
00:03:46.457 --> 00:03:50.275
Now as I said, other solutions exist besides Hyper-V.

73
00:03:50.275 --> 00:03:54.856
In the Microsoft world specifically, that's what we'll limit ourselves to.

74
00:03:54.856 --> 00:03:57.974
We have Hyper-V server that's built into Windows Server.

75
00:03:57.974 --> 00:04:01.288
There is a separate standalone version of Hyper-V Server as well.

76
00:04:01.288 --> 00:04:04.553
App-V is where you're virtualizing individual applications,

77
00:04:04.553 --> 00:04:06.486
it's a more streamlined approach.

78
00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:10.291
Instead of actually deploying a huge heavy virtual machine to each

79
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:13.057
user to use an old version of Internet Explorer,

80
00:04:13.057 --> 00:04:13.836
for instance,

81
00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:17.821
you can actually deploy that old Internet Explorer instance across the

82
00:04:17.821 --> 00:04:21.418
network to each user and have it stream to their system.

83
00:04:21.418 --> 00:04:24.327
It's quite elegant actually and there is other solutions.

84
00:04:24.327 --> 00:04:26.554
In fact, there is other hypervisors.

85
00:04:26.554 --> 00:04:29.530
Software that allows the virtual machines to be

86
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.399
created is called hypervisor software.

87
00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:40.000
Hyper-V is Microsoft's product. If you've ever heard of VMware, their hypervisor is called ESXi.
