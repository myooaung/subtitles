00:00:01.958 --> 00:00:06.223
In this demonstration, I'd like to show you Remote Desktop in Windows 10.

2
00:00:06.223 --> 00:00:12.148
Let's open my Cortana search box and type remote desktop and the main option it

3
00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:15.917
gives us here is Remote Desktop Connection and that's fine.

4
00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:17.360
That's the client tool.

5
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.246
Notice that you expand or contract the options,

6
00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:22.769
which I always recommend that you use.

7
00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.627
As far as opening up the Remote Desktop Server Configuration,

8
00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:30.771
let's return to Cortana and type remote access and we have

9
00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:32.930
in the list Remote Desktop Settings.

10
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.989
Yes, this is what we want.

11
00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.906
And it gives us some useful information and I'm glad it does.

12
00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:41.758
It tells us that Remote Desktop lets you or others

13
00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:45.093
connect to this PC from a remote device,

14
00:00:45.093 --> 00:00:48.231
but look, available for iOS, Android, Mac,

15
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:49.128
and Windows.

16
00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:50.138
That's a good point.

17
00:00:50.138 --> 00:00:53.539
I have an iMac computer at my home and I use the Microsoft

18
00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.264
Remote Desktop Client there to make connections to say my

19
00:00:57.264 --> 00:00:59.472
work PC that runs Microsoft Windows.

20
00:00:59.472 --> 00:01:03.236
It looks like that the server piece is off and it says

21
00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:05.134
are you sure you want to do this.

22
00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:06.089
Yes, I do.

23
00:01:06.089 --> 00:01:10.665
And then there are some advanced settings that we can go to here,

24
00:01:10.665 --> 00:01:13.354
including customizing the configuration port.

25
00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:15.230
That's out of scope for our work today,

26
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.160
so I just wanted to show that much to you now.

27
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.186
I wanted to focus mainly on the client-side component that you see here.

28
00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.084
I was thinking what we should use as an example.

29
00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:28.674
I actually am a specialist in Microsoft Azure.

30
00:01:28.674 --> 00:01:33.104
Azure is Microsoft's public cloud service and one of the many

31
00:01:33.104 --> 00:01:37.601
things that they offer you is the ability to deploy and manage

32
00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:40.668
virtual machines running in the Azure Cloud.

33
00:01:40.668 --> 00:01:45.334
So from the Favorites list, this is the Azure web portal by the way,

34
00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:46.515
the address is portal.

35
00:01:46.515 --> 00:01:46.891
azure.

36
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:52.111
com, and I'm going to select Virtual machines here because I have one created.

37
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.976
This is a Windows Server 2016 virtual machine,

38
00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:58.749
and if you're thinking Tim is this related at all to the Hyper-V

39
00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:02.289
virtualization that we talked about briefly in the previous module,

40
00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.612
the answer to that is yes.

41
00:02:04.612 --> 00:02:09.560
Actually, in the Azure data centers that are spread all around the world,

42
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.443
those hardware hosts run Hyper-V.

43
00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:13.369
I'm sure it's a specialized version,

44
00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:16.799
but it's still Hyper-V and that these are Hyper-V virtual machines,

45
00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.954
they just happen to be hosted up in Azure for us.

46
00:02:19.954 --> 00:02:24.362
Let me open up a new tab here by clicking the new Tab button and just

47
00:02:24.362 --> 00:02:27.052
parenthetically I'll mention if you go to Azure.

48
00:02:27.052 --> 00:02:29.969
com and then click Start free,

49
00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:34.269
you can get into Azure for free with no investment.

50
00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.525
What I mean by that is you get a $200 service credit to be

51
00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:43.014
used over 30 days and you can use it to kick the tires in

52
00:02:43.014 --> 00:02:44.539
Azure and learn your way around.

53
00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.744
Certainly, there is plenty of Pluralsight training on Azure.

54
00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:50.596
Besides virtual machines, there are hosted websites,

55
00:02:50.596 --> 00:02:53.425
there is machine learning, Internet of Things,

56
00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:56.758
database, it's a huge cornucopia of services,

57
00:02:56.758 --> 00:02:58.577
and even after that 30 days,

58
00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:02.797
now there are certain services that give you 12 months of free tier access,

59
00:03:02.797 --> 00:03:04.295
so that's nice as well.

60
00:03:04.295 --> 00:03:06.345
So I wanted to mention that in passing.

61
00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:07.883
Check the exercise files as well.

62
00:03:07.883 --> 00:03:11.107
But you notice here that coming back to the Azure portal,

63
00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:15.478
from my server-1 virtual machine, we have a public IP address,

64
00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:18.438
this means that this virtual machine is connected to the internet,

65
00:03:18.438 --> 00:03:22.003
obviously because it's in the Microsoft Azure public cloud,

66
00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:23.990
it would have to be connected to the internet.

67
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.489
If we want to connect to it,

68
00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.021
we can click this Connect button assuming that it's running,

69
00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:31.809
and it is, and we're asked to download an RDP file.

70
00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:36.178
Let me choose Save as and I'm going to put this on my desktop.

71
00:03:36.178 --> 00:03:41.382
RDP, of course, stands for remote desktop protocol and this is the,

72
00:03:41.382 --> 00:03:41.769
basically,

73
00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.084
a shortcut to a specific instance of the Remote Desktop Connection client.

74
00:03:46.084 --> 00:03:48.312
Now I'm not going to double left-click it,

75
00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:51.550
instead, I'm going to right-click it and go to Edit.

76
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.477
Now you'll notice here that one of the options in the shortcut menu is bold.

77
00:03:55.477 --> 00:03:59.838
The bold option is the default action that Windows takes when you double

78
00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:04.343
left-click any shortcut icon or any icon period for that matter,

79
00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:08.189
and the default action for RDP is connect.

80
00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.057
So I'm going to again right-click and go to Edit and this

81
00:04:11.057 --> 00:04:13.418
brings up the connection that you can customize.

82
00:04:13.418 --> 00:04:17.436
Now it's going to connect to that public IP address that I showed you

83
00:04:17.436 --> 00:04:20.842
in the Azure portal and it's going to use port 3389.

84
00:04:20.842 --> 00:04:25.253
Remember that this is the default port ID used by Remote Desktop

85
00:04:25.253 --> 00:04:28.659
Services and I'm going to supply the username Tim,

86
00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:33.253
I'm going to save that, and then we can specify the graphical quality,

87
00:04:33.253 --> 00:04:35.586
how big we want the window to be,

88
00:04:35.586 --> 00:04:38.392
whether we want audio to play in the virtual machine,

89
00:04:38.392 --> 00:04:40.547
to have it come to our local machine,

90
00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:44.043
I'm going to leave all of these actually at their default and click Connect.

91
00:04:44.043 --> 00:04:46.154
We're prompted, are you sure you want to do this.

92
00:04:46.154 --> 00:04:49.208
We'll click Connect and then I'll supply the password.

93
00:04:49.208 --> 00:04:53.062
Now I created this login when I deployed the virtual

94
00:04:53.062 --> 00:04:55.828
machine You should understand that the virtual machine

95
00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:57.795
doesn't just magically appear in Azure.

96
00:04:57.795 --> 00:05:00.317
You actually have to create the connection yourself.

97
00:05:00.317 --> 00:05:02.064
But as you see,

98
00:05:02.064 --> 00:05:07.194
I'm being taken in now to a Windows Server 2016 VM that's

99
00:05:07.194 --> 00:05:10.777
running in the Azure cloud and you'll see the window controls

100
00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:16.564
here shows me the connection quality, we can pin or unpin the connection bar,

101
00:05:16.564 --> 00:05:19.000
I like to keep it in most circumstances,

102
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.051
and then you can minimize, restore, or close the connection.

103
00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:28.429
Minimize is cool because now I can continue work in my Windows 10 environment,

104
00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:31.965
and if and when I want to do something on that server box,

105
00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:35.105
all I have to do is come down to the task bar again.

106
00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:40.042
If we right-click, the jump list allows you to reopen recent connections.

107
00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:43.260
If you always want this shortcut to stay on the taskbar,

108
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.626
we could choose pin to taskbar or we can click inside the Preview window,

109
00:05:47.626 --> 00:05:49.202
and now as I said,

110
00:05:49.202 --> 00:05:53.512
here we are on that Windows Server machine and it's as if we were

111
00:05:53.512 --> 00:05:56.437
logged on at the keyboard of this virtual machine,

112
00:05:56.437 --> 00:05:56.762
although,

113
00:05:56.762 --> 00:06:07.000
that's kind of funny to think of being at the keyboard of a machine that's not even real from a physical hardware perspective.
