00:00:02.408 --> 00:00:06.009
In this demonstration, we'll look at user profiles in Windows 10,

2
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.069
but first though, I want to cover File Explorer in general.

3
00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.133
Let's come down to the taskbar and open the File Explorer icon.

4
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:16.262
If for whatever reason, you or someone else has unpinned this,

5
00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:18.372
it's easy enough to get it back.

6
00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:20.917
Just open the Start menu, type File Explorer,

7
00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:24.722
and then you can right-click, and if it's unpinned from the taskbar,

8
00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:26.109
you'll be able to pin it,

9
00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.247
you can also put it on the Start menu and there are some

10
00:00:29.247 --> 00:00:30.766
other common options here as well.

11
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.921
Now what do I think are the most important things to show you here.

12
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:37.466
Well one thing that's going to hang up some users that you can be a big

13
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:42.256
help in is if they accidentally close out of a pin or if they have a view

14
00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:44.497
set to something that's uncomfortable for them.

15
00:00:44.497 --> 00:00:46.039
Now let's go to a folder, okay,

16
00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.664
here's a folder that's got a whole bunch of subfolders,

17
00:00:48.664 --> 00:00:51.914
it's actually the folder that corresponds to this course.

18
00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:53.009
That's a little meta, isn't it?

19
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:55.212
But if we go to the View tab and the Ribbon,

20
00:00:55.212 --> 00:00:58.240
notice that you can select various views here,

21
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.421
and just hovering over these views automagically changes the well,

22
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:02.839
view.

23
00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.078
Another thing that you can do actually is hold down Ctrl

24
00:01:06.078 --> 00:01:08.982
and roll your mouse button and that actually jogs through

25
00:01:08.982 --> 00:01:10.425
the different views as well.

26
00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:14.364
Once again, that's holding down Ctrl and jogging your mouse button.

27
00:01:14.364 --> 00:01:18.947
I find in almost all cases I go to Details view because here I

28
00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:21.816
can simply see the columns that I want to see.

29
00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:24.211
By the way, if you right-click a column heading,

30
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:27.867
you can turn on or turn off columns that you want or don't want.

31
00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:29.774
I brought in Date created, for instance,

32
00:01:29.774 --> 00:01:33.942
and let's say I don't want to see size, I'll right-click and get rid of that.

33
00:01:33.942 --> 00:01:37.818
You can sort these in an ascending or descending way.

34
00:01:37.818 --> 00:01:42.686
I will almost always use date created or date modified in a descending sort

35
00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:46.418
so that I can see my most recent files right up on top.

36
00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:51.717
Okay, so here we have, I'm just browsing to some different locations on the disk,

37
00:01:51.717 --> 00:01:54.297
it doesn't matter specifically what we're looking at.

38
00:01:54.297 --> 00:01:58.456
But also, on the View menu, notice this is where you can customize your pins.

39
00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:00.687
There is a Preview pane, for instance,

40
00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:03.202
that depending upon what kind of asset it is,

41
00:02:03.202 --> 00:02:05.736
it can give you a live preview of what it is.

42
00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:06.879
To maximize the window,

43
00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:10.925
we can either use the Maximize button over here or we can double

44
00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:14.446
left-click the title bar and you can adjust the preview.

45
00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:19.198
This can be useful, for instance, if you're browse through a list of image files,

46
00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:22.977
but this actually allows me to step through a PowerPoint file,

47
00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:24.880
the pptx extension, by the way,

48
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.897
is PowerPoint and that's pretty powerful that Windows 10

49
00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:31.308
actually allows you to browse through that when you have

50
00:02:31.308 --> 00:02:32.821
the Preview pane turned on.

51
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:35.049
The Details pane allows you to see metadata.

52
00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.466
If you're comparing a bunch of files that have a similar name and you

53
00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:41.403
need to figure out at a glance who authored a file,

54
00:02:41.403 --> 00:02:44.958
when it was made, it's useful to see those details.

55
00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.371
If you open the Navigation pane, you can turn that on or off.

56
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:52.697
I always have mine on, but if a user inadvertently turns his or hers off,

57
00:02:52.697 --> 00:02:56.119
you can be a hero by showing them how that control works.

58
00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:57.950
There is some sorting and grouping options,

59
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.997
but like I say,

60
00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:03.846
I tend to go to Details and I'll either do an ascending sort by name to put

61
00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:08.363
all of the assets in alphabetical order or I'll do a Date modified or Date

62
00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:11.533
created search in a reverse chronological order way.

63
00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:14.082
Some of these buttons are pretty useful like Size all

64
00:03:14.082 --> 00:03:17.671
columns to fit is kind of cool, hidden items,

65
00:03:17.671 --> 00:03:20.025
Show/hide extensions, show/hide hidden items.

66
00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:23.884
I mentioned this earlier, the only reason I'm seeing.

67
00:03:23.884 --> 00:03:27.765
ini,. pptx,. zip is because I'm showing those extensions.

68
00:03:27.765 --> 00:03:31.929
Windows has always historically hidden extensions by default so I

69
00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:34.989
think Microsoft doesn't want users to get confused.

70
00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.620
I train all of my end users to get accustomed to extensions because they're

71
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.771
very helpful for figuring out exactly what a file is.

72
00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:45.288
Now as far as hidden items,

73
00:03:45.288 --> 00:03:48.419
I'll generally leave that alone when I'm dealing with an end user,

74
00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.646
but if I'm doing technical work, I need to see those hidden items.

75
00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:53.345
If you want to change this globally,

76
00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:58.331
we can open up the Options menu and go to Change Folder and Search options.

77
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:00.206
There is a lot in here, but specifically,

78
00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:03.703
the good stuff that I'm thinking of is in the view where you can,

79
00:04:03.703 --> 00:04:06.553
for instance, display the full path and the title bar,

80
00:04:06.553 --> 00:04:08.882
which will give you the full folder path,

81
00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:11.485
instead of just the name of the current folder.

82
00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:14.801
Always show menus, well I don't necessarily want that.

83
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:16.316
Display file icon on thumbnails,

84
00:04:16.316 --> 00:04:20.260
I don't want that because I like thumbnails for images especially.

85
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.538
Who set these preferences, right?

86
00:04:22.538 --> 00:04:26.087
Hidden files and folders, show them or don't show them,

87
00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:27.479
very important preference there.

88
00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.710
Hide extensions for known file types, again, critically important option.

89
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.616
And then just as important, hide protected operating system files.

90
00:04:35.616 --> 00:04:39.959
For end users, it's important to keep those sensitive files hidden,

91
00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:41.969
but for your IT work, it's just the opposite.

92
00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:45.080
Now what you can do is set up a folder the way you want them

93
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.386
all to be and then click Apply to folders.

94
00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:50.193
That can be a really useful way to do business.

95
00:04:50.193 --> 00:04:53.536
Now you can double left-click the heading of the

96
00:04:53.536 --> 00:04:55.765
ribbon to expand or contract it.

97
00:04:55.765 --> 00:04:59.822
Sometimes contracting is useful because it gives you more screen real estate.

98
00:04:59.822 --> 00:05:03.043
Now you notice the quick access here has these little push pins.

99
00:05:03.043 --> 00:05:07.076
The idea is if you find a folder that you want to have access to a lot,

100
00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:08.747
you can either drag and drop it,

101
00:05:08.747 --> 00:05:12.123
as long as you look for the horizontal bar and let go,

102
00:05:12.123 --> 00:05:16.222
that'll pin it, or you can right-click and choose pin to quick access,

103
00:05:16.222 --> 00:05:20.552
you see what I mean, and then you can drag and drop these to reorder.

104
00:05:20.552 --> 00:05:23.756
And the Quick Access always shows up first in your list.

105
00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:26.200
If you want to get rid of something that you've added,

106
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.070
you can right-click, I'm actually going to do that for my Visual Studio folder,

107
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.143
I'll right-click and choose Unpin from Quick access.

108
00:05:34.143 --> 00:05:37.825
If you're not sure how many disks and volumes are on a system,

109
00:05:37.825 --> 00:05:40.174
you can go to the This PC node.

110
00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:45.044
This gives you a run of common folders, but more importantly, fixed drives.

111
00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:49.303
I have two drives, C and D, and a virtual DVD drive,

112
00:05:49.303 --> 00:05:53.832
and then any network shared folders that you're connected to and any

113
00:05:53.832 --> 00:06:02.000
removable drives like an external USB drive or a thumb drive, so this PC is a very useful place to go on the file system.
