1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,603
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:01,603 --> 00:00:05,542
we'll take a look at some of the built-in

3
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:07,476
troubleshooting utilities in Windows 10.

4
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:08,785
We'll start with troubleshooters,

5
00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:12,613
so let me open the Start menu and type the word troubleshoot.

6
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:15,088
It looks like we want to open up System Settings.

7
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:19,701
Sure enough, it takes us under Update & Security to the Troubleshoot area,

8
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:21,524
and let's just scroll through the list here.

9
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:27,127
We have what Microsoft probably receives their most support requests on,

10
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:30,698
Internet Connectivity, Audio, Printers, and Windows Update,

11
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,910
Blue Screen, Bluetooth, I'm not going to read these,

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,350
but it's a nice significant list, as you can see here.

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,403
Search and Indexing,

14
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:40,814
well what if the user is experiencing problems searching for files.

15
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:45,200
Maybe they receive a message like indexing is disabled on this drive,

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,796
and you want to dig into that a little bit more.

17
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:50,541
Well let's run that troubleshooter and see what happens.

18
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,099
Notice that a detection process first happens,

19
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:56,084
and then depending upon whether the troubleshooter actually

20
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:58,370
finds the problem straightaway or not,

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,142
you may be led through a question and answer or interview process.

22
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:07,578
Let's just say that Files don't appear in search results and click Next.

23
00:01:07,578 --> 00:01:10,033
And in this case it looks like we have to elevate,

24
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:11,371
or we can give feedback,

25
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,826
which is just a standard end question that Microsoft has.

26
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,644
Well this one is going to require elevation,

27
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,020
and I am logged on as an administrator so I was able to do that,

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,505
and it now asks us the question again, files don't appear in search results.

29
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:30,073
And it's going through quite a few processes that a fix for

30
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:32,062
which would require administrative privilege,

31
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:37,602
and in this case it looks like the troubleshooter actually found that I had

32
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:40,752
permissions set incorrectly on some Windows search directories,

33
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:43,123
and it says Fixed, green arrow.

34
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,121
That's a good deal.

35
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:48,513
And we can close the troubleshooter, give feedback or view detailed information.

36
00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:51,409
And this is cool just from an informational standpoint,

37
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:55,825
because it looks specifically on the subsystems of Windows Search that

38
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:58,685
could have gone wrong and whether the issue was present.

39
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,879
So it looks like permissions on Windows Search data

40
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,302
directories needed to be adjusted.

41
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:05,438
Cool, I'm going to cancel out of here,

42
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:07,980
and that's basically how to use the troubleshooter,

43
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,310
it's no more complicated than that.

44
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,147
Let's do another search.

45
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:14,027
This time let's look at error reports.

46
00:02:14,027 --> 00:02:17,263
If we type error reports or problem reports we'll be

47
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:20,107
prompted to open the classic Control Panel.

48
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,008
On this system there's no reports to view,

49
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,284
but I have another system that does have reports,

50
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:26,731
let me bring that on screen, here we go.

51
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:31,490
I'm actually overlaying this window from my Windows 10 host computer.

52
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,031
And we have some Adobe Acrobat updates problems,

53
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:39,438
we have an Odyssey2 emulator that stopped working.

54
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:43,208
Some things we can easily recognize, some aren't so obvious, right?

55
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,964
What about this bad_module_info?

56
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,160
what the heck is that?

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,726
If you double left-click it, it gives you a detailed screen here,

58
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:56,803
and it looks like bad_module_info, the package is Microsoft.

59
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:57,478
Windows.

60
00:02:57,478 --> 00:03:01,989
Cortana, okay, and then we get a Bucket globally unique identifier.

61
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:03,575
So this might be enough.

62
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:07,677
The report was sent anonymously to Microsoft based on my sharing settings,

63
00:03:07,677 --> 00:03:12,155
but we have some specific stuff that we can do a search on.

64
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:14,307
We could open Google or Bing window.

65
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,266
Actually, why don't we just do that.

66
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:20,965
Let me open up an instance of Edge, have that in the background running.

67
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:25,232
Bad_module_info, let me see if I can copy just this guy,

68
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:27,819
and then I'll do a quoted search.

69
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:30,661
Oh, and it looks like we have some search suggestions here,

70
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:34,233
and it looks like there is an answers.

71
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:34,680
microfost.

72
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,019
com result here.

73
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:40,721
Ah, this one is talking about steam games, maybe if I add cortana.

74
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,814
So we're seeing some live troubleshooting here.

75
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:44,219
Cortana has stopped working, okay.

76
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,185
So you see where I'm going here.

77
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:50,042
You could put on your detective hat and just start troubleshooting

78
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,509
based on quoted strings that you pull from here.

79
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:55,079
You can copy the whole report to a clipboard,

80
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,239
and then send that to your vendor, or Microsoft or whomever.

81
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:58,528
Again,

82
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:01,474
this is part of the Security and Maintenance Control

83
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,729
Panel that we've looked at before.

84
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:05,000
Next let's look at Feedback Hub. If we type feedback in Start
