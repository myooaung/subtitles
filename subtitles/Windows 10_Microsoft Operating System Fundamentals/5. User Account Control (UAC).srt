1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,680
User Account Control.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,950
UAC or User Account Control was introduced in Windows Vista,

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,357
and it had a rocky start because it was pretty intrusive.

4
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:15,317
The idea is that a task is either requiring

5
00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:16,961
elevation or not requiring elevation.

6
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:20,464
Something like starting Microsoft Word or a web browser shouldn't

7
00:00:20,464 --> 00:00:23,273
require that you be an administrator to do so.

8
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,449
Open the registry editor, on the other hand,

9
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:28,639
that would certainly be considered an administrative task,

10
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:34,662
so UAC represents a layer to protect the computer operator from

11
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:37,533
inadvertently running high privilege tasks.

12
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:39,364
They'll either be blocked from doing so,

13
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:42,285
as I said earlier, unless they have administrative credentials,

14
00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:46,232
or they'll be prompted to continue based on the settings.

15
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:48,719
When UAC happens the screen dims.

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,262
This is a special mode called Secure Desktop,

17
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:54,273
and the idea there is that any other system,

18
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:57,472
any other process on that machine I should say,

19
00:00:57,472 --> 00:00:58,676
is temporarily suspended,

20
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:04,305
and that answer to the UAC prompt or the input of administrative credentials,

21
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:07,904
you're only communicating with the Windows Security subsystem,

22
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:09,092
and that's it.

23
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:12,933
It's meant to kill any malware that's trying to

24
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:14,640
steal credentials through elevation.

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,245
Now the best practice is to actually turn the UAC prompts up.

26
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,485
They're nowhere near as intrusive as they originally were in Vista,

27
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:24,934
where they seem to pop-up every other action you wanted to try.

28
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:28,854
Now enough years have passed to where the UAC elevation,

29
00:01:28,854 --> 00:01:33,214
while still is regular if the person is regularly doing administrative things,

30
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:36,303
isn't anywhere near as annoying as it once was.

31
00:01:36,303 --> 00:01:40,259
I want to make sure that you understand not to get numb to those prompts.

32
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,040
You don't just want to become in the habit of

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,655
clicking yes to agree to a UAC prompt.

34
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:49,312
Make sure you're inspecting what's going on and what is

35
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,923
expected to happen is what actually is happening,

36
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:54,932
and as far as your standard users go they're going to have to

37
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:58,520
maybe contact you to put in credentials if they're not able

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,199
to do an administrative task.

39
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:09,000
That's going to be on your shoulders to ask yourself and ask the user, why is it that you're trying to do said administrative task?
