Hi there, welcome to Pluralsight.

2
00:00:02.628 --> 00:00:08.710
Tim Warner here welcoming you to the final module in this course,

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.177
Windows 10 MTA Certification Overview.

4
00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:14.594
I have three learning objectives for you in this module.

5
00:00:14.594 --> 00:00:16.836
First, what exactly is the MTA certification,

6
00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:22.037
and how does it fit into Microsoft's IT Pro Certification portfolio?

7
00:00:22.037 --> 00:00:26.392
We'll then look at exam 98-349 in more detail.

8
00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:30.397
We didn't talk about the exam too much over the course of this course,

9
00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:31.921
and that's by design, quite honestly,

10
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:34.772
because I wanted you to focus on the underlying skills.

11
00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:38.848
But know that everything that I added to the course is

12
00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:41.221
directly on that exam blueprint.

13
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:43.981
We'll finish with where to go next with your career.

14
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:46.786
Let's say that you completed this training,

15
00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:49.710
you passed the 98-349 exam, you're an MTA,

16
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.000
what are some possible next steps in the development of your career? Let's get started.
