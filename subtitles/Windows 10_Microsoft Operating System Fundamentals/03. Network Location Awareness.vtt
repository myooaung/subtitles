00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.404
The Network and Sharing Center has been around in Windows for several versions.

2
00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:06.812
It's still here in Windows 10,

3
00:00:06.812 --> 00:00:10.767
and what it allows you to do is see at a glance what your connections are.

4
00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:11.294
For instance,

5
00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:15.117
you see on this screen I'm connected to an Active

6
00:00:15.117 --> 00:00:16.963
Directory domain called company.

7
00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:21.870
pri, and I also am connected to another network that has the public profile.

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.676
We'll talk a little bit more about network location awareness in a moment,

9
00:00:25.676 --> 00:00:28.775
but basically the idea of locations in your network

10
00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:32.324
settings deal with firewall profiles and how restrictive

11
00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:35.343
you feel that connection should be.

12
00:00:35.343 --> 00:00:37.901
I guess we've gotten here sooner than I thought.

13
00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:42.183
The Network Location Awareness service, or NLA, is pretty important.

14
00:00:42.183 --> 00:00:44.619
It's actually a couple of separate services.

15
00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:48.349
If you look at the screenshot of an elevated PowerShell console,

16
00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:52.672
I'm running Get-Service against the DisplayName *location*.

17
00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:55.577
I intentionally made that search fuzzy because I wanted

18
00:00:55.577 --> 00:00:59.643
to bring back both the NLA service, Network Location Awareness,

19
00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:01.413
and the Geolocation Service.

20
00:01:01.413 --> 00:01:03.092
Don't get them confused.

21
00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:06.449
Many applications in Windows 10 can use Geolocation.

22
00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:11.212
Network Location Awareness is simply to associate your network interfaces,

23
00:01:11.212 --> 00:01:13.578
wired and Wi-Fi, with firewall profiles.

24
00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:14.367
And, again,

25
00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:18.058
the point there is you may have different security requirements

26
00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:21.491
based on the context in which you access a network.

27
00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:22.160
For instance,

28
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.718
your home settings are bound to be a lot more permissive than

29
00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:28.261
the settings you would have out in public,

30
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:30.894
say, at a public Wi-Fi hotspot.

31
00:01:30.894 --> 00:01:34.098
Speaking of firewall, here is the classic Control Panel,

32
00:01:34.098 --> 00:01:35.515
the Windows Defender Firewall.

33
00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:37.640
Now notice that subtle name change.

34
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.045
Historically,

35
00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:42.085
the built-in software firewall in Windows has been Windows Firewall.

36
00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:45.275
In Windows 10 it's called Windows Defender Firewall.

37
00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:49.908
This is because we have all of our Windows Defender features,

38
00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:55.453
the anti-malware client, and so forth, in the Windows Defender Security Center,

39
00:01:55.453 --> 00:01:57.651
as we went over earlier in the course.

40
00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:00.987
But this slide is good because it shows you in the

41
00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.320
interface the different locations.

42
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.782
Domain, if you're connected and joined to an Active Directory domain,

43
00:02:06.782 --> 00:02:09.371
private networks, and public networks.

44
00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:13.677
Those are the two built in that a consumer can actually choose.

45
00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:16.418
The first time one of your network connections comes up,

46
00:02:16.418 --> 00:02:20.135
you'll be asked by Windows, do you want to share resources or not,

47
00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:22.853
and the way you answer that question, yes or no,

48
00:02:22.853 --> 00:02:26.043
is going to determine whether your network connection gets

49
00:02:26.043 --> 00:02:29.505
associated with a private or lower-security profile,

50
00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:32.772
or guest or public, the higher-security profile.

51
00:02:32.772 --> 00:02:33.432
Now, yes,

52
00:02:33.432 --> 00:02:37.026
you can change the location profile associated with network connections,

53
00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:39.623
but it's not anywhere near intuitive unfortunately.

54
00:02:39.623 --> 00:02:44.566
Check the exercise files and I give you some remedial help there.

55
00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:48.540
If you're thinking, wow, this is something I want to control as a herd.

56
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.307
If you're a system administrator, you're going to need,

57
00:02:51.307 --> 00:02:54.866
or you're going to want to control network location awareness,

58
00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:57.068
firewall profiles, and firewall, centrally,

59
00:02:57.068 --> 00:02:59.269
and that's absolutely right on.

60
00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.862
This is a screenshot from the Group Policy Editor,

61
00:03:01.862 --> 00:03:05.547
and you can see under the path, Computer Configuration,

62
00:03:05.547 --> 00:03:08.331
Administrative Templates, Network, Network Connections,

63
00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:13.808
Windows Defender Firewall, you can customize settings on a per-profile basis.

64
00:03:13.808 --> 00:03:24.000
There's also another location in Group Policy where you can manage the Windows Defender Firewall Control Panel specifically.
