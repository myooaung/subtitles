1
00:00:02,226 --> 00:00:02,910
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,309
I'm going to walk you through a clean installation of Windows 10.

3
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:09,060
Clean installation means 1 of 2 things,

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,688
either your installing Windows 10 on a hard disk that is empty,

5
00:00:13,688 --> 00:00:16,149
that it's formatted, it's ready for use,

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,529
but it does not currently have an OS on it.

7
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,609
It can also mean reinstalling Windows where you reformat your C drive,

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:24,661
your system drive,

9
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:29,745
and lay down the operating system as if the disk is empty and brand new.

10
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:33,335
Have you ever heard the term don't mind the person behind the curtain?

11
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:35,832
Well I'm about to take you behind the curtain a little bit

12
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:38,401
and show you what I've got going on here.

13
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:42,491
My chosen hypervisor most of the time is VMware workstation.

14
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:47,191
Hyper-V is Microsoft's built-in one, I could use that if I wanted to,

15
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:47,665
that's true,

16
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:51,226
but my preference is to use VMware and it's the same basic

17
00:00:51,226 --> 00:00:53,236
stuff because we're dealing with VMs,

18
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:59,253
so the same ideas here in VMware are exactly the same as they are in Hyper-V.

19
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:03,383
I've created a new empty virtual machine and you notice I'm

20
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:07,239
allocating it 2 GB of RAM from my hardware host.

21
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,872
I've created a 60 GB software file that represents the hard drive,

22
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,147
and again, that's the maximum size,

23
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:19,022
it's not going to be that size unless and until I actually consume it.

24
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:22,854
I'm using the NAT network adapter type and so this will put

25
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:26,536
this virtual machine on my local network and allow me to go

26
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:28,915
out onto the internet if I want to.

27
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:32,234
You can customize these settings all day long by clicking Edit.

28
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:36,811
So Floppy, that's not something I want so I'm going to actually remove that.

29
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:40,517
I don't want sound necessarily, so I'm going to remove that capability.

30
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,677
Now this is a heck of a lot more convenient than

31
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:46,818
working with a real physical computer, wouldn't you agree.

32
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:47,146
Wow.

33
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:52,390
Now if we go to CD/DVD, you see that I'm already using an ISO image file.

34
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,159
I downloaded a file win10-creators.

35
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,186
iso from the Evaluation Center and I'm going to boot this

36
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:04,727
computer from that DVD and that should be just as easy now as

37
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:09,587
powering on the virtual machine, clicking inside of it to capture my mouse,

38
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:13,487
and then letting the system boot from the DVD into

39
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:15,148
the installation setup program.

40
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:19,290
Now I apologize for the wacky what happened graphically there

41
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,124
because I run my virtual machines at 720p resolution,

42
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:28,199
but you'll notice that here we're down to a 640x480 screen

43
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,239
because we are in fact in a setup environment.

44
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,937
Now whereas you used to have no mouse all text screen booting off floppies,

45
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:39,801
now you can take it for granted that you've got mouse access.

46
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:43,786
Chances are very good that the Windows 10 installer has already loaded a

47
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:47,304
driver for my network card so I have internet capabilities.

48
00:02:47,304 --> 00:02:50,147
All I need to do here is verify my language,

49
00:02:50,147 --> 00:02:53,096
my time, and my keyboard input, and click Next.

50
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:57,743
Notice that there is a repair capability built into the Windows 10 setup,

51
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:59,973
that's a useful thing to know about.

52
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:01,903
But we're going to go to install now.

53
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:02,385
Now again,

54
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:06,295
it wasn't too long ago where setting up an operating system by hand

55
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:09,238
meant answering a whole bunch of different questions.

56
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:12,926
It's amazing that really the only question we're going to be asked

57
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,604
here is first of all do we accept the license terms,

58
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:17,294
I will agree to those.

59
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:20,675
Are we going to upgrade or do a fresh install?

60
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:23,238
I did a fresh install by click Custom.

61
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:26,645
It allows you to choose which disk you want to install

62
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:28,427
Windows on and notice the commands.

63
00:03:28,427 --> 00:03:30,346
You can format, you can delete,

64
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:34,130
you can customize the layout of your disks from this screen.

65
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,745
I have on this virtual machine an empty 60 GB software hard disk,

66
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:41,000
so I'm just going to use that, in fact,

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,530
it's the only choice and we'll click Next.

68
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,986
That's all there is to it.

69
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:48,359
We're going to be asked some basic setup questions after it's installed,

70
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:51,936
but this is all there is to the actual installation.

71
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,572
As you see, it's getting files ready for installation,

72
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:59,426
it's going to go through this process, and it's going to restart at least once,

73
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:01,748
and then when we come back, like I said,

74
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:04,732
there'll be some final setup questions and we're off and running.

75
00:04:04,732 --> 00:04:07,761
Here we're being asked to begin with for our home

76
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:10,097
region which I'll verify and click Yes.

77
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:11,922
We're asked to verify the keyboard layout.

78
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:15,190
Now you remember we were asked these questions at the very beginning.

79
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,669
I believe that it's added here at the end because of the

80
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:20,980
human tendency to just click Next, Next,

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,303
Next and blow past a dialog when they might realize,

82
00:04:24,303 --> 00:04:27,216
the user might realize afterwards oh actually I wanted

83
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:29,232
to use a different keyboard layout.

84
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:32,678
Of course, you can always change that once you're in Windows.

85
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:36,302
I'm not going to add a second keyboard layout, that's fine.

86
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:39,053
It says we're connected and they'll check for any updates.

87
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:40,242
Let Windows do this.

88
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:41,728
I can't stress this enough.

89
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:44,175
It's critically important that you keep your

90
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:46,008
Windows 10 machine always up-to-date.

91
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:50,297
Yes, it can be inconvenient from time to time, but so worth it.

92
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:52,610
And you'll notice that the text here, found some,

93
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,856
hang tight while we get them installed was written intentionally to

94
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:59,125
make these messages as user friendly as possible.

95
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,501
Alright, this is an important question.

96
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,640
Are you going to sign into the computer using a Microsoft

97
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,165
account or are you going to do a local account?

98
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:09,854
That's what this domain join instead means.

99
00:05:09,854 --> 00:05:14,571
Microsoft really wants you to sign in with your Microsoft account because it

100
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:17,932
conveys so many advantages with regard to synchronization,

101
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:20,048
and you know what, I actually agree with that.

102
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:24,573
So this could be a Microsoft account that you created for your own home use,

103
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:28,508
or if you're in business and your company uses Office 365,

104
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:32,683
you can also sign in using your Office 365 account and actually

105
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,630
that's what I'm going to need to do here.

106
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,029
I put the wrong account in there.

107
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:42,231
Let me put in my Office 365 account and click Next, pop in my password.

108
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:45,553
Notice that it says please wait while we set up your device.

109
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:49,525
You may be doing this on a full-fledged laptop or desktop computer,

110
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:52,227
but nowadays, the installer doesn't assume that.

111
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,920
You very well could be on a tablet computer.

112
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,396
If something goes wrong, which it looks like,

113
00:05:57,396 --> 00:06:00,281
in this case, I'm going to choose offline account.

114
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:03,776
This is actually a good learning moment because the other

115
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:07,375
alternative you could either use a Microsoft account or an

116
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,488
account that's defined locally on the PC,

117
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:12,912
and if you go the local route, which I'm going to do now,

118
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:15,172
you supply a friendly name for that account.

119
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:18,604
This is going to be an administrator super user account.

120
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:21,296
What's your password, confirm said password,

121
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:25,547
add a hint, do we want to use Cortana or not.

122
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:28,667
Normally, I tend to say no, but you know what,

123
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,802
I really have to say I like Cortana.

124
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:32,936
You want to be careful with this here.

125
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:36,216
Again, especially if you're concerned with privacy.

126
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:39,722
Geolocation diagnostics adds speech recognition,

127
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:42,337
you can turn off the things that you don't want.

128
00:06:42,337 --> 00:06:43,507
Accept to proceed.

129
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:43,897
Again,

130
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:49,319
you always can come back and make override choices later once you're in Windows.

131
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,170
We're just setting up initial defaults for this user.

132
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,395
It's working through the last step of setup.

133
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:57,706
It's basically creating,

134
00:06:57,706 --> 00:07:02,275
Windows is creating my profile and preparing my desktop environment.

135
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:03,231
Here we go.

136
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:05,782
Now notice it says searching for display driver.

137
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:07,836
I've mentioned the term driver a lot.

138
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:12,643
This is the software that powers your installed hardware and Windows 10 has a

139
00:07:12,643 --> 00:07:17,406
very current and robust library of device drivers so you should find that

140
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:20,568
regardless of who makes your hardware components,

141
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:22,514
including keyboard, mouse, etc,

142
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:25,750
Windows should do a pretty good job of finding the proper driver.

143
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,159
If that's not the case, then you can always go to the vendor's website,

144
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:30,588
look up the hardware,

145
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:34,596
and download the Windows 10 driver that way to give it support.

146
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:41,000
We're going to cover post installation tasks in the third and final demo of this module.
