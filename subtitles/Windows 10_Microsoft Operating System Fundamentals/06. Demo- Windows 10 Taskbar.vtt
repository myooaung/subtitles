00:00:01.305 --> 00:00:04.924
When you open an application, it's going to show up on your screen obviously,

2
00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:10.039
and then when you hover over the icon, you'll get a live preview by default,

3
00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.635
and notice that is live.

4
00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:14.545
I don't know if you can see the blinking cursor in the peak thumbnail,

5
00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:16.914
but it's there, and then you can select it.

6
00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:19.619
So if you have more than one instance of PowerShell running,

7
00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.058
for instance, I'm going to open up a second console,

8
00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:26.446
we're going to see multiple peak Windows and notice that you can close them

9
00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:30.701
selectively from here or just go to them selectily from here.

10
00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:34.857
You can rearrange your shortcuts just by dragging and dropping them.

11
00:00:34.857 --> 00:00:39.536
You can invoke the jump list just by right-clicking as I said before.

12
00:00:39.536 --> 00:00:42.650
The File Explorer icon is particularly useful for that.

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.224
Notice that if we right-click the File Explorer icon,

14
00:00:45.224 --> 00:00:49.520
we can see recent items that we've browsed to and you can also

15
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.482
pin commonly accessed folders and locations,

16
00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:57.405
very useful, especially Downloads if you do file downloads from the internet.

17
00:00:57.405 --> 00:00:59.528
On the right-hand side of the taskbar,

18
00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:01.652
we have what's called the Notification area.

19
00:01:01.652 --> 00:01:06.044
This can get kind of cluttered, but of course, you can customize how it behaves.

20
00:01:06.044 --> 00:01:08.096
You'll notice that my taskbar may look a little

21
00:01:08.096 --> 00:01:09.995
different from how you have yours setup.

22
00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:11.969
I have some things turned off.

23
00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.407
If we right-click an empty area of the taskbar and come up to Task View button,

24
00:01:16.407 --> 00:01:18.423
this is something that you might have.

25
00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:22.491
Task View is a way to work with multiple open windows.

26
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:24.236
When you click Task View,

27
00:01:24.236 --> 00:01:28.742
you get a nice tiled collection of windows that are open on that

28
00:01:28.742 --> 00:01:31.139
system and these could be application instances,

29
00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:34.661
like you see here, I have PowerShell and I have Microsoft Edge,

30
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.867
and then I can left-click the one that I want to bring to the foreground.

31
00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:41.167
There are other cool things you can do like snap windows.

32
00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.824
Do you see what I did there?

33
00:01:42.824 --> 00:01:45.927
This is using the mouse and left-click and left dragging the

34
00:01:45.927 --> 00:01:49.184
window to a border and you see that halo,

35
00:01:49.184 --> 00:01:52.075
that means it's going to wrap that window to the halfway

36
00:01:52.075 --> 00:01:55.507
point and then any other open windows will show up as tiles

37
00:01:55.507 --> 00:01:57.260
and this provides a nice interface,

38
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.507
a nice way when I'm doing a lot of file copying,

39
00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:01.008
for instance,

40
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:03.765
I may have two instances of File Explorer open and I

41
00:02:03.765 --> 00:02:05.507
may want to tile them this way.

42
00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:07.496
You can also do other kinds of tiles.

43
00:02:07.496 --> 00:02:10.706
If you go to the top, that'll do a maximize.

44
00:02:10.706 --> 00:02:13.240
If you go to the bottom, it doesn't look like it does anything,

45
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.416
but at least it goes to the left or right.

46
00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:18.440
In the corners, this is a power user tip right here.

47
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.874
The corner allows you to tile up to four Windows, which is pretty convenient.

48
00:02:22.874 --> 00:02:25.667
Now I could do a third one down in the lower left,

49
00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:28.005
or potentially, I could have four tiled windows.

50
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:31.506
Those are features that are enabled by default and overridable

51
00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:34.355
by visiting settings as you would imagine.

52
00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:35.870
Now I have a bunch of icons.

53
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.298
We don't need to describe what each one does here,

54
00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:41.430
but if you right-click each one of those icons,

55
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.772
you're going to get a jump list, at least for most of them,

56
00:02:44.772 --> 00:02:45.596
with different options.

57
00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:49.991
This is a brand-new app that shipped in the latest update in Fall 2017

58
00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:53.305
allowing us to connect with our contacts more meaningfully.

59
00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:57.626
If I right-click my One Drive icon, I can get to settings.

60
00:02:57.626 --> 00:02:59.602
Again, the right-click is magic.

61
00:02:59.602 --> 00:03:01.665
If you left-click or double left-click,

62
00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:05.269
it'll take a default action on whatever notification program it is.

63
00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.704
In this case, if I double left-click the One Drive,

64
00:03:08.704 --> 00:03:12.517
it shows me from my Microsoft account, my One Drive folders.

65
00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:16.616
Over on the very right, we have the notification system, which is super cool.

66
00:03:16.616 --> 00:03:19.623
By default, any apps that have something to tell you,

67
00:03:19.623 --> 00:03:22.452
your email program letting you know you have a new message,

68
00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:25.342
your calendar app letting you know you have an upcoming appointment,

69
00:03:25.342 --> 00:03:28.149
these will show up in your notifications list.

70
00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:30.080
So I really love this feature myself.

71
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.183
When you left-click it,

72
00:03:31.183 --> 00:03:34.323
besides seeing notifications that you can always dismiss by

73
00:03:34.323 --> 00:03:36.176
clicking the close icon that will appear,

74
00:03:36.176 --> 00:03:38.656
you'll see down below we can get to, again,

75
00:03:38.656 --> 00:03:40.554
some really handy options.

76
00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:43.633
Quiet hours, for instance, will suppress notifications.

77
00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:46.220
When I'm recording these modules, for instance,

78
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.994
I have my notification center snoozing because I don't

79
00:03:48.994 --> 00:03:50.670
want to be interrupted while I work.

80
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.557
We can get to our network connections really easily

81
00:03:53.557 --> 00:03:56.459
and browse different networks, really handy,

82
00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.420
especially all settings,

83
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.987
which opens up the Windows settings app at the ground floor.

84
00:04:00.987 --> 00:04:04.658
Finally, everybody wants to know how to customize the desktop behavior.

85
00:04:04.658 --> 00:04:07.579
If you right-click an empty area of the desktop,

86
00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.251
we have a personalize option and that is simply a shortcut back into Settings,

87
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:15.553
back into Personalization, the Background tab.

88
00:04:15.553 --> 00:04:19.450
We were here just a moment ago looking at Start and Taskbar settings,

89
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.243
and if you want to change your background,

90
00:04:21.243 --> 00:04:23.839
you can select from the list Picture, Solid Color,

91
00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:27.904
or Slideshow and then you could choose either a Microsoft granted picture

92
00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:32.261
or you can click Browse to find a picture that you have your system that

93
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.963
maybe you've downloaded from the internet.

94
00:04:33.963 --> 00:04:37.260
If it is a picture, you can choose whether you want to tile it,

95
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.357
stretch it, fit it,

96
00:04:38.357 --> 00:04:41.433
it's going to depend upon the screen resolution that you're using.

97
00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:43.492
If you're using a solid color background,

98
00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:44.945
that's one of the options here,

99
00:04:44.945 --> 00:04:47.758
you can choose a background color or even a custom color.

100
00:04:47.758 --> 00:04:52.036
This option, believe it or not, wasn't in the original version of Windows 10,

101
00:04:52.036 --> 00:04:53.094
kind of annoying.

102
00:04:53.094 --> 00:04:56.775
Colors are cool because it allows you to customize the accent colors.

103
00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:59.708
Notice how my title bar is this really nice blue.

104
00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:03.474
The reason for that is that I have that color selected.

105
00:05:03.474 --> 00:05:06.964
Notice that you can have Windows automatically pick a

106
00:05:06.964 --> 00:05:08.627
color based on your background.

107
00:05:08.627 --> 00:05:11.290
It noticed that I'm using whatever color this is,

108
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.231
aqua, remember I'm color blind, and it will choose one that's complimentary,

109
00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:18.070
otherwise, you can override it.

110
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.599
Like I tend to like bolder colors like blues because well I'm color blind.

111
00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.179
Whether you want transparency options,

112
00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:29.268
whether you want the accent to also affect the Start menu and the

113
00:05:29.268 --> 00:05:32.523
taskbar as you just saw and title bars and so forth.

114
00:05:32.523 --> 00:05:34.382
So there is a lot of settings.

115
00:05:34.382 --> 00:05:38.234
Your homework assignment, by the way, is to invoke this settings dialog,

116
00:05:38.234 --> 00:05:47.000
go to Personalization and go through all the options and test them out until you understand what they all do.
