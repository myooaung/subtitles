1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:04,760
System Restore.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:10,212
System Restore is an often misunderstood service in Windows, I found.

3
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:13,517
It's been in the Windows Client OS for a long time.

4
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:15,329
It's called System Protection formally,

5
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:19,568
so when you see references in Windows 10 to System Protection you

6
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:22,665
know that we're really talking about System Restore.

7
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:26,338
What this service does, it snapshots "system files",

8
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:28,651
and I put that in quotation marks.

9
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:32,458
System files comprise stuff like your registry configuration,

10
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,613
device drivers, applications,

11
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:39,851
but in practice System Restore doesn't technically back up entire applications,

12
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:44,671
it looks for specific file types or file extensions,

13
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:48,114
many of which do happen to be executable.

14
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:52,012
Note that System Restore is not an antimalware product.

15
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:56,009
There's a common conception, and in some cases it might work,

16
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,703
where if your system becomes infected by malware you can roll back to a

17
00:01:00,703 --> 00:01:04,060
system restore point from before when you were infected,

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,062
but I wouldn't depend upon that 100%.

19
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:10,359
System Restore is also not a file recovery product.

20
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,654
A common misconception is that System Restore touches your document files.

21
00:01:14,654 --> 00:01:18,665
Now there are some potential gotchas that could result in data loss,

22
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:20,710
but those are fairly edge cases.

23
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,521
Look in the exercise files, and I give you a pointer to read further on that.

24
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:30,291
Specifically, System Restore is intended to help in the following cases,

25
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,022
number 1,

26
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:33,944
you install a program that conflicts with other

27
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:35,859
software or drivers on your system.

28
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:39,778
Yes, you could go to Programs and Features and remove the program,

29
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:44,014
but you can also consider running a system restore point back to

30
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:46,391
before the application was on the machine.

31
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:47,552
You, in a sense,

32
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:51,719
can roll back the configuration of your system to a previous point in time.

33
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,351
Device Drivers,

34
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:57,727
this is what I find to be the most commonly used case for System Restore.

35
00:01:57,727 --> 00:02:01,190
You update a driver, or maybe Windows Update updates a driver,

36
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,798
and it breaks functionality, you want to go back to the previous version driver.

37
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:06,079
Well,

38
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,450
as long as you have a valid system restore point that was

39
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,753
taken before that driver installation, this is an option.

40
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:15,618
Third, your system develops a stability problem.

41
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:19,802
Maybe another user who uses the system installed a piece of software,

42
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:20,916
or a driver,

43
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,514
or made a registry system configuration change

44
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:25,151
that's introduced some instability,

45
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:29,370
all of these are valid use cases for System Restore.

46
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,621
Now you're probably wondering, if you've never used System Restore,

47
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:35,783
do System Restore points just happen automatically?

48
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:38,780
Is System Restore turned on by default?

49
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,399
The answer to those questions are, number 1, it depends.

50
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:44,712
As I'll show you in the upcoming demo,

51
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:49,089
you do have control over the System Restore Protection Service.

52
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:49,856
And also,

53
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:52,926
it depends upon whether the applications that you

54
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:55,431
install are System Restore aware, that is to say,

55
00:02:55,431 --> 00:03:00,554
you can write in your application installation code an instruction to take a

56
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:04,283
System Restore snapshot automatically before you proceed.

57
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:05,500
There is recovery software.

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,893
There is a third-party piece of software called Revo Uninstaller,

59
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:14,188
and that's an application that allows you to perform a deeper and

60
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:16,594
more comprehensive uninstallation of software.

61
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:17,930
It will, by default,

62
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,422
take a System Restore point before going further in an uninstallation,

63
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:24,916
such that you can roll back your changes if you decide that

64
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:34,000
that uninstallation was not a good idea. Let's hop into a demo, because this is best experienced live in person.
