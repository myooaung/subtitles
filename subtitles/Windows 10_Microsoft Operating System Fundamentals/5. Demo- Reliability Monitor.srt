1
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:04,761
Reliability Monitor.

2
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:09,652
The Windows 10 Reliability Monitor is really the engine from

3
00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:13,255
which your automatic maintenance pushes its data.

4
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:16,492
Remember when we dealt with the automatic Windows maintenance,

5
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:18,096
and you might be wondering, well,

6
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:21,073
as the maintenance goes through its tasks and looks at

7
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:25,282
services and looks at uptime values, where is the data being stored?

8
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:29,012
Well much of it goes into the Windows Event Manager.

9
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:32,601
If you've ever heard of the Event Viewer and Event Log System,

10
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,539
that's where a lot of the data goes,

11
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:38,792
and it also goes to this Reliability Monitor tool where you can check

12
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:42,492
out your system's uptime and availability over time.

13
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:47,931
You can spot application failures, failures in the Windows components themselves,

14
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:52,164
peripheral device failures, warnings, or just changes,

15
00:00:52,164 --> 00:00:53,374
change notifications.

16
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:58,191
Now I've mentioned System Center Configuration Manager quite a bit, or SCCM.

17
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:02,164
There's a sister product called System Center Operations Manager,

18
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:07,051
S-C-O-M, or believe it or not, SCOM, and this is an enterprise monitoring tool,

19
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:12,703
and what it can do is centralize all of this data that you could see on a

20
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:15,744
one-off basis using the Windows 10 Reliability Monitor,

21
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:19,462
and you can spot trends across multiple workstations.

22
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:21,911
But when you're working on a one-off system,

23
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:26,060
the Reliability Monitor's a really helpful tool for diagnosing

24
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,314
potential bottlenecks or slowdowns in system performance,

25
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:33,535
and potentially spot you to software that you didn't

26
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:36,089
know was running and available.

27
00:01:36,089 --> 00:01:38,717
In this demonstration, we'll look at Reliability Monitor.

28
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:43,093
Now if we right-click an empty area of the taskbar, we have Task Manager.

29
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:45,717
Of course there's many ways to use this tool.

30
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:48,499
It defaults to fewer details, but as a power user,

31
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:52,040
you should get accustomed to always having more details exposed

32
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,453
so you can have access to all of these tabs.

33
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:58,328
And you should also get accustomed to, for instance,

34
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:03,872
in the process list, doing an inverse sort on these properties in order to see,

35
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:08,003
for instance, which processes are consuming the most CPU and memory.

36
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,411
Now you'll notice that it actually does,

37
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:12,754
and by it I mean Task Manager,

38
00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:16,872
will expand a process if it is in fact a parent process

39
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:20,722
that has one or more child processes, they will show up here.

40
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:22,053
How do we go further?

41
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:25,552
Specifically, Task Manager's great for giving us right here,

42
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:26,601
right now performance data,

43
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:30,094
but what if we want to see over the life of the machine?

44
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:33,352
Well as long as you have those Automatic Maintenance tasks running,

45
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:37,336
which of course you do, Microsoft makes it difficult to turn off,

46
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:39,522
you can fire up Reliability Monitor.

47
00:02:39,522 --> 00:02:43,868
And if I type reliability, we get View reliability history.

48
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:47,716
And notice that this takes us A) into classic Control Panel,

49
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:52,130
and B) under Security and Maintenance, Reliability Monitor.

50
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,224
And it looks like we're viewing by day from the end of 2017

51
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:00,520
into the first week and change of 2018.

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,893
Now you'll notice here I was working really

53
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,111
high-level of efficiency through December,

54
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:08,771
and you notice the arrows here.

55
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,993
You can move back and forth through this timeline,

56
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:15,464
but I'm just going to keep it here because this is the most recent couple weeks.

57
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:19,323
I took a big hit here on January 2nd as you'll notice.

58
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:21,637
You see the X show up here.

59
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:26,198
The I is an informational item, and we can see those details down below.

60
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:28,131
Let me stretch out these columns.

61
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:32,621
So on this day when we took this dive, AZLOG.

62
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,968
exe stopped working.

63
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:35,979
Well what the heck is AZLOG?

64
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,639
And as far as informational events are concerned,

65
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,141
it looks like on that particular day, wow,

66
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,647
I applied a whole bunch of updates.

67
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:47,273
I wonder if January 2nd was --- well it's definitely

68
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:49,334
not the second Tuesday of the month,

69
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:52,184
so perhaps I ran Windows Update manually and

70
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:54,545
installed a whole bunch of software.

71
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:57,633
But anyway, I want to know more about this AZLOG.

72
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:01,016
So let's click View technical details and see if it

73
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:02,707
gives us any more information.

74
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:07,863
So the Faulting application is AZLOG, the Faulting module is KERNELBASE.

75
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:10,978
dll, gives us specific versions.

76
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:14,512
Does it give us a path?

77
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:18,047
Yes, C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Log Integration\AZLOG.

78
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:23,166
Okay, so this deals with my Microsoft Azure client-side bits.

79
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,092
That had a problem.

80
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:27,477
Well this is enough info to where we can turn to our trusty

81
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:29,996
knowledge repository called Bing or Google,

82
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:33,871
and you can look up some of these specific errors.

83
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:37,038
If there's an exception code, yup there sure is,

84
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:39,310
there's a specific code and so forth.

85
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,334
There's even a globally-unique Report Id for this event that you

86
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:46,454
possibly could share with Microsoft support.

87
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:50,043
Let's take a look further on because it looks like since that day,

88
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:54,113
January 2nd, we're gradually getting better with our reliability,

89
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:56,163
and then we take another hit on the 14th.

90
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,587
It's that dadgum AZLOG.

91
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:01,503
I'm going to want to look much closer at that file.

92
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:03,312
In fact, does it continue?

93
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:06,207
Yup, it sure does, right up until today.

94
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,916
We've still got problems with that.

95
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:12,886
That happened --- today is the 19th, and it's about 2 hours past 1 p.

96
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:13,229
m.

97
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,553
so this is still giving problems that I'm going to

98
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:17,854
definitely want to investigate.

99
00:05:17,854 --> 00:05:19,306
So that's Reliability Monitor.

100
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:26,000
Pretty cool tool, isn't it? I learned something new about my system just now.
