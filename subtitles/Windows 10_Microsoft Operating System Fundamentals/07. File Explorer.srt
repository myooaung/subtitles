1
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,051
File Explorer.

2
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:08,043
File Explorer was called Windows Explorer for many,

3
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:13,155
many years, and even before that when the first versions of Windows came out,

4
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:16,211
Windows 1, 2, and 3, it was called File Manager,

5
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:20,553
and this is a graphical way to browse the directories and files

6
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:23,246
on your hard disk and your removable disks.

7
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:27,193
This, as I said, is a screenshot of File Manager from Windows 3.

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:27,542
1.

9
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:31,514
You could cut and paste files, move and copy them around,

10
00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:35,243
you can create files, very useful skill to have.

11
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:42,128
I submit every bit now in 2017 as all the way back to 1992.

12
00:00:42,128 --> 00:00:47,248
The Windows 10 File Explorer, as it's called, has grown quite refined indeed.

13
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:51,011
There was a time where in Windows you had a couple

14
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:52,380
different Windows Explorer views.

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,247
You had a preview and a Details view and they could

16
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:56,855
actually be opened in separate windows.

17
00:00:56,855 --> 00:01:00,089
Let me walk you through the major parts and pieces of

18
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:02,357
the unified Windows 10 File Explorer.

19
00:01:02,357 --> 00:01:05,783
If you're familiar with the recent Microsoft Office Applications,

20
00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:09,420
then you're familiar with many of these controls like the quick access toolbar,

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,955
this allows you to place buttons that will always be available for

22
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:16,740
every File Explorer window instance that you open.

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,736
The ribbon, as I said,

24
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:22,473
originated in Microsoft Office 2007 and it's a fundamentally different

25
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:27,195
way to navigate commands from how it used to be where you would open

26
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:29,846
up menus and select from menu options.

27
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:33,258
This is the address bar and you can click in there and override

28
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:36,719
whatever is there to browse anywhere in your file system.

29
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,337
The search is a function that I use all the time practically

30
00:01:40,337 --> 00:01:42,238
every single day because let's face it,

31
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:45,953
some of my disk volumes are huge and they have tens of thousands,

32
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:49,901
hundreds of thousands of files and I need to find specific ones quickly.

33
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:54,411
We have our Navigation pane here and this has a lot of magic built into it.

34
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:58,273
You can customize which shortcuts appear under the Quick Access area.

35
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:01,985
You can set up libraries to aggregate documents of different types.

36
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:05,189
As you install software, they will add their own shortcuts.

37
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,078
For instance, I have Microsoft One Drive, as you can see in this screenshot.

38
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:12,152
You also have your removable disks like your USB disks and

39
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:15,111
your optical disks showing up here as well and you can

40
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:16,718
navigate that in a Tree view.

41
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:19,481
Ultimately, you have your Contents or Details pane,

42
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:24,041
which allows you to view specific resources in a variety of different views,

43
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:32,000
very intuitive, and it's crucial that you master this, especially if you're going to be in a support role helping end users.
