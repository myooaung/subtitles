00:00:01.271 --> 00:00:04.049
User profiles.

2
00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.499
User profiles are what allows you to, for instance,

3
00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:11.514
in business to travel from one computer to another and have all of

4
00:00:11.514 --> 00:00:15.208
your files and settings with you or by contrast to have multiple

5
00:00:15.208 --> 00:00:19.052
people share the same computer and each person maintaining their

6
00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.708
own documents and settings.

7
00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:22.086
In Windows XP,

8
00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:26.993
we had our user profile stored under the C Documents and

9
00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:29.831
Settings heading and you notice that there are different

10
00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:31.995
folders for different purposes, My Documents,

11
00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:34.761
the Desktop folder, the Start menu shortcuts,

12
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:38.046
it's a personalized environment per user.

13
00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:41.780
Now in Windows 10, the user profiles are basically the same.

14
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.111
The path has been changed.

15
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:46.322
Years ago, I'm trying to remember if it was Windows 7,

16
00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:49.926
I think, that gave us the shorter path, C Users,

17
00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:54.164
instead of C Documents and Settings, but under your C Users folder,

18
00:00:54.164 --> 00:00:58.415
each user who logs onto that computer will receive his or her own set of

19
00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:01.435
user profile starter folders and then as you go on,

20
00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:02.643
there'll be more added.

21
00:01:02.643 --> 00:01:06.267
Now I have File Explorer configured to show hidden files.

22
00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:09.658
So you notice I have a number of dot folders, as they're called.

23
00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:11.867
If you're familiar with Mac OS or Linux,

24
00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:14.774
you know that hidden folders always start with a period,

25
00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:18.311
that same convention is used by some applications in Windows 10.

26
00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:19.010
For instance,

27
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.684
I have the Secure Shell program installed and I store my encryption keys in.

28
00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:25.120
SSH.

29
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.114
Remember, if you have hidden files hidden,

30
00:01:27.114 --> 00:01:29.755
we wouldn't see those dot folders by default.

31
00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:33.991
There are other folders that aren't dot named, but are still hidden.

32
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:36.877
You notice my AppData folder looks a little bit lighter in

33
00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:39.169
shade for many of the other folders.

34
00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:41.684
This is a very important folder for troubleshooting.

35
00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:41.981
Basically,

36
00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:45.246
many of your applications in Windows 10 will store some of

37
00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:48.841
your preferences inside that app data folder,

38
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:49.868
and really,

39
00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:54.985
the reason why Microsoft hides system files and special folders like this

40
00:01:54.985 --> 00:01:59.958
by default is to make it impossible for a user to think well I'm going to

41
00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.193
"clean" my computer and delete a folder that could have catastrophic

42
00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:06.914
repercussions including data loss.

43
00:02:06.914 --> 00:02:08.496
As a power user though,

44
00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:16.000
I would get familiar with how to show hidden files and I'll make sure you know how to do that in the demo.
