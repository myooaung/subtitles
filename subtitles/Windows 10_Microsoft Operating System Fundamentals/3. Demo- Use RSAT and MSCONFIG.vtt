00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.431
Now those administrative tools are nice,

2
00:00:04.431 --> 00:00:06.658
but they're not specific to Windows Server.

3
00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:10.567
Let's say you are a new systems administrator and you want to be

4
00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:13.803
able to manage Windows Server users and groups,

5
00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:16.180
Windows Server features, this sort of stuff.

6
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.326
Your go-to for this is what's called the Remote Server Administration Tools,

7
00:00:20.326 --> 00:00:21.954
or RSAT tools.

8
00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:25.749
I did a Google search for RSAT tools and I came to this page,

9
00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.256
yes, it's linked in the exercise files, and essentially,

10
00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:32.493
it tells us right here that from our Windows 10 machine,

11
00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:38.149
we can remotely administer Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2,

12
00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.085
2008, 2008 R2.

13
00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:43.492
One thing you'll find is that there is normally a little bit of a

14
00:00:43.492 --> 00:00:47.400
delay when Microsoft releases a new version of Windows Server

15
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.121
before the RSAT tools are available.

16
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:51.351
I'm going to come down towards the bottom,

17
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.650
and I'll download the RSAT package for Windows 10,

18
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.274
and I'll click Download here.

19
00:00:56.274 --> 00:00:59.245
Oh, okay, so even though it wasn't in the text,

20
00:00:59.245 --> 00:01:00.604
it looks like I can,

21
00:01:00.604 --> 00:01:03.523
there is a separate package that we can download for

22
00:01:03.523 --> 00:01:05.412
Windows Server 2016 administration.

23
00:01:05.412 --> 00:01:11.750
X64 is what I want because I'm on a 64-bit environment and I'm going to open

24
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.114
this MSU file directly once it comes down to my machine.

25
00:01:15.114 --> 00:01:18.319
It looks like it's a little under a 100 MB.

26
00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:19.751
Do I want to install this?

27
00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:20.467
Yes, I do.

28
00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:23.208
It comes down as a Windows Update Standalone Installer,

29
00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:26.262
that's what the MSU file type is.

30
00:01:26.262 --> 00:01:30.408
I'm going to accept the license terms and let the update install.

31
00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:35.180
While that's cooking actually, let me come down to Cortana and type msconfig.

32
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.233
This is the system configuration utility.

33
00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:41.669
And notice we were not prompted for administrative credentials that time.

34
00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:45.344
If you're troubleshooting say let's say you've updated your video

35
00:01:45.344 --> 00:01:48.656
driver for your video card and you're having problems,

36
00:01:48.656 --> 00:01:50.456
inconsistent crashes and so on,

37
00:01:50.456 --> 00:01:54.547
you can do a Selective startup here and be picky and choosy,

38
00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:57.660
if you don't mind the technical language about whether you

39
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.101
want to load those system services or not,

40
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:03.622
load your autostart items, that's what Selective startup is.

41
00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:04.947
You want to be more dramatic,

42
00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:08.862
you can actually do what's called a Safe boot and a minimal safe boot

43
00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:12.970
loads just the bare minimum to get Windows up and you can even

44
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.577
suppress the GUI and come to a command line.

45
00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:20.491
So basically, these two tabs are essentials for troubleshooting.

46
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:23.406
Now if your machine crashes before you get into Windows,

47
00:02:23.406 --> 00:02:26.046
then there is some tacts that you can take,

48
00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:29.493
but assuming you can get into Windows an open system configuration,

49
00:02:29.493 --> 00:02:31.575
these are good options for that.

50
00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:35.040
Let me reset that to Normal startup and apply that change.

51
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.501
We have the ability to enable or disable service here,

52
00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:40.496
again, that's very good for troubleshooting.

53
00:02:40.496 --> 00:02:44.775
If we want to remove the Microsoft services and just look at third-party ones,

54
00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:49.530
you see I have Netwrix Auditor, that's a third-party auditing enhancer installed.

55
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.925
I have Google Chrome installed as well.

56
00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:55.753
To do startup items, it looks like it's going to take us into Task Manager,

57
00:02:55.753 --> 00:02:58.363
which is what we looked at in the previous module.

58
00:02:58.363 --> 00:03:00.857
And then for tools, this is just a convenience.

59
00:03:00.857 --> 00:03:03.978
You notice that we've been prompted for user account control.

60
00:03:03.978 --> 00:03:08.190
We can launch that particular utility if you want to adjust the

61
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.973
slider in terms of how aggressively you want Windows 10 to prompt

62
00:03:11.973 --> 00:03:13.415
you for administrative elevation.

63
00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:18.347
So that's all there is to msconfig and it looks like the RSAT,

64
00:03:18.347 --> 00:03:21.873
the Remote Server Administration Tools package has been successfully installed.

65
00:03:21.873 --> 00:03:26.306
Let me see if for those tools or those snap-ins are available immediately.

66
00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:32.576
I'll reopen my Admin Console, MMC, we'll go back to File, Add/Remove Snap-in.

67
00:03:32.576 --> 00:03:34.585
Yep, it looks like they're available.

68
00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:39.359
See Active Directory users and computers is what you use in

69
00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.912
Windows Server environments to modify, drumroll please,

70
00:03:42.912 --> 00:03:47.728
user and computer accounts in an Active Directory domain services domain.

71
00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:50.841
And there is a little x there because number one,

72
00:03:50.841 --> 00:03:58.000
this Windows 10 box is not connected to a domain. Well that's really all we need is number one right there.
