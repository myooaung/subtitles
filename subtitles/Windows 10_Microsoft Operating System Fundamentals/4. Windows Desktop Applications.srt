1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:04,668
Configure Desktop Applications.

2
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:07,438
Now the section we just came out of I taught you how to

3
00:00:07,438 --> 00:00:09,249
manage optional components in Windows.

4
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:11,645
Those are applications, many of them,

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:15,868
and specifically we would call them Traditional Desktop Applications,

6
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:17,392
but they ship with Windows natively.

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:21,121
Now I want to turn your attention to first and third-party applications

8
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,701
that you would install separately on a Windows system.

9
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:29,290
This screen capture shows you PowerPoint 2017 running on a Windows box.

10
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,415
Now this is a little meta,

11
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:35,291
but if you look at the slides there on the left hand part of this window it's

12
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,701
actually the slide deck that you're looking at right now,

13
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:41,617
so it's one of those cool things like if you take a

14
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:45,249
picture of yourself taking a picture, and then take a picture of that picture,

15
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:47,812
you know, that recursive kind of thing.

16
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:50,929
Anyway, a traditional desktop app is what you're accustomed to,

17
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:54,242
it seems to me, since the earliest days of Windows.

18
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:57,012
It's installed separately on each system.

19
00:00:57,012 --> 00:01:00,323
Most applications nowadays are network aware.

20
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:03,848
Some of them pull maybe the majority of their data online,

21
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:05,887
but they're actually installed locally.

22
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:10,147
They register themselves in the Windows registry, although there's exceptions.

23
00:01:10,147 --> 00:01:13,625
There's portable desktop apps that are fully

24
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,613
self-contained executable program files.

25
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:19,106
These traditional desktop apps are normally referred to as

26
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:23,806
thick client or fat client apps because they do have

27
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:26,681
footprint on each systems hard drive.

28
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:30,101
Now the trend that Microsoft began with Windows 8 is what's

29
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:32,781
called the Universal Windows Platform App,

30
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:36,156
and we haven't formally defined UWP yet,

31
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:39,023
but I want to get you thinking of some more

32
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:41,890
characteristics that define the desktop apps first.

33
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,184
Desktop apps are not centrally curated by Microsoft.

34
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:47,850
If you've ever gone in the Windows store,

35
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,459
the application,

36
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:52,691
all of those apps that you see listed have been vetted or tested,

37
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:55,852
and proved, approved I should say, by Microsoft.

38
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:57,751
That's not the case with desktop apps.

39
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,378
There's just too many of them.

40
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:02,911
Microsoft controls the Windows App Store by contrast.

41
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,155
Desktop apps are not sandboxed, generally,

42
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:08,311
unless they've been written that way or permissions-constrained,

43
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:11,284
nor are they optimized for touch gestures,

44
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:15,477
again, unless the application has been specifically programmed for that.

45
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:18,513
They're not necessarily consistent with user interface across platforms.

46
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:22,751
Now that we can look at Microsoft Office as a good example of that.

47
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:25,586
Not too many years ago the experience between,

48
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:27,012
say, Microsoft Word, Excel,

49
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:31,738
PowerPoint on Windows was very different from what you saw on Mac OS.

50
00:02:31,738 --> 00:02:35,212
In the latest version of Office for Mac Microsoft has done a good

51
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:37,637
job of creating a consistent user interface,

52
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:39,796
but still you run into that,

53
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:42,932
the Mac version and the Windows version being very different,

54
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:47,173
and even from a mobile standpoint, the interface of an app on an iPad,

55
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:50,980
which is Apple iOS, Surface, which is Windows 10,

56
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,543
and Android that runs Google Android,

57
00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:57,230
those user interfaces can be very inconsistent and require

58
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,239
a separate learning curve per platform.

59
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,172
I want to go back to that second bullet point,

60
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:04,196
the fact that traditional desktop apps are not

61
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:06,151
sandboxed or permissions constrained.

62
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:09,461
That's actually important because if you install a desktop

63
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:14,366
application that is either you've downloaded a modified version of a

64
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:16,643
legitimate app that has malicious code in it,

65
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:19,589
or the app has been affected after you've installed it,

66
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:20,338
either way,

67
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:24,041
the no sandboxing means that potentially malicious code that attaches

68
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:28,994
to the desktop app can do anything on your system up to the level of

69
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:30,975
permissions of the currently logged on user,

70
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:34,355
and if you're logged on to your system as a network administrator,

71
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:37,257
or in the Windows world a domain administrator,

72
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:45,000
then you could potentially, not intentionally of course, but unintentionally wreak havoc in your network environment.
