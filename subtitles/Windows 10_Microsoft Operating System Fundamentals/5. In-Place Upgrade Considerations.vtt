00:00:01.762 --> 00:00:07.881
Let's look at the in-place upgrade process in greater detail.

2
00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:11.138
In the demo I just went right to the clicky clicky as my friend

3
00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:13.058
and a Pluralsight colleague Greg Shields says,

4
00:00:13.058 --> 00:00:17.165
but now that we've done that and we have that process in our

5
00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:19.189
heads let's look at some considerations.

6
00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.703
Now in one way I modeled how not to do it for you by performing

7
00:00:22.703 --> 00:00:24.783
the upgrade before showing you this stuff.

8
00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:27.377
On the other hand, I thought it was important,

9
00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:30.567
as your instructor, for you to see how it works initially,

10
00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:33.511
and now you can apply these best practices,

11
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:37.900
so that as you go forward you'll keep the best practices in your mind first.

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.827
You want to make sure, first of all,

13
00:00:39.827 --> 00:00:42.535
that the hardware on your system will support Windows 10,

14
00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:46.990
and this means reading the system requirements published at Microsoft's website.

15
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.464
You want to look at the startup environment of your system.

16
00:00:49.464 --> 00:00:54.321
Are you using the Legacy BIOS or the now standard UEFI firmware?

17
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:55.648
That's going to make a difference,

18
00:00:55.648 --> 00:00:58.353
particularly if you want to take advantage of secure boot,

19
00:00:58.353 --> 00:00:59.042
and BitLocker,

20
00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:02.456
and a lot of these more contemporary security methods

21
00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:05.598
that I don't think are optional, personally.

22
00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.072
You're going to need UEFI firmware.

23
00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:10.834
The good news is that any computer that's at least a handful

24
00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:13.989
of years old should support UEFI boot, and again,

25
00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:16.594
like I said, that will allow for drive encryption.

26
00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:19.663
You also want to assess application compatibility.

27
00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:24.362
You saw that the upgrade tool in Windows will perform some

28
00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:26.513
rudimentary comparisons to look at drivers,

29
00:01:26.513 --> 00:01:29.288
and applications, and flag you if there's a problem.

30
00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:32.826
In the business world, though, you'll want to take a larger look at this,

31
00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:36.591
and there's a whole suite of Microsoft tools that help you

32
00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:40.351
evaluate applications for compatibility with Windows 10 or

33
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:41.970
whatever your target Windows version is.

34
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.664
Windows 10 Upgrade Advisor is a good example.

35
00:01:44.664 --> 00:01:48.193
Now that used to be delivered as part of a KB.

36
00:01:48.193 --> 00:01:52.770
The KB is a Windows update package, but as I said a couple minutes ago,

37
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.335
that window of free upgrade has passed,

38
00:01:55.335 --> 00:01:57.850
so that's just largely for historical purposes.

39
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.880
The name of the Enterprise tool that you'd want,

40
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.082
if you are in a position where you're managing a whole bunch of systems,

41
00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:06.702
and you want to make sure that there's not going to be any

42
00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:09.211
glitches with your applications after the upgrade,

43
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:12.307
you'll want to download the free Application

44
00:02:12.307 --> 00:02:15.339
Compatibility Toolkit or ACT from Microsoft.

45
00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:16.428
Another best practice,

46
00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:20.405
make sure that you've disabled antimalware before the upgrade takes place,

47
00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:23.625
and that's just so the antimalware scanner that is,

48
00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:26.461
doesn't try to insert itself into the process.

49
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:27.531
As you can imagine,

50
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:36.000
the antimalware scanner is going to freak out when it sees a new operating system trying to update boot files and stuff like that.
