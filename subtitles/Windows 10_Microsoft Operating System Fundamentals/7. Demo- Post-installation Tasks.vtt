00:00:02.019 --> 00:00:05.895
What are some of the important post installation tasks in Windows 10.

2
00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:08.840
Well you know how to get to the settings by now, don't you.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.304
So one of many ways is to open the Start button and go to the gear icon.

4
00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:18.122
It used to be many years ago that Windows was largely opened by default and it

5
00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:21.857
was up to the user or administrator to increase the security.

6
00:00:21.857 --> 00:00:26.101
Now we find that the trend has reversed and your security related

7
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:29.612
settings are going to be enabled by default in Windows 10,

8
00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.937
which I think is a very good thing indeed.

9
00:00:31.937 --> 00:00:33.442
Case in point, updates.

10
00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:36.076
So from the Windows Settings home page,

11
00:00:36.076 --> 00:00:41.088
let's come down to update and security and you can do a manual update check.

12
00:00:41.088 --> 00:00:43.066
From here, you can view your history.

13
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:47.703
And then you have some ability to customize when updates are installed

14
00:00:47.703 --> 00:00:51.861
and whether you get notified if a restart is necessary.

15
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:55.619
Understand that all of this stuff is provisional in a business

16
00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:59.609
environment and you can centralize the policy and make it impossible

17
00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.711
for your end users to change these settings.

18
00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:05.769
Again, the consistency is important in most businesses.

19
00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:08.585
Under Advanced options allows you to temporarily

20
00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:11.417
pause updates for up to 35 days.

21
00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:15.086
Check by default is give me updates for other

22
00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:16.677
Microsoft products when I update Windows.

23
00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:19.951
So in other words, if you have the Microsoft Office applications installed,

24
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:22.020
it's going to give you those.

25
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.729
If you have Skype installed, it's going to give you those, etc, etc.

26
00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:26.469
Delivery Optimization.

27
00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.007
This was a little controversial when it was first introduced in Windows 10.

28
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.985
In order to make your Windows updates go a lot faster,

29
00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:37.639
you can actually do peer-to-peer downloading.

30
00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.854
By default, if you turn it on, it goes to only your local network other PCs,

31
00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:44.696
but you can even take advantage of the internet.

32
00:01:44.696 --> 00:01:46.971
Now it isn't as scary as you think it is.

33
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:50.762
Look at it this way, you may have 200 MB of updates to download,

34
00:01:50.762 --> 00:01:54.438
are you going to just grab all 200 MB from across the

35
00:01:54.438 --> 00:01:57.921
internet or can you get it much faster with another

36
00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:00.735
Microsoft user maybe in your neighborhood.

37
00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:01.337
Of course,

38
00:02:01.337 --> 00:02:04.649
it's all anonymous and all of the updates that you would

39
00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.792
receive peer to peer from another computer,

40
00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:09.412
the user doesn't have anything to do with it,

41
00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:11.087
the files are all digitally signed.

42
00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:12.046
In other words,

43
00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:14.921
it's meant to make Windows update more friendly to

44
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:17.143
internet connections or network connections,

45
00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:20.047
so that's delivery optimization under advanced options.

46
00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:23.773
So you notice that update is largely ready to go.

47
00:02:23.773 --> 00:02:26.514
From update and security, we have Windows Defender.

48
00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:29.803
This is the Microsoft built-in anti-malware client.

49
00:02:29.803 --> 00:02:30.558
Really important.

50
00:02:30.558 --> 00:02:32.824
You can do a manual scan,

51
00:02:32.824 --> 00:02:37.539
the Windows Defender Security Center is a newish tool that allows you to

52
00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.723
customize the behavior of your various protections and you'll notice

53
00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:43.232
that we've got virus and threat protection,

54
00:02:43.232 --> 00:02:47.657
you can do a manual scan, adjust the scheduled scans.

55
00:02:47.657 --> 00:02:52.486
Firewall is super important because the Windows firewall is going to

56
00:02:52.486 --> 00:02:55.272
protect your machine against unsolicited inbound connections.

57
00:02:55.272 --> 00:02:58.957
This is on and it should stay on.

58
00:02:58.957 --> 00:03:02.347
If you have problems trying to work with a particular app,

59
00:03:02.347 --> 00:03:05.500
notice that you can allow apps through the firewall by

60
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.366
creating what are called firewall exceptions.

61
00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:12.695
This clicks out to the old classic Control Panel that should look familiar if

62
00:03:12.695 --> 00:03:16.604
you've used Windows firewall in previous versions of Windows.

63
00:03:16.604 --> 00:03:19.580
I think those are the major points.

64
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.970
You notice that I'm not necessarily going right to the fun

65
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.108
stuff like customizing your colors in desktop.

66
00:03:25.108 --> 00:03:27.544
I showed you how to do that anyway.

67
00:03:27.544 --> 00:03:27.822
Instead,

68
00:03:27.822 --> 00:03:31.758
I'm most concerned that you know how to get to the security and update

69
00:03:31.758 --> 00:03:40.000
related settings because more than anything else, I want to make sure that you're computing environment is as safe as it can be.
