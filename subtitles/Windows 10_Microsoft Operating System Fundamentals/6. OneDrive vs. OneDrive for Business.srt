1
00:00:01,652 --> 00:00:03,638
Cloud Storage.

2
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:05,771
I'm such a huge fan of cloud storage.

3
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:09,489
Yes, on one hand it's going to require some trust on your side.

4
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:12,456
You have to trust the cloud provider with your data,

5
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:13,800
but on the other hand,

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,429
I think Microsoft has done a good job of demonstrating how and

7
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,118
why they're a good steward of your data.

8
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:21,258
In point of fact,

9
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:24,825
check out the exercise files because I give you a link to

10
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,983
the Microsoft Trust Center website.

11
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:30,004
I give Microsoft strong kudos on their transparency.

12
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:35,267
They tell you right off the top that your data is yours and not theirs,

13
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:39,272
but nonetheless, they offer you enormous availability numbers,

14
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,689
the N number of 9s, 99.

15
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:44,886
99% availability, whatever it is,

16
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:48,301
and they also support a number of different regulations,

17
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:51,274
compliant certifications around the world.

18
00:00:51,274 --> 00:00:51,601
Anyway,

19
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:54,216
the purpose of this slide is to differentiate

20
00:00:54,216 --> 00:00:58,079
OneDrive and OneDrive for Business, which can be confusing for some.

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,888
Now OneDrive is a standalone service, cloud storage service,

22
00:01:01,888 --> 00:01:04,562
that's aimed at the individual consumer.

23
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:07,471
It's directly competing with services like Dropbox,

24
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:10,221
if you're familiar with that, or box.

25
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:10,614
com.

26
00:01:10,614 --> 00:01:13,460
It's a type of service where you can install the

27
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,895
client on just about any device, and have ubiquitous access to your data.

28
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:19,670
That's why I love it so much.

29
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,518
As I said, OneDrive for a consumer is individually managed,

30
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:26,611
and it's just general Software as a Service cloud storage.

31
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,742
The capacity is you get 5 GB for free,

32
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:34,857
and you can then purchase a subscription to go up to 50 GB of storage.

33
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:37,923
So you see, 50 GB it seems like a lot of data,

34
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:39,558
and to many people it is,

35
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:43,143
but it's not going to work in some business environments.

36
00:01:43,143 --> 00:01:46,932
And in those cases, Microsoft wants you to consider OneDrive for Business.

37
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:51,181
And you can, in fact, use OneDrive for Business as an individual consumer,

38
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:52,225
but generally speaking,

39
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:57,984
OneDrive for Business is aimed at corporate clients who need central management.

40
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,408
The management hub here is Office 365.

41
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:02,140
Why do I say that?

42
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,508
Because OneDrive for Business,

43
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:06,968
instead of just being a generally abstracted SaaS cloud storage

44
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:11,302
where you put your files in your OneDrive and they just

45
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:14,106
automagically get replicated in the background.

46
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:17,992
OneDrive for Business will actually use a SharePoint

47
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:20,420
site as your OneDrive repository.

48
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,166
So it's natively tied into Office 365.

49
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:32,455
The storage capacities are much larger, 1 TB to start, up to 5 TB per user.

50
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:33,025
OneDrive universality.

51
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:37,322
I get a kick out of that word because if you look at this slide quickly,

52
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:41,107
if you look away from your screen and then look back at the slide,

53
00:02:41,107 --> 00:02:45,713
it might say OneDrive university, or it might say OneDrive universe.

54
00:02:45,713 --> 00:02:49,520
Anyway, I guess I'm easily amused.

55
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,291
This slide starts with a screenshot of File Explorer,

56
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:57,380
and you can see in the navigation pane that I've installed the OneDrive client,

57
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,712
in particular I'm using OneDrive for Business,

58
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,156
it says OneDrive - Office 365, and then you can store whatever you want in it.

59
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:08,183
As you see here, I'm not storing very much,

60
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:11,935
but it's addressable through Windows, just like any other local disk.

61
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:16,228
And any data that you save here is going to be replicated to Microsoft and

62
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:19,609
available anywhere else you can get to the OneDrive Client.

63
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:23,008
Of course the web interface is super ubiquitous.

64
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,892
You can get to it from anywhere.

65
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:25,161
Again,

66
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:28,498
this would be you'd log in with your Microsoft account if

67
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:30,909
you were just an ordinary OneDrive user.

68
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:33,894
If you are part of OneDrive for Business,

69
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:39,139
an Office 365 implementation, you would log into OneDrive via that,

70
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:42,413
via O 365, and if you look at the interface here,

71
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:44,176
and if you have familiarity with SharePoint,

72
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:48,540
it's meant to look like that because under the hood this is a

73
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,377
document library in your My Site as it's called,

74
00:03:51,377 --> 00:03:53,606
in a SharePoint site collection.

75
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:55,835
Even more to the point,

76
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,804
Microsoft has OneDrive and OneDrive for Business

77
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,253
clients for iOS and Google Android,

78
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:08,000
and you can interact with your files same way, same song and dance.
