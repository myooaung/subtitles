00:00:02.412 --> 00:00:05.674
Now what do you do if you're running Windows and the

2
00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:07.500
application that you're running hangs up.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.659
It could be that it quits unexpectedly,

4
00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.175
but it could be that it just freezes altogether.

5
00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:15.910
The worst situation is when your entire Windows environment freezes.

6
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.970
Sometimes you can just get up, go get a cup of coffee or drink of water,

7
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.715
come back,

8
00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:23.990
and whatever was hanging the system is resolved and you're back in business,

9
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.647
but what I'm getting around to is how can you forcibly

10
00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:29.896
control the applications that are currently running and in

11
00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:32.234
memory on your Windows 10 box.

12
00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:35.586
For historical perspective, we had way back when Windows 3.

13
00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:38.695
1 the task list which would bring up, sure enough,

14
00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:42.997
a list of any open windows, even windows are considered tasks or processes.

15
00:00:42.997 --> 00:00:47.563
A process is different from a program because a program might

16
00:00:47.563 --> 00:00:50.196
have multiple processes associated with it.

17
00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:51.855
What do I mean, Tim, right.

18
00:00:51.855 --> 00:00:54.978
Well think of like the Google Chrome browser as a good example.

19
00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:55.928
When you start Chrome,

20
00:00:55.928 --> 00:00:59.176
you think you're running just a single instance of that application.

21
00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:04.712
It's a process that consumes CPU and memory, disk space, and network.

22
00:01:04.712 --> 00:01:05.241
That's true.

23
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:08.826
But did you know that when you open up multiple tabs in Chrome,

24
00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:12.195
processes are actually spawned for each of those open tabs,

25
00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:14.378
so if you have a whole bunch of tabs,

26
00:01:14.378 --> 00:01:18.443
you can wind up with a number of Chrome processes and that can wind up,

27
00:01:18.443 --> 00:01:21.032
depending upon how much memory you have on your system,

28
00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:23.317
slowing down the system and even hanging it up.

29
00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:26.546
So that's tools like task list and in Windows 10 Task

30
00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:29.372
Manager give you some really nice control.

31
00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:31.927
We're going to go right to the demo on this so I can show

32
00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:36.328
you how to use Windows 10 Task Manager.

33
00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:40.140
In this demonstration, we'll work with Task Manager in Windows 10.

34
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.342
Remember that Task Manager is a built-in utility,

35
00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:44.559
there is nothing that you have to install,

36
00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:48.026
that gives you control over the running applications on your system and

37
00:01:48.026 --> 00:01:51.790
actually Task Manager has a heck of a lot more built into it.

38
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.854
Let me show you.

39
00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:54.436
Many different ways keyboard combinations,

40
00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:54.828
etc,

41
00:01:54.828 --> 00:01:58.658
but one way is by right-clicking an empty area of the

42
00:01:58.658 --> 00:02:00.435
task bar you have Task Manager.

43
00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:01.671
And by default,

44
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:04.968
Task Manager opens in a simplified interface that

45
00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:07.130
just simply lists running programs.

46
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.568
Remember,

47
00:02:07.568 --> 00:02:12.002
a program or an application can consist of multiple individual processes,

48
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:15.014
but this is showing us just the top-level programs,

49
00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:19.073
and as you see, I have Edge and I have Microsoft PowerPoint running.

50
00:02:19.073 --> 00:02:24.346
Now I've got some issues with my system in terms of it displaying a

51
00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:27.046
generic program icon instead of the PowerPoint icon,

52
00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:29.637
but we can ignore that for a second.

53
00:02:29.637 --> 00:02:31.767
If we want to stop an application,

54
00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:35.597
if it's not responding and Windows knows that it's not responding,

55
00:02:35.597 --> 00:02:40.694
it will say parentheses not responding and you may have to end the task.

56
00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:44.007
Most applications nowadays have recovery built into them such that the

57
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:46.903
likelihood of you losing work and losing data is minimized,

58
00:02:46.903 --> 00:02:51.014
but it's still always possible so I want to make sure to relay that

59
00:02:51.014 --> 00:02:55.225
caveat to you that when you're using Task Manager a lot of times it's

60
00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:57.772
a last resort way to stop an application.

61
00:02:57.772 --> 00:03:00.681
Let me right-click, go to Run, and open PowerPoint again.

62
00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:04.756
If you know the executable program name of a program, you can always use it.

63
00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:08.309
As a matter of fact, you know, for Task Manager,

64
00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:10.440
it always used to be T-A-S-K-M-G-R.

65
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.570
Let's see if that works.

66
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.605
Yep, it looks like it still does, that's cool.

67
00:03:13.605 --> 00:03:17.227
But I'll come back to run and type powerpnt,

68
00:03:17.227 --> 00:03:19.822
that historically has been the executable program

69
00:03:19.822 --> 00:03:21.558
file name for Microsoft PowerPoint.

70
00:03:21.558 --> 00:03:23.327
Okay, if we right-click these guys,

71
00:03:23.327 --> 00:03:26.199
notice that we can switch our attention to the app.

72
00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:30.038
It may not be stuck, it just might be minimized and we don't see it,

73
00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:31.121
you see what I mean.

74
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:33.324
Bring back Task Manager again here, right-click,

75
00:03:33.324 --> 00:03:38.720
we have End Task, Run New Task which allows you to start a program,

76
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.104
it's basically the equivalent of doing a Windows

77
00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:44.684
key+R to open the Run box down below.

78
00:03:44.684 --> 00:03:46.458
What else do we have?

79
00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:50.293
Always on top, Open file location, that can be awfully helpful.

80
00:03:50.293 --> 00:03:52.862
When you're working with applications and especially ones

81
00:03:52.862 --> 00:03:54.874
that you don't recognize that are running,

82
00:03:54.874 --> 00:03:57.199
you can try right-clicking, open file location,

83
00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.414
and in this case, it shows us that PowerPoint.

84
00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:03.977
exe is located under C, Program Files, Microsoft Office,

85
00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.822
Office15, which is correct,

86
00:04:05.822 --> 00:04:09.404
so I'm not concerned that this is questionable software.

87
00:04:09.404 --> 00:04:11.490
Properties, let's quickly bring that up.

88
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.635
That brings up the properties sheet of the executable.

89
00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:15.088
Unfortunately,

90
00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:19.750
Microsoft digitally signs their software which serves as a verification method.

91
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.364
If we right-click and choose Search online,

92
00:04:22.364 --> 00:04:22.684
again,

93
00:04:22.684 --> 00:04:25.665
this is very helpful when you're troubleshooting possible malicious

94
00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:29.061
software and it simply opened your default browser,

95
00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:31.872
which on my system is Edge, your default search engine,

96
00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:33.985
which in my case is Bing,

97
00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:39.063
and it searched for that program file name and the executable name.

98
00:04:39.063 --> 00:04:43.094
In the previous demo, I really didn't show too much about Edge specifically.

99
00:04:43.094 --> 00:04:45.375
If you've never used the Edge browser,

100
00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:49.218
it is meant to be a minimal learning curve from Internet Explorer,

101
00:04:49.218 --> 00:04:53.396
but if you've used Firefox or Chrome, you should feel pretty at home.

102
00:04:53.396 --> 00:04:58.144
We have this tabbed interface where you can click + to invoke new tabs.

103
00:04:58.144 --> 00:05:03.401
This star icon is a hub where you can get to your downloads and your favorites,

104
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:05.574
your shortcuts as they're called in other browsers,

105
00:05:05.574 --> 00:05:09.893
and all of these little tabs can be pinned off to the side.

106
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:14.871
One thing that Edge offers that other browsers don't have to the best of my

107
00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:19.898
knowledge is the ability to add notes and highlighting directly to a web

108
00:05:19.898 --> 00:05:22.783
page and you can actually save the web note,

109
00:05:22.783 --> 00:05:27.584
which I'll do right now, it gets saved to Microsoft OneNote by default,

110
00:05:27.584 --> 00:05:32.110
and we also have a share option where you can share your web notes with

111
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.987
other users using a variety of different mechanisms.

112
00:05:35.987 --> 00:05:38.904
OneNote, of course, comes with the Microsoft Office Suite,

113
00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:41.530
but notice that there are extensions that you can add in,

114
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.232
that's what the install means here,

115
00:05:43.232 --> 00:05:48.314
that allow you to share your web annotations via various social media channels.

116
00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:51.135
That's a pretty cool feature that I wanted to make sure to show you.

117
00:05:51.135 --> 00:05:54.331
It's the icon that looks like a little highlighting pen.

118
00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:58.290
And then if we open the ellipses, this is where you can get to the actual menu.

119
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.428
This is what I found is most confusing to end users.

120
00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:04.894
If they want to get to settings and where to do

121
00:06:04.894 --> 00:06:06.582
extensions and this kind of stuff,

122
00:06:06.582 --> 00:06:09.306
there is no menu as such and there is no button.

123
00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:13.237
You need this ellipses button, it's called the Settings and more button,

124
00:06:13.237 --> 00:06:15.957
and this gives you most of your controls,

125
00:06:15.957 --> 00:06:18.862
zoom, you can directly open the Favorites Pane.

126
00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:20.695
Let's see open it again.

127
00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:22.651
We come down to the very bottom,

128
00:06:22.651 --> 00:06:27.125
we have Settings and this is where you can customize when you open the browser,

129
00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:31.067
open a new tab, do you see a blank page or some other option.

130
00:06:31.067 --> 00:06:35.041
You can clear out your browsing data so on and so forth.

131
00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:38.143
The final thing I want to show in this menu are the extensions.

132
00:06:38.143 --> 00:06:40.998
Like I said, instead of browser helper objects,

133
00:06:40.998 --> 00:06:45.463
Edge uses an extension model and it works through the Microsoft store.

134
00:06:45.463 --> 00:06:46.592
From what I've seen,

135
00:06:46.592 --> 00:06:50.911
most or all of these extensions are free and some of them are super helpful.

136
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:55.463
A lot of my productivity is with Evernote and it's nice to be able

137
00:06:55.463 --> 00:06:57.974
to integrate Evernote into my Edge experience,

138
00:06:57.974 --> 00:06:59.523
especially because it's free.

139
00:06:59.523 --> 00:07:03.954
You'll notice that I'm able to just click through and install it transparently,

140
00:07:03.954 --> 00:07:05.825
it comes down from my system.

141
00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:10.328
There is a description, there is ratings and reviews that you can take a look at,

142
00:07:10.328 --> 00:07:13.745
and then to launch it, it should show up on my toolbar here.

143
00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:16.148
Let me turn on the extension, sure, there it is,

144
00:07:16.148 --> 00:07:17.731
and then when you open it,

145
00:07:17.731 --> 00:07:22.090
the behavior of the extension is going to be wholly dependent on what it is.

146
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.804
In Evernote, of course, I'm going to have to log into my Evernote account.

147
00:07:25.804 --> 00:07:28.438
There are other extensions that suppress advertisements,

148
00:07:28.438 --> 00:07:31.016
for instance, all that kind of stuff.

149
00:07:31.016 --> 00:07:31.489
So anyway,

150
00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:33.851
that's your mini tutorial on Edge that I forgot to

151
00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:35.171
give you in the previous demo.

152
00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:36.654
I don't know if you noticed it,

153
00:07:36.654 --> 00:07:40.077
but Microsoft's store was also in this Task Manager list.

154
00:07:40.077 --> 00:07:44.069
I don't like this simplified view quite honestly because it's too bare bones.

155
00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:45.693
So if you click More details,

156
00:07:45.693 --> 00:07:49.177
you get a Task Manager view that's much more familiar too if

157
00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.814
you've used it in previous versions of Windows,

158
00:07:51.814 --> 00:07:54.995
where first of all, let me double left-click the title bar to maximize,

159
00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:59.781
you get a really nice nested list of both the application,

160
00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:02.927
as well as the individual processes within it.

161
00:08:02.927 --> 00:08:08.164
It looks like Edge, for instance, has separate processes not only for each tab,

162
00:08:08.164 --> 00:08:12.118
here's that Harman Kardon Invoke advertisement that we looked at before,

163
00:08:12.118 --> 00:08:15.261
but there are some other ones that may not be particularly familiar,

164
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:16.072
but remember,

165
00:08:16.072 --> 00:08:19.781
you can right-click and you can go to details which

166
00:08:19.781 --> 00:08:22.013
takes you over to the Details tab.

167
00:08:22.013 --> 00:08:27.799
This is where you can see very detailed specifics on a per process basis.

168
00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:28.125
Specifically,

169
00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:32.516
you can see stuff like how much memory these different processes are using.

170
00:08:32.516 --> 00:08:36.165
You can click the columns to do a reverse sort.

171
00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:39.578
My system is largely idol as you see, that's a good thing.

172
00:08:39.578 --> 00:08:42.188
All of these things are right-clickable and you can

173
00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.973
end the task on them if you want to.

174
00:08:44.973 --> 00:08:48.658
You can open the file location to figure out exactly where

175
00:08:48.658 --> 00:08:52.835
that asset exists on the file system, you can search online.

176
00:08:52.835 --> 00:08:54.923
So that's processes and details.

177
00:08:54.923 --> 00:08:58.894
Again, these are clickable so that you can aggregate to see,

178
00:08:58.894 --> 00:09:02.198
for instance, what is my most memory hungry application and process.

179
00:09:02.198 --> 00:09:03.477
Well in this case,

180
00:09:03.477 --> 00:09:07.398
it looks like it's Edge and it looks like that Evernote tab

181
00:09:07.398 --> 00:09:09.722
is consuming the most memory right now.

182
00:09:09.722 --> 00:09:13.718
Performance allows you to see real time data on how your

183
00:09:13.718 --> 00:09:16.592
system is performing hardware wise with CPU,

184
00:09:16.592 --> 00:09:19.321
that's your processor, memory, disk, and network,

185
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:21.344
a lot of good information here.

186
00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:23.565
If you're suspecting that your system is hung up,

187
00:09:23.565 --> 00:09:25.977
you'll want to come here to confirm that.

188
00:09:25.977 --> 00:09:29.538
App history shows you run times of applications over time.

189
00:09:29.538 --> 00:09:33.843
A lot of these tabs in here are great for malware troubleshooting because by

190
00:09:33.843 --> 00:09:37.211
getting a handle on what applications normally show up,

191
00:09:37.211 --> 00:09:39.762
you should find anomalous ones much easier.

192
00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:41.933
In the previous module when we looked at the Registry,

193
00:09:41.933 --> 00:09:43.119
I showed you the startup,

194
00:09:43.119 --> 00:09:47.164
the fact that you could look in your run keys to see applications and

195
00:09:47.164 --> 00:09:50.933
processes that are scheduled to start automatically every time.

196
00:09:50.933 --> 00:09:53.657
Here on the Startup tab, it not only lists those,

197
00:09:53.657 --> 00:09:57.580
but also gives you a startup impact on how much the

198
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.477
particular object will slow down your system,

199
00:10:00.477 --> 00:10:03.161
and notice again, you can right-click to disable,

200
00:10:03.161 --> 00:10:06.677
open the location, search online, or look for properties.

201
00:10:06.677 --> 00:10:10.379
It makes sense that the OneDrive application has a high startup

202
00:10:10.379 --> 00:10:13.461
impact because it needs to log you into your account,

203
00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:17.217
it needs to check to see the synchronization status of all of your

204
00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:20.347
files on your system via say what's in the cloud,

205
00:10:20.347 --> 00:10:20.673
etc.

206
00:10:20.673 --> 00:10:24.075
Users, we can see what's going in a per user basis.

207
00:10:24.075 --> 00:10:27.920
In Windows 10, I found that this is almost always just you.

208
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.498
Details we've been to.

209
00:10:29.498 --> 00:10:34.000
And services are longer running processes that typically run in the background.

210
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.188
I'm running the VMware extension because this is a VMware virtual machine so it

211
00:10:39.188 --> 00:10:42.098
would make sense that I have some services related to that.

212
00:10:42.098 --> 00:10:46.356
Let me do an A to Z sort here and then scrolling through, that's fine.

213
00:10:46.356 --> 00:10:48.181
Let me close out of Task Manager.

214
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:50.006
In terms of wrapping up this demo,

215
00:10:50.006 --> 00:10:55.270
I want to go back to something else I had mentioned earlier yet in this module,

216
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.845
sweeping up the shavings.

217
00:10:56.845 --> 00:11:01.321
Remember with Cortana it functions on trust as I've said too many times and

218
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:04.850
you might decide that you don't want to use Cortana at all.

219
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:05.708
That's perfectly fine.

220
00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:10.382
As long as your Windows 10 is patched to the Fall 2017 creators update,

221
00:11:10.382 --> 00:11:14.459
you can do this with, drumroll please, Group Policy.

222
00:11:14.459 --> 00:11:17.400
Remember we learned in the previous module that Group

223
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.790
Policy provides a way to more centrally manage the registry

224
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.083
settings on multiple computers,

225
00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:25.873
but there are some settings that either you can go to the Registry for,

226
00:11:25.873 --> 00:11:28.241
there is no Control Panel interface for it,

227
00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:30.541
so in this case, we've got Group Policy.

228
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:33.836
So I'm going to right-click the Start button and go to Run.

229
00:11:33.836 --> 00:11:37.906
Do you remember what the msc name is for the Group Policy editor?

230
00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:38.860
It's gpedit.

231
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.247
msc, and in that editor,

232
00:11:41.247 --> 00:11:44.884
I'm going to maximize the view by double left-clicking the title

233
00:11:44.884 --> 00:11:46.924
bar and I'm going to drag the split bar over.

234
00:11:46.924 --> 00:11:50.333
We'll want to go through the path, Computer Configuration,

235
00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:52.467
Administrative Templates, Windows Components,

236
00:11:52.467 --> 00:11:58.401
Search, here it is, and let's make sure our policies are sorted alphabetically.

237
00:11:58.401 --> 00:12:01.671
We have the policy called Allow Cortana.

238
00:12:01.671 --> 00:12:04.696
You notice that the extended view here gives you a little

239
00:12:04.696 --> 00:12:06.578
description of what the policy settings does.

240
00:12:06.578 --> 00:12:10.260
If you don't want to see that, you can flip it to standard.

241
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.369
But in any case, we'll double left-click,

242
00:12:12.369 --> 00:12:15.137
and by default, all of your policies are not configured,

243
00:12:15.137 --> 00:12:18.894
so they're just quietly present, they're not doing anything.

244
00:12:18.894 --> 00:12:21.824
Now this is one of those ones that requires a little logic.

245
00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:25.791
If we enable Allow Cortana, is that going to disable Cortana?

246
00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:26.402
No.

247
00:12:26.402 --> 00:12:30.071
Enabling the policy explicitly allows Cortana.

248
00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:32.424
If you want to turn Cortana off on that system,

249
00:12:32.424 --> 00:12:41.000
you'll need to set this policy to disabled, you'll want to click OK or Apply, and then restart the computer.
