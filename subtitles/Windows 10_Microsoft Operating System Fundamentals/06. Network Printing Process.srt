00:00:02,057 --> 00:00:04,221
This is an old tech net diagram.

2
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:06,695
You see the attribution in the lower left.

3
00:00:06,695 --> 00:00:08,325
I want you to ignore most of it.

4
00:00:08,325 --> 00:00:10,649
I'm going to call out what's relevant for our purpose.

5
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:15,117
The reason I selected this image is that it shows the various ways that a

6
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:18,100
server can make a printer available on the network.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,374
Technically,

8
00:00:18,374 --> 00:00:22,754
you can host a shared printer on a client device on a Windows 10 machine,

9
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:25,675
but in business you'll generally have a server,

10
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:29,047
that is, a machine that's running Windows Server,

11
00:00:29,047 --> 00:00:30,312
maintaining that printer.

12
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:33,791
And that shared printer can be physically cabled to the server,

13
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,676
maybe using USB is all likelihood.

14
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:40,378
Alternatively, some older printers rely upon an external print server.

15
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:43,607
I guess it would make sense for me to briefly define

16
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:45,626
what I mean by a printer server.

17
00:00:45,626 --> 00:00:49,387
A print server represents a network-aware device.

18
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:51,985
It could be, in the case of Hewlett-Packard,

19
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,933
they have a device called Jetdirect.

20
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:57,842
It's a standalone print server that you put on your network on one side,

21
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:00,118
or connect to your printers on the other,

22
00:01:00,118 --> 00:01:04,931
and it serves as a proxy to receive network printing requests so that print

23
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:09,781
server is able to receive printing requests from over the network and despool

24
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:13,478
those jobs to one or more physical print devices.

25
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:14,943
But more commonly nowadays,

26
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:18,720
you have printers that have a network card already installed,

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,109
and they're able to join the network directly,

28
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:26,213
and they are logically managed by a print server computer.

29
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:29,723
I'll show you how that works in the demo by the way.

30
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,508
Another thing I want you to know in general is the network

31
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:34,951
printing process what's happening with spooling.

32
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:37,604
The print spooler service is critical.

33
00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:41,551
You'll often be able to solve many print problems by restarting the spooler

34
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:45,546
service on either the affected client or the print server.

35
00:01:45,546 --> 00:01:45,793
Again,

36
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:48,504
the print server in this context is going to be a

37
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:50,555
Windows Server machine on the same domain.

38
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:53,281
But that print spooler is what on one hand,

39
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:57,010
when the user submits the print job, the job is spooled out,

40
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,518
either locally to a local printer, or in a network printing context,

41
00:02:01,518 --> 00:02:04,899
it'll go across the network and get spooled on the print server.

42
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,407
When I say spool, think of a physical spool,

43
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:10,946
but instead of yarn or thread being wound around the spool,

44
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:13,805
it's actually each page of the print job.

45
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:18,535
The print job is broken down into a page definition language.

46
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:20,982
We don't need to get too deep in the woods there,

47
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:23,765
but just know that that print job could be coming from

48
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:27,360
N number of different applications, and it really doesn't matter.

49
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,377
As long as the printer can translate that print job into a

50
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:35,927
down-level format that it recognizes, it will faithfully print the results,

51
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:39,281
and then the network print queue will then despool the job page

52
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:43,471
by page to the printer that's on the network or perhaps even

53
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:47,186
locally cabled to the print server.

54
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:49,737
There are a number of ways to control printer management.

55
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:54,544
Now that's not so necessary on a standalone local Windows 10 machine.

56
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:57,379
There we can just use the printer's control panel and look

57
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,254
at the individual print queues that way,

58
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:01,861
but on a server side, on a print server,

59
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:06,185
a single server may host a number of shared printers.

60
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,498
So in that case, we have an MMC console,

61
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:10,878
a Microsoft Management Console,

62
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,633
called Print Management that I'll show you how it works.

63
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:15,001
There's also PowerShell.

64
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:18,447
There's a dedicated module appropriately called PrintManagement.

65
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:20,195
There's Group Policy.

66
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:24,165
You know by now that Group Policy is used as a way to centrally

67
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:26,771
perform configuration and desktop management.

68
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:29,704
You can actually deploy network printer connections

69
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:32,273
conveniently to your users via Group Policy.

70
00:03:32,273 --> 00:03:34,004
And then there's management tools.

71
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:37,073
There's first-party tools developed by Microsoft,

72
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:41,009
System Center Configuration Manager is one that I mention an awful lot,

73
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,895
but there's plenty of third-party alternatives that also offer different

74
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:53,000
abstraction layers to make it easier for you to deploy, manage, and troubleshoot your network print devices.
