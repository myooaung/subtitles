00:00:01.757 --> 00:00:06.197
Alright, let's learn how to manage optional features in Windows 10.

2
00:00:06.197 --> 00:00:08.141
Now this can be a little bit confusing.

3
00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.842
Why would it be confusing you're wondering?

4
00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:10.985
Well, let me show you.

5
00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:12.585
I'm going to come down to Cortana,

6
00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:17.195
and let's ask Cortana that we want to work with optional features,

7
00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:20.721
and the result we get is under System settings.

8
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:24.405
So if we give that a click that opens up the Windows 10 settings,

9
00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:26.262
and we have some features,

10
00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:30.345
but there may be features that you know darn well exist.

11
00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:34.022
Client-side Hyper-V is a good example if you're running the

12
00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:38.411
Pro or Enterprise SKUs of Windows 10, and this isn't getting us there,

13
00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:42.163
and even if you click feature history it's going to show you what

14
00:00:42.163 --> 00:00:44.906
optional features in that subset you might have installed,

15
00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:46.679
but that's not what we want.

16
00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:46.975
Similarly,

17
00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:51.763
if we come back to Cortana and we type in add we have an

18
00:00:51.763 --> 00:00:54.009
option for add or remove programs,

19
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.266
and that's an excellent way to uninstall software

20
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.747
that's previously been installed.

21
00:00:58.747 --> 00:01:03.632
We can click to select it, and then click Uninstall and you're done.

22
00:01:03.632 --> 00:01:06.794
Under apps and features there's manage optional features,

23
00:01:06.794 --> 00:01:11.303
but that just brings us back to the original optional features dialog.

24
00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:15.295
What we want is the Windows features control panel,

25
00:01:15.295 --> 00:01:19.350
and a couple ways to do that, back at Cortana we could do Windows features,

26
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.347
and notice that the top result is to turn Windows features on

27
00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:27.599
or off in the traditional Control Panel.

28
00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:29.568
Here it is right here.

29
00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:29.961
Alternatively,

30
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:33.444
in the apps and features setting under related

31
00:01:33.444 --> 00:01:35.967
settings there's programs and features.

32
00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:39.717
This opens up what used to be called the add remove programs

33
00:01:39.717 --> 00:01:42.015
control panel in earlier versions of Windows,

34
00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:46.073
and there's an option to turn Windows features on or off.

35
00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:51.314
So those are the admittedly muddled ways to get to this particular dialog box,

36
00:01:51.314 --> 00:01:54.676
and you can resize this to make it taller,

37
00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:59.788
and then enabling or disabling features and sub-features is just

38
00:01:59.788 --> 00:02:03.381
as easily accomplished as clicking your mouse,

39
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:03.894
okay?

40
00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:05.675
Now that's how to do it graphically.

41
00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:08.374
I have an instance of the PowerShell ISE up,

42
00:02:08.374 --> 00:02:13.061
as you can see, and I have a script file called m07.

43
00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:13.452
ps1.

44
00:02:13.452 --> 00:02:15.895
I've placed this script file in your exercise files,

45
00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:18.694
so you can use it yourself if you want to.

46
00:02:18.694 --> 00:02:21.050
What I'm doing here, first of all, preliminarily,

47
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.878
if you don't know what the ISE is, it's a built-in program in Windows.

48
00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:28.865
It itself is an optional program that's built-in

49
00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:34.064
that allows you to create and edit, modify PowerShell script files,

50
00:02:34.064 --> 00:02:37.152
and if you right-click the PowerShell icon you'll want to

51
00:02:37.152 --> 00:02:40.116
choose run ISE as administrator to start it.

52
00:02:40.116 --> 00:02:44.241
You want to periodically run update help in PowerShell because

53
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:47.907
PowerShell doesn't have any help to speak of initially,

54
00:02:47.907 --> 00:02:49.561
and so you download it.

55
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:53.889
ErrorAction SilentlyContinue means if you run into maybe a help

56
00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.228
file that's broken don't tell me about it,

57
00:02:56.228 --> 00:02:57.862
just skip it and keep going.

58
00:02:57.862 --> 00:03:03.207
On line 7 I'm using Get-Command to look at all cmdlets that have the noun,

59
00:03:03.207 --> 00:03:08.813
WindowsOptionalFeature, and so in Windows 10 we actually have 3 cmdlets,

60
00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:12.285
Disable that turns WindowsOptionalFeatures off,

61
00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:15.395
Enable that installs them, and then Get that lists them.

62
00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.719
If you want syntax help with a cmdlet you'll want to run Get-Help,

63
00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.623
so I'm saying Get-Help on the Get-WindowsOptionalFeature cmdlet name,

64
00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:27.112
and show me examples, and there's a number of examples here.

65
00:03:27.112 --> 00:03:30.845
We don't need to go through them because I already know how to use the cmdlet.

66
00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:34.852
To show all enabled optional features you're going to get an error if

67
00:03:34.852 --> 00:03:38.619
you just run Get-WindowsOptionalFeature on its own.

68
00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.247
You need to supply additional parameters.

69
00:03:41.247 --> 00:03:44.754
Remember I mentioned that you can do online servicing,

70
00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:47.212
which is in a running Windows instance,

71
00:03:47.212 --> 00:03:53.208
or offline when you're working on a VHD or a Windows 10 Virtual Hard Disk file.

72
00:03:53.208 --> 00:03:54.668
Well we're online, of course,

73
00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:58.790
and then I'm using the PowerShell pipeline to take all the Windows

74
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.555
features that are available and filter them.

75
00:04:01.555 --> 00:04:05.720
If you've ever used the Structured Query Language or SQL in relational

76
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.403
databases you're familiar with the Where clause.

77
00:04:09.403 --> 00:04:13.217
Where-Object means that we want to look at all those features,

78
00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:16.089
but only ones whose State property is enabled,

79
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:21.241
and we want to format the results in a table or tabular way.

80
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:24.178
So here are all the specific packages.

81
00:04:24.178 --> 00:04:26.086
Package is the technical term.

82
00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:29.088
The non-technical term is Windows Optional Features that

83
00:04:29.088 --> 00:04:31.637
we can choose to enable or disable.

84
00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:34.081
This is obviously a list of enabled ones,

85
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:36.878
and if you're familiar with ransomware and the

86
00:04:36.878 --> 00:04:40.028
eternal blue x ploy and all of that,

87
00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:43.924
that hinged on vulnerabilities in the SMB1 protocol,

88
00:04:43.924 --> 00:04:46.275
and sadly that's enabled on my system.

89
00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:48.722
I'm going to take care of that in just a minute.

90
00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:52.818
If we want to look at only disabled features it's the same exact command,

91
00:04:52.818 --> 00:04:57.899
but our Where clause is specifying State equals Disabled.

92
00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:58.315
Okay?

93
00:04:58.315 --> 00:05:00.809
To do a disable, like SMB1,

94
00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:06.923
we could do Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName SMB1Protocol - Online.

95
00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:09.284
Do you want to restart this computer to complete?

96
00:05:09.284 --> 00:05:11.210
I'll answer no for now.

97
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.521
The RestartNeeded flag is true though,

98
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.585
and then to enable a feature I found a TelnetClient that,

99
00:05:16.585 --> 00:05:19.297
just for the heck of it, I'm going to install for us now.

100
00:05:19.297 --> 00:05:20.723
We can just select that.

101
00:05:20.723 --> 00:05:24.413
Again, this is going to require a restart to go into effect.

102
00:05:24.413 --> 00:05:27.030
The PowerShell approach here is awfully useful.

103
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.245
What if you want to disable the SMB1Protocol on 25 computers or 250 computers?

104
00:05:34.245 --> 00:05:38.118
With PowerShell with just a few lines of code you can run this

105
00:05:38.118 --> 00:05:46.000
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature command in parallel across all those machines. Isn't that cool?
