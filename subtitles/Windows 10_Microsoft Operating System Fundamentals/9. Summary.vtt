00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:04.066
In summary, what have we learned in this module?

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.424
We've learned that performance tuning and optimization

3
00:00:06.424 --> 00:00:08.579
are in many cases an afterthought.

4
00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.630
I didn't explicitly say that in this module,

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.314
but it was an undercurrent that the time --- I mean as busy professionals,

6
00:00:16.314 --> 00:00:17.102
IT professionals,

7
00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:20.380
it's a nice idea to think while you're troubleshooting and

8
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.639
you have sweat forming on your brow, while I'm using these tools,

9
00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:28.182
I actually can learn quite a bit about my system to improve its performance.

10
00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:32.133
But how often do you actually have time to perform those analyses?

11
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.749
I submit that you should take that time for your own workstations,

12
00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:38.436
as well as the computers that you work on,

13
00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:40.526
on behalf of your customers or clients.

14
00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:41.885
One word of warning though,

15
00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:45.689
don't get stuck down the rabbit hole and avoid tunnel vision.

16
00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:48.065
Sometimes a tendency towards perfectionism,

17
00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.052
sprinkled in liberally with a little OCD,

18
00:00:50.052 --> 00:00:54.645
you can get way off track and get way distracted going down into

19
00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:57.534
performance and metrics and get too involved.

20
00:00:57.534 --> 00:01:01.011
Always begin with the end in mind, and put limits,

21
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:04.863
or bounds, on what you're doing so you don't get too distracted.

22
00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:08.484
With that, we're going to wrap this module up and then head into the next one,

23
00:01:08.484 --> 00:01:10.449
which is on Windows 10 Accounts.

24
00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:12.649
Now you might be thinking, Tim, what?

25
00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.220
We've already done local accounts.

26
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.438
We've already looked at Active Directory domain accounts.

27
00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:18.881
What more can you show me?

28
00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:20.564
Well I think you might be surprised.

29
00:01:20.564 --> 00:01:23.840
There's some fascinating stuff going on in that next module.

30
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.000
I thank you for your participation, and I expect to see you then. Take good care.
