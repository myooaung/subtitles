1
00:00:01,691 --> 00:00:04,220
What is MSCONFIG?

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,704
MSCONFIG is called the system configuration utility.

3
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:10,048
It's been in Client Windows for many years.

4
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:13,333
This is a screenshot of what it looks like in Windows Vista,

5
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,385
yet again, we don't have much change really.

6
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:20,568
We talked in the previous module about Task Manager and its evolution.

7
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:24,318
We've noticed that from earlier versions of Windows to Windows 10,

8
00:00:24,318 --> 00:00:26,995
Task Manager has taken on some additional tabs and

9
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:29,337
allowed you to have some deeper insights,

10
00:00:29,337 --> 00:00:32,024
but it's still the basic same application.

11
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:32,396
Similarly,

12
00:00:32,396 --> 00:00:35,748
you use the system configuration utility to modify how

13
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:37,944
your Windows 10 computer starts up.

14
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:41,748
I'll get into more specifics when we get to the demo.

15
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:46,101
Just know that it's been around since Windows Vista and its basic

16
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:49,698
functionality hasn't changed too much since then.

17
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:53,217
In this demo, we'll look at Administrative tools in Windows 10,

18
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:56,662
the MSCONFIG utility and the MMC framework.

19
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:59,468
We're not going to have the time or scope to get

20
00:00:59,468 --> 00:01:02,866
really in depth with every tool, that's not really the point.

21
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:05,837
The point is I want to make sure you know where to find them,

22
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:08,433
and in general, what they're used for in Windows 10.

23
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:11,657
Now I've brought out the Cortana search box.

24
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:15,339
You'll recall in the previous module we set up this machine for Cortana

25
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:19,220
and I have to say I've become quite taken with Cortana functionality

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,083
despite what I thought I would feel about it.

27
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,854
If you're wondering how to do that, we right-click an empty area of the task bar,

28
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:28,727
come up to Cortana, and instead of showing the Cortana icon,

29
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:30,285
I'm showing the search box itself.

30
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:33,163
And if we come in here and type administrative tools,

31
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:36,662
as long as you're running an appropriate Windows 10 SKU,

32
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:39,059
you'll see that as the best match.

33
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:42,848
I'm going to press Enter to accept that and it takes us again into the

34
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:45,825
traditional Control Panel into Administrative Tools.

35
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:49,060
Now what are the most important of these tools?

36
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,054
Well, that's difficult.

37
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:53,367
Some are certainly ones that you'll use more than others.

38
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:56,082
One that I'll start with here is Computer Management.

39
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:59,888
I like the Computer Management console, let's me maximize this guy,

40
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:02,788
because computer management is actually a rollup of

41
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,832
several administrative tools in one.

42
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:06,935
Now the Microsoft Management Console,

43
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:09,465
you notice that it works on the basis of panes.

44
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:13,863
You can control these panes, their visibility, by using these buttons.

45
00:02:13,863 --> 00:02:18,150
Now the right Actions pane tends to reflect what happens when you

46
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,252
right-click a node in the first pane so I tend to turn that off.

47
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:24,376
Your mileage may vary.

48
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:28,855
And then the way the MMC works, we have these components called snap-ins,

49
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:33,304
the idea that MMC consoles are fully customizable.

50
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:36,837
Now computer management is not customizable because it's a built-in console,

51
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:40,193
but I'll show you in just a minute how to create your own ones.

52
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,961
So for local users and groups, we can pop in here,

53
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:46,568
and if you wanted to change a password or create a new user,

54
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:48,563
you can certainly do that, and again,

55
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:51,588
right mouse clicking is a good way to go for that.

56
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,323
I love the right mouse button.

57
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:56,184
If you want to manage the disks on your system,

58
00:02:56,184 --> 00:03:01,131
if you've popped in a new USB thumb drive and you want to format or reformat it,

59
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:03,552
this is your tool for doing that.

60
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,261
Device Manager has been part of client and server Windows for

61
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:11,049
seemingly forever and this is where you can view the devices that

62
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:15,520
are detected and the drivers that are loaded for those machines by

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,141
Windows and make customizations, disable hardware,

64
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:21,735
enable hardware, etc, etc.

65
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:26,422
So this is just one example of many of these MMC console tools.

66
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:28,717
Another one that's really important is services.

67
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:31,189
When you're troubleshooting Windows 10 Client machines,

68
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:36,086
maybe if the user complains that they feel their system is running too slowly,

69
00:03:36,086 --> 00:03:39,293
you'll want to open the Services panel and take a look at it.

70
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:41,704
You can sort on these different criteria.

71
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:44,454
Let's look at only services that are running.

72
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:48,213
Now in contrast, remember with Task Manager in the previous module,

73
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:52,138
if we right-click the Taskbar settings and bring out Task Manager,

74
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:56,932
we can look at our startup items with their startup impacts.

75
00:03:56,932 --> 00:04:00,508
These are certainly going to be mapped to particular services and we can

76
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:04,831
actually go to the services list here and this seems to give us about the

77
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:08,051
same information that you see in the Services console,

78
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,460
including the ability to start, stop, and restart the service,

79
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,385
but if you want to do anything more dramatic than that,

80
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:17,990
then you'll want to open the services console specifically.

81
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,439
And if you double-click one of these, you can control its run state,

82
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,070
as well as whether it starts up automatically,

83
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,191
or manually, or if you've decided to disable a service.

84
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:31,318
You may find that if a user has connectivity problems or application problems,

85
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:35,695
you may find that its underlying service had been disabled accidentally and

86
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:40,019
you can fix the problem simply by reenabling that service,

87
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:40,490
okay.

88
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,955
So those are Administrative tools.

89
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:43,127
Now check this out.

90
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:45,849
I'm going to right-click the Start button and go to Run,

91
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,100
of course, you could always do Windows key+R,

92
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,962
and if you type MMC, as long as you're an administrator,

93
00:04:50,962 --> 00:04:54,862
once again, we're hit with this User Account Control consent thing,

94
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:58,960
we get an empty MMC console, it just shows Console Root.

95
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,581
Before we do anything, I'm going to do a Save and notice if I open the Save in,

96
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:06,668
it's going to want to put it in the Windows

97
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:09,622
Administrative Tools folder under my user profile.

98
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:13,229
It's a really long path, AppData, Roaming,

99
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,478
Microsoft, Windows, Start Menu, Programs.

100
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:17,101
So wherever I am,

101
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:20,972
whatever machine I log into assuming that the network is

102
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:25,008
configured for roaming user profiles, I'll be able to get to this console.

103
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:27,477
I do this a lot actually as an administrator.

104
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:32,120
I might call this Admin Console as a matter of fact because it allows me to

105
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,100
bring together my most powerful Administrative tools.

106
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,371
This gets saved as a.

107
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:39,642
mmc, Microsoft Management Console file.

108
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:44,231
So now I can open the File menu and select Add/Remove Snap-in and we

109
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:47,923
have a list of all available snap-ins on this machine.

110
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:51,285
Event viewer is really good for diagnostics purposes because it

111
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:54,115
shows you all of the messages that Windows,

112
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:56,252
as well as other applications write.

113
00:05:56,252 --> 00:06:00,815
And check this out, many of these MMC snap-ins are remote computer aware.

114
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:02,973
They're going to default to your current machine,

115
00:06:02,973 --> 00:06:05,127
but you can also connect to another computer,

116
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:09,667
and in many cases, not all, I want to be careful not to use a global statement,

117
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:10,724
but in many cases,

118
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:14,727
you can connect to machines running older versions of Windows Client,

119
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:15,234
Windows Server.

120
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:17,011
I mean, there is a limit there.

121
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:17,626
In fact,

122
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:21,084
check the exercise files for some documentation on that and you

123
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:23,746
may also need to provide alternate credentials.

124
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:26,824
This shouldn't be a problem if you're logged on as a network administrator,

125
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:30,545
but that actually brings in another set of problems related to

126
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:33,093
security that we'll leave there for now.

127
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,890
I'm going to select local computer and we can just

128
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,621
keep bringing other items in here.

129
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:41,093
If I want to manage the digital certificates that are the system,

130
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:41,593
and here,

131
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:44,794
it's asking us do you want to see just your own user

132
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:47,521
account certificates or the entire computer.

133
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:50,514
I'll just leave the default here and click OK.

134
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:54,407
And now if I do a File, Save, I have this custom console,

135
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:56,618
and remember, what's neat is that we could have,

136
00:06:56,618 --> 00:07:01,342
for instance, multiple snap-ins of the same type where one looks at our machine,

137
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:03,966
another one looks at another machine on the network,

138
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,727
another one looks at a server,

139
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,072
that's the power of the MMC framework and that's probably why

140
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:11,792
it's still around because it really works.

141
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:15,385
I'm going to save the console settings, and if I come down to Cortana,

142
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:18,923
let me see if I can type admin console and have it show up.

143
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:19,236
Nope.

144
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:20,803
It's not finding it unfortunately.

145
00:07:20,803 --> 00:07:23,415
Let's see if it's showing up in here.

146
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:24,461
No, it's not.

147
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:24,809
Hmm.

148
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:25,855
Well, no problem.

149
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:28,254
We can always come back to Run,

150
00:07:28,254 --> 00:07:33,320
open up a new instance of mmc on this machine and do a File,

151
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,475
we've got our recently opened consoles down here and it's not lost.

152
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:41,060
I can do a Save as and put it wherever I want to.

153
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,161
I'm going to actually put it on the desktop.

154
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:44,205
There we go.

155
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:51,000
So now at my ready reference, I can double left-click, consent, and then I have my console.
