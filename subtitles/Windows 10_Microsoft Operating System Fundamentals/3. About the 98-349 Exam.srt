1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:06,469
Now let's look at the 98-349 exam in greater detail.

2
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:10,053
The Microsoft Windows Operating System Essentials

3
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:13,996
certification exam has the exam ID 98-349.

4
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:17,969
Every Microsoft certification exam has a unique identifier.

5
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:21,656
The number will stay the same over the course of years

6
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:23,795
and over the course of exam revisions.

7
00:00:23,795 --> 00:00:28,098
Occasionally Microsoft will retire an exam and replace it with a new number,

8
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:30,560
or it'll just retire it and it will disappear.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,557
This exam was published in April of 2011,

10
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:38,223
so as of this recording in 2018 that's a good number of years back.

11
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:41,913
It's most recently been updated August of 2016.

12
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:46,674
Now, there's lots of inconsistent information on the web about this exam.

13
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:49,896
You'll find references to Microsoft learning posts

14
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:52,587
where this is listed as a retired exam,

15
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:55,651
and then when you try to investigate the reference it 404s,

16
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:58,559
which means that the page has been taken offline.

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,624
As you see in the left, the graphic there,

18
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:05,101
that says 2017, so the certification is still alive,

19
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:08,633
is still around as of this recording, even though,

20
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:09,634
like I said,

21
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:12,008
it's not particularly well-documented and there's lots

22
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:13,742
of rumors about it disappearing.

23
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:17,583
That having been said, I want you to focus on your technical skills.

24
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:22,101
The certification is great, the certification may definitely be on your radar,

25
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:25,434
but the most important thing I want you to take away from this course

26
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:28,760
are a bunch of new skills on supporting Windows 10,

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,762
and how you can apply those skills on the job and even in

28
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:35,636
your personal life helping those around you.

29
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:38,535
As far as understanding the certification process,

30
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:41,291
if you've never studied for a certification,

31
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,941
if you've never taken a computer-based exam,

32
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:47,022
if you're not sure how to register for Microsoft exams,

33
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:49,992
I'm not going to spend any time here explaining it,

34
00:01:49,992 --> 00:01:51,477
because I've already done so.

35
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:56,556
Look at the URL at the bottom of this screen, timw.

36
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:57,018
info/mvac.

37
00:01:57,018 --> 00:02:00,034
That'll take you to the Microsoft Virtual Academy website.

38
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:01,753
I put together two courses there.

39
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:03,758
The first one is of particular import.

40
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:07,120
It's called Mastering Microsoft Certification Exam Prep.

41
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,914
You study that,

42
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:11,586
I guarantee you'll come out with a crystal clear understanding of what

43
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:15,019
goes into studying for a Microsoft certification exam,

44
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:18,760
how to register, the whole workflow, I cover it in great detail.

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,052
And then Building an IT Certification Study Lab is

46
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:26,138
really nice guidance on how you can, for fun and for free,

47
00:02:26,138 --> 00:02:30,774
develop a hands-on learning environment at home with minimal cost.

48
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:35,043
I've developed an approach to studying for certification exams.

49
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:37,135
I haven't trademarked this, maybe I should.

50
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:41,677
I call it my certificate Study Pyramid, because I strongly believe,

51
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:46,687
after having taken it's got to be over 100 certification exams over the years,

52
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:49,819
that we have three elements that are all interdependent and need

53
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:52,907
to be present in order for you to succeed.

54
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:54,681
First we have content knowledge.

55
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:57,783
This is understanding the theory of the learning domain,

56
00:02:57,783 --> 00:03:00,703
and the learning domain in this course, of course,

57
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:01,761
is Windows 10.

58
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:05,289
I covered a lot of features, a lot of capabilities,

59
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:08,757
and I also gave you real-world examples of how those

60
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:10,935
features come into play in business.

61
00:03:10,935 --> 00:03:12,789
That's your theoretical content knowledge.

62
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:14,856
Now, if you're working in IT already,

63
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:17,907
you may have already applied a lot of that knowledge,

64
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:18,537
practical application,

65
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:22,110
where you can take what you know about Windows theoretically and

66
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,858
see how it actually behaves in the real work.

67
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:27,139
If you're not yet working in that industry,

68
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,100
then you have some additional work to do,

69
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,915
like I said a moment ago, building a home study lab network is a good idea.

70
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:37,355
You really need to have both of these elements in place by the

71
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:40,132
time you sit for any certification exam,

72
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:42,225
the hands-on and the theory.

73
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:45,839
The third element of my study pyramid is test-taking strategy.

74
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:48,024
I know many people over the years, sadly,

75
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:52,071
who went into their exam session with lots of content knowledge,

76
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:53,412
even practical application,

77
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:56,502
but because they weren't expecting a computer-based test,

78
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,483
and they weren't accustomed to how Microsoft wants to ask

79
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:01,809
those questions and test your knowledge,

80
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:03,025
they didn't pass.

81
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:08,057
So there what I recommend you do is choose a good reputable,

82
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:09,315
legal exam simulation.

83
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:09,728
Measureup.

84
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:15,095
com is a company that is an official practice exam provider for Microsoft.

85
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:18,691
There are others that I recommend, like Transcender and Boson.

86
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,363
I have links to all of those companies in the exercise files.

87
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:25,595
If you're part of an enterprise subscription with Pluralsight,

88
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:29,288
you do have access to Transcender certification exams.

89
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:33,708
so you do have the test-taking strategy element in place.

90
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,763
Let's take a moment to consider learning styles.

91
00:04:36,763 --> 00:04:40,340
What is your preferred way to learn new concepts?

92
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,359
It's crucial that you do some reflection and

93
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:46,001
determine how you best learn new stuff.

94
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,115
For instance, are you a visual learner?

95
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:52,113
This would be somebody who learns really well with books or watching

96
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:54,904
computer-based training like you have here with Pluralsight.

97
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:59,692
Here you're visual, you like images, you like to see spatial relationships,

98
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:02,542
you maybe work cognitively using mind maps,

99
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:04,271
if you're familiar with those.

100
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:09,476
An auditory learner is big on listening and discussion and repetition.

101
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,187
If you're faced with memorizing protocols and ports,

102
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,778
you might develop mnemonic devices.

103
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:17,597
It's the sound and shape of the words that helps you understand,

104
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:21,379
and also dialoging with peers, with your instructor,

105
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:21,852
etc.

106
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:26,087
Kinesthetic is hands-on, you learn best by experiencing.

107
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:27,672
You don't necessarily want to talk about it,

108
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:32,378
you don't want to watch movies on it, you want to do discovery and make mistakes.

109
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:35,353
Now, you may fit mostly in one of these three categories,

110
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:39,773
or you might be like me where I'm fairly divided across all three.

111
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,358
But the way you determine, or should I say,

112
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,055
when you determine your learning style,

113
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:47,166
that's going to take you down in your cert study to

114
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:51,891
rely more or less heavily on, say, video prerecorded training like Pluralsight,

115
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,427
technical instruction books or websites,

116
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:59,354
or the practical aspect, hands-on labs and real-world experience.

117
00:05:59,354 --> 00:06:01,667
I don't want to belabor this,

118
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,944
because from a student's perspective it's got to get pretty tedious,

119
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:07,882
but I have a few slides that I've taken screen

120
00:06:07,882 --> 00:06:11,291
captures from the exam 98-349 blueprint.

121
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,696
As I said at the end of the previous module,

122
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:16,057
I structured this course according to the blueprint,

123
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:17,805
so we cover every topic.

124
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:20,895
And actually it's good to go through this as a sanity check to

125
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:23,240
make sure that we've learned all this stuff,

126
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,615
and also it's good as far as recognition,

127
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,499
patting yourself on the back like, wow,

128
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:31,702
I know a heck of a lot more than I did before I started this training.

129
00:06:31,702 --> 00:06:36,237
So we have the blueprint divided into objective domains, or ODs.

130
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:37,506
These are top-level categories.

131
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:40,443
This first one is called operating system configurations.

132
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:44,286
And notice that Microsoft gives you an estimated

133
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:45,630
percentage of the overall question pool.

134
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,498
We started with control panel, with administrative tools.

135
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:54,029
We've done a lot with classic Control Panel and the Windows 10 Settings ap.

136
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:56,908
We've looked and worked with File Explorer a great deal.

137
00:06:56,908 --> 00:07:00,158
Desktop settings, we certainly looked at the desktop environment,

138
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:03,247
the Start menu, the taskbar, toolbars.

139
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:06,766
Native applications, we used Edge and Cortana,

140
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:10,718
client Hyper-V, MSCONFIG, Task Manager, the computer management console.

141
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:14,863
For mobility, we did Sync Center and the Windows Mobility Center,

142
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:17,591
we did RDP, that's Remote Desktop Protocol.

143
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:21,426
For management tools, we spent a lot of time in Microsoft management consoles,

144
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:24,757
and I also tried to inject as much PowerShell and

145
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:27,115
PowerShell ISE into the course as I could.

146
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:29,663
The next objective domain is installing and upgrading,

147
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:34,429
and we began with looking at system requirements and Windows editions.

148
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:37,678
We did upgrades and application compatibility.

149
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:40,887
We did installation types, clean installation,

150
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:43,490
using Windows Update, network installations.

151
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,229
We worked with operating system architecture, 64-bit, 32-bit, all that.

152
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:50,857
In the applications objective domain,

153
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:54,043
we looked at applications from a number of different lenses,

154
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:54,667
didn't we?

155
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:59,260
Network and local applications, Windows Store apps versus desktop apps,

156
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,753
the SmartScreen filter, user account control and how that fits into security,

157
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:07,855
Windows Defender Security Center, the Malicious Software Removal Tool.

158
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:12,131
For services we looked through PowerShell and the Service Control Manager,

159
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,838
how to control service behavior.

160
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:16,468
In the files and folders objective domain,

161
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:21,012
we covered file systems, we did a lot on networking and file sharing,

162
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:24,426
NTFS, and Share Permissions, HomeGroup, printers,

163
00:08:24,426 --> 00:08:28,417
shared folders, etc., BitLocker and Encrypting File System.

164
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:31,905
We did more with File Explorer, with libraries, remember that?

165
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:34,117
Offline files would be another subject.

166
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:38,614
For managing devices, we looked at plug-and-play and printer installation,

167
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:43,684
and device driver management, all sorts of local and remote storage options,

168
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:46,524
quite a bit with OneDrive and how that functions,

169
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:49,159
printing devices, both local and remote,

170
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,164
installation management, internet printing,

171
00:08:51,164 --> 00:09:02,000
print-to-file, system devices, understanding Device Manager. Ah, enough with these lists, let's get into a demo to break up the monotony.
