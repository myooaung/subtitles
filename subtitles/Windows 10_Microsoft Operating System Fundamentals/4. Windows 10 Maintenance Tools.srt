1
00:00:01,528 --> 00:00:05,114
Local disk maintenance.

2
00:00:05,114 --> 00:00:08,440
Now depending upon what kind of disk you're using in Windows 10,

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,423
namely if it's a physical or virtual disk,

4
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:14,675
and whether the physical disk is HDD or SSD,

5
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:18,047
you'll want to perform routine and regular maintenance to

6
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:21,220
maximize the efficiency of the disk's performance,

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,135
as well as to extend its lifetime.

8
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:26,258
So we have a number of tools built into Windows 10.

9
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:29,058
Some are new, like the Windows Automatic Maintenance tool,

10
00:00:29,058 --> 00:00:32,495
and some have been around so long they even predate

11
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:35,750
Windows and existed originally in MS-DOS.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,740
The Windows Automatic Maintenance tool is essentially a wizard,

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,379
it's very difficult to turn this off actually,

14
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:45,327
Microsoft really wants it to be on and running,

15
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:47,939
that will routinely perform some of the other

16
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,955
utilities that you'll see on this slide.

17
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:54,770
Disk defragmentation has been around for a long time.

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,292
It's relevant primarily with HDD storage.

19
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:59,347
You might remember way back when,

20
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:02,685
when we talked about disk partitions and volumes and the fact that on

21
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:05,958
a volume you have these clusters that are the fundamental allocation

22
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:11,387
units when Windows stores data for you, and over time as you're copying files,

23
00:01:11,387 --> 00:01:14,150
moving files, deleting files, saving new files,

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,737
it's possible, and likely,

25
00:01:15,737 --> 00:01:19,912
that the different clusters that make up a particular file or

26
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:22,459
application may become spread across the disk,

27
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:26,242
and that's going to slow read performance of course because your

28
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:30,278
physical disk's going to have to wander all over those disk platters

29
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:33,614
to round up all of the associated clusters.

30
00:01:33,614 --> 00:01:39,129
Defragmentation software puts all of the file clusters right next to each other,

31
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:42,917
what's called contiguously, and this of course improves I/O.

32
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:46,611
Now there's another operation mixed up with defragmentation

33
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:49,120
called trim that you can do on solid-state drives,

34
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,774
but we're not going to be concerned with that necessarily.

35
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:54,841
In the demo I'm going to show you all these tools,

36
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:57,330
so more will become plain as we go along.

37
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,239
In general though,

38
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,437
you don't want to run traditional disk defragmentation on a

39
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:05,443
flash drive because a flash drive doesn't store data in a

40
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:08,093
cluster map like what happens on HDDs.

41
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:10,615
Disk Cleanup has been around in Windows for a while.

42
00:02:10,615 --> 00:02:12,747
It's a way to purge temp files.

43
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:16,065
Of course, in your browsers you can purge temp files,

44
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:19,226
but Disk Cleanup provides a centralized interface to

45
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:20,646
give you back some disk space.

46
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:20,883
Frankly,

47
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:23,933
this tool used to be more important years ago when

48
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,971
disk storage was more expensive.

49
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:29,070
Windows Update is a service that's non-optional.

50
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,388
You absolutely need to have your Windows 10 machine updating,

51
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:36,262
depending upon which deployment and update ring you're in.

52
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:38,755
If you're in the regular semi-annual channel,

53
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:41,357
you're going to receive updates on a schedule.

54
00:02:41,357 --> 00:02:44,576
We'll have more to talk about Windows Update in detail later,

55
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:48,098
but the bottom line is if you're not using Windows Update,

56
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:51,994
you're rapidly expanding the attack surface,

57
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:54,798
or potential attack surface of your machine.

58
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:58,244
System Restore is a way to roll your system back in time.

59
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,498
If, for instance, you install a bad driver,

60
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:04,007
or if you install an application and you really regret it,

61
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:07,457
and even trying to uninstall the application is unsuccessful,

62
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:10,879
System Restore takes snapshots of your system periodically,

63
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,122
and allows you, as I said, to roll back.

64
00:03:14,122 --> 00:03:16,653
Now a common fear that people have, some people have,

65
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:20,441
about System Restore is that well, if I restore my system back to,

66
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:24,441
say, last Tuesday, I'm going to lose all of my data that I created.

67
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:25,276
That's not true.

68
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:28,059
The only stuff that's going to be rolled back are

69
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:40,000
application and configuration changes, which still might be inconvenient, but a heck of a lot more convenient than potentially reinstalling Windows.
