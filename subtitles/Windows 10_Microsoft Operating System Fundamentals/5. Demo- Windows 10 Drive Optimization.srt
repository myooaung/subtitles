1
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,631
In this demonstration, we'll look at drive optimization,

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,356
built-in ones, in Windows 10.

3
00:00:07,356 --> 00:00:11,161
Let me open the Start menu and type automatic maintenance,

4
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:15,186
and we can choose the Change Automatic Maintenance

5
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:17,393
settings to bring up the dialog.

6
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:19,645
This is classic Control Panel, as you can see,

7
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,587
and it tells us here that Windows will automatically

8
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:24,277
run the scheduled maintenance.

9
00:00:24,277 --> 00:00:27,039
The only options you have, notice there's no on/off,

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,410
is to change when the maintenance tasks run,

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,410
I have mine set to 2:00 AM,

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,700
and whether to allow the scheduled maintenance to wake up

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,786
your computer at the scheduled time.

14
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:40,621
Well first of all, let me just read a bit of this explanatory text.

15
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:44,486
The Automatic Maintenance is stuff like running Windows Update,

16
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:48,248
running an antimalware scan, system diagnostics.

17
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,151
If we come back to Security and Maintenance,

18
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:54,439
it gives us this interface, and of course they're divided into two sections,

19
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:59,066
Security, which allows you to check whether you've got your firewall,

20
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:03,317
virus protection, browser security, and User Account Control enabled.

21
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:06,416
And then under Maintenance, we can open up the reliability monitor,

22
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:10,548
we'll look at that later in the course, we can start a maintenance activity,

23
00:01:10,548 --> 00:01:14,535
or we can change maintenance settings in Automatic Maintenance.

24
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:17,703
The changing settings brings us back to where we started.

25
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,567
Let me expand this again.

26
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:22,549
Start maintenance will actually kick off the process.

27
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:26,748
And User Account Control, this is obviously an administrator task,

28
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:28,422
so let me authenticate as such,

29
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,880
and we don't see any obvious indication that it's going on.

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,864
I'm opening up the notification area here and looking for an indication.

31
00:01:35,864 --> 00:01:38,369
If we right-click and go into Task Manager,

32
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,609
once again running as a standard user means that you'll be typing in

33
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:45,053
your password more often than you would otherwise.

34
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:47,388
And let's look at our processes.

35
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:50,113
I'll do an inverse sort by CPU.

36
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:53,268
It looks like it's running an antimalware scan right now.

37
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:55,647
So all this is happening in the background.

38
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:56,933
While that's happening,

39
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:00,362
let's continue our trolley ride through maintenance tools.

40
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:03,226
I'm going to open Start and type optimize,

41
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:07,275
and this allows us to open Defragment and Optimize Drives.

42
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:09,651
This is a desktop application,

43
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:12,335
and you'll notice if you've used Disk Defragmenter

44
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:15,520
in previous versions of Windows, now it's called Optimize Drives,

45
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,807
and the reason for that is if it's an HDD drive,

46
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,152
you can choose to run a defragment operation.

47
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:28,585
If it's a solid-state drive, what it will do is perform a trim operation.

48
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:32,927
Trim is effectively a method where Windows will examine your solid-state

49
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:38,138
drive on all of the pages that have data and those that are not necessary

50
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:40,684
any more that data is still being held on,

51
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:43,604
and it will free up that area of the disk.

52
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:47,575
The advantage of running trim is instead of doing individual

53
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:51,441
operations on individual blocks that consume the number of

54
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:54,815
read/write cycles that an SDD has in its lifetime,

55
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:58,129
it can do a mass clearing all at once.

56
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:00,560
As far as how we can change the settings,

57
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,460
again we have a User Account Control protected setting.

58
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,861
The default schedule is to run this weekly and to notify you if

59
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:11,251
three consecutive scheduled runs are missed.

60
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:14,880
And you can also choose which disks you want

61
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,896
involved in this optimization process.

62
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,766
So it's a basic control surface.

63
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:22,003
It's nice to have this enabled and scheduled to run.

64
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:26,173
The automatic maintenance is a nice sanity check where you don't have to

65
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,925
worry about running your antimalware scanner on a schedule.

66
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:31,933
Let's return to Start and type Disk Cleanup.

67
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,717
Again, this is a desktop app.

68
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:36,690
It functions the same way it always has over years.

69
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,799
It asks you which drive you want to clean up,

70
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,350
I'll choose drive C, and you'll see the categories of data that it inspects.

71
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,980
Downloaded Program Files, Temporary Internet Files,

72
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,368
Delivery Optimization Files,

73
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:52,895
that's where you're using Windows Update and the

74
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:54,394
Windows Update Delivery Optimization,

75
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:58,321
that's where you can download updates from other computers in a

76
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,065
peer-to-peer fashion to speed up update delivery.

77
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:03,620
Recycle Bin, Temp files, and Thumbnails.

78
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,603
And then there's a protected option for cleaning up system files as well.

79
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:09,063
Now there's third-party products.

80
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:13,727
You might have heard of CCleaner, and Defraggler, and Auslogics Disk Defrag.

81
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:17,026
I'm a big fan of the Diskeeper products.

82
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:22,494
They have an SSD keeper for SSD drives, and Diskeeper for HDD drives,

83
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:26,169
but I'm limiting myself to what's in-box in Windows 10,

84
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:35,000
and as a Windows 10 support professional/power user, it's important that you know where those tools are and how to use them.
