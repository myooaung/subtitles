00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:04,312
In summary, what have we learned in this module.

2
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:06,030
Well first, it's becoming more difficult.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,995
I was going to say impossible when I wrote this slide,

4
00:00:08,995 --> 00:00:11,296
but now I don't want to be too blanket.

5
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:14,621
It's becoming increasingly difficult, let's just say it that way,

6
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:16,466
to avoid virtual digital assistance.

7
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:20,888
I would bet you my bank account that your phone that you carry has

8
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:23,330
a digital assistant of some kind built into it,

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,806
and it's nice that if you choose to adopt that trust model

10
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:29,547
that I said with Microsoft that you can help,

11
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:33,144
you can work with Cortana and really be much more efficient and

12
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:36,173
make it easier for you to learn new stuff.

13
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:36,558
Second,

14
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:41,578
Client Hyper-V gives you an excellent environment to test not only Windows 10,

15
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:45,026
but other Windows versions in a safe sandboxed environment.

16
00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:49,178
Much of this course actually involves some demonstrations that if you're

17
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:52,354
not careful and not being conscious in what you're doing,

18
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:55,402
you could wind up maybe not hosing up your system totally,

19
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:58,304
but at least putting it in a non-desired state.

20
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:02,948
Thus, by using Client Hyper-V, installing a test instance of Windows 10,

21
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:06,591
check the exercise files, I'm pretty sure I mentioned this earlier,

22
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:11,088
but the Microsoft evaluation center allows you to download any of

23
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:15,322
their operating system software as a free fully featured trial and

24
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:18,826
work there because there you can do anything you want without fear

25
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:21,228
of losing any of your real work.

26
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:22,987
So that ends that module.

27
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:25,333
As I said at the end of the previous module,

28
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,972
this one here has been a book end of sorts.

29
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:32,214
We're going to look at the administrative applications in Windows 10 next.

30
00:01:32,214 --> 00:01:37,000
Thanks for your attention. I'll see you then.
