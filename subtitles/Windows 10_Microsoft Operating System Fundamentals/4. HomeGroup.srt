1
00:00:02,373 --> 00:00:07,271
The HomeGroup is a simplified method for file sharing.

2
00:00:07,271 --> 00:00:11,306
When Microsoft introduced this, well before this time,

3
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:16,479
Apple really hadn't had a good, solid grasp on the consumer market.

4
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:21,010
Nowadays, Apple likes to advertise its products as just working together,

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,664
and that's largely true.

6
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:25,357
On my home iMac system, for instance,

7
00:00:25,357 --> 00:00:30,053
I can load a movie into iTunes and then stream it immediately across my

8
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:34,668
network onto my Apple TV and then onto my high-definition TV.

9
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,856
I can do the same thing with my other Apple devices without

10
00:00:37,856 --> 00:00:41,100
having to worry at all about IP addresses,

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,360
sharing protocols, and the like.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,882
In Windows,

13
00:00:43,882 --> 00:00:46,490
that's typically what you have to get into the weeds

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,833
with to do simple media sharing on, say,

15
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:54,465
a consumer home network or perhaps even the smallest of business networks.

16
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:56,457
So the idea of a HomeGroup,

17
00:00:56,457 --> 00:01:01,646
it's a simplified interface for a system to share some or all of its resources.

18
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:05,710
As you can see, this is a screenshot from the Create a Homegroup wizard,

19
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,647
and you can share out your pictures, videos,

20
00:01:09,647 --> 00:01:11,035
music, documents libraries,

21
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:15,880
or even printers or other hardware devices like an external hard drive.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,773
You can selectively share those and then protect them with a simple password.

23
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:24,789
On other systems that you want to connect to from,

24
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:29,986
you would simply browse through in File Explorer any available HomeGroups.

25
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:32,172
If you're on the same local area network,

26
00:01:32,172 --> 00:01:34,073
you should see that advertised HomeGroup,

27
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:37,306
and them supply the password to join it,

28
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,518
and you're in.

29
00:01:38,518 --> 00:01:42,129
So that is the basic use case for home and small,

30
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:45,248
small business environments who need to do file and

31
00:01:45,248 --> 00:01:47,327
media sharing in a simplified way.

32
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:51,064
Now if it sounds like I'm not going into detail on HomeGroup,

33
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:54,869
that's because HomeGroup is officially deprecated.

34
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,326
This is a screenshot from one of the Windows Client blogs.

35
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,654
If you're not a fan of really simple syndication,

36
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,770
or RSS, I suggest that you do so.

37
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,550
My favorite RSS aggregator is Feedly, but there's plenty of them around,

38
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,294
and you'll want to keep up to date with the different Windows blogs,

39
00:02:12,294 --> 00:02:13,417
the major ones.

40
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,229
The Windows Client blog is one.

41
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:17,947
I have the attribution link in the lower left.

42
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:23,633
But this announcement that centers on the Fall 2017 Creators Update,

43
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:28,055
the 1709 update, tells us that we're going to start to retire,

44
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:32,120
Microsoft, that is, is going to begin retiring the HomeGroup service,

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,068
and in a future update, that is probably Spring 2018,

46
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:39,012
the HomeGroup service will no longer be operational.

47
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:41,576
So in the real world, you don't want to use HomeGroup,

48
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:44,276
and if you have customers, clients who are using it,

49
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:49,720
you want to wean them off HomeGroup into a different media sharing mechanism.

50
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,509
Now the Microsoft Certification Exams sometimes lag

51
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:55,842
behind what's happening in the field, so on your MTA exam,

52
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,451
you may see a question or so referencing HomeGroup.

53
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:01,964
I've given you essentially what you need to know to

54
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:04,092
answer those questions successfully.

55
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:04,499
Instead,

56
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:08,162
the reason why Microsoft has deprecated HomeGroup is that

57
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:13,104
it's really not necessary anymore because cloud storage is

58
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:18,026
manifested in software as a service, or SaaS applications,

59
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:20,213
like Microsoft's own OneDrive.

60
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:23,503
There are other popular ones like Dropbox and Box.

61
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,466
This is ubiquitous storage where you can install the

62
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,653
client application on your game console,

63
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:31,996
on your set-top box, on all of your computers,

64
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:34,220
on your phones, on your tablets,

65
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,456
and you have immediate access to any data that's in that account.

66
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:44,000
You see what I mean? So there's really no market need anymore for HomeGroup.
