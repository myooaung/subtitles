00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.344
Let's get into Microsoft accounts to a greater degree of depth,

2
00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:08.993
honing in very tightly on how they work in Windows 10.

3
00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:12.127
You might recall that in Windows 8 and Windows 8.

4
00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:12.440
1,

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.868
Microsoft was a little aggressive about wanting you to log

6
00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:18.427
onto the computer using a Microsoft account.

7
00:00:18.427 --> 00:00:23.311
Now, that can be a deal-breaker for many consumers who just don't trust,

8
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.044
frankly, they don't trust Microsoft to that degree,

9
00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:28.708
and don't want to do that, they want to use a local account.

10
00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:32.302
In a business environment that uses Active Directory we don't want to use

11
00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:34.788
Microsoft accounts for a number of different reasons.

12
00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:39.514
We want to use local accounts and Active Directory accounts on-premises.

13
00:00:39.514 --> 00:00:43.361
So in Windows 10, Microsoft has relaxed those guidances.

14
00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:45.869
I was going to say requirements, but it's really,

15
00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:47.732
strictly speaking, a strong suggestion.

16
00:00:47.732 --> 00:00:52.636
And what you see here is classic Control Panel under User Accounts,

17
00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:55.595
Manage Accounts we have a local account that I've

18
00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:57.447
renamed the Local Administrator Account,

19
00:00:57.447 --> 00:01:00.249
and then we also can define Microsoft account

20
00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:01.985
identities on that machine as well,

21
00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:05.320
and you notice that they show up with the email address that

22
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.594
you use to sign up for Microsoft accounts.

23
00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:11.753
Microsoft accounts do not have to have a Hotmail or Microsoft-owned domain.

24
00:01:11.753 --> 00:01:16.316
They can use any ISP domain; they can use apple.

25
00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:17.769
com or gmail.

26
00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:18.737
com, whatever.

27
00:01:18.737 --> 00:01:22.433
What are the benefits of linking a Microsoft account?

28
00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:24.230
There's really two ways to go.

29
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.988
You could link a Microsoft account to your local account,

30
00:01:26.988 --> 00:01:29.924
that's personally what I do and what I recommend you do,

31
00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:33.302
or you could log on entirely as a Microsoft account.

32
00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:36.047
Assuming that you're connecting your local on-premises

33
00:01:36.047 --> 00:01:39.964
account to your Microsoft account, you do derive some benefits there,

34
00:01:39.964 --> 00:01:40.860
namely cloud synchronization.

35
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.054
As you see here,

36
00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:45.155
notice that we're in the Settings Control Panel and

37
00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:47.060
not the classic control panel.

38
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.381
You can sync your desktop environment, your Internet Explorer and Edge settings,

39
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:53.017
your passwords.

40
00:01:53.017 --> 00:01:56.819
The idea is that you can log onto multiple Windows 10 machines

41
00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.270
and carry all of your preferences with you.

42
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.378
This can be nice if, for instance,

43
00:02:01.378 --> 00:02:04.584
a consumer owns a desktop computer and a laptop computer,

44
00:02:04.584 --> 00:02:07.032
and maybe even a Microsoft Surface tablet.

45
00:02:07.032 --> 00:02:11.250
They have, essentially, a roaming profile that goes from machine to machine.

46
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.268
That's one of the many benefits of cloud connectivity.

47
00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:14.619
However,

48
00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.774
in a business environment you may already have a

49
00:02:17.774 --> 00:02:19.475
roaming profile situation in place,

50
00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:24.060
or you may expressly forbid roaming profiles for security and space purposes.

51
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.152
So that brings up management issues concerning the Microsoft account.

52
00:02:28.152 --> 00:02:30.383
Another one would be what's called shadow IT.

53
00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:34.044
If you allow your Active Directory users to connect to a

54
00:02:34.044 --> 00:02:35.223
Microsoft account on their computers,

55
00:02:35.223 --> 00:02:37.963
then what's to stop them from going to the Microsoft App

56
00:02:37.963 --> 00:02:40.055
Store and downloading non-sanctioned apps,

57
00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:45.298
apps that you don't want them to run, and that you're not going to support?

58
00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:49.189
That actually brings up the management task of some businesses,

59
00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.915
to block Microsoft account creation on company-owned devices.

60
00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:55.921
Now on one level the Microsoft account gives the user a

61
00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:58.188
little bit more personality on their system.

62
00:02:58.188 --> 00:03:01.061
Especially today we have bring your own device,

63
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:04.291
and the blurring of the lines between corporate-owned

64
00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:06.169
devices and employee-owned devices,

65
00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.257
but a very legitimate concern in business is data leakage,

66
00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:12.480
that if a Windows 10 user, again,

67
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.173
is logged on with an Active Directory domain account and they have

68
00:03:16.173 --> 00:03:18.009
administrative privileges on their workstation,

69
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.526
which hopefully they never should,

70
00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:22.355
and they're able to connect to a Microsoft account on their machine,

71
00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:26.655
they could very easily copy corporate data to their own OneDrive account,

72
00:03:26.655 --> 00:03:27.993
you see what I mean?

73
00:03:27.993 --> 00:03:32.311
So, no surprise I'm sure, you can use Group Policy on Active directory,

74
00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:36.287
The path, as you see here, is under Computer Configuration,

75
00:03:36.287 --> 00:03:38.435
Windows Settings, Security Settings, Security Options.

76
00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:40.127
There's a couple of policies.

77
00:03:40.127 --> 00:03:44.009
This one that you see here is called Account Block Microsoft account,

78
00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:53.000
and you can set this to prevent users from connecting to a Microsoft account on their company-owned devices.
