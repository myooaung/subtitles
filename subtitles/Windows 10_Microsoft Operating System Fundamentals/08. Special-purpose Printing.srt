1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,459
We'll finish with special-purpose printing.

2
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:08,452
Now when I first got into the industry,

3
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:12,338
the concept of print to file was something that you never wanted to mess with.

4
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:15,297
What you're doing here is instead of printing to a

5
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:21,147
local or network-based printer, you're creating a more intermediary format,

6
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:24,581
a PRN file, a spool file basically, that you can then,

7
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:27,497
at least in theory, bring to another device.

8
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:31,435
Maybe you're on a computer and you're having connection problems

9
00:00:31,435 --> 00:00:34,325
actually getting the network print job to work,

10
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,516
you could print out to a PRN,

11
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:40,025
bring the PRN to another machine that does have a valid

12
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:41,645
connection to that network printer,

13
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:45,265
and then feed that PRN file directly to the printer.

14
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:46,274
Very clunky actually.

15
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:50,278
Nowadays in the 21st century when we talk about print to file,

16
00:00:50,278 --> 00:00:53,530
it's almost always taking a print job and producing an

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,950
Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format, or PDF file.

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,424
And Windows 10, finally at long last, has the capability in the print dialog,

19
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:06,290
the System Print dialog box, to do a print to PDF.

20
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,583
There was a while there for a few years where Microsoft tried to compete

21
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:13,156
with PDF by developing their own document specification,

22
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,567
the XPS format if you've ever heard of that,

23
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:20,200
but I think everybody understands now that PDF is a very universal,

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,033
and works perfectly fine, as a universal output format.

25
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:27,643
Now if you don't like the Windows PDF printer,

26
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:30,773
Adobe Acrobat, if you install that on a system,

27
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:33,755
it will have its own software printer, and as you would expect,

28
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:36,369
it's very much the difference between a class

29
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:38,330
driver and a device specific driver.

30
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,563
The Windows 10 built-in PDF driver is very basic and bare bones,

31
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:44,482
that's analogous to a class driver.

32
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:47,728
If you install Adobe Acrobat and use their PDF printer,

33
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,446
that's going to have all sorts of rendering options that's

34
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:55,172
tailored specifically to the Adobe PDF format.

35
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:55,727
Internet printing,

36
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:58,856
yet again this is a case where several years ago it

37
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:00,632
was just basically a novelty.

38
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:03,799
The idea of using the Internet Printing Protocol,

39
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,420
IPP, along with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol,

40
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,419
HTTP or HTTPS, to print to a remote printer that could be on your LAN,

41
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,253
could be at another branch office, or could be across the internet.

42
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:18,157
You could be on vacation, for instance,

43
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:21,542
and submit a print job from where you are on one side of the world,

44
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,141
and have it come out on a print device back at your

45
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:26,116
office on the other side of the world.

46
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:28,640
Now why would you want to do that is one question?

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,458
Well, there's some reasons,

48
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:33,216
enough to where I want to tell you that the internet printing protocol

49
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:36,089
does require some special firewall configuration.

50
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,400
The default port that it uses is TCP 631,

51
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,329
that's ordinarily blocked on any firewall worth its salt.

52
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,368
So in order to do internet printing,

53
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:47,747
you have to identify the use case and is this important enough

54
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:52,286
to where you want to expand your home or business network's

55
00:02:52,286 --> 00:02:54,826
attack surface just a little bit.

56
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:56,091
In general practice,

57
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:59,898
IPP may be useful because instead of doing network discovery

58
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:03,001
where you're clicking through the network control panel in

59
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:05,814
Windows 10 trying to search for a printer,

60
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:09,709
you can simply run the Add Printer wizard and provide an

61
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,522
HTTP path to a shared print queue.

62
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:15,587
And because you're specifying HTTP or HTTPS,

63
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:19,246
Windows 10 has the internet printing protocol driver already installed,

64
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:23,266
and it can, again, be a nice convenience for setting up printers.

65
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:26,675
There's some other ways to do internet printing if you've ever

66
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:29,659
heard of Google Cloud Print or Apple AirPrint,

67
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:31,187
these are methods for,

68
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:34,929
as long as your printer supports either or both of those technologies,

69
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:36,670
to make it easier to print.

70
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,120
I've used those, for instance,

71
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,700
to print something from my phone wirelessly to the

72
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,313
Inkjet printer that we have at our home.

73
00:03:44,313 --> 00:03:46,937
If you're using a VPN connection to your corporate

74
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:48,694
network when you're working remotely,

75
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:52,379
you're essentially at the corporate network from the perspective of the network,

76
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:58,000
so you can just do a regular print there. You don't have to worry about IPP.
