00:00:01.828 --> 00:00:04.945
Now I want to quickly cover libraries as well.

2
00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:06.666
Libraries is super useful.

3
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:10.660
If you've got multiple locations that have files that you're interested,

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.547
they could be music files or they could be document files,

5
00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:17.987
you can either use one of the built-in libraries or create one of your own.

6
00:00:17.987 --> 00:00:21.623
Now if you're wondering how to show the libraries node if it's not showing,

7
00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:24.926
what you'll want to do is go to View, Navigation pane,

8
00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:28.141
and ensure that Show libraries is there.

9
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:30.713
On the same pane, on View, under Options,

10
00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:34.049
remember when we were in Change folder and search options,

11
00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:38.379
here this is where you can customize quick access a little bit,

12
00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.273
as well as clear your File Explorer history of your recently selected items.

13
00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:46.130
But anyway, you have these default library items,

14
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.787
and if I right-click the built-in Documents and go to Properties,

15
00:00:49.787 --> 00:00:53.741
we can see that basically these libraries are virtual file

16
00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:57.714
locations that allow you to plug in multiple folders.

17
00:00:57.714 --> 00:01:00.744
These could be local folders on your system or network

18
00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:04.231
folders in your environment and you can aggregate them

19
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.379
together into one virtual location.

20
00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:07.271
Isn't that great?

21
00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:08.162
Not only that,

22
00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:13.867
you can choose a template for the library that says optimize this library for.

23
00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:14.403
The fold,

24
00:01:14.403 --> 00:01:17.081
the columns rather that you get are going to differ

25
00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:20.008
depending upon the folder template so documents,

26
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:23.701
for instance, will have it looks like date modified,

27
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:24.925
type, and size.

28
00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:28.260
Music has contributing artists, album, title.

29
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.923
See these are the different metadata columns that are available.

30
00:01:31.923 --> 00:01:36.333
Let me switch this view to details and we can see pictures has tags,

31
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.305
size, and rating.

32
00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:37.629
Again,

33
00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:41.247
you can right-click to always get to those different options to

34
00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:44.327
get to add or subtract columns I should say.

35
00:01:44.327 --> 00:01:46.487
And if you go to More, in some cases, my gosh,

36
00:01:46.487 --> 00:01:48.970
there's a whole bunch of different columns that you can

37
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.668
choose from based on that template.

38
00:01:50.668 --> 00:01:53.357
Now you can actually create your own library by right-clicking

39
00:01:53.357 --> 00:01:56.383
the Libraries node and coming down to New,

40
00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:56.777
Library.

41
00:01:56.777 --> 00:01:58.975
Give it a name, Project Files,

42
00:01:58.975 --> 00:02:02.980
and I can create pointers by right-clicking going to Properties,

43
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.794
clicking Add to different locations, I'm going to go to this location here,

44
00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:11.352
my microsoft-operating-system-fundamentals project folder,

45
00:02:11.352 --> 00:02:12.650
and I'm going to include that.

46
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.191
Whoop, we hit an error that it can't be included because it's not indexed.

47
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:16.510
Okay.

48
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.308
And then there is a helpful link on how you can index folders.

49
00:02:20.308 --> 00:02:22.731
Well, we get into that later in the course.

50
00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:25.162
So let me choose a local folder instead.

51
00:02:25.162 --> 00:02:27.910
When I'm in a dialog, a browse dialog like this,

52
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.138
you notice that we get,

53
00:02:29.138 --> 00:02:32.562
this is a clickable link where you can actually see the

54
00:02:32.562 --> 00:02:35.352
full path that took you to this location.

55
00:02:35.352 --> 00:02:39.266
So it actually goes on my D drive to Dropbox,

56
00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:41.419
to Pluralsight, to Tim Warner,

57
00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.703
to Microsoft-operating-system-fundamentals and I can

58
00:02:43.703 --> 00:02:46.472
even go inside one of these folders.

59
00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:50.142
You can walk back by clicking back through what's called

60
00:02:50.142 --> 00:02:52.411
the breadcrumb trail or check this out,

61
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:56.629
you can click once to highlight it and override the path completely.

62
00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.876
I'll look at C: to look at my C drive and let's just say I want inetpub,

63
00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:04.647
I'm going to add that to this location, and click OK.

64
00:03:04.647 --> 00:03:07.032
And now I see any contents in there,

65
00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:10.912
including it looks like a retro picture of a Commodore 64 computer,

66
00:03:10.912 --> 00:03:12.306
that's kind of cool.

67
00:03:12.306 --> 00:03:16.406
Alright, so we're going to use File Explorer a lot throughout this course.

68
00:03:16.406 --> 00:03:24.000
That's all I want to do right now. Let's click inside the address bar and go to c:\users.
