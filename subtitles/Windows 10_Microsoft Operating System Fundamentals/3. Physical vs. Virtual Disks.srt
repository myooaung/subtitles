1
00:00:01,307 --> 00:00:04,491
Let's compare and contrast on one side the concept of the

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:06,722
physical or logical disk versus the virtual disk.

3
00:00:06,722 --> 00:00:09,556
I want to make sure you're clear on this.

4
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:12,705
A physical or logical disk refers to hardware,

5
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:15,695
an actual piece of hardware that you can touch with your

6
00:00:15,695 --> 00:00:19,523
hands and install either inside the chassis of a computer

7
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:21,575
or plug into it externally.

8
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:25,481
Now a logical disk is where you partition a physical disk.

9
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:29,420
We've gone through that earlier in this course, so I hope you remember that.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,785
In Windows 10 we can use, for instance,

11
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:36,342
the Disk Management MMC console to divide space on a physical disk.

12
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:40,163
You might, for instance, have a partition for your Windows operating system,

13
00:00:40,163 --> 00:00:43,022
and another partition for your applications.

14
00:00:43,022 --> 00:00:46,636
And one benefit there is if you have a catastrophic OS error that

15
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:49,995
requires you to reformat drive C and reinstall Windows,

16
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:54,936
all of your user data will remain safe on a separate partition.

17
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:58,902
Now normally the physical disks are inconvenient as portable storage,

18
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:01,821
unless, of course, it's an external drive.

19
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:03,440
In helping customers over the years,

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,632
if they're moving to a new computer and they want to be

21
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:09,048
able to switch all their files over, migration scenario,

22
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:12,466
again we talked about that earlier in this course as well,

23
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:16,487
I'll sometimes open the customer's computer case using a screwdriver,

24
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:19,925
remove the hard drive from the person's original computer,

25
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:22,394
place it into an external drive enclosure,

26
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:24,672
you can buy those quite easily,

27
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:30,294
and then mount that using USB as removable storage on the user's new computer,

28
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:33,738
and then you could just simply tap in and copy off

29
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:35,332
all the data that you want to.

30
00:01:35,332 --> 00:01:36,243
Now a virtual disk,

31
00:01:36,243 --> 00:01:41,006
that term virtual sometimes causes confusion among newcomers to IT,

32
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:44,067
it's not imaginary so much as it is software.

33
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:48,913
A virtual disk is a file that resides on a physical disk.

34
00:01:48,913 --> 00:01:51,963
It's not a file you can open up with, say,

35
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:54,507
Microsoft Word or Notepad, it's a binary file.

36
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:55,831
In the Microsoft context,

37
00:01:55,831 --> 00:02:00,955
it's going to have either VHD or VHDX as its file extension.

38
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:05,558
That will associate that virtual disk with hypervisor software.

39
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,733
Hypervisor software is software that allows you to

40
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:11,256
create and manage virtual machines,

41
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:15,922
which are software representations of physical computers.

42
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:21,188
Hyper-V, as you probably already know, is Microsoft's own hypervisor product.

43
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:26,252
Business SKUs of Windows 10 include client-side Hyper-V as a feature.

44
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:28,800
Now when you use a virtual disk in Hyper-V,

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,505
the virtual disk from the perspective of the VM appears to be a physical disk.

46
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:36,561
You actually can use the same tools in Windows 10,

47
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:37,478
like for instance,

48
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:41,434
the Disk Management console that we've talked about and used in the past,

49
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:44,675
just the same way you would on real bare metal.

50
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:48,581
Another thing that differentiates virtual disks from physical disks is

51
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:51,591
that virtual disks are normally dynamically expanding.

52
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:56,772
That is, you may create a 60 GB virtual disk and attach it to your VM,

53
00:02:56,772 --> 00:03:00,164
but it will only occupy as much space on the hardware,

54
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:02,353
on the host's hardware, as you're using,

55
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:04,566
you see, and that's a good thing.

56
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:08,634
It is possible to do what's called thick provisioning and create a virtual

57
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:12,490
disk and allocate the full amount of space on the front end,

58
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,211
but it's generally best practice to let it dynamically expand so that you're

59
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:21,556
consuming less space on the hardware host's physical disk.

60
00:03:21,556 --> 00:03:24,752
Last thing I want to say about these virtual disks used with virtual

61
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:29,664
machines and hypervisors is that you can use tools like PowerShell to

62
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,701
easily convert files for use with different hypervisors.

63
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,027
Many times, for instance,

64
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:39,503
you can use a VHD or VHDX with very minor modification with,

65
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:41,823
say, a VMware infrastructure.

66
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:45,614
Hyper-V is Microsoft's world-class hypervisor.

67
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:47,231
VMware has vSphere.

68
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:50,560
My friend and Pluralsight colleague, Greg Shields,

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,775
and my friend and colleague, Dave Davis,

70
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:57,212
both have a lot of great VMware content in the Pluralsight library,

71
00:03:57,212 --> 00:04:08,000
but know that you can in fact use these VHDs in an eminently portable way. In fact, that's one of the great beauties of virtualization.
