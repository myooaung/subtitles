In summary, what have we learned in this module?

2
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:09,179
Well, first of all, just again, congratulations on completing this long,

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:09,753
in-depth journey.

4
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:13,859
I shake my head in amazement, and I taught it to you, this material.

5
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,599
I hope that you can answer this question with a rousing yes.

6
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:21,798
Are you more comfortable with Windows 10 now than you were when you began?

7
00:00:21,798 --> 00:00:25,038
I encourage you to take a Skill IQ test in Windows 10,

8
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:28,268
and just demonstrate for yourself, not to mention your employer,

9
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:30,536
how your skills have evolved.

10
00:00:30,536 --> 00:00:31,748
If you want to contact me,

11
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:34,838

12
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:38,244
