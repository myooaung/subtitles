00:00:01,944 --> 00:00:06,067
In this final demo of the module, I want to work with Windows Mobility Center.

2
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:10,198
Now I happen to know just obviously and intuitively that this

3
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:12,493
virtual machine is considered a desktop machine.

4
00:00:12,493 --> 00:00:15,711
I can test that actually by right-clicking the Start button,

5
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:20,106
going to Run, and trying to start the Mobility Center executable,

6
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:23,709
which for trivia's sake is mblctr.

7
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:27,952
exe, and it says Windows Mobility Center is available only on laptops,

8
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:29,553
but we know that we can override that.

9
00:00:29,553 --> 00:00:32,609
This is going to give us a chance to practice the

10
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,507
Registry and also to work with websites.

11
00:00:35,507 --> 00:00:37,936
This is a well-known site, vistasx64.

12
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:38,340
com.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,983
I link to this page in the exercise files.

14
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:44,463
And a site like this is intended,

15
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:48,935
their goal is to make it easier for you to implement a

16
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:52,210
Registry change by giving you the Reg file.

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,436
So here, it allows us to Enable_Desktop_WMC.

18
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:57,040
zip.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,706
So I'm downloading this zip file and I'm going to extract it to my desktop,

20
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:02,917
but I'm not going to double left-click it.

21
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:05,281
We want to be really careful.

22
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:08,038
Scan the file with your antimalware tool.

23
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:12,020
I'm going to right-click and go to Open with Notepad,

24
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,568
again, I have to be an administrator to do this,

25
00:01:14,568 --> 00:01:18,215
and this will tell you exactly what it's going to do and it

26
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:20,666
looks like it's going to add some paths.

27
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:24,187
If we don't have a mobile PC folder under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft,

28
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:26,156
it will add one,

29
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:32,801
and it's going to add a value called SkipBatteryCheck with a value of 1 and that

30
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:37,433
makes sense that we would need to disable the batteryCheck because a battery is

31
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,996
only going to be relevant for a laptop computer,

32
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:43,846
and then we're adding a value called RunOnDesktop 1,

33
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:46,313
which means true, which means enable.

34
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:49,075
So I'm actually okay with merging this.

35
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:49,357
Again,

36
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:52,745
have to be an administrator and we have to go through the

37
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,317
process of confirming that we want to do that.

38
00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:57,617
Now I'm imagining we have to restart.

39
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,690
We shouldn't be able to start the executable directly.

40
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,159
Oh, we sure were.

41
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,485
Great!

42
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:06,395
Well, it's one of those things, sometimes you have to log off,

43
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:09,427
sometimes you have to restart, sometimes it just works.

44
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:11,053
In this case, it just works.

45
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:12,679
So what do we have here.

46
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:16,058
Well there is no battery option, of course, as we said earlier.

47
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:20,023
We can adjust display, brightness, there is not much we can do.

48
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:22,553
There is presentation, turn on or turn off.

49
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:25,937
It's kind of limited because some of these options really

50
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,900
are geared toward a laptop computer.

51
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,828
And then there is sync settings,

52
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:34,057
which I said before provide a way for you to synchronize with network

53
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:42,000
files that are configured for offline access and it looks like Sync Center is in fact part of the classic Control Panel.
