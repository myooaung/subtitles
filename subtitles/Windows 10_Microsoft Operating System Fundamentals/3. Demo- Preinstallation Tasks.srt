1
00:00:02,288 --> 00:00:03,126
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:03,126 --> 00:00:06,869
we're going to lay the groundwork for doing a Windows 10 installation.

3
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:11,387
Now I mentioned in the slide portion that one of your buying

4
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:14,491
decisions is going to be which edition, that's certainly true.

5
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:18,404
Editions come mostly in 64-bit versions because the vast

6
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:22,333
majority of any computer nowadays is going to have a

7
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,627
64-bit and not a 32-bit processor.

8
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:26,490
As far as knowing those system requirements,

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,860
let's open up an instance of edge and I'm going to do a search for Windows 10

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,805
system requirements and we've got right at the top here,

11
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:37,409
Windows 10 system requirements.

12
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:41,393
I'm not going to read these, but it's important for you to be aware of this.

13
00:00:41,393 --> 00:00:42,570
If, for instance,

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,290
you're considering doing a fresh installation on an existing

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,477
computer or certainly in an upgrade situation,

16
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:53,519
how do you know, for instance, if you're running a Windows 10 machine,

17
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:57,258
how can you verify what its current hardware profile

18
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,866
and hardware configuration is.

19
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:01,250
That's a good question, isn't it?

20
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,407
Well there is some ways to answer that.

21
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:04,614
This is going to come to the floor in the next module,

22
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:07,003
but I might as well show it to you now.

23
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:10,954
Msinfo32 is also called the System Information app.

24
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:13,745
I actually have it running down here on my taskbar.

25
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:17,300
This is a great way to determine the metadata on a running

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,055
system and it's been in Windows for many years.

27
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:22,527
This is not a Windows 10 specific thing.

28
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:27,184
The System Summary just gives you right out of the box the OS Name,

29
00:01:27,184 --> 00:01:28,725
edition, version, and build.

30
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:31,741
It also gives you your processor, your memory,

31
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:32,445
your storage,

32
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:36,829
but you can dip into the hardware resources to a pretty darn

33
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:40,735
granular degree just by clicking through the list and you can

34
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:42,542
export this data from the File menu,

35
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:45,572
you can bring it out all into a standard text file.

36
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:45,862
Again,

37
00:01:45,862 --> 00:01:48,812
that can be useful when you're working with customer

38
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:52,577
equipment and you're planning a fresh reinstallation or an

39
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:55,262
upgrade installation of say Windows 10.

40
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:58,110
There are third-party tools, CPUZ is one,

41
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,829
Periform Speccy is another, that's what you're looking at right now.

42
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,518
I have links to these in the exercise files.

43
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:08,091
Speccy is cool because it gives you the metadata in a well I think

44
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:12,164
a pretty appealing way graphically and it can give you information

45
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:16,485
that you can't get from the msinfo32 like the temperature that your

46
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:19,015
motherboard is running at, your CPU temperature,

47
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,461
that kind of stuff.

48
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,915
Detailed info, it's good stuff.

49
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:26,502
Now to set up our next demo where we actually perform a clean installation.

50
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:32,103
What I recommend you do is to do a search for the Windows Evaluation center,

51
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:33,878
we'll go there right now.

52
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:38,812
This is where you can download fully functional trial version software.

53
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:44,364
Let me scroll down to the bottom and you can do this for anything in the family,

54
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:48,034
that is not just Windows client or Windows Server,

55
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,220
but the System Center tools I mentioned before,

56
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,040
it's all there.

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,379
I'm going to go to Windows Client and Windows 10 Enterprise sounds like a

58
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,709
really good edition to trial because it has all the features.

59
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:00,940
The evaluation terms here,

60
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,752
it looks like it's 90 days and we have to register in order to download it.

61
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:11,305
So you fill in your contact information and it will normally come down as a.

62
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:14,637
iso DVD image file and that's going to bring up questions like

63
00:03:14,637 --> 00:03:17,581
well what the heck do you do with an ISO file.

64
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:20,673
I mentioned that there is the Media Creation tool,

65
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:23,680
Windows 10 media creation tool, there we go,

66
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,311
I'll select it from the list here.

67
00:03:26,311 --> 00:03:29,811
And this tool allows you to, for instance,

68
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:33,553
create installation media on say a USB flash drive

69
00:03:33,553 --> 00:03:35,983
from that ISO that you've downloaded.

70
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,461
Now I'm not going to step through all of that in this demo

71
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:41,649
because it gets too far out of scope, but once again,

72
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,615
check the exercise files for some links,

73
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:45,294
that's how you're going to solve that.

74
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:47,134
Now specifically in the next demo,

75
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to use that ISO file itself by attaching it to a new VM, a new virtual machine.
