1
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:03,830
Configuring Windows features.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,471
The historical perspective here is that Microsoft

3
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:09,112
goes back a long way in Windows.

4
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:11,179
This is a screenshot from Windows 3.

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:15,756
1 that shows you how you can add or subtract optional features.

6
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:19,029
These are built-in programs, in many cases,

7
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:21,852
many programs, and back in those days actually,

8
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:23,607
back in Windows 3.

9
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:30,077
1 space may indeed have been a factor that would lead you to dump,

10
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:32,160
say games, wallpapers, screensavers.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,701
Maybe you didn't have enough RAM or CPU power to do it,

12
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:39,017
and disk space was certainly at a premium back then,

13
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:40,407
so even Windows 3.

14
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,796
1 had this capability.

15
00:00:41,796 --> 00:00:43,882
We still have it today in 2018.

16
00:00:43,882 --> 00:00:48,382
I submit that now the reason why you would want to adjust which default or

17
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:52,537
built-in programs you have installed in your Windows 10 deals with

18
00:00:52,537 --> 00:00:56,225
performance and security rather than disk space.

19
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:59,209
This is the Graphical User Interface in Windows 10.

20
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:00,634
It's the Windows Features dialog.

21
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:05,215
Notice that it gives you a graphical view that looks much like File

22
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:08,307
Explorer where you can expand and contract components.

23
00:01:08,307 --> 00:01:12,669
For instance, look about 1/3 of the way down the screen, Hyper-V.

24
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:17,183
Client-side Hyper-V you can click to select the root node that'll select

25
00:01:17,183 --> 00:01:20,636
all subcomponents or you can expand and be selective.

26
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:24,334
Hyper-V, for instance, includes both the actual client-side engine,

27
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,688
as well as the management tools.

28
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:29,803
If you don't want the GUI tool you don't have to install it.

29
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:31,134
This is a good thing.

30
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,614
From a security perspective it's called reducing the

31
00:01:33,614 --> 00:01:35,820
attack surface of your system.

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,904
Here's the idea.

33
00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:41,269
If a built-in Windows component has a software bug or a vulnerability in

34
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:45,144
it that can be exploited there's no way that your system will be

35
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:47,883
vulnerable if you don't have that feature enabled.

36
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:49,467
You see what I mean?

37
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:52,002
So this speaks to what's called least service.

38
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:56,376
If you don't need an application or service on your machine uninstall it.

39
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:58,817
If you change your mind later you can always come back,

40
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:01,455
circle back and reinstall, but once again,

41
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,512
by not installing components you don't need you're giving

42
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:06,757
your system potentially a performance boost,

43
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:12,996
as well as importantly reducing the attack surface area of that machine.

44
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:13,695
Windows Features.

45
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:17,193
You can manipulate these at the command line as well.

46
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:20,580
Command line I want you to always think in terms of larger environments,

47
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,415
and when I say larger I'm not necessarily talking

48
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:24,997
fleets of thousands of computers.

49
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:29,542
You may be a tech who does maybe four or five systems a day.

50
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:34,074
Even there when you're doing the same repetitive action over and over again,

51
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:35,847
that's a candidate for automation,

52
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:38,701
so I want you to keep that in mind as we're going on.

53
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,390
We have the DISM tools.

54
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,416
DISM is a command line tool.

55
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:46,150
DISM stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management,

56
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,236
and it ships with Windows by default.

57
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:51,238
It allows you to do both online and offline servicing.

58
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,985
Now what the heck does that mean Tim, right?

59
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:55,609
This is not a deployment course.

60
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,174
Keep having to remind myself over and over again.

61
00:02:58,174 --> 00:03:00,994
You can, even on a standalone Windows 10 machine,

62
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:05,580
use DISM to view, install, and uninstall optional features,

63
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,856
but it becomes powerful in an Enterprise context because you can

64
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:12,174
run a DISM script against n number of machines.

65
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:15,775
Online means that you're actually operating on a Windows 10

66
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:17,822
box that's powered up and functional.

67
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,663
Offline means that you're working on, in the case of a virtual machine,

68
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:26,807
you'd be working on the virtual hard disk of that system while it's powered off.

69
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,946
PowerShell is an automation engine, command line only,

70
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:33,898
although you can build GUI front ends, as we saw in the previous module.

71
00:03:33,898 --> 00:03:37,829
You can get GUI front ends for DISM, as well as many PowerShell functions.

72
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:41,500
PowerShell has three cmdlets that are relevant here.

73
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,289
Get, Enable, and Disable are the verbs, WindowsOptionalFeature is the noun.

74
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not going to say anything more about this now because I'm going to do a demonstration on it momentarily.
