00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:05.670
In this demo, I want to go further yet with networking in Windows 10.

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.137
I'm logged onto this machine as a domain user.

3
00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:12.649
Let me expand my Start menu and we can see trainer.

4
00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.925
Just for grins, I'll go to Change account settings,

5
00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:16.661
and we can see I'm COMPANY\trainer.

6
00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:19.957
This is the name of the domain.

7
00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:21.950
The name of the account is trainer.

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.294
And actually I want to verify that this computer account

9
00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:27.338
actually exists in Active Directory,

10
00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:31.017
and it gives me a great excuse to make sure I cover the RSAT tools,

11
00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:32.951
because I've mentioned them in the past.

12
00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:35.999
If you do a search on Google or Bing, whatever,

13
00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.974
for remote server administration tools for Windows 10,

14
00:00:38.974 --> 00:00:40.307
you can download that package,

15
00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:44.973
and this allows you to connect to Windows Server machines from your workstation.

16
00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:46.061
As a daily practice,

17
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:49.346
you want to get into the habit of administering your Active

18
00:00:49.346 --> 00:00:51.437
Directory domain from your workstation.

19
00:00:51.437 --> 00:00:56.650
You shouldn't have to necessarily RDP or remote desktop out to each server.

20
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.158
In previous versions of Windows,

21
00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:01.740
when you install the RSAT tools you then have to go into

22
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.504
Programs and Features and enable that,

23
00:01:03.504 --> 00:01:06.312
but that doesn't happen in Windows 10 anymore.

24
00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:10.055
Notice as soon as I start to type Active Directory I get links to

25
00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:12.996
the apps that you normally see in Windows Server.

26
00:01:12.996 --> 00:01:17.888
Active Directory Users and Computers is the console used to manage,

27
00:01:17.888 --> 00:01:20.534
well, Active Directory users and computers.

28
00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:23.653
I'll have to authenticate with a domain administrator account,

29
00:01:23.653 --> 00:01:26.301
but once I've done so I can now browse into the domain,

30
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:30.834
and if I go into Computers I see DEVBOX and DEVBOX1.

31
00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:34.419
DEVBOX1 is this machine here, I actually changed the name,

32
00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:38.084
and it gives you a whole bunch of possibilities here,

33
00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:40.150
BitLocker Recovery, that's kind of cool.

34
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.816
Member of,

35
00:01:40.816 --> 00:01:44.699
by default computers belong to the Domain Computers group in Active Directory,

36
00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:47.691
and therefore you can target Group Policy to computers

37
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:50.469
in the same way that you can users.

38
00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.667
Speaking of which, if we go to Users, here we have my trainer account,

39
00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:56.933
and that account is Member of, Administrators,

40
00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:01.134
so it's a domain administrator account, and whoops,

41
00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:02.885
Enterprise Admins, yikes.

42
00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:07.820
Enterprise Admins is the most powerful group of all in Windows Server.

43
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.937
I'm going to remove that association,

44
00:02:09.937 --> 00:02:17.000
because that's giving this account way too much privilege. Least privilege is what we're going at, right?
