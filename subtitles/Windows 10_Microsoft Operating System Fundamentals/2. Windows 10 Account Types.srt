1
00:00:00,879 --> 00:00:05,288
We have count them, four different account types supported in Windows 10.

2
00:00:05,288 --> 00:00:06,943
First we have the local account.

3
00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:10,141
That screenshot I just showed you from Windows NT showed

4
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:13,784
local accounts that were resident in the Security Accounts

5
00:00:13,784 --> 00:00:16,143
Manager database of that system.

6
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:17,978
Same thing exists in Windows 10.

7
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:21,863
These accounts are defined and usable only on the local system.

8
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:26,318
We have an important distinction between a standard user and an administrator.

9
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:30,062
An administrator would be someone who belongs to the administrators local

10
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:34,312
group and has full spectrum access to that local machine.

11
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:36,915
A standard user has a moderate amount of user rights

12
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:38,592
and privileges out of the box,

13
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:42,249
and then it's your task as a systems administrator to find the

14
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:44,931
balance of what's called least privilege security,

15
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:48,340
where your users have enough privileges to do their jobs,

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,589
but nothing more.

17
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:53,310
A Microsoft account is an online identity that doesn't

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,420
have to be a Microsoft owned email Id.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,970
It can be just about anything; Gmail, Hotmail, which is Microsoft, Yahoo.

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,432
com.

21
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:05,866
These Microsoft accounts are cool because the account

22
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,799
settings will synchronize across devices.

23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,488
The chief advantage of using a Microsoft account in our

24
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,637
consumer environment is that you can get to,

25
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:19,990
for instance, your OneDrive files seamlessly on your Windows 10 desktop.

26
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,837
If you have an iPad you can install OneDrive there and get to your files.

27
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:26,951
If you use an Xbox you can use OneDrive.

28
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:29,027
Same thing, it's a universal account.

29
00:01:29,027 --> 00:01:29,793
It's really convenient.

30
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:32,883
Now the waters get a little muddy when we get into

31
00:01:32,883 --> 00:01:35,033
business and enterprise environments.

32
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:36,458
That's what we're going to talk about next.

33
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,875
Things like Office 365,

34
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:43,416
which is Microsoft's online collaboration and productivity platform.

35
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:47,076
Office 365, to use that as an example,

36
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:50,099
uses Azure Active Directory in those accounts.

37
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,424
These Azure AD accounts are often used in business nowadays in what's

38
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:57,735
called a hybrid cloud in which on-premises identities,

39
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:01,857
ones that are defined in, say, and Active Directory domain,

40
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:04,992
are synchronized up into an Azure AD tenant,

41
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:08,487
and then the accounts that are synchronized can then

42
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:13,154
transparently access services online, like Office 365 and many,

43
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:14,191
many others.

44
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:18,414
A Standard AD account is an on-premises Active Directory Identity.

45
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:21,866
In a Microsoft network the domain is the fundamental

46
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:23,921
unit of connection and administration,

47
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:28,920
and normally in a domain environment a user will never touch any of the

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,665
local identities defined on his or her Windows system.

49
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:37,413
They will log on strictly with their domain account and go from there.

50
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:39,604
Least privilege, as I mentioned a moment ago,

51
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:42,082
is an IT security principle that, formally defined,

52
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:44,879
is a principle in which every process, user,

53
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,975
or application must be able to access only the information and

54
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:52,301
resources that are necessary for their legitimate purpose.

55
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:55,078
This is a good description here,

56
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:58,318
especially the reference to processes and applications.

57
00:02:58,318 --> 00:02:59,820
User accounts, group accounts,

58
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,797
and applications are all what are called security principles,

59
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:07,243
or security Ids, or security assets.

60
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:08,471
Those are the objects,

61
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:12,253
the principles that are granted or denied access to network resources,

62
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:16,244
and once again, least privilege is critical because if you,

63
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:17,015
for instance,

64
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:20,995
out of convenience make your ordinary domain users and business

65
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:24,124
members of the administrators group on their system,

66
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:26,727
so they see fewer permission denied errors,

67
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:28,951
that gives the user more convenience,

68
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:32,051
but it dramatically reduces the security of the system.

69
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:34,558
So the best practice guidance is for everybody,

70
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:37,822
and I'm not talking just Joe and Jane end user,

71
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:40,954
but even you as a systems administrator should log on

72
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,445
to your system with a standard, local, or domain identity,

73
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:49,477
and then use something like the run as capability that I'll show you in a demo

74
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:53,854
to elevate your privileges when you feel that's necessary.

75
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:55,223
As I said,

76
00:03:55,223 --> 00:04:00,311
that question of privilege splits between the administrator or the super user,

77
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,188
as it's sometimes called, and the standard user.

78
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:06,736
In Windows 10 in the local accounts database members of the

79
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:09,893
built-in Users group are considered standard users.

80
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:11,908
There's no guest account in Windows 10.

81
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:14,857
Microsoft found that most customers never used the account,

82
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:17,372
so it just presents a security hazard.

83
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:20,961
Administrative actions are going to require UAC elevation.

84
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,457
That means that the user's going to either have to ask an

85
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:27,273
administrator to put in their credentials or through scripting

86
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:29,587
automation it's done automatically over the network,

87
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:33,070
but you do have to authenticate as an honest to

88
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,232
goodness administrator to do that task.

89
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:39,197
As I already said, the best practice is to run everybody as standard user,

90
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:42,252
and then elevate only when necessary.

91
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,872
An administrator has complete control over the computer.

92
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:48,453
There's a built-in Administrator Identity on Windows systems,

93
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:50,794
as well as an administrators group.

94
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:55,777
That is to say, any account that's placed in that administrators group becomes,

95
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:59,278
by inheritance, and administrator of that local system.

96
00:04:59,278 --> 00:05:01,286
As far as the built-in Administrator account,

97
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:05,856
the best practice is to rename it to something non-intuitive like Joe

98
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:08,514
Shmoe because Administrator is a known quantity,

99
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:12,732
and any attacker is first going to try to breach a system by

100
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:14,481
attempting that as the username thinking,

101
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,415
well, I know that account exists.

102
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:20,790
If it's been renamed, then you've made the attackers work harder to do.

103
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,118
Certainly,

104
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:24,850
you haven't stopped them because there's other reasons why it's pretty

105
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,349
trivial to find out which is the administrator identity,

106
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:30,957
but renaming it is certainly better than nothing.

107
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:34,657
Perhaps better is to disable it, and enable it only when you need it.

108
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:38,867
Administrative actions as an administrator require User Account Control

109
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:42,679
consent instead of actually having to put in credentials.

110
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:49,000
Now that's default behavior. We'll talk more about UAC momentarily.
