00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:04.636
Now let's turn our attention to Encrypting File System, or EFS.

2
00:00:04.636 --> 00:00:08.461
Now EFS is fundamentally different from BitLocker.

3
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:12.964
BitLocker is used if you need volume-level encryption,

4
00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:15.514
whole-disk encryption, in other words.

5
00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:18.573
EFS is file, or resource-level encryption.

6
00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:20.612
So the use case here is,

7
00:00:20.612 --> 00:00:23.965
on your workstation you may interact with very sensitive

8
00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:26.887
documents that contain very proprietary information,

9
00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:27.438
let's say,

10
00:00:27.438 --> 00:00:30.469
and you want to make sure that if someone who shouldn't

11
00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:35.209
get access to the files somehow does, and they try to email them off-campus,

12
00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:39.655
that whoever receives the files ultimately is unable to open them.

13
00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:43.617
Now it is true that in business we have what's called DLP,

14
00:00:43.617 --> 00:00:44.938
or data loss protection.

15
00:00:44.938 --> 00:00:47.849
You might have heard of Active Directory Rights Management Services.

16
00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:51.242
There's other ways to protect proprietary file data.

17
00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:53.341
EFS has been around for a long time,

18
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:56.097
and it uses a strong encryption protocol to boot.

19
00:00:56.097 --> 00:01:01.639
It does require that your volumes protected by EFS are on an NTFS file

20
00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:05.234
system because EFS is a fundamental feature of NTFS.

21
00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:06.883
It relies upon digital certificates.

22
00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:11.418
And oh, boy, digital certificates is another discussion unto itself.

23
00:01:11.418 --> 00:01:12.557
Wait for the demo,

24
00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:15.973
and I'll speak a little bit more about the digital certificate issue.

25
00:01:15.973 --> 00:01:20.752
Related to that is the question of the DRA, or the data recovery agent.

26
00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:25.021
If you're using EFS in business, what happens if the user leaves the company,

27
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:27.648
and his or her user account is deleted,

28
00:01:27.648 --> 00:01:29.896
and their workstation is wiped and reloaded?

29
00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:30.211
Well,

30
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:33.283
if you're not carefully preserving the user's own digital

31
00:01:33.283 --> 00:01:36.702
certificates that they use to encrypt their EFS files,

32
00:01:36.702 --> 00:01:41.317
they can, and they have been, I've known people who have been burned this way,

33
00:01:41.317 --> 00:01:45.255
are never able to successfully unlock those files again.

34
00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:46.619
It's really strong encryption.

35
00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.666
So in an Active Directory environment,

36
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:51.503
you absolutely want to make sure you have

37
00:01:51.503 --> 00:01:53.756
administrators configured with DRA certificates,

38
00:01:53.756 --> 00:01:57.358
and they can unlock any EFS-encrypted file.

39
00:01:57.358 --> 00:02:00.087
And that's super-useful for recovery purposes.

40
00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:01.979
This is best implemented in the enterprise.

41
00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.953
Even small office/home office businesses generally,

42
00:02:04.953 --> 00:02:07.605
unless they're doing like government contract stuff,

43
00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:11.369
would have need for EFS, but it is related to security,

44
00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:20.000
and it is related to data encryption, and it is built right into Windows 10, so I want to make sure you understand a bit about it.
