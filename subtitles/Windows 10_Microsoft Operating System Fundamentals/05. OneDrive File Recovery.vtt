00:00:00.274 --> 00:00:05.981
speaking of which, let's cover OneDrive recovery next.

2
00:00:05.981 --> 00:00:10.623
As you know, OneDrive is Microsoft's file synchronization platform.

3
00:00:10.623 --> 00:00:14.383
You have One Drive Personal for consumer users and OneDrive for

4
00:00:14.383 --> 00:00:18.800
Business that relies upon Office 365 SharePoint Online,

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.325
but they both have the same basic method of operation.

6
00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:24.535
You install the application on all your devices,

7
00:00:24.535 --> 00:00:28.516
and your documents and their versions are synced across all those devices.

8
00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:32.183
To do file recovery, this is going to require you to hit the web client,

9
00:00:32.183 --> 00:00:34.728
the web portal as you see in this diagram.

10
00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:37.308
Not only that, you'll want to look at the Recycle bin,

11
00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:39.222
which is what I'm pointing out right here.

12
00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:43.390
When you delete a file in OneDrive it goes to your Recycle bin first.

13
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.439
You also have Version history capability with OneDrive files,

14
00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:50.446
so as a file evolves over time you can review the Version

15
00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:53.075
history and then bring back previous versions.

16
00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:54.680
To repeat this one more time,

17
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.573
you get the most flexibility with this when you're in

18
00:00:57.573 --> 00:01:00.635
the web interface and not on a mobile, client,

19
00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:04.510
or even in the Windows 10 desktop application experience.

20
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.865
Now,

21
00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:08.765
understand that the notion of the Recycle bin in OneDrive is

22
00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:12.142
subject to retention policy and not backup.

23
00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:15.260
You have a window of time between 30 and 90 days,

24
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.641
depending upon which version of OneDrive you're using,

25
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:20.072
and OneDrive for Business, as you might expect,

26
00:01:20.072 --> 00:01:23.580
has some additional layers of retention that an administrator can set.

27
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.771
But, once again, there's no backup.

28
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:28.683
If you put a file in the Recycle bin,

29
00:01:28.683 --> 00:01:32.676
after the 30 days or whatever your current retention period is elapses,

30
00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:36.219
that file may not be subject to recovery at all.

31
00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.338
So this, again,

32
00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:40.572
underscores the point that you need to have some

33
00:01:40.572 --> 00:01:42.625
kind of backup solution in place.

34
00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:47.017
Now, what we just looked at with File Recovery kind of answers that question,

35
00:01:47.017 --> 00:01:51.410
because File Recovery will monitor and backup One Drive contents,

36
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.847
so it's nice to have that layer of protection.

37
00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:57.930
The common theme that I just want to put through this entire module,

38
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.815
besides A,

39
00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:01.914
the critical importance of having backup solution

40
00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:05.013
in place and not overlooking it, is B,

41
00:02:05.013 --> 00:02:08.959
I want you to recognize just how critical file data is.

42
00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.626
If worse comes to worse, you can reinstall your operating system,

43
00:02:12.626 --> 00:02:16.157
if worse comes to worse you can uninstall and reinstall applications,

44
00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:21.769
those are fine, but your data, the files that you create and work on,

45
00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.228
are truly potentially unrecoverable losses,

46
00:02:24.228 --> 00:02:31.000
so the data is, I mean, it's precious, let's put it that way, at least it is to me.
