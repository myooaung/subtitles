1
00:00:01,617 --> 00:00:04,684
Cortana.

2
00:00:04,684 --> 00:00:08,585
The historical perspective with Cortana doesn't go as far back as

3
00:00:08,585 --> 00:00:11,909
many of my other historical perspective slides have.

4
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:13,836
Here, you see virtual digital assistants,

5
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:17,351
Google Home on the right, Amazon Echo in the middle,

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:22,624
and iPhone on the left, and each vendor has their own digital assistant.

7
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:26,956
Apple has Siri, Amazon has Alexa, and Google has the Google Assistant,

8
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:29,772
and the idea with these is that they're supposed to make

9
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:32,607
your life easier because you can use natural language to

10
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:34,378
give these devices instructions.

11
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:35,549
Will it rain tomorrow?

12
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:37,890
What is my drive time look like today?

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,942
What is the time in Los Angeles, California or Shanghai?

14
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:42,975
You see what I mean?

15
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:45,356
Now the tradeoff with all of these virtual digital assistants is

16
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:48,360
that you're giving up a little bit of privacy because you're

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,638
sharing some of your habits with the vendor.

18
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:55,328
This speaks to a larger point of cloud computing where in

19
00:00:55,328 --> 00:00:59,501
order to get this really nice personalized experience from

20
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:04,414
these digital assistants, you wind up needing to trust that Microsoft,

21
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:09,081
Google, Amazon will handle your personal data responsibly.

22
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:11,453
Now how does this fit into Windows l0?

23
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:13,877
Well Microsoft has its own virtual assistant,

24
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:16,698
it is named Cortana, code-named Cortana.

25
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:18,177
Now it's officially called Cortana.

26
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:22,899
If you play the Halo video games, Cortana was a character from that echo system.

27
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:26,646
Microsoft, from what I understand, had a different name in mind for Cortana,

28
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:30,175
but so many users loved the code name that it became

29
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:31,853
the formal name for this product.

30
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:32,938
Now at the right,

31
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:36,790
you see a screenshot of a Windows 10 Start menu and you know that you

32
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,834
can press the Start button on your keyboard or click the Start icon and

33
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,558
just start to type to get search results.

34
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:46,990
That's using the Windows search and indexing service, that's fine.

35
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,277
Now you can put your searches on a much higher plane by integrating with

36
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,931
this Cortana virtual assistant that ships with Windows 10.

37
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:59,525
Now up until Fall 2017 when Microsoft released the Fall creators update,

38
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:03,421
you were unable to get rid of or disable Cortana fully.

39
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:07,292
If you do want to do that for privacy reasons or performance reasons,

40
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:09,430
I'll actually show you how to do that in a demo,

41
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,662
but if you are willing to let Microsoft know some of your web browsing habits,

42
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:17,115
potentially your contacts, calendar details,

43
00:02:17,115 --> 00:02:19,077
seems like a lot.

44
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:21,236
So again, I just can't stress that enough,

45
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:23,742
this does require a fundamental element of trust.

46
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:25,525
You need to trust Microsoft.

47
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:27,825
If you choose to accept those terms,

48
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:31,812
what you get in return is the ability for Cortana to

49
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:35,111
give you all sorts of well assistance, directions,

50
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:39,951
you can set reminders, and you don't have to do this with a keyboard,

51
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,929
you can actually use your voice.

52
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:45,485
Cortana can be trained to respond to your voice as well,

53
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:48,097
and what's kind of novel, I think, about Cortana,

54
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:52,041
Microsoft from what I understand actually used real physical

55
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:56,603
personal assistants as the model for Cortana and they found by

56
00:02:56,603 --> 00:02:59,612
working with real live personal assistants that these assistants

57
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:03,084
pretty much run their lives through notebooks to keep track of

58
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:04,735
everything they need to remember.

59
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:06,373
And the way you configure Cortana,

60
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:10,688
the way you can retrieve what she knows so to speak or supply her

61
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:17,000
with additional intelligence is through the metaphor of the notebook and that's what I'm highlighting here.
