1
00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:04,945
Ah, this is quite a marathon journey, isn't it?

2
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:10,312
Our last subject is Recovery Drive, a brand-new feature in Windows 10.

3
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:12,776
Here's what the Recovery Drive does.

4
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:15,502
Let's discuss the workflow, and it'll become apparent.

5
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:19,490
You're going to point the Recovery Drive creation tool to a USB disk.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,283
This could be a USB thumb drive or an external drive.

7
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:25,573
You're going to build the Recovery Drive,

8
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:29,232
which is kind of sort of like a system image backup,

9
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:30,230
but not exactly.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,409
A system image backup is an exact duplication of your entire

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,191
Windows environment as of that point in time.

12
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:41,621
The Recovery Drive allows you to snapshot the core operating system,

13
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:45,572
as well as its updated drivers and Windows update files,

14
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:46,809
you see the difference?

15
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:49,758
This allows you to, in a troubleshooting scenario,

16
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,934
to recover your system minus programs and files.

17
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:55,831
It will give you the activation state,

18
00:00:55,831 --> 00:01:00,236
that is the Recovery Drive will keep the Windows activation

19
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:03,854
so that you don't have to do anything special after

20
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:05,565
recovering from a Recovery Drive.

21
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,701
Drivers and Windows update are included.

22
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:11,995
So long story short, Recovery Drive is not going to bring back any of your data,

23
00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:14,407
so please don't look at it in that context.

24
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,534
As a matter of fact,

25
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,581
you could really have a bad time if you do a Recovery Drive

26
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:21,718
restore and expect that it's going to bring back your data

27
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:23,464
like a system image backup will.

28
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:25,865
No, it's not going to, and for that matter,

29
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:29,175
your system image backup is only going to bring back all your document

30
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:32,125
files as they existed at the date of that backup.

31
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,514
You see these complexities?

32
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:37,491
Recovery Drive is where you want to effectively refresh your system,

33
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:42,808
but put yourself ahead of the game in terms of not having to go back to

34
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:47,202
Windows Update and re-download a whole bunch of updates and go through

35
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:51,802
the driver acquisition process if you have vendor-specific drivers that

36
00:01:51,802 --> 00:01:54,288
you've gotten from their websites.

37
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:58,098
So summing up, we looked at a lot of different backup products.

38
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:01,330
Let's put them all in context to make things really clear.

39
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,167
First we looked at System Restore,

40
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:06,853
which is for troubleshooting a failed installation of a

41
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:09,549
device driver application registry change,

42
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:11,108
not an entire system.

43
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:15,524
File History allows you to "sanity check" recovery of individual files,

44
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:18,687
predominantly your OneDrive files and your profile files.

45
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:21,845
They get automatically backed up to an external disk,

46
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:24,081
and you can bring them back from the dead,

47
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:29,028
so to speak, if one becomes corrupted or missing in your live installation.

48
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:33,099
OneDrive is a cloud storage solution that gives you high availability,

49
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,778
but not necessarily high recoverability,

50
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:38,544
so don't ever forget about backing up OneDrive.

51
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:42,669
And then both Recovery Drive and Windows Backups are mechanisms to bring

52
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:46,550
back the operating system in more of a bare-metal way,

53
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,831
with Recovery Drive giving you just the operating system,

54
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:52,183
activation status, updates and drivers,

55
00:02:52,183 --> 00:03:03,000
Windows Backup being able to come back with individual files and folders, or an entire system image from a previous point in time.
