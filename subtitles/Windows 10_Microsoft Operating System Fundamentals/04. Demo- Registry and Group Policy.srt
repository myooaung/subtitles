1
00:00:01,572 --> 00:00:06,153
Now I mentioned that these settings and Control Panel items modify the Registry.

2
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:07,631
How do we open the Registry?

3
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:11,360
Well I would suggest that you right-click the Start button,

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,299
go to Run, and type regedit, R-E-G-E-D-I-T.

5
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,925
Now you have to be an administrator to run this tool.

6
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:20,279
If you're logged on with standard user permissions,

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,886
then you'll be prompted to supply an administrative username and password.

8
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:27,890
If you're already logged on that machine as a local administrator,

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,698
then you're prompted for consent, which you see here,

10
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,469
and I'm going to grant that consent.

11
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:34,625
Here is the Registry editor, as I mentioned before.

12
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:39,182
There is a lot we could do here and there is a lot of important Registry keys.

13
00:00:39,182 --> 00:00:43,502
One that I've used so much when working with customers over the

14
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,267
years are the autostart keys because malware,

15
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:47,320
malicious software,

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,206
normally will create values in your autostart paths

17
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:53,395
such that as you would expect,

18
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:57,324
the malware will autostart every time the system is rebooted.

19
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,156
Now there is four different paths.

20
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:00,978
Check the exercise files for details,

21
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,225
but the main one I'll go to is under the machine

22
00:01:04,225 --> 00:01:06,448
configuration HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, Software,

23
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:10,305
Microsoft, Windows, scroll down,

24
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:12,573
I have quite a bit of software installed on this system

25
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,693
and there is a lot of Windows options,

26
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:17,292
I just want plain old garden variety Windows,

27
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:20,771
current version, and then scroll down again,

28
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:21,268
Run.

29
00:01:21,268 --> 00:01:25,321
Now this is a pretty clean virtual machine so there is really not too much here.

30
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:26,625
It is a virtual machine,

31
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,446
so you'll notice I have a setting called VMware User

32
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:32,018
process and if I double left-click that,

33
00:01:32,018 --> 00:01:35,406
it's a string value and basically this means that

34
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:37,692
every time I start the computer,

35
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:40,914
VMware will start this little agent program that you see

36
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:43,123
running down in my notification area.

37
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:43,514
Specifically,

38
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:49,346
this Windows 10 box is running as a virtual machine under VMware workstation.

39
00:01:49,346 --> 00:01:52,318
I'm just trying to get you to the point here of understanding

40
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:54,436
the basics of working with the Registry.

41
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:54,747
Remember,

42
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:58,235
I mentioned that there is no undo functionality so this means

43
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:00,741
that when you're doing surgery on the Registry,

44
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:03,194
it's important for you to take a backup.

45
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:08,050
Now you can backup the entire Registry or you can just backup a part of it.

46
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,890
Now what you back up depends upon where you are in the hierarchy.

47
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,587
If I just want to backup the contents of the Run key,

48
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:18,407
I can right-click and select Export from the shortcut menu.

49
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:23,273
I'm going to browse to my desktop and I'm going to save this as RunKey.

50
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:25,732
Now notice that it's saved as a.

51
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:26,435
reg file,

52
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:29,855
that's important to know because you want to be careful when you're browsing

53
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:33,510
the web and downloading a reg file and just opening it up.

54
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,775
That could have potentially disastrous consequences.

55
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:40,735
Now here is a trivia question or a learning question from the previous module.

56
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:43,145
You'll notice that I don't see the.

57
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:46,583
reg on this RunKey, how can we force it to display.

58
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,611
What do you think?

59
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:51,495
Well it's going to involve the Settings/Control Panel system isn't it,

60
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:55,005
and specifically what I showed you in the previous module is

61
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:57,088
that you can open a File Explorer window,

62
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:59,535
go to the View tab, and under Options,

63
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:02,332
you can do a change folder and search options,

64
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:05,186
and in there, you can come over to View,

65
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:10,396
scroll down a bit and uncheck Hide extensions for known file types.

66
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:14,688
I'll apply that change and we can see that it's taken place immediately.

67
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:16,333
Click OK to dismiss folder options.

68
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,901
Now I mentioned that's the way I showed you in the previous module.

69
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:24,318
One of my goals is, remember, to show you how to be a Windows 10 power user.

70
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,155
You can also press the Windows key and just type your search,

71
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:30,743
folder options, for instance, and look what it does.

72
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:34,244
It actually attempts or asks us if we want to open the

73
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:35,999
File Explorer Options Control Panel.

74
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:40,120
This one happens to use the classic interface as you can see,

75
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,186
but it's the same set of options, and if we scroll down,

76
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:46,498
we can see hide extensions for known file types is

77
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:48,138
still deselected as we expected.

78
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:50,757
Now to look at the contents of this,

79
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:53,875
let's say actually let's come back to the Registry and let's say we're

80
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,968
living dangerously and we don't want this to autostart.

81
00:03:56,968 --> 00:04:00,154
Now note that many times you don't have to come down to the

82
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:02,376
level of the Registry to remove something.

83
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:02,723
Oftentimes,

84
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:06,652
you can do it through Control Panel or through the application itself,

85
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:10,063
but let's just say you were reading a support article and

86
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:12,218
it instructs you to delete this value.

87
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,487
I'm going to right-click and delete it.

88
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,197
We do see a scary-looking confirmed value delete dialog that says

89
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:20,434
that this action can cause system instability.

90
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,684
Are you sure you want to do it?

91
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:25,013
I'm going to click Yes and there is no undo.

92
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:28,247
Sometimes Registry changes go into effect immediately.

93
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,193
Other times, you'll have to log off and log back on,

94
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:34,386
and other ones, specifically, ones that effect the entire system,

95
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:36,734
you have to restart to see that change.

96
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,809
Now if we decided that we did in fact need that value,

97
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:42,808
remember, we took a backup of the RunKey.

98
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:44,027
Check this out.

99
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:49,539
Right-click, come down to Open with and you can force this guy to open,

100
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,434
not with Registry editor, but with another app.

101
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:54,602
I'm going to choose a plain text editor.

102
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:57,970
Notepad has been in Windows for many years, I think that's fine.

103
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,427
We'll click OK, and although it kind of looks like gobbledygook,

104
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,057
specifically, we see a bunch of hexadecimal values.

105
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:05,852
I'm going to go to Format,

106
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:10,004
Font and boost the font a little bit to make it easier for you to see.

107
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:14,122
It shows you the path that you backed up and then the values and the

108
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:17,725
value data of every value that's in that backup.

109
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:21,399
Now if you back up the entire Registry, that's going to be big reg file.

110
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:21,658
Here,

111
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:26,361
I just backed up those two values and this is actually the one that we deleted,

112
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:28,135
this VMware user process.

113
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:31,731
To merge this back into the registry, we can double left-click it.

114
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,270
You do have to be an administrator to do a registry

115
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,034
merge as I think is a good idea.

116
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:38,347
And it says, are you sure you want to do this.

117
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:39,602
I'm going to click Yes,

118
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:43,073
and it tells us that the keys and values contained in this file

119
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:45,194
have been successfully added to the Registry.

120
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:48,092
Let's come back to the Registry editor and there is that

121
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:50,071
value that we deleted a moment ago.

122
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:50,368
Finally,

123
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:54,421
I'm going to very quickly show you Group Policy just in case you were

124
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,084
interested and where to find that in Windows 10.

125
00:05:57,084 --> 00:06:00,321
We can right-click the Start and go to Run again,

126
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:02,634
and this time, we type gpedit,

127
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:08,317
that stands for Group Policy editor,. msc and the msc file type

128
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:11,606
denotes that this is a Microsoft Management Console,

129
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:12,806
or MMC file.

130
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:17,041
We'll see more about MMC consoles a bit later in this course.

131
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,567
Just like we saw in the Registry, there is the computer,

132
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:25,036
the HKey local machine, and then the users HKey users and HKey current user.

133
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:28,311
Current user is whoever is currently logged onto the machine.

134
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:31,493
The Registry settings that you can control in Group Policy

135
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:34,030
editor are similarly split along those axes,

136
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,791
and note,

137
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:39,534
it doesn't take too much clicking for you to begin to appreciate just

138
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:42,921
how much power you have over a system in Group Policy.

139
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:46,017
So there is plenty of training in the Pluralsight library if

140
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:53,000
you're interested in learning more about it, but I think that we'll call this demo done for now.
