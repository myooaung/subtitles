1
00:00:01,413 --> 00:00:01,677
Okay,

2
00:00:01,677 --> 00:00:05,792
I wanted to show you a little bit more about Edge protection with SmartScreen.

3
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:10,522
This is a pretty cool demonstration site that Microsoft developed.

4
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:14,160
The URL is https:/demo.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,069
smartscreen.

6
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:15,979
msft.

7
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:16,888
net.

8
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:19,440
I have that in the exercise files too,

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,040
but these are demo pages that do not actually contain malicious calls.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,917
You're not putting your computer at risk,

11
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:28,726
but it's nice, for instance,

12
00:00:28,726 --> 00:00:33,541
if a web page might be a phishing site you'll see something like this.

13
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,782
This might not be the site you want.

14
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:36,902
Does this look correct?

15
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:40,456
You can report it as safe or report it as unsafe,

16
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:43,734
and then depending upon what kind of code the site wants to run

17
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:45,934
it looks like it's asking for Adobe Flash.

18
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:49,422
You can choose to allow that if you want to.

19
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:50,212
Isn't that cool?

20
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:52,056
Let's come back to our demo page.

21
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:55,608
Here's a page known for phishing that should be blocked.

22
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:59,255
This is what SmartScreen will show you, and you can get some more information,

23
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:03,044
and then Back to safety to go away from that site.

24
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:06,156
This is definitely something you want to train your users in.

25
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:08,339
Malware page, a page that hosts malware.

26
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:10,834
They're going to see a page like this.

27
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:12,028
Blocked Download.

28
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:17,919
If it's URL reputation matches known hijacked software SmartScreen will say,

29
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:21,338
this is unsafe to download and was blocked.

30
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:23,068
Now if you're thinking to yourself, wow,

31
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:27,269
this is super useful, but I want to be able to capture all of this information.

32
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:30,907
I don't want it to happen on my user's computers one off

33
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:32,843
because I may never know about it.

34
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,956
That's a good entrÃ©e point for you to look into the

35
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:38,693
Defender Advanced Threat Protection, ATP.

36
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:42,412
Maybe your company already has an Office 365 subscription,

37
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:46,860
which makes it even easier yet to onboard your Windows 10 clients.

38
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,688
So this goes through a number of different possibilities.

39
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:52,491
I encourage you to visit this demo.

40
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:52,892
smartscreen.

41
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:53,292
msft.

42
00:01:53,292 --> 00:01:53,693
net,

43
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:57,833
so you can get a better feel for how the SmartScreen

44
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:02,496
filter actually works in practice, and we've also talked about the store,

45
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:05,262
the Windows App Store or the Microsoft Store,

46
00:02:05,262 --> 00:02:06,724
as it's known right now.

47
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:09,112
This is where you can shop for applications.

48
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:12,131
You can even shop for Xbox applications through here,

49
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,557
which I think is pretty darn cool,

50
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:18,451
and the SmartScreen filter will track any apps that you obtain,

51
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:20,053
their calls to the internet,

52
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:27,000
if they raise any red flags in the Microsoft SmartScreen online database you'll be made aware of that.
