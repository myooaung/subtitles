00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:04,208
In summary, what we've learned in this module.

2
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:07,332
I didn't tell this until now, so let me say it right now,

3
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:10,554
that I know many people who make a great living for themselves

4
00:00:10,554 --> 00:00:12,502
doing simply disaster recovery planning.

5
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:15,795
It's enough of a job to warrant a full-time career.

6
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:19,697
And you know you're going to be loved by your clients and customers,

7
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:22,762
because you're helping them preserve their business.

8
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:26,581
It's for a very good reason that disaster recovery planning is

9
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,776
often called business continuity planning,

10
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:32,688
because a data loss can really shorten the life,

11
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:34,967
or outright kill a business flat.

12
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:38,026
Public cloud makes it easier than ever to run backups.

13
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:41,502
You can actually use the cloud, Microsoft's Azure cloud,

14
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:45,863
for instance, as a data restore center, a data recovery center,

15
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:48,687
for your entire environment, your server environment,

16
00:00:48,687 --> 00:00:50,314
if you're using servers.

17
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:52,519
If you're a consumer and you have Office 365,

18
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,801
you can use Azure as an individual or as a small business owner,

19
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:59,879
and you can backup to an Azure storage account no problem.

20
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,898
Discipline is definitely necessary.

21
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:04,475
We don't get into restore so much here,

22
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:09,358
but the notion of a good backup is only as good as its verification.

23
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:12,189
That is, is the backup legitimate, is it corrupted,

24
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:14,890
I hope not, can you actually restore it,

25
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,190
and do you perform periodic trial restores to make sure

26
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,125
that your backup scheme is functional.

27
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,889
So we have one more content module left,

28
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:24,867
and then we're going to wrap up in module 20,

29
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:27,867
the final module, looking at the MTA certification.

30
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:29,710
But in that last content module,

31
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,816
we're going to essentially bookend to what we're doing here,

32
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:38,000
we'll look at Windows 10 Troubleshooting. Thanks for your attention, I'll see you then.
