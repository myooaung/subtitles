00:00:00.358 --> 00:00:02.791
In summary, what have we learned?

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:04.818
As I just said actually,

3
00:00:04.818 --> 00:00:06.476
strong troubleshooting skills are going to carry

4
00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:09.365
you very far in the IT industry, there's no doubt.

5
00:00:09.365 --> 00:00:12.091
Avoid the tendency to just wipe and reload.

6
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:13.053
As I said,

7
00:00:13.053 --> 00:00:16.934
this sometimes happens in bigger enterprises where they don't want to

8
00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:19.569
deal with troubleshooting specific system problems,

9
00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:22.969
they'll just wipe and reload the user's hard drive to set them back

10
00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:25.968
to a pristine operating system corporate image.

11
00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:28.935
And if that's what your business has as its policy,

12
00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:32.100
that's fine, but in a smaller environment in the interest of time,

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.062
you might be better off, I mean, not just blindly going forth,

14
00:00:35.062 --> 00:00:38.248
you want to have a methodology in mind, of course,

15
00:00:38.248 --> 00:00:42.752
but knowing some of these so-called quick fix tools like System Restore and

16
00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:45.705
being able to boot into a diagnostic mode or Safe Mode,

17
00:00:45.705 --> 00:00:49.991
you may be able to solve the problem without having to do a wipe and reload.

18
00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:52.794
Well, this concludes the Windows 10 content specifically.

19
00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:55.611
We've come a long way, haven't we?

20
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:57.971
I want to congratulate you, because you,

21
00:00:57.971 --> 00:00:58.983
I'm very positive,

22
00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:03.133
have broadened and deepened your Windows 10 support skills significantly.

23
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.890
So for those of you who are interested in the certification,

24
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.316
what we're going to do in the final module is look at the Microsoft

25
00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:13.207
Technology Associator MTA certification in great detail,

26
00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:15.138
and I'm going to give you tips, tricks,

27
00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:17.616
and suggestions on how you can leverage Microsoft

28
00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:24.000
certifications to expand your career. Thanks for hanging in with me, I'll see you then.
