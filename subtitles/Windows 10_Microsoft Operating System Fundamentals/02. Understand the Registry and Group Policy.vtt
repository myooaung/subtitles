00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:04.333
Settings, Control Panel, and the Registry.

2
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.331
From a historical perspective,

3
00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:08.943
I don't know how long you've been with the Microsoft Windows operating system,

4
00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:13.448
but there was a time not too long ago where Windows settings,

5
00:00:13.448 --> 00:00:15.240
that is user settings,

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.390
computer settings were stored not in a centralized database,

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.880
but in a series of text files.

8
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.275
You're seeing in this screenshot the Sysedit tool from Windows 95.

9
00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.760
Around that time, Windows 95, Windows 98,

10
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.185
Microsoft finally started extricating itself fully

11
00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:34.818
from storing settings in those.

12
00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:36.364
ini text files.

13
00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:36.673
Basically,

14
00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:41.050
it's kind of a cumbersome way to keep track of user and computer settings.

15
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.691
Now that having been said, if you use Linux or UNIX,

16
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:47.559
those old operating systems, well UNIX is old,

17
00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.215
Linux isn't as old, they still habitually will store settings,

18
00:00:52.215 --> 00:00:54.493
application settings, user, computer settings,

19
00:00:54.493 --> 00:00:59.096
and text files, but in Windows land, we have the Registry.

20
00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:01.118
Now that having been said,

21
00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:05.717
some applications even now in 2017 will still use configuration files.

22
00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:08.370
Largely, it's up to the developer.

23
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.789
Microsoft strongly prefers us to use the Registry.

24
00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.702
Now I mentioned Registry but didn't formally define it.

25
00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:18.645
The Registry is in fact,

26
00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:22.317
a hierarchical database consists of a number of binary files,

27
00:01:22.317 --> 00:01:23.268
and by binary,

28
00:01:23.268 --> 00:01:27.989
I mean that you can't open these files in a text editor and see their contents.

29
00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:32.235
Those old ini files that I mentioned, yes, those were human editable.

30
00:01:32.235 --> 00:01:33.166
With the Registry,

31
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:37.595
you need to tap into those binary files by using the Registry editor,

32
00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:38.920
this is Regedit.

33
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.362
exe.

34
00:01:39.362 --> 00:01:43.867
Now historically, there has been a lot of fear among computer users,

35
00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:44.591
end users,

36
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:47.762
and even power users about making a mistake in the

37
00:01:47.762 --> 00:01:49.849
Registry editor and hosing up your system.

38
00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:52.122
The reason for that is that Registry editor

39
00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:55.077
historically has not had an undo capability.

40
00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:59.778
That having been said, you can, in fact, back up parts or the entire registry.

41
00:01:59.778 --> 00:02:02.443
I'll do that for you in the demo as a matter of fact.

42
00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:06.208
The bottom line is, even though we have easier ways to configure a system,

43
00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:08.234
namely Control Panel and preferences,

44
00:02:08.234 --> 00:02:14.092
sometimes you do have to go down to the level of the Registry to view data,

45
00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:14.789
modify data,

46
00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.769
sometimes even create new settings or delete

47
00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.897
settings directly from the Registry.

48
00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:21.904
As far as vocabulary is concerned,

49
00:02:21.904 --> 00:02:25.851
the top level of the hierarchy consists of a number of

50
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:28.179
handle keys or HKey virtual folders.

51
00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:30.492
The technical name for these is subtree.

52
00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:33.504
There is really only two divisions of the tree,

53
00:02:33.504 --> 00:02:37.018
there is Hkey, local machine for all computer related settings,

54
00:02:37.018 --> 00:02:40.566
settings that are irrespective of the user logged on,

55
00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:45.329
and HKey users which covers all of the user profiles on that machine.

56
00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.142
I hope that you're following these modules

57
00:02:47.142 --> 00:02:49.167
sequentially because in the previous module,

58
00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:51.641
we learned about user profiles.

59
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:55.122
Within a subtree, you have a number of what look like folders,

60
00:02:55.122 --> 00:02:58.136
but are technically called keys and subkeys.

61
00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:58.422
Remember,

62
00:02:58.422 --> 00:03:01.900
you're dealing with binary data that's stored in a number of files

63
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.244
throughout the file system of your computer.

64
00:03:04.244 --> 00:03:07.527
Ultimately, you get down to the value level.

65
00:03:07.527 --> 00:03:08.434
As you see here,

66
00:03:08.434 --> 00:03:09.568
we're looking at the path

67
00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:15.446
HKey_LocalMachineSystem\CurrentControlSet\ControlHiveList and this actual

68
00:03:15.446 --> 00:03:21.504
subkey gives you a list of values that correspond to each hive or physical registry

69
00:03:21.504 --> 00:03:22.977
file on the system.

70
00:03:22.977 --> 00:03:26.965
And it's beyond our scope to get really deep into what each

71
00:03:26.965 --> 00:03:29.339
of these files means and what it does,

72
00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:34.360
but the bottom line is your Registry values all have an associated data type,

73
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.615
some might allow you to specify 0 and 1 to denote false and true values,

74
00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:43.565
some allow you to specify string data and actually put a path

75
00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:46.477
there like you see in many of these values,

76
00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:50.049
and then the value data represents the actual

77
00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.467
content that's stored for each value.

78
00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:57.486
Now Group Policy is a term that you may or may not be familiar with.

79
00:03:57.486 --> 00:04:00.740
Group Policy provides a centralized way to control

80
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.721
Registry settings on a system.

81
00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:05.836
In an Active Directory domain, a business network,

82
00:04:05.836 --> 00:04:09.228
Group Policy is typically used to standardize the user's

83
00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:11.942
desktop environment and also quite honestly,

84
00:04:11.942 --> 00:04:17.375
to put potentially harmful controls out of the reach of the end user.

85
00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:19.348
This is the local Group Policy editor.

86
00:04:19.348 --> 00:04:22.463
Again, it's way beyond our scope to get deeper into Group Policy.

87
00:04:22.463 --> 00:04:26.787
All I want you to know at this level is that when faced with the

88
00:04:26.787 --> 00:04:30.355
issue how do I modify Registry settings for a number of

89
00:04:30.355 --> 00:04:38.000
computers instead of just one at a time, Group Policy is going to be your tool for doing that.
