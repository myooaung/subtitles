00:00:02.104 --> 00:00:05.673
Let's take a look at OneDrive in Windows 10.

2
00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:10.497
Now OneDrive is one of the great conveniences in Windows 10 because,

3
00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:14.550
for instance, if you're using a Microsoft account in Windows 10,

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.186
you're already authenticated to your associated OneDrive.

5
00:00:18.186 --> 00:00:22.233
The OneDrive client is already up and running in all likelihood,

6
00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:26.118
you'll notice if I open my notification menu it says OneDrive,

7
00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:29.813
and the little cloud icon is dimmed because I'm not signed in.

8
00:00:29.813 --> 00:00:31.722
If I right-click and go to Settings,

9
00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:33.631
let's see if there's anything worthwhile here.

10
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.950
Start OneDrive automatically when I sign in to Windows,

11
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.803
and then Add an account and choose the folders involved.

12
00:00:40.803 --> 00:00:42.910
Well first we have to add an account,

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.281
and that kicks off the Set up OneDrive wizard.

14
00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:49.104
Now the difference between OneDrive and OneDrive for Business is going to

15
00:00:49.104 --> 00:00:52.751
depend upon whether this is just a consumer Microsoft account,

16
00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:56.287
or if it's associated with an Office 365 tenet.

17
00:00:56.287 --> 00:00:56.826
Tim@azuredepot.

18
00:00:56.826 --> 00:01:01.673
com is part of an Office 365 Enterprise subscription,

19
00:01:01.673 --> 00:01:05.510
so by definition it's going to be OneDrive for Business.

20
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.635
So I'm signing in.

21
00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:10.277
Now by default, that folder's going to come in in your home folder.

22
00:01:10.277 --> 00:01:13.565
So I'm logged on as trainer, so it's C:\Users\trainer\OneDrive,

23
00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:17.358
and then in my case -Office 365.

24
00:01:17.358 --> 00:01:20.153
But if I don't have a lot of space on drive C,

25
00:01:20.153 --> 00:01:22.704
or if I otherwise want to change its location,

26
00:01:22.704 --> 00:01:23.743
that's perfectly okay.

27
00:01:23.743 --> 00:01:26.760
Maybe I want to put it on drive D.

28
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.441
So now I'm at D:\OneDrive - Office 365.

29
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:30.186
Click Next.

30
00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:33.910
Now it's viewing what's in my OneDrive on the web,

31
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.276
or in the Microsoft fabric, and we can be selective on what we want.

32
00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:40.773
My Office 365 email Attachments folder,

33
00:01:40.773 --> 00:01:44.953
and then loose files that are not in a folder are selected.

34
00:01:44.953 --> 00:01:47.478
I have very little up there as you see.

35
00:01:47.478 --> 00:01:48.166
Click Next.

36
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.888
And as we're waiting here,

37
00:01:49.888 --> 00:01:53.368
it gives us little animation that shows we can drag

38
00:01:53.368 --> 00:01:55.479
and drop into the OneDrive folder.

39
00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.798
We can share those folders using the OneDrive web client,

40
00:01:58.798 --> 00:02:03.123
or from within an Office app, and then of course we have the iOS,

41
00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.167
Android, and Windows Phone mobile app.

42
00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:08.823
And then finally Open my OneDrive folder, and there it is.

43
00:02:08.823 --> 00:02:12.317
And we see what's called a toast notification appear in the

44
00:02:12.317 --> 00:02:14.801
lower right that we're now syncing that folder,

45
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.017
and we can edit the content of that folder.

46
00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:18.636
That's fine.

47
00:02:18.636 --> 00:02:19.873
So here it comes.

48
00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:23.697
I had some loose files in there, and I can work,

49
00:02:23.697 --> 00:02:28.673
as I said before, using the navigation or directly in the window.

50
00:02:28.673 --> 00:02:31.842
I can operate on my OneDrive for Business account

51
00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:34.330
exactly as I would any other folder.

52
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.849
So I'll create a folder called Projects,

53
00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.740
and I'll create a simple document by right-clicking.

54
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.374
I'll create a Text Document called kickoff,

55
00:02:42.374 --> 00:02:45.687
and I'll just add some generic text to it.

56
00:02:45.687 --> 00:02:48.550
I'll close, and of course save my changes.

57
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.612
So that's all well and good.

58
00:02:50.612 --> 00:02:53.706
We now see I have my OneDrive Office 365.

59
00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:56.526
It's showing up as Up to date, and if I right-click,

60
00:02:56.526 --> 00:02:58.671
I have a whole bunch of options here.

61
00:02:58.671 --> 00:03:02.622
If I have a large volume of files that are syncing and perhaps

62
00:03:02.622 --> 00:03:05.316
slowing down the performance of my computer,

63
00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:08.941
I can pause that syncing for a while, I can manage my storage,

64
00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:10.707
I can view the folder online.

65
00:03:10.707 --> 00:03:11.884
Actually, let's choose that.

66
00:03:11.884 --> 00:03:13.588
That's a convenient method.

67
00:03:13.588 --> 00:03:17.717
As I said, OneDrive for Business goes to SharePoint Online,

68
00:03:17.717 --> 00:03:22.242
so I'm going to need to authenticate again with my Office 365 account,

69
00:03:22.242 --> 00:03:26.847
and I'm going to stay signed in because this is my computer and I'm

70
00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:29.776
even comfortable saving my credentials in Edge.

71
00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:33.838
If you look at the address bar here, it says https://azuredepot,

72
00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:38.128
that's the name of my Office 365 tenet, my.

73
00:03:38.128 --> 00:03:38.604
sharepoint.

74
00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:39.081
com.

75
00:03:39.081 --> 00:03:43.787
So that demonstrates the truth that Office 365 and SharePoint

76
00:03:43.787 --> 00:03:47.572
Online is inextricably interwoven with OneDrive.

77
00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:51.259
Now, you can do that, that is to say OneDrive for Business,

78
00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:52.795
even as an ordinary consumer.

79
00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:55.164
I'm going to do a search for OneDrive plans,

80
00:03:55.164 --> 00:03:57.654
and we'll browse out to the Plans page.

81
00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:01.569
This is a Software as a Service, or SaaS, offering.

82
00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.515
This URL is in the exercise files by the way, not that you necessarily need it.

83
00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:10.244
And over on the right here, the two consumer plans,

84
00:04:10.244 --> 00:04:14.873
you have the free, which is 5 GB, it's called OneDrive Basic.

85
00:04:14.873 --> 00:04:18.112
All you need to get started with that is a Microsoft account,

86
00:04:18.112 --> 00:04:21.717
and then you go through the same process of running Set

87
00:04:21.717 --> 00:04:23.737
up OneDrive and you'll get that done.

88
00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:25.102
Let me just try that.

89
00:04:25.102 --> 00:04:28.113
I have a consumer account under a different email address.

90
00:04:28.113 --> 00:04:31.494
Let me see what happens if we go down that path.

91
00:04:31.494 --> 00:04:33.861
I have two-factor authentication on this account,

92
00:04:33.861 --> 00:04:37.123
and I think that that's something you should have as well.

93
00:04:37.123 --> 00:04:39.309
Now notice here this is a personal OneDrive,

94
00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:40.970
so it's going under C:\Users\trainer\OneDrive.

95
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.947
I'm going to leave that location alone.

96
00:04:44.947 --> 00:04:45.849
We'll click Next.

97
00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:46.150
Well,

98
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.726
this is an advertisement really saying that we can go to

99
00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:51.932
OneDrive for Business with Premium features,

100
00:04:51.932 --> 00:04:53.042
but I'll choose Not now.

101
00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:53.929
And just for grins,

102
00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:57.772
we'll step through the wizard until we can open my OneDrive folder.

103
00:04:57.772 --> 00:04:59.392
And so the consumer OneDrive,

104
00:04:59.392 --> 00:05:04.119
notice that it shows up in the navigation bar as OneDrive - Personal by default,

105
00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:06.846
I have a lot more content in here actually,

106
00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:09.870
and they give you a bunch of folders like Favorites,

107
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:10.217
Music,

108
00:05:10.217 --> 00:05:13.685
Photos that very much mirror what you have in your

109
00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:15.554
home folder on your local system.

110
00:05:15.554 --> 00:05:17.111
You see what I mean?

111
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:20.003
So to round this out, we have the 2 personal plans,

112
00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:22.761
there's the Storage only that give you 50 GB,

113
00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:25.579
and then if you go to OneDrive for Business,

114
00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:28.191
even as an individual you can do that,

115
00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:32.656
there's Office 365 Personal and Office 365 Home.

116
00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:40.000
It looks like that the Personal there's just one user, and home you're given five users.
