00:00:02.901 --> 00:00:06.776
In this demo, we'll do a whirlwind tour of client-side Hyper-V.

2
00:00:06.776 --> 00:00:08.590
Entire courses exist covering Hyper-V.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.646
As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you a reference to my friend,

4
00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.930
Jason Helmick's, Pluralsight course at the conclusion of this module.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.876
But first of all, as long as you're running an appropriate edition of Windows,

6
00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:21.513
I'm running Enterprise edition.

7
00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:23.945
Of course, that brings up the question,

8
00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:27.002
how can you know what edition of Windows you're running.

9
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:28.066
There are many ways.

10
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:33.309
I'm going to do a Windows key+R to open the Run box and type winver.

11
00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.211
Winver is short for Windows version and it looks like here we can see,

12
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:42.226
I don't know if you can see this, it gives us build and version numbers.

13
00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:43.372
That's not what we want.

14
00:00:43.372 --> 00:00:46.743
We'll learn about that in a couple of modules when we do installation,

15
00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:49.731
but it says the Windows 10 Enterprise operating system.

16
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:52.778
Okay, so that's one way to do it.

17
00:00:52.778 --> 00:00:53.425
Another way,

18
00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:55.691
you can right-click Start and use your

19
00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:58.127
Administrative menu here and go to System.

20
00:00:58.127 --> 00:01:02.109
This opens the system, what used to be the system Control Panel,

21
00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.566
now it's the system setting.

22
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:08.583
And if we scroll down, we can see under Windows Specifications,

23
00:01:08.583 --> 00:01:09.727
Windows 10 Enterprise.

24
00:01:09.727 --> 00:01:13.284
So long story short, enterprise certainly has Client Hyper-V.

25
00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:17.352
I'm going to open Start and type Hyper-V and it

26
00:01:17.352 --> 00:01:19.795
looks like I have Hyper-V Manager.

27
00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:23.732
If you don't see that icon, then you need to turn on that optional feature.

28
00:01:23.732 --> 00:01:27.431
You notice that by typing Hyper-V we have Settings,

29
00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:28.937
turn Windows features on and off.

30
00:01:28.937 --> 00:01:31.603
Another thing you could do is open up Cortana,

31
00:01:31.603 --> 00:01:34.331
actually, let me try Cortana here.

32
00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:35.135
Windows features.

33
00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:40.953
Yep, tells you right off the bat, turn Windows features on and off Control Panel.

34
00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:41.513
And remember,

35
00:01:41.513 --> 00:01:44.315
you can make use of these filters when you're using

36
00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:47.819
Cortana where you can look at documents,

37
00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:48.820
web, applications,

38
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.929
and you can get to all of your filter settings by

39
00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:53.342
dropping down the filters list.

40
00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:58.136
But the Windows features old school, this is classic Control Panel dialog box,

41
00:01:58.136 --> 00:02:02.677
allows you actually if you want to uninstall Internet Explorer 11,

42
00:02:02.677 --> 00:02:03.273
you can.

43
00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:05.357
And right above it, we have Hyper-V.

44
00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:08.827
So I've gone through the process of checking all these boxes and

45
00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:12.248
the reason I checked all the boxes is because we definitely need

46
00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:15.918
not only the platform components, but the Management Tools.

47
00:02:15.918 --> 00:02:19.820
And notice that we get not only the Graphical User Interface Management Tool,

48
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.129
but also the Windows PowerShell module.

49
00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.141
Now you will need to restart your computer in order to have that go into effect.

50
00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:29.365
And just because it's here and it reminded me of it,

51
00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:31.257
Internet Explorer 11 is installed by default,

52
00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:34.765
and sure enough, if you type, again, I'm going to use Cortana.

53
00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:36.499
Internet Explorer, here it is,

54
00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:40.069
and it looks quite a bit like Internet Explorer 10,

55
00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.897
if you've used previous versions,

56
00:02:41.897 --> 00:02:44.965
and it's here for backward compatibility for sites

57
00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:46.794
that just don't run well under Edge.

58
00:02:46.794 --> 00:02:47.856
As a matter of fact,

59
00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:51.652
let me go back to Edge for a second and if you find that a

60
00:02:51.652 --> 00:02:53.653
page is not displaying well in Edge,

61
00:02:53.653 --> 00:02:58.209
you can open the Settings menu and choose Open with Internet Explorer and see

62
00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.782
if you have a better experience loading that page there.

63
00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:02.217
Okay.

64
00:03:02.217 --> 00:03:06.896
I'm intentionally weaving all of these different features together because it's

65
00:03:06.896 --> 00:03:13.089
important that you have an integrated grasp of Windows 10 and to be able to go

66
00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:16.087
from tool to tool option to option seamlessly.

67
00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:18.952
It's going to be a lot of initially memorization,

68
00:03:18.952 --> 00:03:22.552
but then muscle memory and that's going to allow if you're in a support role,

69
00:03:22.552 --> 00:03:23.678
a technical support role,

70
00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:27.338
that's going to allow you to be more mindful and your brain will

71
00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:29.877
be more free to pay attention to your customer,

72
00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:33.248
the person you're helping, to really listen to what they're telling you.

73
00:03:33.248 --> 00:03:33.697
Okay.

74
00:03:33.697 --> 00:03:38.446
So assuming you've enabled the Hyper-V and restarted rather your computer,

75
00:03:38.446 --> 00:03:44.429
you can come and open it up, Hyper-V and it's Hyper-V Manager is the desktop app.

76
00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:48.481
It uses the Microsoft Management console and it looks like I've

77
00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:50.992
already created a virtual machine that's powered off.

78
00:03:50.992 --> 00:03:52.221
Huh, well that's cool.

79
00:03:52.221 --> 00:03:54.325
Before you start creating virtual machines though,

80
00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:55.891
you'll want to configure your environment,

81
00:03:55.891 --> 00:03:58.607
and if you right-click your computer name,

82
00:03:58.607 --> 00:04:00.540
you have various options,

83
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.308
Hyper-V Settings and then something called Virtual Switch Manager,

84
00:04:04.308 --> 00:04:05.285
and SAN Manager.

85
00:04:05.285 --> 00:04:07.239
Let's just go to Hyper-V Settings.

86
00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.595
The major things here that I want you to be aware of,

87
00:04:09.595 --> 00:04:12.541
you may want to change the location for your virtual

88
00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:14.702
hard disks in your virtual machines.

89
00:04:14.702 --> 00:04:19.241
Your C drive, for instance, is used by default and that may be space constrained.

90
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:21.236
You may have a much bigger data drive.

91
00:04:21.236 --> 00:04:24.379
So you'll come into Hyper-V Settings and you can change the paths.

92
00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.477
Many of these other options, let me see,

93
00:04:26.477 --> 00:04:28.707
you might want to change the mouse release key.

94
00:04:28.707 --> 00:04:30.811
When you click inside a virtual machine,

95
00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:34.456
it captures your mouse and then the mouse movements you make in Windows

96
00:04:34.456 --> 00:04:38.174
10 will be reflected in the virtual machine and then you'll need to

97
00:04:38.174 --> 00:04:42.018
choose whatever key combination you want to use here to release the

98
00:04:42.018 --> 00:04:44.480
mouse back to your hardware host, okay.

99
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.548
Now as far as creating a virtual machine,

100
00:04:47.548 --> 00:04:50.813
you can go in a new virtual machine and you step through a wizard process

101
00:04:50.813 --> 00:04:54.735
and the main thing to remember here besides just giving it a name and

102
00:04:54.735 --> 00:04:57.040
determining where you want to store the files,

103
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.288
those files can become several gigabytes in size

104
00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:02.318
depending upon what you're doing.

105
00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:05.336
The virtual machines can run Generation 1,

106
00:05:05.336 --> 00:05:10.088
which is an older model, Generation 2, which is the current model.

107
00:05:10.088 --> 00:05:13.795
Generally speaking, unless you have a reason to choose generation 1,

108
00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:18.102
for instance, if you have Microsoft Azure as part of your job description,

109
00:05:18.102 --> 00:05:20.790
in that case, you'll want to go gen 1, but otherwise,

110
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.001
I'd go gen 2 to make sure you've got the latest and greatest.

111
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:26.740
Remember that these virtual machines consume system

112
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.705
resources from your Windows 10 host.

113
00:05:28.705 --> 00:05:33.587
So if you have 32 GB of RAM on your Win 10 box and you're going to

114
00:05:33.587 --> 00:05:35.702
create a Windows 10 virtual machine for sandboxing,

115
00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:39.260
you'll want to give it an amount of startup memory that is

116
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.404
not going to make things painfully slow.

117
00:05:41.404 --> 00:05:43.242
A Gig is a little low.

118
00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:48.752
I would say 2048 MB, which is 2 GB of RAM is a good startup point.

119
00:05:48.752 --> 00:05:53.568
Now dynamic memory means that Hyper-V will only give the virtual machine

120
00:05:53.568 --> 00:05:57.174
enough memory to do its job and that's good if you're system,

121
00:05:57.174 --> 00:06:01.790
that is if your Windows 10 hardware host is already a bit constrained for RAM.

122
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.107
The switch process,

123
00:06:03.107 --> 00:06:07.057
the switch feature in Hyper-V is how you determine

124
00:06:07.057 --> 00:06:09.841
where your virtual machine exists, in other words,

125
00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:13.307
do you want your virtual machine to go out onto the internet.

126
00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:16.098
Do you want your virtual machine to appear on your

127
00:06:16.098 --> 00:06:17.824
local area network as another machine.

128
00:06:17.824 --> 00:06:21.945
It's beyond our scope to get really into the switch system here so I'm just

129
00:06:21.945 --> 00:06:24.652
going to choose the default switch that Microsoft gives us.

130
00:06:24.652 --> 00:06:29.501
You're asked to give an optional name to the virtual hard disk file.

131
00:06:29.501 --> 00:06:33.580
You're not actually using a full hardware hard disk,

132
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.410
although, technically you can.

133
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.027
Instead, the entire VM environment is going to be contained in a.

134
00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:41.973
VHD or.

135
00:06:41.973 --> 00:06:42.920
VHDX file.

136
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.976
Generation 2 VMs using the VHDX file format,

137
00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:53.711
and although it defaults to 127 GB, that represents the maximum size.

138
00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:54.905
It's actually going to be,

139
00:06:54.905 --> 00:06:58.750
that is the file will only be as large as the data you're actually storing,

140
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.846
and I find on a Windows 10 box you can get up to 15-20 GB pretty easily,

141
00:07:03.846 --> 00:07:07.237
so you'll want to make sure you're storing your VM disks

142
00:07:07.237 --> 00:07:10.001
on a good drive that has lots of space.

143
00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:12.738
As far as how to install the operating system,

144
00:07:12.738 --> 00:07:16.283
almost always, you'll want to go the route of an image file,

145
00:07:16.283 --> 00:07:16.577
a.

146
00:07:16.577 --> 00:07:20.701
iso disk image and I'll go to browse and I happen to have one on my

147
00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:23.935
desktop for the latest and greatest Windows 10 version.

148
00:07:23.935 --> 00:07:27.374
These ISO files are software representations of DVDs,

149
00:07:27.374 --> 00:07:30.996
and as such, they're pretty big, about 4.

150
00:07:30.996 --> 00:07:35.017
1 GB it looks like for this Windows 10 file and this is going

151
00:07:35.017 --> 00:07:39.215
to behave as if it's an optical disk inserted into the media

152
00:07:39.215 --> 00:07:41.495
drive of a real live computer.

153
00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:42.101
You see?

154
00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:43.313
So we can finish,

155
00:07:43.313 --> 00:07:46.963
it's going to create all of the virtual assets of that virtual

156
00:07:46.963 --> 00:07:50.424
machine and then we can right-click and go to Settings and

157
00:07:50.424 --> 00:07:52.876
make tweaks to any or the above.

158
00:07:52.876 --> 00:07:55.204
If you want to change the RAM allocation,

159
00:07:55.204 --> 00:07:58.494
let's say I only want it 512 MB, that's not very smart,

160
00:07:58.494 --> 00:08:00.897
but I'm going to do it just for this case.

161
00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:03.613
If you want to give the VM more processor ability,

162
00:08:03.613 --> 00:08:08.033
you can give it more access to your hardware host and go on from there.

163
00:08:08.033 --> 00:08:12.314
Again, we don't need to go too far down this rabbit hole for this level,

164
00:08:12.314 --> 00:08:14.432
but know that in our Pluralsight library,

165
00:08:14.432 --> 00:08:16.361
we have plenty of training available.

166
00:08:16.361 --> 00:08:20.760
I'm not sure if this is a real virtual machine or if it's orphaned.

167
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.498
I'm going to right-click it and click Start just to see.

168
00:08:23.498 --> 00:08:25.024
And if you look down below,

169
00:08:25.024 --> 00:08:27.944
this little preview window gives you an idea of what's

170
00:08:27.944 --> 00:08:29.841
happening in that virtual machine.

171
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:34.265
You can always double left-click it to create a console connection to it.

172
00:08:34.265 --> 00:08:36.047
It looks like it's trying to start.

173
00:08:36.047 --> 00:08:36.811
Like I said,

174
00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:39.352
I don't remember if I actually installed an operating

175
00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.790
system or if this is an empty VM.

176
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:45.465
It looks like this is an empty VM, it's not doing anything, that's fine.

177
00:08:45.465 --> 00:08:47.849
I'm going to click the turn off.

178
00:08:47.849 --> 00:08:50.233
There is shut down and turn off.

179
00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:53.713
Shut down is the graceful way to stop a VM.

180
00:08:53.713 --> 00:08:57.925
Turn off is where you're just going to essentially flip the power switch and

181
00:08:57.925 --> 00:09:01.219
there is nothing on that machine obviously that I want to save.

182
00:09:01.219 --> 00:09:04.639
So this is a really quick introduction to Hyper-V.

183
00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:13.000
The good news is that we're going to revisit Hyper-V when we do Windows 10 installation in a couple more modules.
