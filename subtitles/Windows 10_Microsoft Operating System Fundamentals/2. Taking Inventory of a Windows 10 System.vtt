00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.385
Inventorying a Windows 10 System.

2
00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:07.799
Why would you want to inventory a Windows 10 System?

3
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.494
Well in business it's called asset management,

4
00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:11.866
and it's a key part of IT service management.

5
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.266
When you're working with your customers and clients,

6
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.330
maybe you have a new customer and you don't know exactly what

7
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.878
you're dealing with with their computer.

8
00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:22.457
There are a few spots to go in Windows 10 to get a

9
00:00:22.457 --> 00:00:24.526
really nice idea of what's going on.

10
00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:28.744
First from the software perspective, which Windows 10 edition are they running,

11
00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:29.803
which version specifically?

12
00:00:29.803 --> 00:00:31.921
How much memory do they have?

13
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:35.784
What kind of CPU and motherboard does the system have?

14
00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:37.241
How much storage and so forth?

15
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:41.515
We'll begin our trolley ride in the System Control Panel, as you see here.

16
00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:45.155
Specifically you'll notice that we can view the System architecture,

17
00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:47.641
the amount of installed memory, the host name,

18
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:50.843
whether the computer is part of a work group or a domain,

19
00:00:50.843 --> 00:00:55.138
but we also see up at the top of this dialog the Windows edition.

20
00:00:55.138 --> 00:01:02.015
So here in this screenshot, this is a Windows 10 Enterprise edition computer.

21
00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:04.843
Another place to go is the About Windows dialog.

22
00:01:04.843 --> 00:01:08.806
You know, most traditional desktop applications in the Help menu,

23
00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:11.861
there's an About option where you can check program version

24
00:01:11.861 --> 00:01:15.109
from a command prompt or the run box, or a PowerShell prompt,

25
00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:19.598
you can type winver, w-i-n-v-e-r, to see the About Windows screen,

26
00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:21.909
which gives you the version.

27
00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.782
And as you can see here, I'm running the latest creator's update,

28
00:01:25.782 --> 00:01:29.026
the 1709 version, which is September 2017,

29
00:01:29.026 --> 00:01:33.076
and it also gives me my specific OS Build number.

30
00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:34.981
That can be important for instance,

31
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:37.373
if you open up a support ticket with Microsoft,

32
00:01:37.373 --> 00:01:41.212
they'll want to know right down to the build number what you're running.

33
00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:45.841
There's also license information shown in this dialog.

34
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:47.386
The Microsoft System Information tool,

35
00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:50.757
it's been in Windows since pretty much the beginning,

36
00:01:50.757 --> 00:01:52.125
probably Windows 95.

37
00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:57.546
Msinfo32 is the traditional command executable way to start this tool.

38
00:01:57.546 --> 00:02:00.204
I'm not going to say anything more about it really now because

39
00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:03.086
we're going to do a demo on it in just a moment.

40
00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:08.032
There's lots of third-party utilities that can also help you inventory a system.

41
00:02:08.032 --> 00:02:11.219
This is a piece of freeware I found called ProduKey.

42
00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:13.354
Now note that when I reference third-party utilities,

43
00:02:13.354 --> 00:02:16.757
and you'll see a few more of them in the upcoming demo,

44
00:02:16.757 --> 00:02:19.268
I don't have any arrangement with those vendors.

45
00:02:19.268 --> 00:02:22.528
I'm recommending them to you because they're tools that

46
00:02:22.528 --> 00:02:25.347
I actually use in my career myself.

47
00:02:25.347 --> 00:02:25.830
Anyway,

48
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.174
ProduKey solves the problem of retrieving the product key

49
00:02:30.174 --> 00:02:31.580
associated with Microsoft software.

50
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.986
So in this example,

51
00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:37.276
you can see on my Windows 10 Enterprise machine I can retrieve the key,

52
00:02:37.276 --> 00:02:39.753
of course I've blurred it out for security reasons.

53
00:02:39.753 --> 00:02:43.086
I have Office 2013 and actually 2016 installed,

54
00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:47.729
but both of those show up as 2013 for some inscrutable reason,

55
00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:53.186
and I also have an instance of the SQL Server Database Engine on my machine.

56
00:02:53.186 --> 00:03:02.000
It's surprisingly non-intuitive to find the product key on a system, so a utility like ProduKey can really come in handy.
