1
00:00:02,152 --> 00:00:03,922
Remote Desktop.

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:07,868
It used to be, a number of years ago, the 1980s,

3
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:12,703
for instance, is when a third-party Symantec published their PC anywhere program.

4
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:16,410
It used to be rather problematic if you were a systems

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,745
administrator and you needed to touch systems remotely.

6
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:21,429
Now you could be a business user, an end user,

7
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:25,508
and you want to be able to get to your work PC from home let's say.

8
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:27,040
Well certainly in the 80s,

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,179
this was before the world wide web and before the adoption of TCP/IP is the

10
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,979
standard protocol suite not only for the public internet,

11
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:39,969
but also for business specific local area networks.

12
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:40,592
So anyway,

13
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:45,511
I guess what I'm saying from a historical point is that this remote

14
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:49,748
access concept started with third-party tools like pcANYWHERE where you

15
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:53,405
would install the pcANYWHERE program on all of your machines that you

16
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:55,582
wanted to not only be remotely accessible,

17
00:00:55,582 --> 00:00:59,552
but also from which you wanted to connect to remote

18
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:01,699
machines and it worked like a charm.

19
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:05,707
I first was introduced to pcANYWHERE around the time I got into IT

20
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:09,851
in the late 90s and this functionality has been entirely replaced

21
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:14,792
by a number of other technologies including Windows Remote Desktop

22
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,903
that we're covering now.

23
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:20,933
Remote Desktop, as I've said, is a built-in service.

24
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:23,907
It's going to depend upon the Windows 10 version,

25
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:27,475
your home version is not going to have remote desktop,

26
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:29,720
but the Business edition certainly do.

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,856
And the use case here is that you want to establish a

28
00:01:32,856 --> 00:01:35,006
connection to a remote computer running Windows.

29
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:37,936
Now it doesn't have to run Windows 10 necessarily,

30
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:41,202
in fact, in a business world, if you're an administrator,

31
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:44,102
you would be working from your Windows 10 machine and you would

32
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:48,206
establish a connection to one or more Windows Servers boxes that could

33
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:50,668
exist in your local campus and your data center,

34
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:51,854
maybe in another campus,

35
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:56,234
or maybe even the internet into the Amazon or Microsoft public clouds.

36
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:59,584
Remote Desktop has client and server components.

37
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:00,671
As you see here,

38
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:03,808
we have in the settings program in Windows 10 a simple

39
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:06,731
slider to enable or disable remote desktop,

40
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:09,425
and under that, you see user accounts.

41
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:13,029
You can pick which users can remotely access this PC.

42
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:16,374
The server is what hosts that remote connectivity.

43
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:20,625
Now if you're a home user, you certainly would want to keep this turned off.

44
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,668
This is in most cases the server piece that is,

45
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:26,079
something that you would have in a business environment.

46
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,879
And to tie in what we learned a bit earlier,

47
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,904
remember we've been flirting around a bit with Group Policy,

48
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:36,648
you absolutely want to centrally manage remote desktop capability

49
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:40,540
across your business by setting those in Group Policy.

50
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,647
The client-side component of remote desktop is called the Remote

51
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:47,912
Desktop Connection tool as you see here and this allows you to

52
00:02:47,912 --> 00:02:50,970
specify the remote computer name and also the credentials that will

53
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,871
be used for authentication and then you can specify how big you want

54
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:56,276
the remote Windows to be,

55
00:02:56,276 --> 00:03:00,054
whether you want to share the clipboard between the client and the server,

56
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,947
and basically all of the parameters around that connection.

57
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:06,213
Once again, Remote Desktop is a fantastic go-to tool.

58
00:03:06,213 --> 00:03:11,111
Any Windows Systems administrator will likely use this tool every day.

59
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:13,061
Now from a networking standpoint,

60
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:16,972
I'm not sure where you are as far as your skills with TCP/IP,

61
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:22,175
but I do want to say that the default protocol and port that remote desktop

62
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:28,861
uses is called TCP 3389 and you can look at a port number as a mailbox address

63
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:33,434
such that when your client computer goes across the network using Remote

64
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:37,144
Desktop Connection to connect to a remote machine that's running the Remote

65
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:39,072
Desktop Server Service it's going to,

66
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:42,740
the client is going to knock on the server's door

67
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:53,000
so to speak at address TCP 3389. This is a well-known port for what's called the Remote Desktop Protocol, or RDP.
