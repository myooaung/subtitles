00:00:00.046 --> 00:00:01.225
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:01.225 --> 00:00:07.207
I want to go a little bit further with what we did in the first demo

3
00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:10.191
with linking our local account to a Microsoft account.

4
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:13.648
We'll deal with some federation now, so why don't I open up Start,

5
00:00:13.648 --> 00:00:18.854
come to Settings, go into Accounts, and I'm going to go to Email & app accounts.

6
00:00:18.854 --> 00:00:23.504
For convenience with, say, the local mail app, you can add accounts to there.

7
00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:27.606
You see that if we click Add an account we can bring in our Outlook.

8
00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:31.641
com mail, that would be our own personal Microsoft mail if we have it.

9
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:37.014
If we want to use Exchange Online from Office 365, we can authenticate there.

10
00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:39.321
We can do Google, Yahoo, or iCloud.

11
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:43.142
So this provides a nice way to add account support that's

12
00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:46.866
stored locally on the computer and allows us to pipeline

13
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.015
those accounts into our mail client.

14
00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:53.619
So I'm choosing to connect to Google here, and it says Connecting to a service.

15
00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.449
This is federation in action.

16
00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.241
Notice that Windows 10 is going back to Google now to

17
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.779
have me authenticate with them.

18
00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:01.819
That makes sense,

19
00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.577
because my source of authority for this account isn't on the computer,

20
00:01:05.577 --> 00:01:06.562
but it's at Google.

21
00:01:06.562 --> 00:01:07.873
So let me authenticate here.

22
00:01:07.873 --> 00:01:10.234
Of course, I have to type the correct password.

23
00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:13.662
And, once again, I'm a huge fan of two-step verification,

24
00:01:13.662 --> 00:01:15.978
so I'll put in my Authy code.

25
00:01:15.978 --> 00:01:18.554
This is what's called an OAuth permission screen.

26
00:01:18.554 --> 00:01:22.203
If you get deeper into federation, you'll learn about OAuth.

27
00:01:22.203 --> 00:01:24.623
The application is requesting access.

28
00:01:24.623 --> 00:01:27.044
Windows wants to tap in,

29
00:01:27.044 --> 00:01:32.229
so basically this creates the trust relationship between the identity store,

30
00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.447
which is Gmail on one side and Windows on the other.

31
00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:39.421
Windows wants to basically manage all of my Gmail info.

32
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:41.805
Do we want to allow Windows to do that?

33
00:01:41.805 --> 00:01:42.600
Yes, I do.

34
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.785
Great, so now we're all done with that.

35
00:01:44.785 --> 00:01:50.389
So that means we can open Cortana or search and open the mail app in Windows,

36
00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:53.489
choose the account that we added, go to the Inbox,

37
00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:54.854
and we're off and running.

38
00:01:54.854 --> 00:01:56.178
So there's that.

39
00:01:56.178 --> 00:01:58.385
Now, for Azure AD stuff,

40
00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:03.062
if we're authenticating more deeply into Office 365 or Microsoft Azure,

41
00:02:03.062 --> 00:02:08.378
what we'll want to do there is come down to Access work or school,

42
00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:09.810
and then click Connect.

43
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.292
Again, the UI here, I'm not a big fan of it, it's kind of confusing.

44
00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:16.677
We've got important options that are buried in dialog boxes,

45
00:02:16.677 --> 00:02:20.432
but Microsoft didn't ask me for my opinion on that,

46
00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:21.559
so moving on.

47
00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.428
Now notice we have here just a straight ahead

48
00:02:24.428 --> 00:02:26.970
connection using a work or school account,

49
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.505
where there's alternate actions down below,

50
00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:31.881
Join this device to Azure Active Directory,

51
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:35.943
or join this device to a local active directory domain.

52
00:02:35.943 --> 00:02:39.893
A common confusion point I've seen with administrators is,

53
00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:44.309
where do you join a domain from within the Windows 10 Settings app.

54
00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:45.571
It's buried, actually.

55
00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:48.722
You have to go under Accounts, Access work or school,

56
00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:51.005
Connect, and then it's right down here.

57
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:51.661
Very annoying.

58
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:54.175
I prefer the classic system Control Panel,

59
00:02:54.175 --> 00:02:57.994
or even better, from PowerShell, the Add computer cmdlet.

60
00:02:57.994 --> 00:02:58.757
But anyway,

61
00:02:58.757 --> 00:03:04.487
let me see what happens here if I put in my Office 365 administrator account.

62
00:03:04.487 --> 00:03:08.735
That account is, in fact, a native Azure Active Directory credential.

63
00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:11.833
We have to put in our password obviously.

64
00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:12.940
And then it says,

65
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.528
hold on while we register this device with your company and apply policy.

66
00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:17.893
This may take a moment.

67
00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:18.793
Note to self.

68
00:03:18.793 --> 00:03:23.020
I need to make sure after I stop recording this demo that I

69
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.191
switch my two-factor authentication in Office 365 from SMS

70
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:28.973
to using an authenticator app.

71
00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:30.398
Check the exercise files.

72
00:03:30.398 --> 00:03:32.012
If you're interested, I have a link there.

73
00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:36.226
The reason why SMS two-factor is looked down upon and discouraged,

74
00:03:36.226 --> 00:03:39.256
is that it's too easy to compromise the cellular network,

75
00:03:39.256 --> 00:03:43.072
and if you were to capture somebody's text message and get

76
00:03:43.072 --> 00:03:45.983
their verification code and you knew a little bit more

77
00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:47.739
about the user's environment, you could,

78
00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.208
well, defeat their two-factor authentication and log on to a service as them.

79
00:03:52.208 --> 00:03:55.421
So the best practice is to use an authenticator app.

80
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:58.792
Again, I use Authy, but there's plenty of other ones around.

81
00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:00.738
It's prompting us to create a PIN.

82
00:04:00.738 --> 00:04:02.683
Those PINs are pretty popular, aren't they?

83
00:04:02.683 --> 00:04:03.940
I'll just make a simple one.

84
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.878
Oh, it looks like it has to be at least six characters long.

85
00:04:06.878 --> 00:04:11.596
In that case, I'll make it essentially a passphrase using letters and symbols.

86
00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:13.573
Okay, we'll click Next.

87
00:04:13.573 --> 00:04:16.454
It's prompting me for my Microsoft account credentials here,

88
00:04:16.454 --> 00:04:19.592
because this is a high security action I'm taking.

89
00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.618
Alright, so now I have a work or school account added here.

90
00:04:22.618 --> 00:04:24.153
And what benefit does that give us?

91
00:04:24.153 --> 00:04:28.341
Well, if we open up Edge, for instance, and I go to portal.

92
00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:28.751
office.

93
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:30.803
com, the Microsoft office portal,

94
00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:36.187
we can have a much smoother sign-in experience because my Office 365

95
00:04:36.187 --> 00:04:39.023
administrator account is already connected to Windows,

96
00:04:39.023 --> 00:04:39.833
you see.

97
00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:41.517
And away we go.

98
00:04:41.517 --> 00:04:45.306
Here we are in the Office 365 Admin Center.

99
00:04:45.306 --> 00:04:47.282
Lastly, you can take an additional step,

100
00:04:47.282 --> 00:04:50.959
and if you are using Microsoft Azure and Windows Intune,

101
00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:54.929
go to Connect, Join this device to Azure Active directory.

102
00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:58.132
There we have to log on with an account that's

103
00:04:58.132 --> 00:05:00.071
associated with the target directory.

104
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:04.301
I could, for instance, use that same Office 365 account,

105
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.296
authenticate with my password.

106
00:05:05.296 --> 00:05:08.328
It prompts you, are you sure you want to join this organization?

107
00:05:08.328 --> 00:05:09.889
And I'm going to click Join.

108
00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.517
I'm actually not going to click Join,

109
00:05:11.517 --> 00:05:14.290
I'm going to cancel here because it can be pretty invasive.

110
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.671
Depending upon how you set up your device policies and your Intune subscription,

111
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:22.275
it could require that we log onto the system using that credential,

112
00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:26.279
which I don't want to do, and it can also make other management changes.

113
00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:31.314
I don't remember how I set up Intune, to be perfectly honest with you.

114
00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:34.388
Just in case you're boiling over with curiosity,

115
00:05:34.388 --> 00:05:36.700
from the Office 365 Admin Center,

116
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.189
if you scroll down under the Admin Center's link,

117
00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:42.177
you can click out to the Intune portal,

118
00:05:42.177 --> 00:05:44.952
which used to take you to a separate honest-to-goodness portal,

119
00:05:44.952 --> 00:05:47.571
but now it takes you into portal.

120
00:05:47.571 --> 00:05:48.118
azure.

121
00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:52.499
com, into the Microsoft Intune section, you see.

122
00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:53.718
And so there we have it,

123
00:05:53.718 --> 00:06:03.000
we're not going to get any further than just showing you this initial screen. Check the exercise files for some additional notes if you'd like them.
