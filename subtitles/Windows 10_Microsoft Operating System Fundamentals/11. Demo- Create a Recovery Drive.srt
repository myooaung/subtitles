00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,334
In this demonstration,

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:06,223
we'll look at the new Recovery Drive feature in Windows 10.

3
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:08,284
Let me open up Start, type recovery drive,

4
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:12,775
and we get a link to create a Recovery Drive in classic Control Panel.

5
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:17,551
Specifically, this starts a program called the Recovery Media Creator,

6
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,828
and the one option here is to back up system files

7
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:22,615
to the Recovery Drive as well.

8
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:24,375
It's going to scan and look for media.

9
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:28,567
Now as it happens, I've already worked behind the scenes before I started this.

10
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:30,020
You're going to use a USB stick,

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,238
you're going to need at least a 32 GB volume on that disk.

12
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,561
I actually created a disk on my virtual machine here,

13
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:40,784
labeled it Recovery, 32 GB in size,

14
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:45,845
and if I open it up it looks a lot like the root of a

15
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,598
Windows 10 operating system image.

16
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:49,106
It has your boot files,

17
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:52,814
it's going to put you into the Windows recovery environment and

18
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:55,837
allow you to resurrect your operating system.

19
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:58,925
You have under Sources, you have Reconstruct.

20
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,572
WIM, and maybe additional WIM files.

21
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:05,279
This is the actual image that will come back if we

22
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:07,391
decide to boot from this partition.

23
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:08,918
So that's the process.

24
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:12,856
This Recovery Drive wizard is going to be spinning its wheels for a long time.

25
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:16,703
Essentially, all you do here is you choose a disk partition,

26
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:19,480
preferably a USB thumb drive, like I said,

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,868
or an external drive,

28
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:22,845
and then click Next and it's going to go through the

29
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:24,108
process of creating the drive.

30
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:25,915
There's really nothing to look at.

31
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:29,279
If you're wondering, as I said, again, how to use the Recovery Drive,

32
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:32,279
that's where we boot into Windows recovery environment.

33
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:34,523
You would boot the computer off that drive.

34
00:01:34,523 --> 00:01:36,464
And if you're wondering, well, how do you do that?

35
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:40,575
Partly it depends on whether you're using UEFI or legacy BIOS.

36
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:44,697
You're going to use a startup key to invoke that interface,

37
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:47,850
and then you can customize the boot order and make sure that

38
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,520
you're booting from the Recovery Drive partition.

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,133
You may also be able to start your computer and then press F12 to

40
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:57,622
get a list of possible boot volumes from there.

41
00:01:57,622 --> 00:02:00,195
Finally, it looks like the Recovery Drive stopped spinning,

42
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:01,902
and it shows us available drives.

43
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:06,271
It says that the drive must be able to hold at least 8 GB,

44
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:11,708
but as I said, 32 is pretty standard if you're using Windows to go,

45
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,143
or other Windows recovery-oriented features,

46
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:15,835
32 is a pretty standard drive.

47
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:19,334
I'm going to choose G, which has a system image backup on it.

48
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:21,322
Now you want to be really careful here,

49
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:24,467
because whatever you choose to be your recovery file,

50
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:27,356
or your recovery drive rather, is going to be deleted.

51
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:34,000
You see what this says, everything on the drive will be deleted, and then click Create.
