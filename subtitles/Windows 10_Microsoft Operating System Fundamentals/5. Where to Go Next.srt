1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:04,837
Where to go next.

2
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:08,218
Well, your career is up to you, isn't it?

3
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:11,450
I would suggest that you let your passion be your guide.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,712
My late Grandpa Cook used to say, Tim,

5
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:16,724
you know you're in the right job when it's not a job,

6
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:19,428
when it's a career, number 1, and what makes it a career?

7
00:00:19,428 --> 00:00:22,396
According to my Grandpa Cook it was if you're doing work that

8
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:24,969
you would do even if you weren't getting paid,

9
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:26,112
you've found your career,

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,127
and that's how I feel about teaching and information technology.

11
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:30,274
What's your passion?

12
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:32,568
Well, your passion has three elements.

13
00:00:32,568 --> 00:00:34,290
This is the world according to Tim Warner,

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,485
but I hope you find my analysis useful.

15
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:38,292
One would be interest.

16
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:39,922
Think of Grandpa Cook.

17
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:43,183
What aspects of IT inspire you the most?

18
00:00:43,183 --> 00:00:46,608
Are you allergic to programming or does it actually intrigue you?

19
00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:50,725
Are you interested in helping individual users, maybe in a help desk role?

20
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:53,030
Do you like architecture and planning systems?

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,392
You need to have an interest,

22
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:57,188
because otherwise you're not going to last very long in IT,

23
00:00:57,188 --> 00:00:58,909
I can assure you of that.

24
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:01,773
Aptitude is, alright, you're interested in development,

25
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:06,128
but what native ability do you have with mathematics and logical thinking?

26
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:08,840
How are you understanding flowcharting, for instance?

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,237
What kind of intuitive feel do you have for troubleshooting problems?

28
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:15,544
You need to align your interests with your natural abilities.

29
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:16,615
And thirdly, availability.

30
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:20,223
Are you in a position in terms of time, money,

31
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:24,560
your family and life situation, your willingness to invest in learning,

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,746
because you're going to need to get your big break if you're getting into IT.

33
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:31,514
You're going to have to convince a business to take a chance on you.

34
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:35,768
Once you gain your sea legs and you can demonstrate your effectiveness,

35
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:39,956
then subsequent jobs, subsequent contracts as your career evolves,

36
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:41,632
will become much easier.

37
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,798
In defining your skill set more granularly,

38
00:01:44,798 --> 00:01:47,595
I myself have largely been a generalist,

39
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:50,888
so all five of these categories fit in my wheelhouse,

40
00:01:50,888 --> 00:01:53,982
but I'm probably in the minority really with most people.

41
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:57,588
Most people tend to gravitate toward one of these categories.

42
00:01:57,588 --> 00:01:57,938
Server,

43
00:01:57,938 --> 00:02:01,434
this would be the Windows Server product and the different

44
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:04,677
enterprise servers like SharePoint and Exchange,

45
00:02:04,677 --> 00:02:06,298
perhaps Microsoft Azure.

46
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:09,296
This is system administration, system architecture.

47
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:13,026
Then there's desktop support, Windows and Windows-capable,

48
00:02:13,026 --> 00:02:15,477
Windows devices, this could be hardware,

49
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:17,303
software maintenance, data center technician,

50
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:22,020
although that's kind of blurring the lines between server and desktop.

51
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,801
Application support, Office applications, Office 365 is a huge subject nowadays.

52
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:31,681
You can build your whole career doing consulting work in Office 365.

53
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:34,135
Any business is going to have databases.

54
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:37,943
Microsoft's own flagship product is SQL Server.

55
00:02:37,943 --> 00:02:41,025
And then if you have determined that you're really interested in programming,

56
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:43,044
there is Visual Studio and the.

57
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:45,578
NET framework language, there's SharePoint applications,

58
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:47,103
there's Azure development.

59
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:50,747
The bottom line is, and this is all just within the Microsoft wheelhouse,

60
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:53,043
if you go outside of Microsoft into, say,

61
00:02:53,043 --> 00:03:02,000
the open source world, all five of these categories are listed there as well. Pretty exciting time to be in IT, I hope you'd agree.
