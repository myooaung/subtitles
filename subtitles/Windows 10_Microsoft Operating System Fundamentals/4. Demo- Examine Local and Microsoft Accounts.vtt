00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:05.458
Alright, in this demo we're going to examine accounts,

2
00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:08.474
local accounts, Microsoft accounts, and so forth.

3
00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.647
I want to give you a very useful tip, by the way,

4
00:00:10.647 --> 00:00:12.306
at least I hope it will be useful.

5
00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:14.569
I'm going to right-click, Start, and go to Run.

6
00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:17.497
I know technically I can just click the Start button or

7
00:00:17.497 --> 00:00:19.369
press the Windows key on my keyboard,

8
00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.824
but this is a good tip if you've been frustrated on how the classic

9
00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:27.090
Control Panel is somewhat hidden in Windows 10.

10
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.378
From a command prompt or Run type control,

11
00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:34.201
and look what it does, it opens up all Control Panel items lickety-split.

12
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.003
From classic Control Panel let's go to User Accounts,

13
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.310
and we can see who is logged onto the system right now,

14
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.855
that would be me, and notice that I'm a local account,

15
00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:46.010
I'm of the Administrator account type.

16
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.482
Now this interface that you see here is intended for the consumer,

17
00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:52.283
that should be pretty obvious to you.

18
00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:55.661
Notice that we have most things protected by User Account control,

19
00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:59.529
but this is not a particularly comfortable interface for

20
00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:02.306
Active Directory administrators for sure.

21
00:01:02.306 --> 00:01:05.164
To that point, let me right-click, go to Run again,

22
00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:08.142
and type the computer management console,

23
00:01:08.142 --> 00:01:08.849
compmgmt.

24
00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:09.556
msc.

25
00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:13.173
This gives you a nice control surface that includes

26
00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.324
the Local Users and Groups node,

27
00:01:15.324 --> 00:01:20.134
so that's a more direct way to get to local accounts defined on that machine.

28
00:01:20.134 --> 00:01:22.483
All of this is review, I understand.

29
00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:26.120
Now notice it says Make change to my account in PC settings,

30
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.389
so honestly there's not a whole lot we can do from the classic Control Panel.

31
00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:34.778
So I clicked that link, and that's opening up the Windows 10 Settings app,

32
00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:36.263
and this is under Accounts.

33
00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:39.136
You'll notice that the navigation here in the Settings app,

34
00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:42.667
if sometimes it might be hard for you to determine your context,

35
00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:45.539
where are you in the hierarchy of settings.

36
00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.115
Well, the top element is where you are, and then you have,

37
00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:52.256
akin to tabs on an old-fashioned Windows window,

38
00:01:52.256 --> 00:01:54.502
we have these entries here.

39
00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:57.264
Now, if we go home we can see Accounts right here,

40
00:01:57.264 --> 00:02:01.535
so that's how you can get to it from the home base of Windows Settings.

41
00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:04.628
And we have Your info, Email & app accounts,

42
00:02:04.628 --> 00:02:08.571
Sign-in options, Access work or school, and then family or other people,

43
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:10.091
which we're not dealing with,

44
00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:13.379
we're dealing with business in this environment so we won't do that,

45
00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.465
but on Your info let's see what we have.

46
00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:19.323
The main thing here is if we want to connect using a Microsoft account we

47
00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:21.809
can click Sign-in with a Microsoft account instead,

48
00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.471
and this is going to take us to the live.

49
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:30.266
com database, where you can either create an account if you don't have one,

50
00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:31.742
or put in your email,

51
00:02:31.742 --> 00:02:35.484
phone number or skype ID that's associated with your account.

52
00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:38.744
I'll put my email address, supply my password.

53
00:02:38.744 --> 00:02:40.900
I use two-factor authentication.

54
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.057
Particularly, I use Authy,

55
00:02:43.057 --> 00:02:46.451
that's what I recommend if you're going to use one of those apps.

56
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:48.316
I'll put in my verification code.

57
00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:52.222
We have to supply our Windows password one final time to

58
00:02:52.222 --> 00:02:53.855
complete that handshaking process.

59
00:02:53.855 --> 00:02:56.195
It asks if we want to use Windows Hello,

60
00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:59.757
which could be the integration of biometrics or a

61
00:02:59.757 --> 00:03:01.775
personal identification number instead.

62
00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:04.142
Now, depending upon how your environment is set up,

63
00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:07.253
you might have your Microsoft account already set up for this.

64
00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.958
I'm going to click Next and skip over this for now.

65
00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.609
I'll choose Setup a PIN later,

66
00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.785
and you'll notice now that under Your info it says Manage my Microsoft account,

67
00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:19.045
and if you click that link it takes you to account.

68
00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:19.311
microsoft.

69
00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:19.577
com.

70
00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:22.744
If you want to go back to using only a local account,

71
00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.851
notice that you can click Sign in with a local account instead.

72
00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:29.005
So this now means that we can log on to the computer

73
00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:31.856
using not only my local account name, Tim,

74
00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:34.509
but also any of my Microsoft account information.

75
00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:39.011
And now you notice here that I show up on my info page with

76
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:41.364
an email address instead of local account.

77
00:03:41.364 --> 00:03:43.870
If we come down to Sync your settings,

78
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.223
this allows you to customize the individual settings that are synced; Theme,

79
00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:50.258
Internet Explorer, Passwords, Language prefs,

80
00:03:50.258 --> 00:03:53.150
Ease of Access, and then somewhat cryptically,

81
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.229
Other Windows Settings.

82
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.027
You've got to love that.

83
00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.593
If we go to Sign-in options,

84
00:03:57.593 --> 00:04:01.419
this is where you can turn in biometrics with Windows Hello if you have,

85
00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:02.577
say, a thumbprint reader.

86
00:04:02.577 --> 00:04:04.977
You can change your password, add a PIN.

87
00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:07.927
Picture password is kind of fun, where you can select a photo,

88
00:04:07.927 --> 00:04:12.369
click on it in any three spots, and that becomes your authentication method.

89
00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:14.632
And then there's some privacy options, and so forth.

90
00:04:14.632 --> 00:04:18.142
So that's the main body of information now that we've

91
00:04:18.142 --> 00:04:19.897
connected to our Microsoft account.

92
00:04:19.897 --> 00:04:22.190
That should make things easier, for instance,

93
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.194
when we're using Microsoft account services,

94
00:04:24.194 --> 00:04:26.579
like OneDrive would be a good example.

95
00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:28.633
If I right-click OneDrive and go to Settings,

96
00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:32.398
we see here that we're automagically logged in using our Microsoft account,

97
00:04:32.398 --> 00:04:37.128
and we have transparent access now to those OneDrive files and folders.

98
00:04:37.128 --> 00:04:39.802
You see in the background here I still have the

99
00:04:39.802 --> 00:04:41.441
classic Control Panel User Accounts up,

100
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:44.508
and once again we see that I'm listed as a Microsoft

101
00:04:44.508 --> 00:04:46.584
account as opposed to a local account.

102
00:04:46.584 --> 00:04:49.526
Now, I've opened up an elevated PowerShell prompt.

103
00:04:49.526 --> 00:04:54.124
I'm going to run the command, the cmdlet, I should say, Get-LocalUser.

104
00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:55.600
I was using tab there.

105
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.485
I typed Get-Local.

106
00:04:56.485 --> 00:04:57.666
Let me go back.

107
00:04:57.666 --> 00:05:02.389
Tab allows you to search through the cmdlets, it's very convenient.

108
00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:03.593
And here we have Tim.

109
00:05:03.593 --> 00:05:07.085
If you want more info about Tim, there's lots of different things we could do.

110
00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:10.983
What I'm going to do is just create a quick variable called

111
00:05:10.983 --> 00:05:13.714
$tim is Get-LocalUser with the name 'tim',

112
00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:16.522
and that way I can do this.

113
00:05:16.522 --> 00:05:21.644
If you want to investigate all the possible properties from a PowerShell prompt,

114
00:05:21.644 --> 00:05:24.330
you can create a variable of the object,

115
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.369
in this case the variable tim contains a reference to my user account,

116
00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:30.140
and by using the PowerShell pipeline,

117
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.381
which takes the output of the first part of the

118
00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:35.946
pipeline and passes it to the second,

119
00:05:35.946 --> 00:05:38.561
Format-List star leaves nothing to the imagination.

120
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:45.000
So we can see that the principle source for this account is in fact a Microsoft account.
