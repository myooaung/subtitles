00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850
in this video,

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.210
I am going to show you how to hunt,

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.460
sewing or Kumi,

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.450
which is front strip.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.450
The first for is Arista that is under the color.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.110
So you're going to try full from the EDS that you're seem it's going to be one sense

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.150
measurer off the with the first being good to be at the bottom.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.640
The second being will be the mark off the Arista under the color,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.250
Then third pain is will be in between.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.300
Then fourth and fifth is also another.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.920
In between.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:52.290
The starting point off the sewing could be four cents Meryl from the hem line that you're

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:03.550
going to start it from the inside of the fold in scoop tiny beat from the body,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.850
a polka mi then scooped one center middle.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.780
But this is quarter size.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.590
So if I say once sent one since middle that means 25 millimeter.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:33.050
You can repeat the sewing until you get the four cents mirror from the mark off every step

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.660
under the color.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.620
Oh,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.960
uh,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:02:13.310
when you reach the four cents Miro from the mark off the Arista under color making the not

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.850
Then cut the threat,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:31.240
huh?

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.850
Next step.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.260
It's going to that.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.550
That's the front strips on the body.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:57.320
I'm going to lay down the body part face into the right side together them pin at the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.380
bottom at the top and another two pains in between,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.950
Uh,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.350
starts this from the hem line.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.020
The first to stitch it.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.170
Same adds the sleeve sewing.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:25.150
So one stick the stitches over the as then start the stitch.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.850
The 1st 4 stitches you're going to home guy Asi Newey,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:39.250
which is back stitch after he finished the four stitches in back stitch.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.560
Then I'm going to do the running stitch until they can sucky.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.570
That's a point off alchemy.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:04:07.960
Um

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:26.560
huh

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:55.970
Oh,

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:03.430
oh,

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:18.340
oh,

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:32.450
when you at the Cannes sake,

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.550
that's alchemy.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.450
Point to back one stitch,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.150
then stitch 45 tickly to four or five stitches.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.240
That's the rainforests men.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.870
Purpose.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:06:10.720
Oh,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:24.750
no.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:39.020
After finished the stitches,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.590
I,

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:41.840
running to media,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.850
made a key say,

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.450
before stitching salvage.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:07:02.320
Yet now I'm going to stitch the selvage edge on the body from six cents Meryl from the hem

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.950
line the quarter size or to be 1.25 cents mirror that using slip stitches,

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:26.150
two stitches of the ship stitches to hold on the body until just outside off the color mark

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.150
.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.150
-

00:07:26.150 --> 00:08:23.720
Oh

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:23.720
!

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:45.900
Oh,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:54.740
no.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:25.320
When I

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.950
reached just outside of the hem line,

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:37.580
I'm going to make not and cut the threat to finished.
