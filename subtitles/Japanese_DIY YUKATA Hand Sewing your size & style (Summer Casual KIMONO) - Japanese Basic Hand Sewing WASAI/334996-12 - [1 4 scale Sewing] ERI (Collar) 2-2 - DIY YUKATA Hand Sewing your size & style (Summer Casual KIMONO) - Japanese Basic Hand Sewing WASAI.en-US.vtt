Going to start two cents medal before different strip.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.190
In this case,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.980
quota size would be 2.5 million.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.600

Then I can keep running stitch until the color opening close to the color opening.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.320
I need to make a small stitch as possible for the reinforcement purpose.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.570
